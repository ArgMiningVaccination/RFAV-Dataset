Often, this activity is provided through a separate and distinct employee/occupational health program within an indivi dual healthcare facility with the infection preventionist either providing support or consultation. In smaller facilities, the individual may be responsible for the infection prevention and control as well as the employee/occupational health programs. Re gardless, knowledge regarding program requirements, implementation, ongoing assessment and summative evaluation are critical as a means of ensuring the health and safety of the healthcare workforce. Ideally, the basis for the immunization program will be an integral part of a risk assessment process that links employee health and infection prevention and control. The purpose of this toolkit is to provide infection preventionists and their employee/occupational health colleagues with a full spectrum of inf ormation, tools and resources that will assist them with the planning, development, implementation, evaluation and improvement of their healthcare personnel immunization program relevant in all healthcare settings. The term \"healthcare personnel \" is used throughout this toolkit instead of the term \"healthcare worker \", as healthcare personnel encompasses a broader group of workers. Healthcare personnel refers to individuals w orking in healthcare settings (paid and unpaid) w ho have the potential to be exposed to patients ; infectious material; contaminated environmental surfaces ; equipment and supplies ; as well as contaminated air. Gr oups of healthcare personnel may include nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nursing assistants, therapists, technicians, laboratorians, emergency medical services personnel, dental hygienists, dental assistants, students and trainees, contract staff not employed by the facility, and licensed independent practitioners, among others. Healthcare personnel also include those without direct patient care responsibilities but with the potential for exposure to infectious agents that can be transmitted to them during their work time. These personnel include clerical, food services, environmental services, security, maintenance, finance and billing, and volunteers, among others. Consequently, the information contained in thi s toolkit must be considered to be relevant and applicable to all persons working in healthcare setting s. Resources critical for th e immunization program have been provided via guidelines and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Healthcare [formerly Hospital] Infection Control Practices Advi sory Committee (HICPAC), with these documents focusing on which vaccines should be provided, to whom, and under what circumstances. Most recently, a summary document was released by the ACIP entitled Immunization of Health- Care Personnel which pulled toge ther current immunization recommendations for healthcare personnel and has essentially replaced the immunization guidelines provided in a n ACIP/ HICPAC summary document from 1997 1,2. However, aspect s of the healthcare personnel immunization program invol ve programmatic elements including safe handling of the vaccine supply, implementation of the immunization program, management of the immunization process, and overall program evaluation. Robust guidance for these aspects have been provided by the CDC and are included in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide that was revised in October 2011 as well as the Pink Book that provides comprehensive information regarding vaccine -preventable diseases as well as practical factors such as vaccination schedules, administration, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions . 3,4 Additional information can be found in the 2008 CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit that is currently under revision. Although the information provided in the aforementioned Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide and the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit seem to target physician offices and cl inics, they are relevant to practices in the employee/occupational health offices in hospitals, long term care facilities, ambulatory surgery settings, and any other facility that provides services to patients. Tools and resources to assist the employee/o ccupational health nurse and the infection preventionist are abundant and need only be gathered together and promoted. To that end, this document, the Healthcare Personnel Immunization Toolkit, has been compiled to provide assistance to the employee/occup ational health and infection preventionists as they work to promote and improve healthcare personnel immunization through effective and evidence -based programs. Practical items, including sample policies and procedures, have been added to facilitate implementation of the recommendations and resources. At present, the infection prevention and employee/occupational health field s lack clearly articulated competencies to guide professional development and practice with respect to healthcare personnel immun ization programs outside those proposed for hospital -based healthcare personnel in 2008.5 The Toolkit therefore, addresses areas of specific practice expertise (instead of competencies) that are important for a safe , comprehensive and dynamic approach to immunization for healthcare personnel, recognizing the likelihood of healthcare personnel experiencing varying job roles and changes in physical status. These practice areas include: 1) vaccine storage and handling; 2) employee/occupational h ealth provider roles; 3) vaccine selection; ) administration; 5 ) management of vaccine reactions; 6 ) education of healthcare personnel receiving immunization; 7 documentation; 8 ) program evaluation; improvement; 10 ) practice e xpertise assessment for the employee/occupational health professional. In support of the practice areas, tools and resources for the immunization program including checklists, frequently asked questions, assessments, and sample policies are included . Care should also be taken to review the package inserts of all vaccines to ensure the most up - to-date information regarding administration, indic ations, and contraindications. Frequent visits to the CDC and Immunization Action Coalition websites are important to ensure that printed materials provided to vaccine recipients (e.g., VIS) are the most current. References: 1.

Immunization providers are responsible for proper storage and handling from the time vaccine arrives at the facility until the vaccine is given. Below is an outline of vaccine storage and handling best practices. CDC' s Storage and Handling Toolkit contains detailed information on vaccine management. Immunization providers and staff are strongly encouraged to review the Storage and Handling Toolkit annually. Educate all staff, including temporary staff, as part of new staff orientation. In addition, Vaccines for Children (VFC) providers should follow VFC policy and work with their immunization program. Vaccine Management includes, but is not limited to, these three components. 1. The equipment used for vaccine storage and temperature monitoring is reliable and appropriate. 2. Staff is knowledgeable regarding proper vaccine storage and handling. At least 2 staff members should be responsible for vaccine management. 3. Written storage and handling plans are updated at least annually for: - routine storage and handling of vaccines; and - emergency vaccine retrieval and storage . Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan should include the following four elements. 1. Ordering and Accepting Vaccine Deliveries Store vaccines at the recommended temperatures IMMEDIATELY upon arrival. - Store refrigerated vaccines between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). - frozen vaccines between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Ensure vaccines are delivered when the facility is open. Vaccine shipments should be delivered when staff is available to unpack and store the vaccine properly. Inform manufacturer/distributor when vaccine shipments can be delivered. VFC providers should also notify the immunization program. Consider holidays, vacations, changes in hours of operation, and staff schedules when ordering vaccines. Educate all facility staff about vaccine storage. Vaccine shipments are often accepted by nonmedical staff. They should be aware that vaccine needs to be stored according to the manufacturer's guidelines immediately upon delivery. Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 5 General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease Order vaccines to maintain an adequate amount to meet the needs of the facility's patients. The amount of vaccine needed can vary throughout the year. Anticipate peak periods such as back-to-school appointments or influenza season and order accordingly. Order the vaccines and presentations that are appropriate for the ages and types of patients the facility serves. Influenza vaccine, for example, is available from many manufacturers with differing indications. Maintain a vaccine inventory log including: 1. vaccine name and number of doses received; 2. date vaccine received; 3. condition of vaccine on arrival; 4. vaccine manufacturer and lot number; and 5. vaccine expiration date. 2. Storing and Handling Vaccines Store vaccines in refrigerator and freezer units which can maintain the appropriate temperature range and are large enough to maintain the year's largest inventory without crowding. Stand alone units are preferred but household combination units with separate exterior doors and thermostats can be used. Dormitory-style refrigerators should not be used. A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that is outfitted with one exterior door with an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. Store vaccine in storage units designated specifically for biologics. If biologic specimens must be stored in the same unit, these should be stored on a lower shelf to prevent contamination. Food and drinks should never be stored in the same unit with vaccines. Keep a calibrated thermometer with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration* in the refrigerator and freezer. These thermometers should be recalibrated as recommended by the manufacturer. Post \"Do Not Unplug\" signs next electrical outlets and \"Do Not Stop Power\" signs near circuit breakers to maintain a consistent power source. Read and document refrigerator and freezer temperatures at least twice each workday- in the morning and before the end of the workday. Keep temperature logs for at least 3 years. *Certificate of Traceability and Calibration thermometer with calibration measurements traceable to a testing laboratory accredited by the International organization of Standardization, to the standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or to another internationally recognized standards agency Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 6 General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease Store vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aim to maintain storage unit temperatures within the middle of the acceptable temperature range. This allows for the small temperature fluctuations that can occur in refrigerators and freezers without exposing vaccines to unacceptable temperatures. Ensure good air circulation around the vaccine in the storage unit. Proper air circulation is essential to maintaining the correct storage temperatures. Bins, baskets, or some other type of uncovered containers with slotted sides or openings should be used to store the vaccines. There should be space between the containers to promote air flow. Store vaccines on the shelves away from the walls, and vents in the part of the unit best able to maintain the required temperature. Vaccines should never be stored in the door of the freezer or refrigerator . The temperature here is not stable. Place frozen packs in the door of the freezer and water bottles in the door of the refrigerator to help the storage unit maintain a constant temperature. Frozen packs or water bottle should be placed securely so they do not dislodge and prevent the door from closing. In addition, caution must be taken to avoid weighing down the door so much that the seal is compromised when the door is closed. Store unopened and opened vaccines in their original box with the lid in place until administration. Several vaccines must be protected from light. This practice also helps to ensure different vaccines are not stored together in the same bins or containers which can lead to vaccine administration errors. And in the event of a power failure, studies have shown storing vaccines in the box helps to maintain the vaccine at the appropriate temperature. Prepare vaccines at the time the vaccine is administered. This includes reconstituting or \"mixing\" vaccine, if indicated. Use only the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer. Store diluent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3. Managing Inventory Rotate stock so vaccine and diluent with the shortest expiration date is used first. Place vaccine with the longest expiration date behind the vaccine that will expire the soonest. Remove expired vaccine and diluent from usable stock. Keep vaccine stock well organized. VFC providers should separate and identify VFC and other vaccines purchased with public funds within the storage unit. In addition, clearly label the space where the vaccine is placed to help staff choose the appropriate vaccine. Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 7 General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease Inspect the storage unit daily. A physical inspection helps to ensure vaccines and thermometers are placed appropriately within the unit. During a busy work day, vaccines and thermometers can be easily moved or displaced to an area inappropriate for vaccine storage. Dispose of all vaccine materials using medical waste disposal procedures. Contact the immunization program for details and state specific guidance. 4. Managing Potentially Compromised Vaccines Identify and isolate all potentially compromised vaccines and diluents. Label these \"DO NOT USE\". Store separately from uncompromised vaccines and diluents in the recommended temperature range. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. Do not automatically discard the vaccine or diluent. Contact vaccine manufacturers and/or state immunization program for appropriate actions that should be followed for all potentially compromised vaccines and diluents. Educate staff administering vaccines on correct handling and preparation procedures to decrease the likelihood of vaccine or diluent inadvertently being compromised. For example, each vaccine should be prepared just prior to administration. Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan should include the following components. 1. Designate an alternate site where vaccines and diluents can be safely stored. Considerations when choosing a site include types of storage unit(s) available, temperature monitoring capabilities, and back-up generator. Potential back-up locations include local hospitals, another provider 's facility, retail or clinic pharmacies, long-term care facilities, or the Red Cross. Identify procedures that allow 24-hour access to alternate facilities. 2. Obtain and store an adequate number/amount of appropriate packing containers and materials (e.g., frozen and refrigerated gel packs, bubble wrap) in the facility that will be needed to pack vaccines for safe transport. Acceptable packing containers are described in the Storage and Handling Toolkit. Consider the year's largest inventory when stocking supplies. Store these supplies with a copy of the emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan. Communicate to staff where everything is kept. 3. Include written directions for packing vaccines and diluents for transport. A calibrated thermometer should be placed in each packing container near the vaccine or refrigerated diluent.

Develop a plan in which vaccine coordinators will be notified of power outages at the facility. Include instructions for gaining 24-hour access to where the vaccines are stored. 5. Incorporate written procedures for managing potentially compromised vaccines. 6. Include contact information for vaccine manufacturers and/or the immunization program.

Examine the shipping container and contents for damage during transport. Some vaccines are shipped with a temperature monitor. If a temperature monitor is present, check and follow the instructions. The vaccine should not have been frozen or exposed to freezing temperatures. If the interval between shipment from the distributor/manufacturer and arrival of the vaccine at the facility has been more than 48 hours or you have questions about the condition of the vaccine at the time of delivery, you should take three steps. 1. Immediately place the vaccine in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the distributor , manufacturer and/or the immunization program for guidance. NOTE: Contact the distributor and immunization program regarding shipments of Vaccines for Children (VFC) or other vaccines purchased with public funds that may not have been transported properly. DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) has 2 components. The lyophilized Hib vaccine (ActHIB) and DTaP-IPV diluent vials should arrive packaged together in the same shipping container. Storage Requirements Refrigerate vaccine and diluent, if applicable, immediately upon arrival. Do not freeze or expose to freezing temperatures. DTaP, Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 11 Selected Biologicals Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel): Refrigerate the lyophilized Hib vaccine (ActHIB) together between 35\u00b0F* and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). Do not store them *Storage temperatures between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) are specified in the label and the license for these products. However, 2C is exactly converted to 35.6F so the manufacturer's guidance for Fahrenheit is rounded by the manufacturer. Shelf Life Check expiration date on the container, vial or manufacturer-filled syringe of the vaccine AND diluent, if applicable. Do not use after the expiration date shown on the label. Preparation Inspect the vaccine visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. DTaP, DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix), DTaP-IPV (KINRIX), DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) vaccines should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for information on vaccine administration. DTaP, DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix), DTaP-IPV (KINRIX): Just before use, shake vial or manufacturer-filled syringe well. After shaking, the vaccine should be a cloudy, white colored liquid. Do not use vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel): This vaccine is supplied in 2 vials that must be mixed together before administration. Consider posting reminders or labeling the vaccine to remind staff to reconstitute DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) prior to administering it. Only use the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer to reconstitute the vaccine. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for an example of a label and the educational handout \"Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them\". 1. Just before use, shake the vial of DTaP/IPV diluent. 2. Withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial (blue capped vial) and inject it into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine component (green capped vial). 3. Shake the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine and diluent well to mix thoroughly. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation.

A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the manufacturer and/ or the immunization program for further guidance. 4. Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/ or the manufacturer NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions Often providers have different influenza presentations in the same storage unit. Influenza products and presentations have different approved indications (e.g., ages). Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike vaccines next to each other. Labeling the space where the vaccine is stored with name, age indications, and route of administration can help prevent vaccine administration errors. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for an example of a label.

Examine the shipping container and contents for damage during transport. Some vaccines are shipped with a temperature monitor. If a temperature monitor is present, check and follow the instructions. The vaccine should not have been frozen or exposed to freezing temperatures. If the interval between shipment from the distributor/manufacturer and arrival of the vaccine at the facility has been more than 48 hours or you have questions about the condition of the vaccine at the time of delivery, you should take three steps. 1. Immediately place the vaccine in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the distributor , manufacturer and/or the immunization program for guidance. NOTE: Contact the distributor and immunization program regarding shipments of Vaccines for Children (VFC) or other vaccines purchased with public funds that may not have been transported properly. Storage Requirements Refrigerate immediately upon arrival. Store between 35\u00b0F* and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze or expose to freezing temperatures. Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluvirin: Protect vaccine from light at all times by storing in the original box. *Storage temperatures between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) are specified in the label and the license for these products. However, 2C is exactly converted to 35.6F so the manufacturer's guidance for Fahrenheit is rounded by the manufacturer. Shelf Life Influenza vaccine is formulated for use during the current influenza season. Check expiration date on the container, vial or manufacturer-filled syringe. Do not use after the expiration date shown on the label.

If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. Shake vial or manufacturer-filled syringe well before use. Shake multidose vials each time before withdrawing a dose. Do not use vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. These vaccines should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for information on vaccine administration. . Beyond Use Date*: Shelf Life after Opening Single-Dose Vials: All of the vaccine should be drawn into a sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. Manufacturer-Filled Syringes: Manufacturer-filled syringes should be activated (i.e., syringe tip removed or needle attached) at the time the vaccine is administered. Intradermal Microinjection Syringe: Manufacturer-filled microinjection syringe should be activated (i.e., needle cap removed) at the time the vaccine is administered. Multidose Vials: Shake vial well prior to withdrawing each dose. Withdraw a single age-appropriate dose of vaccine into sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. A separate, sterile syringe and needle should be used for each immunization. Unused portions of multidose vials should be refrigerated between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). A multidose vial that is normal in appearance, stored and handled properly can be used through the expiration date printed on the vial unless otherwise stated in the manufacturer's product information. Once entered, a multidose vial of Afluria or FluLaval should be discarded after 28 days. *The date or time after which the vaccine should not be used; determined from the date or time the manufacturer-filled syringe is activated, vial is entered or vaccine is reconstituted; may be different from the expiration date. Vaccines Exposed to Inappropriate Temperatures (Temperature Excursions) Vaccine exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range- either too warm or too cold- requires immediate corrective action! Vaccine providers should have a current emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan that includes, but is not limited to, these four actions.

Place the vaccine in the recommended storage between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the manufacturer and/ or the immunization program for further guidance. 4. Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/ or the manufacturer. NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions Vaccines, including TIV, should be drawn from the vial into the syringe at the time of administration. CDC strongly discourages providers from prefilling syringes in advance. If more than one dose of vaccine must be predrawn, only draw up a few syringes (no more than 10 doses or the contents of one multidose vial). Provider prefilled syringes should be administered by the person who filled them. Any syringes prefilled by the provider must be stored within the recommended temperature range and used or discarded by the end of the workday. CDC recommends manufacturer-filled syringes for large immunization events, such as community influenza vaccination clinics. Once a manufacturer-filled syringe is activated (e.g., syringe cap removed or needle attached) it must be stored within the recommended temperature range and used or discarded by the end of the workday. Often providers have different TIV presentations in the same storage unit. Influenza products and presentations have different approved indications (e.g., ages, route). Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike or look-alike vaccines next to each other. Labeling the space where the vaccine is stored with name, age indications, dosage and route of administration can help prevent vaccine administration errors.

Do not use after the expiration date shown on the label. Preparation MMR is supplied in 2 vials that must be mixed together before administration. Consider posting reminders or labeling the vaccine to remind staff to reconstitute it. Only use the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer to reconstitute the vaccine. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for an example of a label and the educational handout \"Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them\". This vaccine should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. The Resources section at the end of this document also includes vaccine administration information. 1. Just before use, withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial and inject it into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine component. 2. Shake the vial now containing the lyophilized vaccine and diluent to mix thoroughly. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. 3. The reconstituted vaccine should be a yellow, clear liquid. Inspect visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. Beyond Use Date*: Shelf Life after Opening All of the reconstituted vaccine should be drawn into a sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. Administer immediately. Unused, reconstituted MMR may be stored in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 8 hours. Do not freeze or expose reconstituted vaccine to freezing temperatures. Protect reconstituted vaccine from light at all times. Agitate stored, reconstituted vaccine prior to administration. Do not administer reconstituted MMR vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours.

Special Instructions MMR vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. Consider storing MMR in the freezer between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Storing MMR in the freezer can free up storage space in the refrigerator . More vaccines must be stored in the refrigerator than in the freezer . Storing MMR in the freezer increases the space available for vaccines that should be stored in the refrigerator. In addition, storing MMR in the freezer can decrease confusion when stocking both MMR and MMRV (ProQuad). MMRV must be stored in the freezer. MMRV has been inadvertently moved to the refrigerator storage because staff confused it with MMR. Storing MMR and MMRV in the freezer decreases the likelihood of this happening. MMR may be stored and/or transported in an insulated container between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). Place a calibrated thermometer in the container with the vaccine. Monitor and record the temperature. Use of dry ice is not recommended, even for temporary storage. Dry ice may subject MMR vaccine to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Providers can have different products or presentations containing the same vaccine in the storage unit, for example, MMR and MMRV (ProQuad) vaccines.

This vaccine should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. The Resources section at the end of this document also includes vaccine administration information. 1. Just before use, withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial and inject it into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine component. 2. Swirl the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine and diluent well to mix thoroughly. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. 3. The reconstituted vaccine should be a clear, colorless liquid. Inspect visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. Beyond Use Date*: Shelf Life after Opening Single-Dose Vials: All of the reconstituted vaccine should be drawn into a sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. Administer immediately. Unused, reconstituted MPSV4 vaccine may be stored in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 30 minutes. Agitate any stored, reconstituted vaccine prior to administration. Do not administer reconstituted MPSV4 vaccine if it is not used within 30 minutes. Follow the immunization program guidance before discarding VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds. Multidose Vials: Shake well prior to withdrawing each dose. Withdraw a single dose (0.5 mL) of vaccine into sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. A separate, sterile syringe and needle should be used for each immunization. Unused portions of multidose vials should be refrigerated between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F 8\u00b0C). Once entered, the multidose vial of MPSV4 should be discarded after 35 days. *The date or time after which the vaccine should not be used; determined from the date or time the manufacturer-filled syringe is activated, vial is entered or vaccine is reconstituted; may be different from the expiration date.

Special Instructions Providers can have different products or presentations containing the same vaccine in the storage unit. Vaccine products and presentations often have different approved indications and uses (e.g., ages, route). For example, meningococcal vaccines (MCV4 and MPSV4) can be confused when stored in the same storage unit. Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike or look-alike vaccines next to each other.

Follow the immunization program guidance before discarding VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds. *The date or time after which the vaccine should not be used; determined from the date or time the manufacturer-filled syringe is activated, vial is entered or vaccine is reconstituted; may be different from the expiration date. Vaccines Exposed to Inappropriate Temperatures (Temperature Excursions) Varicella-containing vaccines exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range require immediate corrective action! Vaccine providers should have a current emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan that includes, but is not limited to, these four actions. 1. Vaccine exposed to temperature above +5\u00b0F should be stored in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). Vaccine exposed to temperatures below -58F should be stored in a freezer between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the manufacturer and/ or the immunization program for further guidance. 4. Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/ or the manufacturer. NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions In order to maintain temperatures between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C), it will be necessary in most combination refrigerator/freezer models to turn the temperature dial down to the coldest setting. This may result in the refrigerator compartment temperature being lowered as well. Careful monitoring of the refrigerator temperature will be necessary to avoid freezing vaccines stored in the refrigerator. Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 71 Selected Biologicals Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease\"Dormitory-style\" refrigerator/freezer is not appropriate for the storage of varicella- containing vaccines. A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. CDC and the vaccine manufacturer do not recommend transporting varicella-containing vaccines. If varicella-containing vaccines must be transported, CDC recommends transport with a portable freezer unit that maintains the temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Portable freezers may be available for rent in some places. According to the manufacturer's product information varicella-containing vaccines may be stored between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 72 continuous hours prior to reconstitution. If varicella-containing vaccines must be transported between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) complete the following actions: 1. Place a calibrated thermometer in the container as close as possible to the vaccine. 2. Record: a. the time refrigerator storage began b. the time refrigerator storage ended c. storage temperature during transport 3. Contact the manufacturer (1-800-9-VARIVAX) immediately upon arrival at the alternate storage facility for further guidance. 4. Do not discard vaccine without contacting the manufacturer and/or the immunization program for guidance. Use of dry ice is not recommended, even for temporary storage. Dry ice may subject varicella-containing vaccine to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Providers can have different products or presentations containing the varicella- containing vaccines in the storage unit. For example, single antigen and combination vaccines. Vaccine products and presentations often have different approved indications and uses (e.g., ages, route). Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike or look-alike vaccines next to each other.

Some of these errors are much more serious than others, but none of them should occur. Be sure your clinic or practice is not making errors such as these. Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave. St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.orgTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, April 2011.Error #1: Designating only one person, rather than at least two, to be responsible for storage and handling of vaccines Since vaccines are both expensive and fragile, everyone in the office should know the basics of vaccine handling, including what to do when a shipment arrives and what to do in the event of an equipment failure or power outage. It's very important to train at least one back-up person in all aspects of proper storage and handling of vaccines. The back-up and primary persons should be equally familiar with all aspects of vaccine storage and handling, including know - ing how to handle vaccines when they arrive, how to properly record refrigera - tor and freezer temperatures, and should be prepared to lead the response to an equipment problem or power outage. Error #2: Refrigerating vaccine in a manner that could jeopar - dize its quality The temperature in the vegetable bins, on the floor, next to the walls, in the door, and near the cold air outlet from the freezer may differ significantly from the temperature in the body of the refrigerator: do not store your vaccines or place thermometers in these locations. Always store vaccines in their original packag - ing in the body of the refrigerator away from these locations, and place your thermometer with the vaccines. Place vaccine packages in such a way that air can circulate around the compartment. Never overpack a refrigerator compartment. Error #3: Storing food and drinks in the vaccine refrigerator Frequent opening of the refrigerator door to retrieve food items can adversely affect the internal temperature of the unit and damage vaccines. Error #4: Inadvertently leaving the refrigerator or freezer door open or having inadequate seals Remind staff to close the unit doors tightly each time they open them. Also, check the seals on the doors on a regular schedule, and if there is any indication the door seal may be cracked or not sealing properly, have it replaced. Replac - ing a seal is much less costly than replacing a box of pneumococcal conjugate or varicella vaccine. Error #5: Storing vaccine in a dorm-style refrigerator All vaccines should be stored in a refrigerator and/or freezer unit that is designed specifically for the storage of biologics or, alternatively, in a separate free-stand - ing unit. A dorm-style combination refrigerator-freezer unit with just one exte - rior door has been shown to be unacceptable no matter where the vaccine was placed inside the unit. Small stand-alone refrigerator or freezer units are best for short-term storage needs. Error #6: Recording temperatures only once per day Temperatures fluctuate throughout the day. Temperatures in the refrigertor and freezer should be checked at the beginning and end of the day to determine if the unit is getting too cold or too warm. Ideally, you should have continuous thermometers that record temperatures all day and all night; those with alarms can alert you when temperatures go out of range. A less expensive alternative is to purchase maximum/minimum thermometers. Only thermometers with a Current Certificate of Traceability and Calibration* should be used for vaccine storage. It's also a good idea to record the room temperature on your temper - ature log in case there is a problem with the storage unit. This information may be helpful to the vaccine manufacturer and/or state immunization program in determining whether your vaccine is still usable. Error #7: Recording temperatures for only the refrigerator or freezer, rather than both It is essential to monitor and record temperatures in all refrigerators and freez - ers used to store vaccine. At all times you should have calibrated thermometers in the refrigerators as well as the freezers. Assure that your storage tempera - ture monitoring is accurate by purchasing thermometers that have a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration* and recalibrate them according to the manufac - turer's instructions. Your state immunization program may be able to provide more information on calibrated thermometers. Error #8: Documenting out-of-range temperatures on vaccine temperature logs but not taking action Documenting temperatures is not enough. Acting on the information is es - sential! So, what should you do? Notify your supervisor whenever you have an out-of-range temperature. Sometimes the solution is as simple as shutting a door left ajar or re-checking a freezer temperature that is slightly elevated as it goes through a normal, brief defrost cycle. Check the condition of the unit for problems. Are the seals on the door tight? Is there excessive lint or dust on the coils? After you have made any adjustment, document the date, time, tem - perature, the nature of the problem, the action you took, and the results of your action. Recheck the temperature every two hours. Call maintenance or a repair person if the temperature is still out of range. If the solution is not quick and easy, you will need to safeguard your vaccines by moving them to another storage unit that is functioning at the proper temperature. Label the affected vaccines \"Do not use\" and contact your state immunization program or vac - cine manufacturer to find out if the affected vaccine is still usable. Be sure to notify your state's VFC Program Coordinator if VFC vaccine was involved. Error #9: Discarding temperature logs at the end of every month It's important that you keep your temperature logs for at least three years. As your refrigerator or freezer ages, you can track recurring problems. If out-of- range temperatures have been documented, you can determine how long and how often this has been happening and take appropriate action. It's also a great way to demonstrate why you need a new refrigerator or freezer. Error #10: Discarding multi-dose vials 30 days after they are opened Don't discard your multi-dose vials of vaccines prematurely. Almost all multi- dose vaccine vials contain a preservative and can be used until the expiration date on the vial unless there is actual contamination or the vials are not stored under appropriate temperatures. However, you must discard multi-dose vials of reconstituted vaccine (e.g., meningococcal polysaccharide, yellow fever) if they are not used within a defined period after reconstitution. Refer to the vaccine package inserts for detailed information. Error #11: Not having emergency plans for a power outage or natural disaster Every clinic should have a written Emergency Response Plan that identifies a refrigerator and freezer in another location (ideally, a storage unit with a back-up generator) in which to store vaccine in the event of a power outage or natural disaster. Consider arranging in advance for a local hospital or simi - lar facility to be your back-up location if you should need it. Be sure back-up location staff understand vaccine storage and will allow you to supervise place - ment and verify storage temperatures so vaccine is not damaged.*A calibrated thermometer with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration with calibra - tion measurements traceable to a testing laboratory accredited by the International Organization of Standardization, to the Standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or to another internationally recognized standards agency.Transporting Refrigerated Vaccine IMM-983 (2/10) California Department of Public Health, Immunization Branchwww.eziz.orgGuidelines for vaccine transport and short-term storage The procedure below for packing vaccine will keep all vaccines ( except varicella vaccine ) within recommended tem- peratures for 12 hours during transport and/or storage at room temperatures (inside a car, building, etc.). It will also main-tain recommended temperatures if the cooler is exposed to outside temperatures as low as -4\u00baF for one of those 12 hours.If the vaccine will be stored in refrigerators after transport, be sure those refrigerators have maintained temperatures be- tween 35\u00baF and 46\u00baF for at least 3 to 5 days. Assemble packing supplies 1. Cooler. Use hard plastic Igloo-type coolers. Attach a \"Vaccines: Do Not Freeze\" label to the cooler. 2. \"Conditioned\" cold packs. Condition frozen gel packs by leaving them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until the edges have defrost-ed and packs look like they've been \"sweating.\" Cold packs that are not conditioned can freeze vaccine. Do not use dry ice. 3. Thermometer. Prepare the thermometer by placing it in the refrigera- tor at least 2 hours before you pack the vaccine. 4. Packing material. Use two 2-inch layers of bubble wrap. Not using enough bubble wrap can cause the vaccine to freeze. Pack vaccine Spread conditioned cold packs to cover only half of the bot-tom of the cooler. Spread \"conditioned\" cold packs to cover only half of the bubble wrap. Make sure that the cold packs do not touch the boxes of vaccine.Completely cover the vaccine with another 2-inch layer of bubble wrap. Fill the cooler to the top with bubble wrap. Place the thermom-eter's digital display and the Return or Transfer of Vaccines Report form on top. It's ok if temperatures go above 46\u00baF while packing.Stack layers of vaccine boxes on the bubble wrap. Do not let the boxes of vaccine touch the cold packs.Completely cover the cold packs with a 2-inch layer of bubble wrap. Then, place the thermometer/probe on top of the bubble wrap directly above a cold pack.1. Cold packs 2. Bubble wrap 3. Vaccine& Thermometer4. Bubble wrap 6. Form & display5. Cold packs As soon as you reach the destination site, check the vaccine temperature. If the vaccine is: Between 35\u00baF and 46\u00baF , put it in the refrigerator.

Then label the vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and put it in the refrigerator.Follow these procedures: 1. Close the door tightly and/or plug in the refrigerator/freezer. 2. Ensure the vaccine is kept at appropriate temperatures. Make sure the refrig- erator/freezer is working properly or move the vaccines to a unit that is. Do not discard the affected vaccines. Mark the vaccines so that the potentially compromised vaccines can be easily identified. 3. Notify the local or state health department or call the manufacturer (see manufacturers' phone numbers below). 4. Record action taken.Record this information*: 1.

Federal regulations require that vaccines undergo years of testing before they can be licensed. Once in use, vaccines are monitored continually for safety and efficacy. As an immunization provider, you also play a key role in helping to ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines through proper 1) Vaccine storage and handling; 2) Vacc ine administration; 3) Timing and spacing of vaccine doses ; 4) Observation of precautions and contraindications ; 5) Management of vaccine side effects ; 6) Reporting of suspected side effects ; and 7) Communication about vaccine benefits and risks . Addit ional information that addresses standards for immunization practices for children and adolescents and adults can be found in the 2003 American Journal of Preventive Medicine article by Poland et al available at http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0749 - 3797/PIIS074937970300120X.pdf that supports the need to ensure that healthcare professionals review and administer vaccines in a ccordance with patient (in this instance, the healthcare personnel) needs. Vaccine Storage To achieve the best possible results from vaccines, carefully follow the recommendations for storage, handling, and administration found in each vaccine's package insert. Here are other steps you can take to help monitor and ensure vaccine safety: Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective action Proper vaccine storage unit(s) are available in which to store vaccines A properly calibrated thermometer or temperature recording device is inside each storage compartment Cold chain procedures are in place to ensure that vaccine storage and handling guidelines are being followed Vaccines are inspected upon delivery a nd refrigerator and freezer temperatures are monitored to assure maintenance of the cold chain. Vaccine stock is rotated so the oldest vaccines are used first. If errors in vaccine storage and administration occur, there is evidence that corrective action is immediately taken to prevent them from happening again 2 Vaccine Administration To achieve the best possible results from vaccines, carefully follow the recommendations for storage, handling, and administration found in each va ccine's package insert. Here are other steps you can take to monitor and help ensure vaccine safety: Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective action Administration of vaccine is performed to ensure that it is never administered later than the expiration date If reconstituted, the vaccine is administered within the prescribed time period following that reconstitution Vaccines are drawn into syringes immediately prior to administration (unless pre-drawn in the pharmacy un der USP 797 standard conditions) If vaccines are mixed in the same syringe, it has been specifically approved for such mixing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The vaccine and administration information, including lot numbers and injection sites, are noted in the employee's health record If errors in vaccine administration occur, appropriate notification is immediately performed to ensure patient safety Timing and Spacing The timing and spacing of vaccine doses are two of the most important issues in the appropriate use of vaccines. To ensure optimal results from each immunization, follow the currently recommended immunization schedules. Use the following checklist to hel p monitor and ensure vaccine timing and spacing: Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective action All needed vaccines are administered as recommended, even if it means giving multiple doses at the same time Use of combination vaccines have been considered to minimize missed doses or timing errors (e.g., MMR, MMRV) Administration records are maintained in a manner that provides all necessary information (e.g., dates of administration) and are organized in a way that promote s 3 adherence with followup dosing and scheduling An electronic process is utilized to maintain vaccine information and calculate next dose due dates Observe Valid Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications and precautions to vaccination indicate when vaccines should not be given. A contraindication is a condition in a patient that increases the chance of a serious, adverse reaction. In general, a vaccine should not be administered when a co ntraindication is present. A precaution is a condition in a patient that may increase the chance of a serious side effect or render a vaccine less effective. Normally, vaccination is deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of a side effect, and the provider may decide to vaccinate the patient. Most precautions and some contraindications are temporary and the vaccine may be given at a later time. Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective action Every healthcare worker patient is screened for contraindications and precautions before being given a vaccine dose Documentation of the discussion regarding the contraindication/precaution is maintained Many conditions are often inappropriately regarded as contraindications to vaccination. In most cases, the following are not contraindications: Mild acute illness (e.g., diarrhea and minor upper- respiratory tract illnesses, including otitis media) with o r without low grade fever Mild to moderate local reactions and/or low grade or moderate fever following a prior dose of the vaccine Current antimicrobial therapy Convalescent phase of illness Recent exposure to an infectious disease Breastfeeding 4 Communicate About Vaccine Benefits and Risks Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective action Assess reasons for refusal/declination of vaccines to determine educational opportunities Identify and collaborate with experts in immunization to identify concise communications regarding individual vaccines and their importance in disease prevention Develop targeted communications regardi ng vaccines that focus on the most common questions from pe rsonn el Coordinate communication methods so they include healthcare personnel who are employees as well as students, licensed independent professi onals , and relevant external partners such as supply and pharmaceutical vendors and representatives A copy of the most current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) is provided to all vaccines prior to the administration of each vaccine dos e If English is the second language, the VIS in the employee's native language is provided, if available Be Prepared to Manage Vaccine Side Effects Most people experience no side effects, or only mild ones, following immunization. Mild side effects may include soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site or mild fever. Severe side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, following vaccination are extremely rare . Quality Monitoring Element Yes No NA Followup and/or corrective actio n Emergency protocols have been written and are regularly reviewed Personnel responsible for the immunization program are knowledgeable regarding the emergency protocols and have been deemed competent to apply those emergency interventions Epinephrine and equipment for maintaining an airway are available for immediate use 5 Report Suspected Side Effects to VAERS The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national vaccine safety monitoring program.

Although birth before 1957 generally is considered acceptable evidence of measles, mumps, and rubella immunity, healthcare facilities should consider recommending 2 doses of MMR vaccine routinely to unvaccinated HCP born before 1957 who do not have laboratory evidence of disease or immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella. For these same HCP who do not have evidence of immunity, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and 1 dose during an outbreak of rubella. Varicella It is recommended that all HCP be immune to varicella. Evidence of immunity in HCP includes documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine given at least 28 days apart, history of varicella or herpes zoster based on physician diagnosis, laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory confirmation of disease. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis (Td/Tdap) All adults who have completed a primary series of a tetanus/diphtheria- containing product (DTP, DTaP, DT, Td) should receive Td boosters every 10 years. HCP of all ages with direct patient contact should be given a 1-time dose of Tdap, with priority given to those having contact with infants younger than age 12 months. Meningococcal Vaccination is recommended for microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis. Use of MCV4 is preferred for persons younger than age 56 years; give IM. Use MPSV4 only if there is a permanent contraindica - tion or precaution to MCV4. Use of MPSV4 (not MCV4) is recommended for HCP older than age 55; give SC. References 1.

Test for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti- HBs) to document immunity 1-2 months after dose #3. If anti-HBs is at least 10 mIU/mL (positive), the patient is immune. No further serologic testing or vaccination is recommended. If anti-HBs is less than 10 mIU/mL (negative), the patient is unpro - tected from hepatitis B virus series. after dose #3. - If anti-HBs is positive, the patient is immune. No further testing or vac - cination is recommended. - If anti-HBs is negative after 6 doses of vaccine, patient is a non-responder. For non-responders: HCP who are non-responders should be considered susceptible to HBV and should be counseled regarding precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or probable parenteral exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive blood.1 It is also possible that non-responders are persons who are HBsAg positive. Testing should be considered. HCP found to be HBsAg positive should be counseled and medically evaluated. Note: Anti-HBs testing is not recommended routinely for previously vac - cinated HCP who were not tested 1-2 months after their original vaccine series. These HCP should be tested for anti-HBs when they have an exposure to blood or body fluids. If found to be anti-HBs negative, the HCP should be treated as if susceptible.1 Influenza All HCP, including physicians, nurses, paramedics, emergency medical tech - nicians, employees of nursing homes and chronic care facilities, students in these professions, and volunteers, should receive annual vaccination against influenza. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may only be given to non-pregnant healthy HCP age 49 years and younger. Inactivated injectable influenza vaccine (TIV) is preferred over LAIV for HCP who are in close contact with severely immunosuppressed persons (e.g., stem cell transplant patients) when patients require protective isolation. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) HCP who work in medical be immune to measles, mumps, and rubella. HCP born in 1957 or later can be considered immune to measles, mumps, or rubella only if they have documentation of (a) laboratory confirmation Healthcare Personnel Vaccination Recommendations Hepatitis B Give 3-dose series (dose #1 now, #2 in 1 month, #3 approximately 5 months after #2). Give IM. Obtain anti-HBs serologic testing 1-2 months after dose #3. Influenza Give 1 dose of influenza vaccine annually. Give inactivated injectable influenza vaccine intramuscularly or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasally. MMR For healthcare personnel (HCP) born in 1957 or later without serologic evidence of immunity or prior vaccination, give 2 doses of MMR, 4 weeks apart. For HCP born prior to 1957, see below. Give SC. Varicella For HCP who have no serologic proof of immunity, prior vaccination, or history of varicella disease, (chickenpox) give 2 doses of varicella vaccine, 4 weeks apart. Give SC. Tetanus, diphtheria, Give all HCP a Td booster dose every 10 years, following the completion of the primary 3-dose series. pertussis Give a 1-time dose of Tdap to HCP of all ages with direct patient contact. Give IM. Meningococcal Give 1 dose to microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis. Give IM or SC. Vaccine Recommendations in brief Hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio vaccines are not routinely recommended for HCP who may have on-the-job exposure to fecal material. www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2017.pdf Item #P2017 (1/11)Adapted from the Michigan Department of Community Health Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave. St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.orgTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 2011.Continuing Education Examination available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/cme/conted.html.

Summary This report updates the previously published summary of recommendations for vaccinating health-care personnel (HCP) in the United States (CDC. Immunization of health-care workers: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] and the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee [HICPAC]. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR-18]). This report was reviewed by and includes input from the Healthcare (formerly Hospital) Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. These updated recommendations can assist hospital administrators, infection-control practitioners, employee health clinicians, and HCP in optimizing infection prevention and control programs. The recommendations for vaccinating HCP are presented by disease in two categories: 1) those diseases for which vaccination or documentation of immunity is recommended because of risks to HCP in their work settings for acquiring disease or transmitting to patients and 2) those for which vaccination might be indicated in certain circumstances. Background information for each vaccine-preventable disease and specific recommendations for use of each vaccine are presented. Certain infection-control measures that relate to vaccination also are included in this report. In addition, ACIP recommendations for the remaining vaccines that are recommended for certain or all adults are summarized, as are considerations for catch-up and travel vaccinations and for work restrictions. This report summarizes all current ACIP recommendations for vaccination of HCP and does not contain any new recommendations or policies.

The report, which was reviewed by and includes input from HICPAC, summarizes all current ACIP recommendations for vaccination of HCP and does not contain any new recommendations or policies that have not been published previously. These recommendations can assist hospital administrators, infection-control practitioners, employee health clinicians, and HCP in optimizing infection prevention and control programs. HCP are defined as all paid and unpaid persons working in health-care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. HCP might include (but are not limited to) physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual staff not employed by the health-care facility, and persons (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, billing, and volunteers) not directly involved in patient care but potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from HCP and patients (2). Because of their contact with patients or infective material from patients, many HCP are at risk for exposure to (and possible transmission of) vaccine-preventable diseases. Employers and HCP have a shared responsibility to prevent occupationally acquired infections and avoid causing harm to patients by taking reasonable precautions to prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination programs are therefore an essential part of infection prevention and control for HCP . Optimal use of recommended vaccines helps maintain immunity and safeguard HCP from infection, thereby helping protect patients from becoming infected; pertinent ACIP statements on various individual vaccines and diseases have been published (Table 1). Nationwide, ongoing implementation of these vaccine recommendations through well-managed vaccination programs could substantially reduce both the number of susceptible HCP in any setting in which they interact with patients and their risks for transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases to patients, other HCP , and other contacts (3 ). HICPAC and CDC have recommended that secure, preferably computerized, systems should be used to manage vaccination records for HCP so records can be retrieved easily as needed (3 ). Each record should reflect immunity status for indicated vaccine-preventable diseases (i.e., documented disease, vaccination history, or serology results) as well as vaccinations administered during employment and any documented episodes of adverse events after vaccination ( 4). For each vaccine, the record should include date of vaccine administration (including for those vaccines that might have been received prior to employment), vaccine manufacturer and lot number, edition and distribution date of the language-appropriate Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) provided to the vaccinee at the time of vaccination, and the name, address, and title of the person administering the vaccine (4). Accurate vaccination records can help to rapidly identify susceptible HCP (i.e., those with no history of vaccination or lack of documentation of immunity) during an outbreak situation and can help reduce costs and disruptions to health-care operations ( 5-7). HCP should be provided a copy of their vaccination records and encouraged to keep it with their personal health records so they can readily be made available to future employers. HICPAC has encouraged any facility or organization that provides direct patient care to formulate a comprehensive vaccination policy for all HCP ( 3). The American Hospital Association has endorsed the concept of vaccination programs for both hospital personnel and patients ( 8). To ensure that all HCP are up to date with respect to recommended vaccines, facilities should review HCP vaccination and immunity status at the time of hire and on a regular basis (i.e., at least annually) with consideration of offering needed vaccines, if necessary, in conjunction with routine annual disease-prevention measures (e.g., influenza vaccination or tuberculin testing). These recommendations (Tables 2 and 3) should be considered during policy development. Several states and health-care facilities have established requirements relating to assessment of vaccination status and/or administration of one or more vaccines for HCP ( 9,10). Disease-specific outbreak control measures are described in this report and elsewhere ( 3,11,12). All HCP should adhere to all other recommended infection-control guidelines, whether or not they are individually determined to have immunity to a vaccine-preventable disease. Methods In 2008, the ACIP Immunization of Health-Care Personnel Work Group (the Work Group) was formed as a subgroup of the ACIP Adult Immunization Work Group to update the previously published recommendations for immunization of HCP . The Work Group comprised professionals from Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 3academic medicine (pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine, occupational and environmental medicine, and infectious disease); federal and state public health professionals; and liaisons from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and HICPAC. The Work Group met monthly, developed an outline for the report, worked closely with subject matter experts at CDC (who developed, revised, and updated sections of the report), and provided subsequent critical review of the draft documents. The approach of the Work Group was to summarize previously published ACIP recommendations and not to make new recommendations or policies; a comprehensive list of publications containing the various vaccine-specific recommendations is provided (Table 1). In February 2011, the updated report was presented to ACIP , which voted to approve it. The recommendations for vaccination of HCP are presented below by disease in two categories: 1) those diseases for which routine vaccination or documentation of immunity is recommended for HCP because of risks to HCP in their work settings and, should HCP become infected, to the patients they serve and 2) those diseases for which vaccination of HCP might be indicated in certain circumstances. Vaccines recommended in the first category are hepatitis B, seasonal influenza, measles, mumps, and rubella, pertussis, and varicella vaccines. Vaccines in the second category are meningococcal, typhoid, and polio vaccines. Except for influenza, all of the diseases prevented by these vaccines are notifiable at the national level ( 13). Main changes from the 1997 ACIP recommendations have been summarized (Box). Diseases for Which Vaccination Is Recommended On the basis of documented nosocomial transmission, HCP are considered to be at substantial risk for acquiring or transmitting hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and varicella. Current recommendations for vaccination are provided below. Hepatitis B Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is transmitted through percutaneous (i.e., breaks in the skin) or mucosal (i.e., direct contact with mucous membranes) exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. The virus is highly infectious; for nonimmune persons, disease transmission from a needlestick exposure is up to 100 times more likely for exposure to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive blood than to HIV-positive blood ( 14). HBV infection is a well recognized occupational risk for U.S. HCP and globally. The risk for HBV is associated with degree of contact with blood in the work place and with the hepatitis B e-antigen status of the source persons ( 15). The virus is also environmentally stable, remaining infectious on environmental surfaces for at least 7 days (16). In 2009 in the United States, 3,371 cases of acute HBV infection were reported nationally, and an estimated 38,000 new cases of HBV infection occurred after accounting for underreporting and underdiagnosis ( 17). Of 4,519 persons reported with acute HBV infection in 2007, approximately 40% were hospitalized and 1.5% died ( 18). HBV can lead to chronic infection, which can result in cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, liver cancer, and death. An estimated 800,000-1.4 million persons in the United States are living with chronic HBV infection; these persons serve as the main reservoir for continued HBV transmission (19). Vaccines to prevent hepatitis B became available in the United States in 1981; a decade later, a national strategy to eliminate HBV infection was implemented, and the routine vaccination of children was recommended ( 20). During 1990- 2009, the rate of new HBV infections declined approximately 84%, from 8.5 to 1.1 cases per 100,000 population ( 17); the decline was greatest (98%) among persons aged <19 years, for whom recommendations for routine infant and adolescent vaccination have been applied. Although hepatitis B vaccine coverage is high in infants, children, and adolescents (91.8% in infants aged 19-35 months and 91.6% in adolescents aged 13-17 years) ( 21,22), coverage remains lower (41.8% in 2009) for certain adult populations, including those with behavioral risks for HBV infection (e.g., men who have sex with men and persons who use injection drugs) (23). Hepatitis B in Health-Care Settings During 1982, when hepatitis B vaccine was first recommended for HCP , an estimated 10,000 infections occurred among persons employed in a medical or dental field. By 2004, the number of HBV infections among HCP had decreased to an estimated 304 infections, largely resulting from the implementation of routine preexposure vaccination and improved infection-control precautions (24-26). The risk for acquiring HBV infection from occupational exposures is dependent on the frequency of percutaneous and mucosal exposures to blood or body fluids (e.g., semen, saliva, and wound exudates) containing HBV, particularly fluids containing HBeAg (a marker for high HBV replication and viral load) (27-31). The risk is higher during the professional Recommendations and Reports 4 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7training period and can vary throughout a person's career ( 1). Depending on the tasks performed, health-care or public safety personnel might be at risk for HBV exposure; in addition, personnel providing care and assistance to persons in outpatient settings and those residing in long-term-care facilities (e.g., assisted living) might be at risk for acquiring or facilitating transmission of HBV infection when they perform procedures that expose them to blood (e.g., assisted blood-glucose monitoring and wound care) (32-34).A Federal Standard issued in December 1991 under the Occupational Safety and Health Act mandates that hepatitis B vaccine be made available at the employer's expense to all health-care personnel who are exposed occupationally to blood or other potentially infectious materials ( 35). The Federal Standard defines occupational exposure as reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that might result from the performance of an employee's duties (35). Occupational Safety and Health Administration BOX. Summary of main changes* from 1997 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices/Hospital (now Healthcare) Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee recommendations for immunization of health-care personnel (HCP) Hepatitis B HCP and trainees in certain populations at high risk for chronic hepatitis B (e.g., those born in countries with high and intermediate endemicity) should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc/anti-HBs to determine infection status. Influenza Emphasis that all HCP, not just those with direct patient care duties, should receive an annual influenza vaccination Comprehensive programs to increase vaccine coverage among HCP are needed; influenza vaccination rates among HCP within facilities should be measured and reported regularly. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) History of disease is no longer considered adequate presumptive evidence of measles or mumps immunity for HCP; laboratory confirmation of disease was added as acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity. History of disease has never been considered adequate evidence of immunity for rubella. The footnotes have been changed regarding the recommendations for personnel born before 1957 in routine and outbreak contexts. Specifically, guidance is provided for 2 doses of MMR for measles and mumps protection and 1 dose of MMR for rubella protection. Pertussis HCP, regardless of age, should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they hav e not pr eviously r eceived Tdap. The minimal interval was removed, and Tdap can no w be administer ed r egardless of inter val since the last tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine. Hospitals and ambulatory-care facilities should provide Tdap for HCP and use appr oaches that maximiz e v accination rates. VaricellaCriteria for evidence of immunity to varicella were established. For HCP they include written documentation with 2 doses of vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, diagnosis of history of varicella disease by health-care provider, or diagnosis of history of herpes zoster by health-care provider. Meningococcal HCP with anatomic or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies should now receive a 2-dose series of meningococcal conjugate vaccine. HCP with HIV infection who are vaccinated should also receive a 2 dose series. Those HCP who remain in groups at high risk are recommended to be revaccinated every 5 years. Abbreviations: HBsAg = Hepatitis B surface antigen; anti-HBc = hepatitis B core antibody; anti-HBs = hepatitis surface antibody; Tdap reduced diptheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. * Updated recommendations made since publication of the 1997 summary of recommendations (CDC Immunization of health-care workers: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] and the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee [HICPAC]. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR-18]). Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 5(OSHA) vaccination practice requirements (e.g., preexposure and postexposure antibody testing) are based on current ACIP recommendations. OSHA regulations might have accelerated the use of hepatitis B vaccine in HCP (36). Data from a national, cross-sectional survey demonstrated that during 2002-2003, an estimated 75% of HCP had received the 3-dose hepatitis B vaccination series ( 37). Since 2002, rates of 1-dose and 3-dose vaccination coverage have remained stable. Data obtained through the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 2009 demonstrated a 1-dose coverage rate of 75%-77% and a 3-dose rate of 67%-68% among HCP aged 18-49 years ( 23). Similarly, data obtained through the National Immunization Survey-Adult (NIS-Adult) in 2007 demonstrated a 3-dose coverage of 62% among HCP aged 18-64 years ( 38). The Healthy People 2020 goal (objective no. IID-15.3) of a hepatitis B vaccination coverage rate of 90% among HCP ( 39) has not been achieved. Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety Vaccine Effectiveness The 3-dose vaccine series administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months produces a protective antibody response in approximately 30%-55% of healthy adults aged 40 years after the first dose, 75% after the second dose, and >90% after the third dose ( 40-42 ). After age 40 years, <90% of persons vaccinated with 3 doses have a protective antibody response, and by age 60 years, protective levels of antibody develop in approximately 75% of vaccinated persons ( 43). Smoking, obesity, genetic factors, and immune suppression also are associated with diminished immune response to hepatitis B vaccination (43-46). Duration of Immunity Protection against symptomatic and chronic HBV infection has been documented to persist for 22 years in vaccine responders ( 47). Immunocompetent persons who achieve hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) concentrations of 10 mIU/mL after preexposure vaccination have protection against both acute disease and chronic infection. Anti-HBs levels decline over time. Regardless, responders continue to be protected, and the majority of responders will show an anamnestic response to vaccine challenge ( 47-51). Declines might be somewhat faster among persons vaccinated as infants rather than as older children, adolescents, or adults and among those administered recombinant vaccine instead of plasma vaccine (which has not been commercially available in the United States since the late 1980s). Although immunogenicity is lower among immunocompromised persons, those who achieve and maintain a protective antibody response before exposure to HBV have a high level of protection from infection (52). Among persons who do not respond to a primary 3-dose vaccine series (i.e., those in whom anti-HBs concentrations of 10 mIU/mL were not achieved), 25%-50% respond to an additional vaccine dose, and 44%-100% respond to a 3-dose revaccination series using standard or high dosage vac - cine (43,53-58). Persons who have measurable but low (i.e., 1-9 mIU/mL) levels of anti-HBs after the initial series have better response to revaccination than persons who have no anti-HBs (49,53,54). Persons who do not have protective levels of anti-HBs 1-2 months after revaccination either are infected with HBV or can be considered primary nonresponders; for the latter group, genetic factors might be associated with nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccination ( 54,58,59). ACIP does not recommend more than two vaccine series in nonresponders (52). Vaccine Safety Hepatitis B vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe when administered to infants, children, adolescents, and adults (52,60,61). Although rare cases of arthritis or alopecia have been associated temporally with hepatitis B vaccination, recent data do not support a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccine and either arthritis or alopecia ( 61-63). During 1982- 2004, an estimated 70 million adolescents and adults and 50 million infants and children in the United States received 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine ( 52). The most frequently reported side effects in persons receiving hepatitis B vaccine are pain at the injection site (3%-29%) and temperature of However, in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects were reported no more frequently among persons receiving hepatitis B vaccine than among persons receiving placebo ( 40,41,64-67 ). Revaccination is not associated with an increase in adverse events. Hepatitis B vaccination is contraindicated for persons with a history of hypersensitivity to yeast or any vaccine component (4,64-66 ). Persons with a history of serious adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis) after receipt of hepatitis B vaccine should not receive additional doses. As with other vaccines, vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever, should be deferred until illness resolves ( 4). Vaccination is not contraindicated in persons with a history of multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic diseases. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination; limited data suggest that developing fetuses are not at risk for adverse events when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to pregnant women ( 4,68). Available vaccines contain noninfectious hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and do not pose any risk for infection to the fetus. Recommendations and Reports 6 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7Recommendations T wo single-antigen hepatitis B vaccines, Recombivax HB (Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) and one combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine, T winrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), are available in the United States. Primary vaccination consists of 3 intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine or of the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis vaccine series does not need to be restarted if the second or third dose is delayed. Detailed vaccination recommendations are available in previously published guidelines ( 52). Vaccine schedules are available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/adult-schedule.htm#HCWs. In adults, hepatitis B vaccine always should be administered into the deltoid muscle. Longer needles (up to 1.5 inches in length) might be required for obese adults (4). Preexposure Unvaccinated and Incompletely Vaccinated Pre- and Postvaccination Serologic Testing Prevaccination serologic testing for previous infection is not indicated for the majority of persons being vaccinated because of occupational risk unless the hospital or health-care organization considers such testing cost-effective (3,52,69-72 ). However, such testing is indicated for HCP and is cost-effective in certain high-risk populations (see HCP and T rainees at Additional Risk), regardless of vaccination status (71,73). All unvaccinated persons whose work- and training-related activities involve reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids (e.g., HCP , long-term-care facility staff, and public safety workers) should be vaccinated with the complete, 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series. Persons with an incom plete series are not consid ered protected and should complete the 3-dose series. Because higher risk has been repor ted during the professional training period, the vaccination series should be completed before trainees have contact with blood; vaccination should be offered in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions. To determine the need for rev accination and to guide postexposure prophylaxis, postvaccination serologic testing should be performed for all HCP at high risk for occupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids. Postvaccination serologic testing is performed 1-2 months after administration of the last dose of the vaccine series using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (10 mIU/mL). Persons determined to have anti-HBs concentrations of 10 mIU/mL after receipt of the primary vaccine series are considered immune, and the result should be documented. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels. Postvaccination testing for persons at low risk for mucosal or percutaneous exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g., public safety workers and HCP without direct patient contact) likely is not cost effective ( 52); however, persons who do not undergo postvaccination testing should be counseled to seek immediate testing if exposed. Persons determined to have anti-HBs concentrations of <10 mIU/mL soon after receipt of the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. For these persons, administration of a second complete 3-dose series on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1-2 months after the third dose, usually is more practical than conducting serologic testing after each additional dose of vaccine. Persons who do not have a protectiv e concentration of anti-HBs (10 mIU/mL) after revaccination (i.e., after receiving a total of 6 doses) should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc to determine infection status. Those determined not to be infected but who have anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL (nonresponders) should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) postexposure prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to HBsAg-positive blood (72). Persons determined to be infected (anti-HBc-positive) and positive for HBsAg should be provided counseling regarding how to prevent HBV transmission to others and referred for further evaluation (e.g., HBV viral load testing), care, treatment, and other services, as appropriate (69- 71). Persons who are HBsAg- positive and who perform exposure-prone procedures should seek counsel from a review panel comprised of experts with a balanced perspective (e.g., HCPs' personal physicians and infectious disease specialists) regarding the procedures that they can perform safely. They should not be excluded from work ( 69). Persons who were infected in the past (anti-HBc-positive but negative for HBsAg) require no vaccination or treatment. Postexposure The need for postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated immediately after HCP experience any percutaneous, ocular, mucous-membrane or nonintact skin exposure to blood or body fluid in the workplace. Decisions to administer Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 7postexposure prophylaxis should be based on the HBsAg status of the source and the vaccination history and vaccine-response status of the exposed HCP (Table 4) (72). Unvaccinated and Incompletely Vaccinated HCP and Trainees Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated persons who experience a workplace exposure from persons known to be HBsAg-positive should receive 1 dose of hepatitis B immune globulin HBIG (i.e., passive vaccination) as soon as possible after exposure (preferably within 24 hours). The effectiveness of HBIG when administered >7 days after percutaneous or permucosal exposures is unknown (Table 4). Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible after exposure; HBIG should be administered at the same time at another injection site. The 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed for previously unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated persons who have needlestick or other percutaneous exposures, regardless of the HBsAg status of the source and whether the status of the source is known. To document protective levels of anti-HBs (10mIU/mL), postvaccination testing of persons who received HBIG for postexposure prophylaxis should be performed after anti-HBs from HBIG is no longer detectable (4-6 months after administration). Vaccinated HCP and Trainees Vaccinated HCP with documented immunity (anti-HBs concentrations of 10 mIU/mL) require no postexposure prophylaxis, serologic testing, or additional vaccination. Vaccinated HCP with documented nonresponse to a 3-dose vaccine series should receive 1 dose of HBIG and a second 3-dose vaccine series if the source is HBsAg-positive or known to be at high risk for carrying hepatitis. If the source is known or determined to be HBsAg- negative, these previously nonresponding HCP should complete the revaccination series and undergo postvaccination testing to ensure that their response status is documented (Table 4). Postvaccination testing of persons who received HBIG for PEP should be performed after anti-HBs from HBIG is no longer detectable (4-6 months after administration). Vaccinated HCP with documented nonresponse to two 3-dose vaccine series should receive 2 doses of HBIG, 1 month apart if the source is HBsAg-positive or known to be at high risk for carrying hepatitis; no additional vaccination is necessary. If the source is known or determined to be HBsAg-negative, these previously nonresponding HCP need no additional testing or treatment (Table 4). Vaccinated HCP with no documentation of postvaccination serologic response who are exposed to an HBsAg-positive source should have serum obtained for anti-HBs testing immediately. Those determined to have protective levels of antibody (anti-HBs 10 mIU/mL) require no additional treatment; those with concentrations <10 mIU/mL should receive 1 dose of HBIG, along with a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. To document protective levels of anti-HBs (10mIU/mL), postvaccination testing of persons who received HBIG for postexposure prophylaxis should be performed after anti-HBs from HBIG is no longer detectable (4-6 months after administration). Vaccinated HCP with no documentation of postvaccination serologic response who are exposed to a source with unknown infection status should be tested for anti-HBs. Those determined to have protective levels of antibody require no additional treatment; those with concentrations <10 mIU/mL should receive a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and serologic testing 1-2 months later. Vaccinated HCP with no documentation of postvaccination serologic response who are exposed to a source known to be HBsAg-negative require no testing or treatment (Table 4). HCP and Trainees at Additional Risk Regardless of vac cination histor y, HCP and trainees in certain high-risk populations, including those born in geographic regions with high HBsAg prevalence (8%) and intermediate (2%-7%) prevalence ( 71), unvaccinated U.S- born HCP whose parents were born in regions of high HBsAg prevalence, HIV-positive HCP , HCP who have disclosed having engaged or currently engaging in high-risk substance abuse or sexual behaviors, and HCP who require immunosuppressive therapy or who are on hemodialysis should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc/anti-HBs to determine infection status. For those who are unvaccinated, blood should be drawn for testing before the first dose of vaccine is administered, and vaccination should be administered during the same health-care visit. Persons testing negative for hepatitis B infection or immunity should be managed in the same manner as other uninfected HCP . Persons determined to be HBsAg-positive should be provided counseling regarding how to prevent HBV transmission to others and referred for further evaluation (e.g., HBV viral load testing), care, treatment, and other services as appropriate (69- 71). Persons who are HBsAg- positive and who perform exposure-prone procedures should seek counsel from a review panel comprised of experts with a balanced perspective (e.g., personal physicians Recommendations and Reports 8 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7of HCP and infectious disease specialists) regarding the procedures that they can perform safely. They should not be excluded from work ( 69). Additional information regarding prevaccination testing for HCP with other hepatitis B risk factors and for pregnant women has been published previously ( 52,71). HCP receiving hemodialysis should be provided annual anti-HBs testing and should be administered a booster dose of vaccine when anti-HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/mL (52). persons, hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, and persons receiving chemotherapy), the frequency of postvaccination testing and the need for booster doses has not been determined (52). Other Considerations Occupational health programs and others responsible for infection prevention and control should identify all staff whose work-related activities involve exposure to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids in a health-care, laboratory, public safety, or institutional setting (including employees, students, contractors, attending clinicians, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and volunteers); provide education to staff to encourage vaccination; and implement active follow-up, with reminders to track completion of the vaccine series and postvaccination testing among persons receiving vaccination (72). In partnership with state and local health authorities, household, sex, or needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-positive HCP and trainees should be identified, tested, vaccinated (if indicated), and provided with counseling and referral for needed services, when appropriate. Influenza Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Influenza causes an estimated average of >200,000 hospitalizations and 3,000-49,000 deaths annually in the United States ( 74-76 ). The majority of influenza-related severe illnesses and deaths occur among persons with chronic medical conditions, infants and young children, seniors, and pregnant women ( 74-78 ). Reducing the risk for influenza among persons at higher risk for complications is a major focus of influenza prevention strategies (77). Influenza Transmission in Health-Care Settings HCP are exposed to patients with influenza in the workplace and are thus at risk of occupationally acquired influenza and of transmitting influenza to patients and other HCP . In a cross- sectional survey of hospital house staff (physicians in training), 37% reported influenza-like illness during September-April, and 9% reported more than one respiratory illness. Length of illness varied (range: 1-10 days; mean: 7 days), as did days missed (range: 0-10 days; mean: 0.7 days) ( 79). Infected HCP who continue to work while ill might transmit influenza to patients, many of whom are at increased risk for severe outcomes from influenza. HCP are therefore recommended for routine annual influenza vaccination (77). Few randomized trials of the effect that influenza vaccination has on illness in HCP have been conducted. In one randomized trial of 427 HCP , influenza vaccination of HCP failed to decrease episodes of respiratory infection or duration of illness but was associated with a 28% decrease in absenteeism (from 1.4 days to 1.0 day) attributable to respiratory infections ( 80). No laboratory confirmation of influenza was obtained in this study. In another randomized trial among HCP , vaccination was associated with a significantly lower rate of serological evidence of influenza infection, with a vaccine efficacy rate of 88% for influenza A and 89% for influenza B (p<0.05) ( 81); however, no significant differences were noted in days of febrile respiratory illness or absenteeism. Influenza can cause outbreaks of severe respiratory illness among hospitalized persons and long-term-care residents ( 82- 90). Influenza outbreaks in hospitals (86-88) and long-term-care facilities ( 91) have been associated with low vaccination rates among HCP . One nonrandomized study demonstrated an increase in HCW vaccination rates and decrease in nosocomially acquired, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a hospital after a mobile cart-based HCP vaccination program was introduced (86). Several randomized controlled studies of the impact of HCP vaccination on morbidity and mortality in long-term care facilities have been performed ( 92-95 ). These studies have demonstrated substantial decreases in all-cause mortality (92-95) and influenza-like illness ( 92,94,95). However, studies which examine and demonstrate efficacy in preventing more specific outcomes (e.g., laboratory-confirmed influenza illness and mortality) are lacking. Recent systematic reviews suggest that vaccination of HCP in settings in which patients also were vaccinated provided significant reductions in deaths among elderly patients from all causes and deaths from pneumonia, but also note that additional randomized controlled trials are warranted (96,97), as are examination of more specific outcomes. Preventing influenza among HCP who might serve as sources of influenza virus transmission provides additional protection to patients at risk for influenza complications. Vaccination of HCP can specifically benefit patients who cannot receive vaccination (e.g., infants aged <6 months or those with severe Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 9allergic reactions to prior influenza vaccination), patients who respond poorly to vaccination (e.g., persons aged 85 years and immune-compromised persons), and persons for whom antiviral treatment is not available (e.g., persons with medical contraindications). Although annual vaccination has long been recommended for HCP and is a high priority for reducing morbidity associated with influenza in health-care settings ( 98-100 ), national survey data have demonstrated that the vaccination coverage level during the 2008-09 season was 52.9% (101). Considerations Regarding Influenza Vaccination of HCP Barriers to HCP aceptance of influenza vaccination have included fear of vaccine side effects (particularly influenza-like symptoms), insufficient time or inconvenience, perceived ineffectiveness of the vaccine, perceived low likelihood of contracting influenza, avoidance of medications, and fear of needles ( 79,102-109). Factors demonstrated to increase vaccine acceptance include a desire for self-protection, previous receipt of influenza vaccine, a desire to protect patients, and perceived effectiveness of vaccine ( 79,105,106,109-112 ). Strategies that have demonstrated improvement in HCP vaccination rates have included campaigns to emphasize the benefits of HCP vaccination for staff and patients, vaccination of senior medical staff or opinion leaders, removing administrative barriers (e.g., costs), providing vaccine in locations and at times easily accessible by HCP , and monitoring and reporting HCP influenza vaccination rates ( 99,113-120). Intranasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an option for healthy, nonpregnant adults aged <50 years who dislike needles. The practice of obtaining signed declinations from HCP offered influenza vaccination has been adopted by some institutions but has not yet been demonstrated to exceed coverage rates of >70%-80% ( 99,115,121-123). Institutions that require declination statements from HCP who refuse influenza vaccination should educate and counsel these HCP about benefits of the vaccine. Each health-care facility should develop a comprehensive influenza vaccination strategy that includes targeted education about the disease, including disease risk among HCP and patients, and about the vaccine. In addition, the program should establish easily accessible vaccination sites and inform HCP about their locations and schedule. Facilities that employ HCP should provide influenza vaccine at no cost to personnel (124). The most effective combination of approaches for achieving high influenza vaccination coverage among HCP likely varies by institution. Hospitals and health-care organizations in the United States traditionally have employed an immunization strategy that includes one or more of the following components: education about influenza, easy access to vaccine, incentives to encourage immunization, organized campaigns, institution of declination policies, and legislative and regulatory efforts (e.g., vaccination requirements) ( 99, 115, 121-126). Beginning January 1, 2007, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health-Care Organizations required accredited organizations to offer influenza vaccinations to staff, including volunteers and licensed independent practitioners and to report coverage levels among HCP ( 127). Standards are available for measuring vaccination coverage among HCP as a measure of program performance within a health-care setting ( 128). Beginning January 2013, the Centers for Medicaid Services will require acute care hospitals to report HCP influenza vaccine as part of its hospital inpatient quality reporting program.* Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety Effectiveness of influenza vaccines varies from year to year and depends on the age and health status of the person getting the vaccine and the similarity or \"match\" between the viruses or virus in the vaccine and those in circulation. Vaccine strains are selected for inclusion in the influenza vaccine every year based on international surveillance and scientists' estimations about which types and strains of viruses will circulate in a given year. Annual vaccination is recommended because the predominant circulating influenza viruses typically change from season to season and, because immunity declines over time postvaccination (77). In placebo-controlled studies among adults, the most frequent side effect of vaccination was soreness at the vaccination site (affecting 10%-64% of patients) that lasted <2 days ( 129,130 ). These injection-site reactions typically were mild and rarely interfered with the recipient's ability to conduct usual daily activities. The main contraindication to influenza vaccination is a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to egg or other components of the vaccine. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome within 6 weeks following a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered to be a precaution for use of influenza vaccines (77). * US Department of Health and Human Services.

Federal Register 2011;76:51631-3.Recommendations and Reports 10 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7Recommendations Vaccination Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months who have no medical contraindication; therefore, vaccination of all HCP who have no contraindications is recommended. The influenza vaccine is evaluated annually with one or more vaccine strains updated almost every year. In addition, antibody titers decline during the year after vaccination. Thus, annual vaccination with the current season's formulation is recommended. Annual vaccination is appropriate and safe to begin as early in the season as vaccine is available. HCP should be among the groups considered for prioritized receipt of influenza vaccines when vaccine supply is limited. T wo types of influenza vaccines are available. LAIV is administered intranasally and is licensed for use in healthy nonpregnant persons aged 2-49 years. The trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) is administered as an intramuscular injection and can be given to any person aged 6 months. Both vaccine types contain vaccine virus strains that are selected to stimulate a protective immune response against the wild-type viruses that are thought to be most likely in circulation during the upcoming season. Use of LAIV for HCP who care for patients housed in protective inpatient environments has been a theoretic concern, but transmission of LAIV in health-care settings has not been reported. LAIV can be used for HCP who work in any setting, except those who care for severely immunocompromised hospitalized persons who require care in a protective environment. HCP who themselves have a condition that confers high risk for influenza complications, who are pregnant, or who are aged 50 years should not receive LAIV and should be administered TIV instead. An inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 60 mcg of hemagglutinin antigen per influenza vaccine virus strain (Fluzone High-Dose [sanofi pasteur]) is an alternative inactivated vaccine for persons aged 65 years. Persons aged 65 years may be administered any of the standard-dose TIV preparations or Fluzone High-Dose (77). The majority of TIV preparations are administered intramuscularly. An intradermally administered TIV was licensed in May 2011 and is an alternative to other TIV preparations for persons aged 18-64 years (131). Use of Antiviral Drugs for Treating Exposed Persons and Controlling Outbreaks Use of antiviral drugs for chemoprophylaxis or treatment of influenza is an adjunct to (but not a substitute for) vaccination. Oseltamivir or zanamivir are recommended currently for chemoprophylaxis or treatment of influenza ( 132,133). TIV can be administered to exposed, unvaccinated HCP at the same time as chemoprophylaxis, but LAIV should be avoided because the antiviral medication will prevent viral replication needed to stimulate a vaccine response ( 77). Antivirals are used often among patients during outbreaks in closed settings such as long-term-care facilities but also can be administered to unvaccinated HCP during outbreaks, when an exposure to a person with influenza occurs, or after exposure when vaccination is not thought to be protective against the strain to which a vaccinated HCP was exposed. Chemoprophylaxis consists of 1 dose (of either antiviral drug) daily for 10 days, and treatment consists of 1 dose twice daily for 5 days. In many instances of HCP exposure, watchful waiting and early initiation of treatment if symptoms appear is preferred rather than use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis immediately after exposure. The intensity and duration of the exposure and the underlying health status of the exposed worker are important factors in clinical judgments about whether to provide chemoprophylaxis. If chemoprophylaxis is used, the provider should base choice of the agent on whether the circulating strain or strains of influenza have demonstrated resistance to particular antivirals. Program Evaluation Health-care administrators should include influenza vaccination coverage among HCP as a measure of quality of care (124). Influenza vaccination rates among HCP within facilities should be regularly measured and reported, and ward-, unit-, and specialty-specific coverage rates should be provided to staff and administration ( 124). Such information might be useful to promote compliance with vaccination policies. Measles Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Measles is a highly contagious rash illness that is transmitted by respiratory droplets and airborne spread. Severe complications, which might result in death, include pneumonia and encephalitis. Before the national measles vaccination program was implemented in 1963, almost every person acquired measles before adulthood; an estimated 3-4 million persons in the United States acquired measles each year ( 134). Approximately 500,000 persons were reported to have had measles annually, of whom 500 persons died, 48,000 were Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 11hospitalized, and another 1,000 had permanent brain damage from measles encephalitis (134). Through a successful 2-dose measles vaccination program (i.e., a first dose at age 12-15 months and a second dose between ages 4-6 years) ( 135) and better measles control throughout the region of the Americas ( 136), endemic transmission of measles was interrupted in the United States, and measles was declared eliminated from the country in 2000 (137). However, measles remains widespread in the majority of countries outside the Western Hemisphere, with an estimated 20 million measles cases occurring worldwide ( 138) and approximately 164,000 related deaths ( 139). Thus, the United States continues to experience international importations that might lead to transmission among U.S. residents and limited outbreaks, especially in unvaccinated populations (140-143). During 2001-2008, a total of 557 confirmed measles cases were reported in the United States from 37 states and the District of Columbia (annual median: 56; range: 37 in 2004 to 140 in 2008), representing an annual incidence of less than one case per million population ( 144). Of the 557 reported case-patients, 126 (23%) were hospitalized (annual median: 16; range: 5-29); of these, at least five case-patients were admitted to intensive care. T wo deaths were reported, both in 2003 (144). Of the 557 reported case-patients during 2001-2008, a total of 223 (40%) were adults, including 156 (28%) aged 20-39 years and 67 (12%) aged 40 years. Of the 438 measles cases among U.S. residents, 285 (65%) cases were considered preventable (i.e., occurred among persons who were eligible for vaccination but were unvaccinated) ( 144). The remaining 153 (35%) cases were considered nonpreventable. Cases were defined as nonpreventable if they occurred among U.S. resident case-patients who had received 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, if patients were vaccinated as recommended if traveling internationally, or if they were not vaccinated but had other evidence of immunity (i.e., were born before 1957 and therefore presumed immune from natural disease in childhood, had laboratory evidence of immunity, or had documentation of physician-diagnosed disease) or for whom vaccination is not recommended. During 2001-2008, a total of 12.5% (one of eight) of measles cases reported to CDC among HCP occurred in persons born before 1957; the other seven cases occurred among HCP born after 1957. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination policies have been enforced with variable success in United States health-care facilities over the past decade. Even though medical settings were a primary site of measles transmission during the 1989-1991 measles resurgence ( 145,146 ), as of September 2011, only three states (New York, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island) had laws mandating that all hospital personnel have proof of measles immunity and did not allow for religious or philosophic exemptions (147). Vaccine coverage in the United States is high; in 2010, a total of 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine (21); during 2009-2010, a total of 94.8% of kindergartners had evidence of 2 doses ( 148); and in 2010, a total of 90.5% of adolescents had evidence of 2 doses ( 22). Nationally representative data on MMR vaccine coverage of U.S. HCP are not available. Measles Transmission and the Costs of Mitigating Measles Exposures in Health-Care Settings Health-care-associated cases of measles are of public health concern. Because of the severity of measles, infected persons are likely to seek medical care in primary health-care facilities, emergency departments, or hospitals (141,149,150). Medical settings played a prominent role in perpetuating outbreaks of measles transmission during the 1989-1991 measles resurgence (145,146 ) and were a primary site of measles transmission in a health-care-associated outbreak in 2008 ( 149). During 2001- 2008, a total of 27 reported measles cases were transmitted in U.S. health-care facilities, accounting for 5% of all reported U.S. measles cases. Because of the greater opportunity for exposure, HCP are at higher risk than the general population for becoming infected with measles. A study conducted in 1996 in medical facilities in a county in Washington state indicated that HCP were 19 times more likely to develop measles than other adults ( 151). During 2001-2008, in the 23 health-care settings in which measles transmission was reported, eight cases occurred among HCP , six (75%) of whom were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. One health-care provider was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for 6 days from severe measles complications (142). During a health-care-associated measles outbreak in Arizona in 2008 with 14 cases, six cases were acquired in hospitals, and one was acquired in an outpatient setting. One unvaccinated health-care worker developed measles and infected a hospital emergency room patient who required intensive care following hospital admission for measles (149). High costs also are involved in evaluating and containing exposures and outbreaks in health-care facilities, as well as a substantial disruption of regular hospital routines when control measures are instituted, especially if hospitals do not have readily available data on the measles immunity status Recommendations and Reports 12 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7of their staff and others included in the facility vaccination program. In 2005 in Indiana, one hospital spent more than $113,000 responding to a measles outbreak ( 142), and in 2008 in Arizona, two hospitals spent $799,136 responding to and containing cases in their facilities ( 149). The Arizona outbreak response required rapid review of measles documentation of 14,844 HCP at seven hospitals and emergency vaccination of approximately 4,500 HCP who lacked documentation of measles immunity. Serologic testing at two hospitals among 1,583 HCP without documented history of vaccination or without documented laboratory evidence of measles immunity revealed that 138 (9%) of these persons lacked measles IgG antibodies (149). Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies, and Vaccine Safety Vaccine Effectiveness MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles with a 1-dose vaccine effectiveness of 95% when administered on or after age 12 months and a 2-dose vaccine effectiveness of 99% (135). Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies T wo doses of live measles vaccine are considered to provide long-lasting immunity ( 135). Although antibody levels decline following vaccination, a study examining neutralizing antibody levels up to 10 years following the second dose of MMR vaccine in children indicates that antibodies remain above the level considered protective (152). Studies among HCP in the United States during the measles resurgence in the late 1980s through early 1990s demonstrated that 4%-10% of all HCP lacked measles IgG antibodies (153-156). During the 2008 Arizona outbreak, of the 1,077 health-care providers born during or after 1957 without documented measles immunity, 121 (11%) were seronegative (149). In a study of measles seroprevalence among 469 newly hired HCP at a hospital in North Carolina who were born before 1957, and thus considered immune by age, who could not provide written evidence of immunity to measles, serologic testing indicated that six (1.3%) lacked measles IgG antibodies (157). Other serologic studies of hospital-based HCP indicate that 2%-9% of those born before 1957 lacked antibodies to measles (156,158-160). A survey conducted during 1999- 2004 found a seroprevalence of measles antibodies of 95.9% among persons in the U.S. population aged 6-49 years ( 161). The survey indicated that the lowest prevalence, 92.4%, was among adults born during 1967-1976 (161). A 1999 study of U.S. residents aged 20 years determined that 93% had antibodies to measles virus (162). Vaccine Safety Measles vaccine is administered in combination with the mumps and rubella components as the MMR vaccine in the United States. Monovalent measles vaccine rarely has been used in the United States in the past 2 decades and is no longer available. After decades of use, evidence demonstrates that MMR vaccine has an excellent safety profile (134). The majority of documented adverse events occur in children. In rare circumstances, MMR vaccination of adults has been associated with the following adverse events: anaphylaxis (approximately 1.0-3.5 occurrences per million doses administered) ( 134), thrombocytopenia from the measles component or rubella component (a rate of three to four cases for every 100,000 doses) (134), and acute arthritis from the rubella component (arthralgia develops among approximately 25% of rubella-susceptible postpubertal females after MMR vaccination, and approximately 10% have acute arthritis-like signs and symptoms) (135). When joint symptoms occur, they generally persist for 1 day-3 weeks and rarely recur ( 135). Chronic joint symptoms attributable to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine are reported very rarely, if they occur at all. Evidence does not support an association between MMR vaccination and any of the following: hearing loss, retinopathy, optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, or autism (135,163-169). A woman can excrete the rubella vaccine virus in breast milk and transmit the virus to her infant, but the infection remains asymptomatic (135). Otherwise, persons who receive MMR or its component vaccines do not transmit measles, rubella, or mumps vaccine viruses (135). No transmission of MMR vaccine virus in a health-care setting has been documented. Recommendations Vaccination All persons who work in health-care facilities should have presumptive evidence of immunity to measles. This information should be documented and readily available at the work location. Recently vaccinated HCP do not require any restriction in their work activities. Presumptive evidence of immunity to measles for persons who work in health-care facilities includes any of the following: Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 13 written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of live measles or MMR vaccine administered at least 28 days apart, laboratory evidence of immunity,\u00a7 laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957.\u00b6 Prevaccination Testing Prevaccination antibody screening before MMR vaccination for an employee who does not have adequate presumptive evidence of immunity is not necessary unless the medical facility considers it cost effective ( 134,170-172 ) although no recent studies have been conducted. For HCP who have 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to measles, serologic testing for immunity is not recommended. In the event that a HCP who has 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine is tested serologically and determined to have negative or equivocal measles titer results, it is not recommended that the person receive an additional dose of MMR vaccine. Such persons should be considered to have presumptive evidence of measles immunity. Documented age-appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of subsequent serologic testing. Because rapid vaccination is necessary to halt disease transmission, during outbreaks of measles, serologic screening before vaccination is not recommended. Use of Vaccine and Immune Globulin for Treating Exposed Persons and Controlling Outbreaks Following airborne infection-control precautions and implementing other infection-control measures are important to control the spread of measles but might fail to prevent all nosocomial transmission, because transmission to other susceptible persons might occur before illness is recognized. Persons infected with measles are infectious 4 days before rash onset through 4 days after rash onset. When a person who is suspected of having measles visits a health-care facility, airborne infection-control precautions should be followed stringently. The patient should be asked immediately to wear a medical mask and should be placed in an airborne-infection isolation room (i.e., a negative air-pressure room) as soon as possible. If an airborne-infection isolation room is not available, the patient should be placed in a private room with the door closed and be asked to wear a mask. If possible, only staff with presumptive evidence of immunity should enter the room of a person with suspect or confirmed measles. Regardless of presumptive immunity status, all staff entering the room should use respiratory protection consistent with airborne infection-control precautions (i.e., use of an N95 respirator or a respirator with similar effectiveness in preventing airborne transmission) (3,150). Because of the possibility, albeit low (~1%), of measles vaccine failure in HCP exposed to infected patients ( 173), all HCP should observe airborne precautions in caring for patients with measles. HCP in whom measles occurs should be excluded from work until 4 days following rash onset. Contacts with measles-compatible symptoms should be isolated, and appropriate infection-control measures (e.g., rapid vaccination of susceptible contacts) should be implemented to prevent further spread (174). If measles exposures occur in a health-care facility, all contacts should be evaluated immediately for presumptive evidence of measles immunity. HCP without evidence of immunity should be offered the first dose of MMR vaccine and excluded from work from day 5-21 following exposure ( 135). HCP without evidence of immunity who are not vaccinated after exposure should be removed from all patient contact and excluded from the facility from day 5 after their first exposure through day 21 after the last exposure, even if they have received postexposure intramuscular immune globulin of 0.25 mL/kg (40 mg IgG/kg) (135). Those with documentation of 1 vaccine dose may remain at work and should receive the second dose. Case-patient contacts who do not have presumptive evidence of measles immunity should be vaccinated, offered intramuscular immune globulin of 0.25 mL/kg (40 mg IgG/kg), which is the standard dosage for nonimmunocompromised persons ( 135), or quarantined until 21 days after their exposure to the case-patient. Contacts with measles-compatible symptoms should be isolated, and appropriate infection-control measures should be implemented to prevent further spread. If immune globulin is administered to an exposed person, observations should continue for signs and symptoms of measles for 28 days after exposure because immune globulin might prolong the incubation period. Available data suggest that live virus measles vaccine, if administered within 72 hours of measles exposure, will prevent, or modify disease (134). Even if it is too late to provide effective postexposure prophylaxis by administering MMR, the vaccine can provide protection against future exposure to all three infections. Identifying persons who lack evidence of measles immunity during The first dose of measles-containing vaccine should be administered on or after the first birthday; the second dose should be administered no earlier than 28 days after the first dose. \u00a7 Measles immunoglobulin (IgG) in the serum; equivocal results should be considered negative. \u00b6 The majority of persons born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and may be presumed immune, depending on current state or local requirements. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles.Recommendations and Reports 14 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7contact investigations provides a good opportunity to offer MMR vaccine to protect against measles as well as mumps and rubella, not only for HCP who are part of an organization's vaccination program, but also for patients and visitors. If an exposed person is already incubating measles, MMR vaccination will not exacerbate symptoms. In these circumstances, persons should be advised that a measles-like illness occurring shortly after vaccination could be attributable either to natural infection or to the vaccine strain. In such circumstances, specimens should be submitted for viral strain identification. Mumps Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Mumps is an acute viral infection characterized by fever and inflammation of the salivary glands (usually parotitis) ( 175). The spectrum of illness ranges from subclinical infection (20%-40%) to nonspecific respiratory illness, sialadenitis including classic parotitis, deafness, orchitis, and meningoencephalitis; severity increases with age ( 175). In the prevaccine era, mumps was a common childhood illness, with approximately 186,000 mumps cases reported in the United States per year ( 176). After the introduction of the Jeryl Lynn strain mumps vaccine in 1967 and the implementation of the 1-dose mumps vaccine policy for children in 1977 ( 177), reports of mumps cases in the United States declined 99% ( 178). During 1986-1987, an increase in reported mumps cases occurred, primarily affecting unvaccinated adolescents and young adults. In the late 1980s, sporadic outbreaks continued to occur that affected both unvaccinated and 1-dose vaccinated adolescents and young adults (178). In 1989, a second dose of MMR vaccine was recommended nationwide for better measles control among school-aged children ( 179). Historically low rates of mumps followed with only several hundred reported cases per year in the United States during 2000-2005. In 1998, a national goal to eliminate mumps was set for 2010 (180). However, in 2006, a total of 6,584 mumps cases were reported in the United States, the largest U.S. mumps outbreak in nearly 20 years ( 181-183 ). Whereas overall national mumps incidence was 2.2 per 100,000 population, eight states in the Midwest were the most affected, with 2.5-66.1 cases per 100,000 population ( 183). The highest incidence (31.1 cases per 100,000 population) was among persons aged 18-24 years (e.g., college-aged students), the majority of whom had received 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Of the 4,017 case-patients for whom age and vaccination status were known, 1,786 (44%) were aged 25 years (incidence: 7.2 cases per 100,000 persons); of these 1,786 patients, 351 (20%) received at least 2 doses, 444 (25%) received 1 dose, 336 (19%) were unvaccinated, and 655 (37%) had unknown vaccination status. Since the 2006 resurgence, two additional large U.S. mumps outbreaks have occurred, both during 2009-2010, one among members of a religious community with cases occurring throughout the northeastern United States ( 184) and the other in Guam (185); both outbreaks primarily affected children and adolescents in crowded environments who had received 2 doses of vaccine. Vaccine coverage in the United States is high; in 2010, approximately 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine ( 21); during 2009-2010, a total of 94.8% of kindergartners had evidence of 2 doses ( 148). In 2010, a total of 90.5% of adolescents had evidence of 2 doses (22). Nationally representative data on MMR vaccine coverage of U.S. HCP are not available. Mumps Transmission and the Costs of Mitigating Mumps Exposures in Health-care Settings Although health-care-associated transmission of mumps is infrequent, it might be underreported because of the high percentage (~20%-40%) of infected persons who might be asymptomatic ( 186-189). In a survey of 9,299 adults in different professions conducted in 1968, before vaccine was used routinely, the rate of mumps acquisition was highest among dentists and HCP , with rates of 18% among dentists and 15% among physicians (37% for pediatricians), compared with 9% among primary and secondary school teachers and 2% among university staff members (190). In the postvaccine era, mumps transmission also has been documented in medical settings ( 191-193). During a Tennessee mumps outbreak during 1986-1987, a total of 17 (12%) of 146 hospitals and three (50%) of six long-term-care facilities reported one or more practices that could contribute to the spread of mumps, including not isolating patients with mumps, assigning susceptible staff to care for patients with mumps, and not immunizing susceptible employees. Health-care-associated transmission resulted in six cases of mumps infections among health-care providers and nine cases of mumps infections among patients ( 191). In Utah in 1994, two health-care providers in a hospital developed mumps after they had contact with an infected patient (192). During the 2006 outbreak, one health-care facility in Chicago experienced ongoing mumps transmission lasting 4 weeks (193). During the 2006 multistate U.S. outbreak, 144 (8.5%) of 1,705 adult case-patients in Iowa for whom occupation was known were health-care providers (Iowa Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 2006). Whether transmission occurred from patients, coworkers, or persons in Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 15the community is unknown. During the 2009-2010 outbreak in the northeastern region of the United States, seven (0.2%) of the 3,400 case-patients were health-care providers, six of whom likely were infected by patients because they had no other known exposure. Exposures to mumps in health-care settings also can result in added economic costs because of furlough or reassignment of staff members from patient-care duties or closure of wards (194). In 2006, a Kansas hospital spent $98,682 containing a mumps outbreak ( 195). During a mumps outbreak in Chicago in 2006, one health-care facility spent $262,788 controlling the outbreak (193). Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies, and Vaccine Safety Vaccine Effectiveness MMR vaccine has a 1-dose vaccine effectiveness of 79%-95% (199-202). In a study conducted on two Iowa college campuses during the 2006 mumps outbreak among a population that was primarily vaccinated with 2 doses, 2-dose vaccine effectiveness ranged from 79% to 88% (202). Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies Mumps antibody levels wane over time following the first or second dose of vaccination ( 203,204), but the correlates of immunity to mumps are poorly understood and the significance of these waning antibody levels is unclear. A study on a university campus in Nebraska in 2006 indicated lower levels of mumps neutralizing antibodies among students who had been vaccinated with a second MMR dose >15 years previously than among those who had been vaccinated 1-5 years previously, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05) ( 205). In a 2006 study on a university campus in Kansas, students with mumps were more likely to have received a second dose of MMR vaccine 10 years previously than were their roommates without mumps ( 206). However, another 2006 study from an Iowa college campus identified no such association (202). During 1999-2004, national seroprevalence for mumps antibodies for persons aged was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.8-91.1) ( 207). In the Nebraska study, 414 (94%) of the 440 participants were seropositive for mumps antibodies ( 205). A study in Kansas in 2006 indicated that 13% of hospital employees lacked antibodies to the mumps virus (195). In a recent study on mumps seroprevalence among 381 newly hired health-care personnel at a hospital in North Carolina who were born before 1957 and thus considered immune by age and who could not provide written evidence of immunity to mumps, serologic testing indicated that 14 (3.7%) lacked IgG antibodies to mumps (157). Vaccine Safety Mumps vaccine is administered in combination with the measles and rubella components as the MMR vaccine in the United States. Monovalent mumps vaccine has rarely been used in the United States in the past 2 decades and is no longer available. After decades of use, evidence demonstrates that MMR vaccine has an excellent safety profile. The most common adverse reactions to the mumps component of the MMR vaccine are parotitis 10-14 days after vaccination and low-grade fever (175). On the basis of biologic plausibility, orchitis, arthritis, or sensorineural deafness might rarely follow vaccination ( 175). The majority of documented adverse events occur in children. In rare circumstances, MMR vaccination of adults has been associated with anaphylaxis (approximately 1.0-3.5 occurrences per million doses administered) ( 134), thrombocytopenia from the measles component or rubella component (rate: three to four cases for every 100,000 doses) (134), and acute arthritis from the rubella component (arthralgia develops among approximately 25% of rubella-susceptible postpubertal females after MMR vaccination, and approximately 10% have acute arthritis-like signs and symptoms) ( 135). When joint symptoms occur, they generally persist for 1 day-3 weeks and rarely recur ( 135). Chronic joint symptoms attributable to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine are reported rarely, if they occur at all. Evidence does not support a link between MMR vaccination and hearing loss, retinopathy, optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, or autism (135,163-169). A woman can excrete the rubella vaccine virus in breast milk and transmit the virus to her infant, but the infection remains asymptomatic (135). Otherwise, persons who receive MMR or its component vaccines do not transmit measles, rubella, or mumps vaccine viruses (135). No transmission of MMR vaccine virus in a health-care setting has been documented. Recommendations Vaccination All persons who work in health-care facilities should have presumptive evidence of immunity to mumps. This information should be documented and readily available at the work location. Recently vaccinated HCP do not require any restriction in their work activities. Presumptive evidence of immunity to mumps for persons who work in health-care facilities includes any of the following: Recommendations and Reports 16 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of live mumps or MMR vaccine administered at least 28 days apart,** laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957.\u00a7\u00a7 Prevaccination Testing For HCP who do not have adequate presumptive evidence of mumps immunity, prevaccination antibody screening before MMR vaccination is not necessary (135,175 ). For HCP who have 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to mumps, serologic testing for immunity is not recommended. In the event that a health-care provider who has 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine is tested serologically and determined to have negative or equivocal mumps titer results, it is not recommended that the person receive an additional dose of MMR vaccine. Such persons should be considered immune to mumps. Documented age-appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of subsequent serologic testing. Likewise, during outbreaks of mumps, serologic screening before vaccination is not recommended because rapid vaccination is necessary to halt disease transmission. Controlling Mumps Outbreaks in Health-Care Settings Placing patients in droplet precautions and implementing other infection-control measures is important to control the spread of mumps but might fail to prevent all nosocomial transmission, because transmission to other susceptible persons might occur before illness is recognized (208). When a person suspected of having mumps visits a health-care facility, only HCP with adequate presumptive evidence of immunity should be exposed to the person, and in addition to standard precautions, droplet precautions should be followed. The index case-patient should be isolated, and respiratory precautions (gown and gloves) should be used for patient contact. Negative pressure rooms are not required. The patient should be isolated for 5 days after the onset of parotitis, during which time shedding of virus is likely to occur (209). If mumps exposures occur in a health-care facility, all contacts should be evaluated for evidence of mumps immunity. HCP with no evidence of mumps immunity who are exposed to patients with mumps should be offered the first dose of MMR vaccine as soon as possible, but vaccine can be administered at any interval following exposure; they should be excluded from duty from day 12 after the first unprotected exposure through day 25 after the most recent exposure. HCP with documentation of 1 vaccine dose may remain at work and should receive the second dose. HCP with mumps should be excluded from work for 5 days from the onset of parotitis ( 209). Antibody response to the mumps component of MMR vaccine generally is believed not to develop soon enough to provide effective prophylaxis after exposure to suspected mumps ( 191,210 ), but data are insufficient to rule out a prophylactic effect. Nonetheless, the vaccine is not recommended for prophylactic purposes after exposure. However, identifying persons who lack presumptive evidence of mumps immunity during contact investigations provides a good opportunity to offer MMR vaccine to protect against mumps as well as measles and rubella, not only for HCP who are part of an organization's vaccination program, but also for patients and visitors. If an exposed person already is incubating mumps, MMR vaccination will not exacerbate the symptoms. In these circumstances persons should be advised that a mumps-like illness occurring shortly after vaccination is likely to be attributable to natural infection. In such circumstances, specimens should be submitted for viral strain identification to differentiate between vaccine and wild type virus. Immune globulin is not routinely used for postexposure protection from mumps because no evidence exists that it is effective (135). Rubella Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Rubella (German measles) is a viral disease characterized by rash, low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise (211). Although rubella is considered a benign disease, transient arthralgia and arthritis are observed commonly in infected adults, particularly among postpubertal females. Chronic arthritis has been reported after rubella infection, but such reports are rare, and evidence of an association is weak ( 212). Other complications that occur infrequently ** The first dose of mumps-containing vaccine should be administer ed on or after the first birthday; the second dose should be administered no earlier than 28 days after the first dose. Mumps immunoglobulin (IgG) in the serum; equivocal results should be considered negative. \u00a7\u00a7 The majority of persons born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally between birth and 1977, the year that mumps vaccination was recommended for routine use, and may be presumed immune, even if they have not had clinically recognizable mumps disease. (This might vary depending on current state or local requirements.) For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of mumps immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval; for unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of mumps immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of mumps.Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 17are thrombocytopenia and encephalitis 211). Infection is asymptomatic in 25%-50% of cases ( 213). Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable and should not be considered in assessing immune status. Many rash illnesses might mimic rubella infection and many rubella infections are unrecognized. The only reliable evidence of previous rubella infection is the presence of serum rubella IgG antibody (211). Of primary concern are the effects that rubella can have when a pregnant woman becomes infected, especially during the first trimester, which can result in miscarriages, stillbirths, therapeutic abortions, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), a constellation of birth defects that often includes blindness, deafness, mental retardation, and congenital heart defects ( 211,213 ). Postnatal rubella is transmitted direct or droplet contact from nasopharyngeal secretions. The incubation period ranges from 12 to 23 days ( 214,215). An ill person is most contagious when the rash first appears, but the period of maximal communicability extends from a few days before to 7 days after rash onset ( 213). Rubella is less contagious than measles. In the prevaccine era, rubella was an endemic disease globally with larger epidemics that occurred; in the United States, rubella epidemics occurred approximately every 7 years ( 211). During the 1964-1965 global rubella epidemic, an estimated 12.5 million cases of rubella occurred in the United States, resulting in approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis, 11,250 fetal deaths attributable to spontaneous or surgical abortions, 2,100 infants who were stillborn or died soon after birth, and 20,000 infants born with CRS. The economic impact of this epidemic in the United States alone was estimated at $1.5 billion in 1965 dollars ($10 billion in 2010 dollars) (216). After the rubella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1969, reported rubella cases decreased from 57,686 in 1969 to 12,491 in 1976 ( 216), and CRS cases reported nationwide decreased from 68 in 1970 to 23 in 1976 ( 217). Declines in rubella age-specific incidence occurred in all age groups, including adolescents and adults, but the greatest declines were among children aged <15 years ( 216). During 1977-1978, a resurgence of rubella occurred, primarily among older adolescents and young adults, because the initial vaccination strategy targeted children ( 218). During this resurgence, 62% of reported rubella cases occurred among persons aged >15 years compared with 23% of cases during 1966-1968 ( 135). As a result of the change in the epidemiologic profile of rubella, in 1977, ACIP modified its recommendations to include the vaccination of susceptible postpubertal girls and women. In 1989, a second MMR vaccination dose was recommended in response to large measles outbreaks nationwide ( 179). During 2001-2004, the annual numbers of rubella and CRS cases were extremely low, with 23 reported rubella cases in 2001, a total of 18 in 2002, a total of 7 in 2003, and a total of 9 in 2004 (219). Rubella was declared eliminated from the United States in 2004 (219,220). During 2005-2009, a total of 54 cases of rubella were reported; the majority of the cases occurred among persons aged >20 years. Of the reported cases, 23 (43%) were import-associated; only two outbreaks of rubella were reported during this time, and both involved only three cases (CDC, unpublished data, 2009). Since 2005, only four cases of CRS have been reported, with two cases reported in 2009; three (75%) cases were acquired internationally, and the other had an unknown source (CDC, unpublished data, 2009). Rubella importations are expected to continue in the immediate future. As of September 2011, only three states (i.e., New York, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island) had laws mandating that all hospital personnel have proof of rubella immunity and did not allow for religious or philosophical exemptions ( 147). Additional states had requirements for specific types of facilities or for certain employees within those facilities, but they did not have universal laws mandating proof of rubella immunity for all hospital personnel (147). MMR vaccine coverage in the United States is high; in 2010, an estimated 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine ( 21); during 2009-2010, a total of 94.8% of kindergarteners had evidence of 2 doses (148); and in 2010, a total of 90.5% of adolescents had evidence of 2 doses ( 22). Nationally representative data on MMR vaccine coverage of U.S. HCP are not available. Rubella Transmission and the Costs of Mitigating Rubella Exposures in Health-Care Settings No documented transmission of rubella to HCP or other hospital staff or patients in U.S. health-care facilities has occurred since elimination was declared. However, in the decades before elimination, rubella transmission was documented in at least 10 U.S. medical settings ( 221-231 ) and led to outbreaks with serious consequences, including pregnancy terminations, disruption of hospital routine, absenteeism from work, expensive containment measures, negative publicity, and the threat of litigation (232 ). In these outbreaks, transmission occurred from HCP to susceptible coworkers and patients, as well as from patients to HCP and other patients. No data are available on whether HCP are at increased risk for acquiring rubella compared with other professions.Recommendations and Reports 18 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies, and Vaccine Safety Vaccine Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness of the RA 27/3 rubella vaccine against clinical rubella is 95% (85%-99% >99% for clinical laboratory confirmed rubella ( 211,233). Antibody responses to rubella as part of MMR vaccine are equal (i.e., >99%) to those seen after the single-antigen RA 27/3 rubella vaccine (211,234). Duration of Immunity and Seroprevalence Studies In clinical trials, 97%-99% of susceptible persons who received a single dose of the RA 27/3 rubella vaccine when they were aged 12 months developed antibody ( 211,235,236 ). T wo studies have demonstrated that vaccine-induced rubella antibodies might wane after 12-15 years ( 237,238); however, rubella surveillance data do not indicate that rubella and CRS are increasing among vaccinated persons. National seroprevalence for rubella antibodies among persons aged 6-49 years during 1999-2004 was 91% ( 239). During 1986-1990, serologic surveys in one hospital indicated that 5% of HCP (including persons born in 1957 or earlier) did not have detectable rubella antibody ( 240). Earlier studies indicated that up to 14%-19% of U.S. hospital personnel, including young women of childbearing age, lacked detectable rubella antibody ( 225,241,242). In a recent study on rubella seroprevalence among 477 newly hired HCP at a hospital in North Carolina who were born before 1957, and thus considered immune by age, who could not provide written evidence of immunity to rubella, serologic testing revealed that 14 (3.1%) lacked detectable levels of antibody to rubella ( 157). Because of the potential for contact with pregnant women in any type of health-care facility, all HCP should have documented presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella. History of disease is not considered adequate evidence of immunity. Vaccine Safety Rubella vaccine is administered in combination with the measles and mumps components as the MMR vaccine in the United States. Monovalent rubella vaccine has been used rarely in the United States in the past 2 decades and is no longer available. After decades of use, evidence demonstrates that MMR vaccine has an excellent safety profile. The most common adverse reactions to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine are transient rashes, which usually appear 7-10 days after vaccination in approximately 5% of vaccinated persons, or transient lymphadenopathy, fever, sore throat, and headache (135,211).The majority of documented adverse events occur in children. In rare circumstances, MMR vaccination of adults has been associated with the following adverse events: anaphylaxis (approximately 1.0-3.5 occurrences per million doses administered) ( 134), thrombocytopenia from the measles component or rubella component (rate: three to four cases for every 100,000 doses) (134), and acute arthritis from the rubella component (arthralgia develops among approximately 25% of rubella-susceptible postpubertal females after MMR vaccination, and approximately 10% have acute arthritis-like signs and symptoms from the rubella component of the vaccine) (135). When joint symptoms occur, they generally persist for 1 day-3 weeks and rarely recur ( 135). Chronic joint symptoms attributable to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine are very rarely reported, if they occur at all. As a result of the theoretic risk to the fetus, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after receipt of a rubella-containing vaccine ( 243). However, receipt of rubella-containing vaccine during pregnancy should not be a reason to consider termination of pregnancy; data from 18 years of following to term 321 known rubella-susceptible women who were vaccinated within 3 months before or 3 months after conception indicated that none of the 324 infants born to these mothers had malformations compatible with congenital rubella syndrome, but five had evidence of subclinical rubella infection ( 244). The estimated risk for serious malformations to fetuses attributable to the mother receiving RA 27/3 vaccine is considered to range from zero to 1.6% (135,244). Evidence does not support a link between MMR vaccination and any of the following: hearing loss, retinopathy, optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, or autism (135,163-169). A woman can excrete the rubella vaccine virus in breast milk and transmit the virus to her infant, but the infection remains asymptomatic (135). Otherwise, persons who receive MMR or its component vaccines do not transmit measles, rubella, or mumps vaccine viruses (135). No transmission of MMR vaccine virus in a health-care setting has been documented. Recommendations Vaccination All persons who work in health-care facilities should have presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella. Adequate rubella vaccination for HCP consists of 1 dose of MMR vaccine. However, because of the 2-dose vaccination requirements for measles and mumps, the use of the combined MMR vaccine will result in the majority of HCP receiving 2 doses of rubella-containing vaccine, which should provide an additional safeguard Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 19against primary rubella vaccine failure. Recently vaccinated HCP do not require any restriction in their work activities. Presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella for persons who work in health-care facilities includes any of the following: written documentation of vaccination with 1 dose of live rubella or MMR vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity,\u00b6\u00b6 laboratory confirmation of rubella infection or disease, or birth before 195 7*** (e xcept wo men of ch ildbearing potential who could become pregnant, although pregnancy in this age group would be exceedingly rare ). Prevaccination Testing For HCP who do not have adequate presumptive evidence of rubella immunity, prevaccination antibody screening before MMR vaccination is not necessary unless the medical facility considers it cost effective ( 135). For HCP who have 1 documented dose of MMR vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to rubella, serologic testing for immunity is not recommended. In the event that a health-care provider who has at least 1 documented dose of rubella-containing vaccine is tested serologically and determined to have negative or equivocal rubella titer results, receipt of an additional dose of MMR vaccine for prevention of rubella is not recommended. Such persons should be considered immune to rubella. However, if the provider requires a second dose of measles or mumps vaccine, then a second dose of MMR should be administered. Documented age-appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of subsequent serologic testing. Likewise, during outbreaks of rubella, serologic screening before vaccination is not recommended because rapid vaccination is necessary to halt disease transmission. Controlling Rubella Outbreaks To prevent transmission of rubella in health-care settings, patients suspected to have rubella should be placed in private rooms. In addition to standard precautions, droplet precautions should be followed until 7 days after onset of symptoms. Room doors can remain open, and special ventilation is not required. Any exposed HCP who do not have adequate presumptive evidence of rubella immunity should be excluded from duty beginning 7 days after exposure to rubella and continuing through either 1) 23 days after the most recent exposure or 2) 7 days after rash appears if the provider develops rubella (213-215 ). Exposed HCP who do not have adequate presumptive evidence of immunity who are vaccinated postexposure should be excluded from duty for 23 days after the most recent exposure to rubella because no evidence exists that postexposure vaccination is effective in preventing rubella infection (244). Neither rubella-containing vaccine ( 244) nor immune globulin (IG) ( 211,244 is effective for postexposure prophylaxis of rubella. Although intramuscular administration of 20 mL of immune globulin within 72 hours of rubella exposure might reduce the risk for rubella, it will not eliminate the risk (135,245); infants with congenital rubella have been born to women who received IG shortly after exposure ( 213). In addition, administration of IG after exposure to rubella might modify or suppress symptoms and create an unwarranted sense of security with respect to transmission. If exposure to rubella does not cause infection, postexposure vaccination with MMR vaccine should induce protection against subsequent infection of rubella, as well as measles and mumps. If the exposure results in infection, no evidence indicates that administration of MMR vaccine during the presymptomatic or prodromal stage of illness increases the risk for vaccine-associated adverse events (213). Pertussis Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection. Secondary attack rates among susceptible household contacts exceed 80% (246,247). T ransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory secretions or large aerosolized droplets from the respiratory tract of infected persons. The incubation period is generally 7-10 days but can be as long as 21 days. The period of communicability starts with the onset of the catarrhal stage and extends into the paroxysmal stage. Symptoms of early pertussis (catarrhal phase) are indistinguishable from other upper respiratory infections. Vaccinated adolescents and adults, whose immunity from childhood vaccinations wanes 5-10 years after the most recent dose of vaccine (usually administered at age 4-6 years), are an \u00b6\u00b6 Rubella immunoglobulin (IgG) in the serum; equivocal results should be considered negative. *** Depending on current state or local requirements, for unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of infection or disease, health-care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with one dose of MMR vaccine; for unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of infection or disease, health-care facilities should recommend 1 dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of rubella. Because rubella can occur in some persons born before 1957 and because congenital rubella and congenital rubella syndrome can occur in the offspring of women infected with rubella virus during pregnancy, birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity for women who could become pregnant.Recommendations and Reports 20 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7important source of pertussis infection for susceptible infants. Infants too young to be vaccinated are at greatest risk for severe pertussis, including hospitalization and death. The disease can be transmitted from adults to close contacts, especially unvaccinated children. Vaccination coverage among infants and children for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine remains high. In 2010, coverage for children aged 19-35 months who have received 4 doses of DTaP/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP)/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (DT) was 84% ( 21). Among children entering kindergarten for the 2009-2010 school year, DTaP coverage was 93% ( 148). Vaccination coverage for tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was 68.7% among adolescents in 2010 and <7% among adults in 2009 (22,248). Tdap vaccination coverage among HCP was 17.0% in 2009 (248). Disease in Health-Care Settings and Impact on Health- Care Personnel and Patients In hospital settings, transmission of pertussis has occurred from hospital visitors to patients, from HCP to patients, and from patients to HCP ( 249-252). Although of limited size (range: 2-17 patients and 5-13 staff), documented outbreaks were costly and disruptive. In each outbreak, HCP were evaluated for cough illness and required diagnostic testing, prophylactic antibiotics, and exclusion from work. During outbreaks that occur in hospitals, the risk for contracting pertussis among patients or staff is often difficult to quantify because exposure is not well defined. Serologic studies conducted among hospital staff indicate that exposure to pertussis is much more frequent than suggested by attack rates of clinical disease ( 246,249-254 ). In one outbreak, seroprevalence of pertussis agglutinating antibodies among HCP correlated with the degree of patient contact and was highest among pediatric house staff (82%) and ward nurses (71%) and lowest among nurses with administrative responsibilities (35%) (251). A model to estimate the cost of vaccinating HCP and the net return from preventing nosocomial pertussis was constructed using probabilistic methods and a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 HCP with direct patient contact followed for 10 years (255). Baseline assumptions, determined from data in the literature, included incidence of pertussis in HCP , ratio of identified exposures per HCP case, symptomatic percentage of seroconfirmed pertussis infections in HCP , cost of infection-control measures per exposed person, vaccine efficacy, vaccine coverage, employment turnover rate, adverse events, and cost of vaccine ( 255). In a 10-year period, the cost of infection control would be $388,000 without Tdap vaccination of HCP compared with $69,000 with such a program ( 255). Introduction of a vaccination program would result in a net savings as high as $535,000 and a benefit-cost ratio of 2.38 (i.e., for every dollar spent on the vaccination program, the hospital would save $2.38 on control measures) (255). Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety A prelicensure immunogenicity and safety study in adolescents and adults of a vaccine containing acellular pertussis estimated vaccine efficacy to be 92% ( 256). Recent postlicensure studies of Tdap demonstrate vaccine effectiveness at 78% and 66% ( 257,258). Duration of immunity from vaccination has yet to be evaluated. Data from pre- and postlicensure studies support the safety of Tdap in adolescents and adults (259-263). Since the 2005 Tdap recommendations for HCP , one study tried to determine if postexposure prophylaxis following pertussis exposure was necessary for Tdap-vaccinated HCP ( 264). During the study period, 116 exposures occurred among 94 HCP . Pertussis infection occurred in 2% of those who received postexposure prophylaxis compared with 10% of those who did not, suggesting a possible benefit of postexposure prophylaxis among Tdap-vaccinated HCP suboptimal among HCP , and the duration of protection afforded by Tdap is unknown, vaccination status does not change the approach to evaluate the need for postexposure prophylaxis in exposed HCP . Postexposure prophylaxis is necessary for HCP in contact with persons at risk for severe disease. Other HCP either should receive postexposure prophylaxis or be monitored for 21 days after pertussis exposure and treated at the onset of signs and symptoms of pertussis. Recommended postexposure prophylaxis antibiotics for HCP exposed to pertussis include azithromycin, clarithroymycin, or erythromycin. HCP are not at greater risk for diphtheria or tetanus than the general population. Recommendations Vaccination Regardless of age, HCP should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap and regardless of the time since their most recent Td vaccination. Vaccinating HCP with Tdap will protect them against pertussis and is expected to reduce transmission to patients, other HCP , household members, and persons in the community. Tdap is not licensed for multiple administrations; therefore, after receipt of Tdap, HCP should receive Td for future booster vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria. Hospitals and ambulatory-care facilities should provide Tdap for HCP and Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 21use approaches that maximize vaccination rates (e.g., education about the benefits of vaccination, convenient access, and the provision of Tdap at no charge). Prevaccination Testing Prevaccination serologic testing is not recommended. Demonstrating Immunity Immunity cannot be demonstrated through serologic testing because serologic correlates of protection are not well established. Controlling Pertussis Outbreaks in Health-Care Settings Prevention of pertussis transmission in health-care settings involves diagnosis and early treatment of clinical cases, droplet isolation of infectious patients who are hospitalized, exclusion from work of HCP who are infectious, and postexposure prophylaxis. Early diagnosis of pertussis, before secondary transmission occurs, is difficult because the disease is highly communicable during the catarrhal stage, when symptoms are still nonspecific. Pertussis should be considered in the differential diagnoses for any patient with an acute cough illness with severe or prolonged paroxysmal cough, particularly if characterized by posttussive vomiting, whoop, or apnea. Nasopharyngeal specimens should be taken, if possible, from the posterior nasopharynx with a calcium alginate or Dacron swab for cultures and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Health-care facilities should maximize efforts to prevent transmission of Bordetella pertussis. Precautions to prevent respiratory droplet transmission or spread by close or direct contact should be employed in the care of patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed pertussis ( 265). These precautions should remain in effect until patients are improved clinically and have completed at least 5 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. HCP in whom symptoms (i.e., unexplained rhinitis or acute cough) develop after known pertussis exposure might be at risk for transmitting pertussis and should be excluded from work until 5 days after the start of appropriate therapy (3). Data on the need for postexposure prophylaxis in Tdap- vaccinated HCP are inconclusive ( 264). Certain vaccinated HCP are still at risk for B. pertussis. Tdap might not preclude the need for postexposure prophylaxis. Postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for all HCP who have unprotected exposure to pertussis and are likely to expose a patient at risk for severe pertussis (e.g., hospitalized neonates and pregnant women). Other HCP should either receive postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis or be monitored daily for 21 days after pertussis exposure and treated at the onset of signs and symptoms of pertussis. Varicella Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Varicella is a highly infectious disease caused by primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV is transmitted from person to person by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid of skin lesions of varicella or herpes zoster (HZ), a localized, generally painful vesicular rash commonly called shingles, or infected respiratory tract secretions that also might be aerosolized (266). The average incubation period is 14-16 days after exposure to rash (range: 10-21 days). Infected persons are contagious an estimated 1-2 days before rash onset until all lesions are crusted, typically 4-7 days after rash onset (266). Varicella secondary attack rates can reach 90% among susceptible contacts. Typically, primary infection with VZV results in lifetime immunity. VZV remains dormant in sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing HZ. Before the U.S. childhood varicella vaccination program began in 1995, approximately 90% of varicella disease occurred among children aged <15 years ( 266). During 1997-2009, national varicella vaccine coverage among children aged 19-35 months increased from 27% to 90%, leading to dramatic declines of >85% in varicella incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths ( 267-269 ). The decline in disease incidence was greatest among children for whom vaccination was recommended; however, declines occurred in every age group including infants too young to be vaccinated and adults, indicating reduced communitywide transmission of VZV. Current incidence of varicella among adults is low (<0.1/1,000 population), and adult cases represent <10% of all reported varicella cases ( 270). National seroprevalence data from 1999-2004 demonstrated that, in the early vaccine era, adults continued to have high immunity to varicella ( 271). In this study, 98% of persons aged 20-49 years had VZV-specific IgG antibodies. However, with declining likelihood of exposure to VZV, children and adolescents who did not receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine could remain susceptible to VZV infection as they age into adulthood, when varicella can be more severe. The clinical presentation of varicella has changed since the implementation of the varicella vaccination program, with more than half of varicella cases reported in 2008 occurring among persons who were vaccinated previously, the majority of them children. Varicella disease in vaccinated children (breakthrough varicella) usually has a modified or atypical presentation; the rash is typically mild, with <50 lesions that are Recommendations and Reports 22 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7more likely to be predominantly maculopapular than vesicular (266). Fever is less common, and the duration of illness is shorter. Nevertheless, breakthrough varicella is infectious. One study indicated that vaccinated children with varicella with <50 lesions were only one third as infectious as unvaccinated children whereas those with 50 lesions were as infectious as unvaccinated children (272). Because the majority of adults are immune and few need vaccination, fewer breakthrough cases have been reported among adults than among children, and breakthrough varicella in adults has tended to be milder than varicella in unvaccinated adults (273,274). The epidemiology of varicella in tropical and subtropical regions differs from that in the United States. In these regions, a higher proportion of VZV infections are acquired later in life. Persons emigrating from these regions might be more likely to be susceptible to varicella compared to U.S.-born persons and, therefore, are at a higher risk for developing varicella if unvaccinated and exposed (275,276). Disease in Health-Care Settings and Impact on Health- Care Personnel and Patients Although relatively rare in the United States since introduction of varicella vaccine, nosocomial transmission of VZV is well recognized and can be life-threatening to certain patients (277-289). In addition to hospital settings, nosocomial VZV transmission has been reported in long-term-care facilities and a hospital-associated residential facility (290,291). Sources of nosocomial exposure that have resulted in transmission include patients, HCP , and visitors with either varicella or HZ. Both localized and disseminated HZ in immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients have been identified as sources of nosocomial transmission of VZV. Localized HZ has been demonstrated to be much less infectious than varicella; disseminated HZ is considered to be as infectious as varicella ( 266). Nosocomial transmission has been attributed to delays in the diagnosis or reporting of varicella or HZ and in failures to implement control measures promptly. In hospitals and other health-care settings, airborne transmission of VZV from patients with either varicella or HZ has resulted in varicella in HCP and patients who had no direct contact with the index case-patient ( 284-288,291 ). Although all susceptible patients in health-care settings are at risk for severe varicella disease with complications, certain patients without evidence of immunity are at increased risk: pregnant women, premature infants born to susceptible mothers, infants born at <28 weeks' gestation or who weigh 1,000 grams regardless of maternal immune status, and immunocompromised persons of all ages (including persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, have malignant disease, or are immunodeficient).VZV exposures among patients and HCP can be disruptive to patient care, time-consuming, and costly even when they do not result in VZV transmission ( 281,282,292 ). Studies of VZV exposure in health-care settings have documented that a single provider with unrecognized varicella can result in the exposure of >30 patients and >30 employees ( 292). Identification of susceptible patients and staff, medical management of susceptible exposed patients at risk for complications of varicella, and furloughing of susceptible exposed HCP are time-consuming and costly (281,282). With the overall reduction in varicella disease attributable to the success of the vaccination program, the risk for exposure to VZV from varicella cases in health-care settings is likely declining. In addition, an increasing proportion of varicella cases occur in vaccinated persons who are less contagious. Diagnosis of varicella has become increasingly challenging as a growing proportion of cases occur in vaccinated persons in whom disease is mild, and HCP encounter patients with varicella less frequently. Although not currently routinely recommended for the diagnosis and management of varicella, laboratory testing of suspected varicella cases is likely to become increasingly useful in health-care settings, especially as the positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis declines. Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety Vaccine Effectiveness Formal studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy or effectiveness have not been performed among adults. Studies of varicella vaccine effectiveness performed among children indicated good performance of 1 dose for prevention of all varicella (80%-85%) and >95% effectiveness for prevention of moderate and severe disease (266,293). Studies have indicated that a second dose among children produces an improved humoral and cellular immune response that correlates with improved protection against disease (266,294). Varicella vaccine effectiveness is expected to be lower in adults than in children. Adolescents and adults require 2 doses to achieve seroconversion rates similar to those seen in children after 1 dose ( 266). A study of adults who received 2 doses of varicella vaccine 4 or 8 weeks apart and were exposed subsequently to varicella in the household estimated an 80% reduction in the expected number of cases (295). Duration of Immunity Serologic correlates of protection against varicella using commercially available assays have not been established for adults ( 266). In clinical studies, detectable antibody levels have persisted for at least 5 years in 97% of adolescents and adults who were administered 2 doses of varicella vaccine Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 234-8 weeks apart, but boosts in antibody levels were observed following exposures to varicella, which could account for the long-term persistence of antibodies after vaccination in these studies (295). Studies have demonstrated that whereas 25%-31% of adult vaccine recipients who seroconverted lost detectable antibodies 1-11 years after vaccination ( VZV-specific T-cell for cell-mediated immunity [CMI]) was maintained in 94% of adults 1 and 5 years postvaccination ( 297). Disease was mild in vaccinated persons who developed varicella after exposure to VZV, even among vaccinees who did not seroconvert or who lost detectable antibody ( 273,274 ). Severity of illness and attack rates among vaccinated adults did not increase over time. These studies suggest that VZV-specific CMI affords protection to vaccinated adults, even in the absence of detectable antibody response. Vaccine Safety The varicella vaccine has an excellent safety profile. In clinical trials, the most common adverse events among adolescents and adults were injection-site complaints (24.4% after the first dose and 32.5% after the second dose) (266,295 ). Varicella-like rash at the injection site occurred in 3% of vaccine recipients after the first dose and in 1% after the second. A nonlocalized rash occurred in 5.5% of vaccine recipients after the first dose and in 0.9% after the second, with a median number of lesions of five, at a peak of 7-21 and 0-23 days postvaccination, respectively ( 295). Data on serious adverse events among adults after varicella vaccination are limited, but the proportion of serious adverse events among all adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System during 1995-2005 was low (5%) among both children and adults ( 298). Serious adverse events reported among children included pneumonia, hepatitis, HZ (some hospitalized), meningitis with HZ, ataxia, encephalitis, thrombocytopenic purpura. Not all adverse events reported after varicella vaccination have been laboratory confirmed to be attributable to the vaccine strain VZV (266,298). Risk for transmission of vaccine virus was assessed in placebo recipients who were siblings of vaccinated children and among healthy siblings of vaccinated leukemic children ( 266). The findings suggest that transmission of varicella vaccine virus from healthy persons to susceptible contacts is very rare. The risk might be increased in vaccinees in whom a varicella-like rash develops after vaccination. However, this risk is also low. The benefits of vaccinating HCP without evidence of immunity outweigh this extremely low potential risk. Since implementation of the varicella vaccine program, transmission of vaccine virus has been documented from eight persons (all of whom had a rash after vaccination) resulting in nine secondary infections among household and long-term-care facility contacts ( 299). No transmission has been documented from vaccinated HCP . Recommendations Vaccination Health-care institutions should ensure that all HCP have evidence of immunity to varicella. This information should be documented and readily available at the work location. HCP without evidence of immunity to varicella should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine administered 4-8 weeks apart. If >8 weeks elapse after the first dose, the second dose may be administered without restarting the schedule. Recently vaccinated HCP do not require any restriction in their work activities; however, HCP who develop a vaccine-related rash after vaccination should avoid contact with persons without evidence of immunity to varicella who are at risk for severe disease and complications until all lesions resolve (i.e., are crusted over) or, if they develop lesions that do not crust (macules and papules only), until no new lesions appear within a 24-hour period. Evidence of immunity for HCP includes any of the following (266): written documentation of vaccinatio n with 2 doses of varicella vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 or laboratory confirmation of disease, diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella disease by a health-care provider,\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 or diagnosis or verification of a history of HZ by a health-care provider. In health-care settings, serologic screening before vaccination of personnel without evidence of immunity is likely to be cost effective. Key factors determining cost-effectiveness include sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests, the nosocomial transmission rate, seroprevalence of VZV antibody in the personnel population, and policies for managing vaccine recipients developing postvaccination rash or who are \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Commercial assays can be used to assess disease-induced immunity, but they often lack sensitivity to detect vaccine-induced immunity (i.e., they might yield false-negative results). \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Verification of history or diagnosis of typical disease can be provided by any health-care provider (e.g., a school or occupational clinic nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or physician). For persons reporting a history of, or reporting with, atypical or mild cases, assessment by a physician or their designee is recommended, and one of the following should be sought: 1) an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or 2) evidence of laboratory confirmation if it was performed at the time of acute disease. When such documentation is lacking, persons should not be considered as having a valid history of disease because other diseases might mimic mild atypical varicella.Recommendations and Reports 24 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7exposed subsequently to VZV. Institutions may elect to test all unvaccinated HCP , regardless of disease history, because a small proportion of persons with a positive history of disease might be susceptible. For the purpose of screening HCP , a less sensitive and more specific commercial ELISA should be considered. The latex agglutination test can produce false-positive results, and HCP who remained unvaccinated because of false test results subsequently contracted varicella (289). Routine testing for varicella immunity after 2 doses of vaccine is not recommended. Available commercial assays are not sensitive enough to detect antibody after vaccination in all instances. Sensitive tests that are not generally available have indicated that 92%-99% of adults develop antibodies after the second dose ( 266). Seroconversion does not always result in full protection against disease and, given the role of CMI for providing long-term protection, absence of antibodies does not necessarily mean susceptibility. Documented receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine supersedes results of subsequent serologic testing. Health-care institutions should establish protocols and recommendations for screening and vaccinating HCP and for management of HCP after exposures in the work place. Institutions also should consider precautions for HCP in whom rash occurs after vaccination, although they should also consider the possibility of wild-type disease in HCP with recent exposure to varicella or HZ. A vaccine to prevent HZ is available and recommended for all persons aged 60 years without contraindications to vaccination. HZ vaccine is not indicated for HCP for the prevention of nosocomial transmission, but HCP aged 60 years may receive the vaccine on the basis of the general recommendation for HZ vaccination, to reduce their individual risk for HZ. Varicella Control Strategies Appropriate measures should be implemented to manage cases and control outbreaks (300).Patient Care Only HCP with evidence of immunity to varicella should care for patients who have confirmed or suspected varicella or HZ. Airborne precautions (i.e., negative air-flow rooms) and contact precautions should be employed for all patients with varicella or disseminated HZ and for immunocompromised patients with localized HZ until disseminated infection is ruled out. These precautions should be kept in place until lesions are dry and crusted. If negative air-flow rooms are not available, patients should be isolated in closed rooms and should not have contact with persons without evidence of immunity to varicella. For immunocompetent persons with localized HZ, standard precautions and complete covering of the lesions are recommended. Postexposure Management of HCP and Patients Exposure to VZV is defined as close contact with an infectious person, such as close indoor contact (e.g., in the same room) or face-to-face contact. Experts differ regarding the duration of contact; some suggest 5 minutes, and others up to 1 hour; all agree that it does not include transitory contact ( 301). All exposed, susceptible patients and HCP should be identified using the criteria for evidence of immunity. An additional criterion of evidence of immunity only for patients who are not immunocompromised or pregnant is birth in the United States before 1980. Postexposure prophylaxis with vaccination or varicella-zoster immunoglobulin, depending on immune status, of exposed HCP and patients without evidence of immunity is recommended (266). HCP who have received 2 doses of vaccine and who are exposed to VZV (varicella, disseminated HZ, and uncovered lesions of a localized HZ) should be monitored daily during days 8-21 after exposure for fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms suggestive of varicella. HCP can be monitored directly by occupational health program or infection-control practitioners or instructed to report fever, headache, or other constitutional symptoms and any atypical skin lesions immediately. HCP should be excluded from a work facility immediately if symptoms occur. HCP who have received 1 dose of vaccine and who are exposed to VZV (varicella, disseminated HZ, and uncovered lesions of a localized HZ) (in the community or health-care setting/workplace) should receive the second dose within 3-5 days after exposure to rash (provided 4 weeks have elapsed after the first dose). After vaccination, management is similar to that of 2-dose vaccine recipients. Those who did not receive a second dose or who received the second dose >5 days after exposure should be excluded from work for 8-21 days after exposure. Unvaccinated HCP who have no other evidence of immunity who are exposed to VZV (varicella, disseminated HZ, and uncovered lesions of a localized HZ) are potentially infective from days 8-21 after exposure and should be furloughed during this period. They should receive postexposure vaccination as soon as possible. Vaccination within 3-5 days of exposure to rash might modify the disease if infection occurred. Vaccination >5 days postexposure is still indicated because it induces protection against subsequent exposures (if the current exposure did not cause infection). For HCP at risk for severe disease for whom varicella vaccination is contraindicated (e.g., pregnant or immunocomprosed HCP), varicella-zoster immune globulin after exposure is recommended. The varicella-zoster immune Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 25globulin product currently used in the United States, VariZIG (Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada), is available under an Investigational New Drug Application Expanded Access protocol; a sample release form is available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/UCM176031.pdf. Varicella-zoster immune globulin might prolong the incubation period by a week, thus extending the time during which personnel should not work from 21 to 28 days. In case of an outbreak, HCP without evidence of immunity who have contraindications to vaccination should be excluded from the outbreak setting through 21 days after rash onset of the last identified case-patient because of the risk for severe disease in these groups. If the VZV exposure was to localized HZ with covered lesions, no work restrictions are needed if the exposed HCP had previously received at least 1 dose of vaccine or received the first dose within 3-5 days postexposure. A second dose should be administered at the appropriate interval. HCP should be monitored daily during days 8-21 after exposure for fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms suggestive of varicella and excluded from a work facility if symptoms occur. If at least 1 dose was not received, restriction from patient contact is recommended. Diseases for Which Vaccination Might Be Indicated in Certain Circumstances Health-care facilities and other organizations should consider including in their vaccination programs vaccines to prevent meningococcal disease, typhoid fever, and polio for HCP who have certain health conditions or who work in laboratories or regions outside the United States where the risk for work-related exposure exists. Meningococcal Disease Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors Meningococcal disease is rare among adults in the United States and incidence has decreased to historic lows; during 1998-2007 the average annual incidence of meningococcal disease was 0.28 (range: 0.26-0.31) cases per 100,000 population among persons aged 25-64 years (302). Routine vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended by ACIP for adolescents aged 11-18 years, with the primary dose at age 11-12 years and the booster dose at age 16 years. In 2010, coverage with meningococcal conjugate vaccine among persons aged 13-17 years was 62.7% (22).Nosocomial transmission of Neisseria meningitidis is rare, but HCP have become infected after direct contact with respiratory secretions of infected persons (e.g., managing of an airway during resuscitation) and in a laboratory setting. HCP can decrease the risk for infection by adhering to precautions to prevent exposure to respiratory droplets ( 303,304) and by taking antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis if exposed directly to respiratory secretions. Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety T wo quadrivalent (A, C, W-135, Y) conjugate meningococcal vaccines (MCV4) are licensed for persons aged through 55 years ( 305,306 ). Both protect against two of the three serogroups that cause the majority of meningococcal disease in the United States and against 75% of disease among adults. Available data indicate that the majority of persons do not have enough circulating functional antibody to be protected 5 years after a single dose of MCV4. Both vaccines had similar safety profiles in clinical trials. Quadrivalent (A, C, W-135, Y) meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is available for use in persons aged >55 years. No vaccine for serogroup B meningococcal disease is licensed in the United States. Recommendations Vaccination MCV4 is not recommended routinely for all HCP . HCP Recommended to Receive Vaccine to Prevent Meningococcal Disease A 2-dose vaccine series is recommended for HCP with known asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies, because these conditions increase the risk for meningococcal disease. HCP traveling to countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic also are at increased risk for infection and should receive vaccine. Those with known asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies should receive a 2-dose vaccine series. All other HCP traveling to work to high-risk areas should receive a single dose of MCV4 before travel if they have never received it or if they received it >5 years previously. Clinical microbiologists and research microbiologists who might be exposed routinely to isolates of N. meningitides should receive a single dose of MCV4 and receive a booster dose every 5 years if they remain at increased risk. Health-care personnel aged >55 years who have any of the above risk factors for meningococcal disease should be vaccinated with MPSV4 (305).Recommendations and Reports 26 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7HCP Who May Elect to Receive Vaccine to Prevent Meningococcal Disease HCP with known HIV infection are likely at increased risk for meningococcal disease and may elect vaccination. If these HCP are vaccinated, they should receive a 2-dose vaccine series (307). Booster Doses HCP who receive the 2-dose MCV4 vaccine series and/or remain in a group at increased risk should receive a booster dose every 5 years (306). Postexposure Management of Exposed HCP Postexposure prophylaxis is advised for all persons who have had intensive, unprotected contact (i.e., without wearing a mask) with infected patients (e.g., via mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, or endotracheal tube management), including HCP who have been vaccinated with either the conjugate or polysaccharide vaccine (3). Antimicrobial prophylaxis can eradicate carriage of N. meningitidis and prevent infections in persons who have unprotected exposure to patients with meningococcal infections ( 305). Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis . In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin- resistant strains of N. meningitidis have been detected (as of August 30, 2011, only parts of Minnesota and North Dakota), ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis ( 308). Azithromycin can be used as an alternative. Ceftriaxone can be used during pregnancy. Postexposure prophylaxis should be administered within 24 hours of exposure when feasible; postexposure prophylaxis administered >14 days after exposure is of limited or no value ( 305). HCP not otherwise indicated for vaccination may be recommended to be vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine in the setting of a community or institutional outbreak of meningococcal disease caused by a serogroup contained in the vaccine. Typhoid Fever Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors The incidence of typhoid fever declined steadily in the United States during 1900-1960 and has since remained low. During 1999-2006, on average, 237 cases were reported annually to the National Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Surveillance System (309). The median age of patients was 22 years and 54% were male; 79% reported foreign travel during the 30 days before onset of symptoms. Among international travelers, the risk for Salmonella Typhi infection appears to be highest for those who visit friends and relatives in countries in which typhoid fever is endemic and for those who visit (even for a short time) the most highly endemic areas (e.g., the Indian subcontinent) (310). Increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, which are used to treat multidrug-resistant. S. Typhi, has been seen particularly among travelers to south and southeast Asia ( 311). Isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (DCS) do not qualify as resistant according to current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria but are associated with poorer clinical outcomes ( 311,312). Resistance to nalidixic acid, a quinolone, is a marker for DCS and increased from 19% in 1999 to 59% in 2008 ( 313). Nine isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin also were seen during this time period (313). Although overall S. Typhi infections have declined in the United States, increased incidence and antimicrobial resistance including resistance to fluoroquinolones have been seen for paratyphoid fever caused by Paratyphi A ( 314). No vaccines that protect against Paratyphi A infection are available. Transmission and Exposure in Health-Care Settings During 1985-1994, seven cases of laboratory-acquired typhoid fever were reported among persons working in microbiology laboratories, only one of whom had been vaccinated ( 315). Additionally, S. Typhi might be transmitted nosocomially via the hands of infected persons (315). Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety T wo typhoid vaccines are distributed in the United States: oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine (one enteric-coated capsule taken on alternate days for a total of four capsules) and the capsular polysaccharide parenteral vaccine (1 0.5 mL intramuscular dose). Both vaccines protect 50%-80% of recipients. To maintain immunity, booster doses of the oral vaccine are required every 5 years, and booster doses of the injected vaccine are required every 2 years. Complication rates are low for both types of S. Typhi vaccines. During 1994-1999, serious adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in an estimated 0.47 to 1.3 per 100,000 doses, and no deaths occurred (310). However, live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine should not be used among immunocompromised persons, including those infected with HIV ( 316). Theoretic concerns have been raised about the immunogenicity of live, attenuated Ty21a vaccine in persons concurrently receiving antimicrobials (including antimalarial chemoprophylaxis), viral vaccines, or immune globulin (317). A third type of vaccine, a parenteral heat-inactivated vaccine associated with higher reactogenicity, was discontinued in 2000 (310,318). Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 27Recommendations Vaccination Microbiologists and others who work frequently with S. Typhi should be vaccinated with either of the two licensed and available vaccines. Booster vaccinations should be administered on schedule according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Controlling the Spread of Typhoid Fever Personal hygiene, particularly hand hygiene before and after all patient contacts, will minimize risk for transmitting enteric pathogens to patients. However, HCP who contract an acute diarrheal illness accompanied by fever, cramps, or bloody stools are likely to excrete substantial numbers of infective organisms in their feces. Excluding these HCP from care of patients until the illness has been evaluated and treated can prevent transmission (3). Poliomyelitis Background Epidemiology and Risk Factors In the United States, the last indigenously acquired cases of poliomyelitis caused by wild poliovirus occurred in 1979, and the Americas were certified to be free of indigenous wild poliovirus in 1994 ( 319,320). With the complete transition from use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to has been eliminated ( 321,322 ), so the risk for exposure to any live poliovirus in the United States is limited. However, global eradication of poliomyelitis has not yet occurred, so reintroductions of poliovirus into the United States are possible. T wo cases of paralytic polio from vaccine-derived poliovirus have occurred since 2000 (one imported case in 2005 and one case in an immunodeficient person in 2008), and evidence of limited circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in an undervaccinated community was documented in 2005 (323-325). Transmission and Exposure in Health-Care Settings Poliovirus can be recovered from infected persons, including from pharyngeal specimens, feces, urine, and (rarely) cerebrospinal fluid. HCP and laboratory workers might be exposed if they come into close contact with infected persons (e.g., travelers returning from areas where polio is endemic) or with specimens that contain poliovirus.Vaccine Effectiveness, Duration of Immunity, and Vaccine Safety Both IPV and OPV are highly immunogenic and effective when administered according to their schedules. In studies conducted in the United States, 3 doses of IPV resulted in 100% serocoversion for types 2 and 3 poliovirus and 96%-100% for type 1 (326). Immunity is prolonged and might be lifelong. IPV is well tolerated, and no serious adverse events have been associated with its use. IPV is an inactivated vaccine and does not cause VAPP . IPV is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, including 2-phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, and polymyxin B. OPV is no longer available in the United States. Recommendations Vaccination Because the majority of adults born in the United States are likely immune to polio as a result of vaccination during childhood, poliovirus vaccine is not routinely recommended for persons aged 18 years. The childhood recommendation for poliovirus vaccine consists of 4 doses at ages 2, 4, and 6-18 months and 4-6 years. However, vaccination is recommended for HCP who are at greater risk for exposure to polioviruses than the general population, including laboratory workers who handle specimens that might contain polioviruses and HCP who have close contact with patients who might be excreting wild polioviruses, including HCP who travel to work in areas where polioviruses are circulating. Unvaccinated HCP should receive a 3-dose series of IPV, with dose 2 administered 4-8 weeks after dose 1, and dose 3 administered 6-12 months after dose 2. HCP who have previously completed a routine series of poliovirus vaccine and who are at increased risk can receive a lifetime booster dose of IPV if they remain at increased risk for exposure. Available data do not indicate the need for more than a single lifetime booster dose with IPV for adults. Controlling the Spread of Poliovirus Standard precautions always should be practiced when handling biologic specimens. Suspect cases require an immediate investigation including collection of appropriate laboratory specimens and control measures. All suspect or confirmed cases should be reported immediately to the local or state health department.Recommendations and Reports 28 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7Other Vaccines Recommended for Adults Certain vaccines are recommended for adults based on age or other individual risk factors but not because of occupational exposure ( 327). Vaccine-specific ACIP recommendations should be consulted for details on schedules, indications, contraindications, and precautions for these vaccines. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). PPSV is recommended for healthy persons aged 65 years. PPSV is also recommended for persons aged <65 years with certain underlying medical conditions, including anatomic or functional asplenia, immunocompromise (including HIV infection), chronic lung, heart or kidney disease, and diabetes. T etanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td). All adults should have documentation of having received an age-appropriate series of Td-containing vaccine and a routine booster dose every 10 years. Persons without documentation of having received a Td series should receive a 3-dose series. The first dose of the series should be administered as Tdap (see Pertussis). Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. (Gardasil) or bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is recommended for females at age 11 or 12 years with catch-up vaccination recommended through age 26 years. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) may be administered to males aged 9-26 years. Zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine contains the same live attenuated varicella zoster virus as varicella vaccine but at a higher concentration (approximately 14 times more vaccine virus per dose). Zoster vaccine is recommended for the prevention of HZ (shingles) in persons aged 60 years. T ransmission of vaccine virus from the recipient to a contact has not been reported. Consequently, limiting or restricting work activities for persons who recently received zoster vaccine is not necessary. Hepatitis A vaccine. HCP have not been demonstrated to be at increased risk for hepatitis A virus infection because of occupational exposure, including persons exposed to sewage. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for person with chronic liver disease, international travelers, and certain other groups at increased risk for exposure to hepatitis A.Catch-Up and Travel Vaccination Catch-Up Programs Managers of health-care facilities should implement catch-up vaccination programs for HCP who already are employed, in addition to developing policies for achieving high vaccination coverage among newly hired HCP . HCP vaccination records could be reviewed annually during the influenza vaccination season or concurrent with annual TB testing. This strategy could help prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Because education, especially when combined with other interventions such as reminder/recall systems and low or no out-of-pocket costs, enhances the success of many vaccination programs, informational materials should be available to assist in answering questions from HCP regarding the diseases, vaccines, and toxoids as well as the program or policy being implemented ( 120,328). Conducting educational workshops or seminars several weeks before the initiation of a catch-up vaccination program might promote acceptance of program goals. Travel Hospital personnel and other HCP who perform research or health-care work in foreign countries might be at increased risk for acquiring certain diseases that can be prevented by vaccines recommended in the United States (e.g., hepatitis B, influenza, MMR, Tdap, poliovirus, varicella, and meningococcal vaccines) and travel-related vaccines (e.g., hepatitis A, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, typhoid, or yellow fever vaccines) ( 329). Elevated risks for acquiring these diseases might stem from exposure to patients in health-care settings (e.g., poliomyelitis and meningococcal disease) but also might arise from circumstances unrelated to patient care (e.g., high endemicity of hepatitis A or exposure to arthropod-vector diseases [e.g., yellow fever]). All HCP should seek the advice of a health-care provider familiar with travel medicine at least 4-6 weeks before travel to ensure that they are up to date on routine vaccinations and that they receive vaccinations recommended for their destination (329). Although bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination is not recommended routinely in the United States, HCP should discuss potential beneficial and other consequences of this vaccination with their health-care provider. Work Restrictions Work restrictions for susceptible HCP (i.e., no history of vaccination or documented lack of immunity) exposed to or infected with certain vaccine-preventable diseases can range from restricting individual HCP from patient contact to complete exclusion from duty (Table 5). A furloughed employee should be considered in the same category as an Recommendations and Reports MMWR / November 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7 29employee excluded from the facility. Specific recommendations concerning work restrictions in these circumstances have been published previously (3,11). Acknowledgments The following persons contributed to this report: Rachel J.

Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication to vaccination of women. Previous anaphylactic reaction to common baker's yeast is a contraindication to vaccination.The vaccine produces neither therapeutic nor adverse effects in HBV-infected persons. Prevaccination serologic screening is not indicated for persons being vaccinated because of occupational risk but might be indicated for HCP in certain high-risk populations. HCP at high risk for occupational contact with blood or body fluids should be tested 1-2 months after vaccination to determine serologic response. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)0.06 mL/kg IM as soon as possible after exposure, if indicated Postexposure prophylaxis (see Table 4)See package insert \u00a7 Influenza vaccine (TIV and LAIV)Annual vaccination with current seasonal vaccine. TIV is available in IM and ID formulations. LAIV is administered intranasally.All HCP History of severe (e.g., anaphylactic) hypersensitivity to eggs; prior severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccineNo evidence exists of risk to mother of fetus when the vaccine is administered to a pregnant woman with an underlying high-risk condition. Influenza vaccination is recommended for women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season because of increased risk for hospitalization and death. LAIV is recommended only for healthy, non-pregnant persons aged 2-49 years. Intradermal vaccine is indicated for persons aged 18-64 years. HCP who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should receive TIV rather than LAIV. Measles live-virus vaccine2 doses SC; 28 days apartVaccination should be recommended for all HCP who lack presumptive evidence of immunity; \u00b6 vaccination should be considered for those born before 1957.Pregnancy; immunocompromised persons,** including HIV-infected persons who have evidence anaphylaxis to gelatin or gelatin-containing products; anaphylaxis to neomycin; and recent administration of immune globulin.HCP vaccinated during 1963-1967 with a killed measles vaccine alone, killed vaccine followed by live vaccine, or a vaccine of unknown type should be revaccinated with 2 doses of live measles virus vaccine. Mumps live-virus vaccine2 doses SC; 28 days apartVaccination should be recommended for all HCP who lack presumptive evidence of immunity. Vaccination should be considered for those born before 1957.Pregnancy; immunocompromised persons,** including HIV-infected persons who have evidence anaphylaxis to gelatin or gelatin-containing products; anaphylaxis to neomycinHCP vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type should consider revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Rubella live-virus vaccine1 dose SC; (However, due to the 2-dose requirements for measles and mumps vaccines, the use of MMR vaccine will result in most HCP receiving 2 doses of rubella-containing vaccine.)Vaccination should be recommended for all HCP who lack presumptive evidence of immunity. \u00a7\u00a7Pregnancy; immunocompromised persons** including HIV-infected persons who have evidence anaphylaxis to gelatin or for rubella vaccine-associated malformations in the offspring of women pregnant when vaccinated or who become pregnant within 1 month after vaccination is negligible. \u00b6\u00b6 Such women should be counseled regarding the theoretical basis of concern for the fetus.

After receipt of Tdap, receive Td for routine booster every 10 years.All HCP , regardless of age. History of serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) to any component of Tdap. Because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons with history of anaphylaxis to components in Tdap or Td should be referred to an allergist to determine whether they have a specific allergy to tetanus toxoid and can safely receive tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine. Persons with history of encephalopathy (e.g., coma or prolonged seizures) not attributable to an identifiable cause within 7 days of administration of a vaccine with pertussis components should receive Td instead of Tdap. Tetanus prophylaxis in wound management if not yet received (varicella zoster virus live-virus apart if aged 13 years.All HCP who do not have evidence of immunity defined as: written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of varicella vaccine: laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease; diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella disease by a health-care provider, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 or diagnosis or verification of a history of herpes zoster by a health-care provider.Pregnancy; immunocompromised persons;** history reaction after receipt of gelatin or neomycin. Varicella vaccination may be considered for HIV-infected adolescents and adults with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count >200 cells/uL. Avoid salicylate use for 6 weeks after vaccination.Because 71%-93% of adults without a history of varicella are immune, serologic testing before vaccination is likely to be cost-effective.

For persons reporting a history of, or reporting with, atypical or mild cases, assessment by a physician or their designee is recommended, and one of the following should be sought: 1) an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or 2) evidence of laboratory confirmation if it was performed at the time of acute disease. When such documentation is lacking, persons should not be considered as having a valid history of disease because other diseases might mimic mild atypical varicella. \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 For example, immunocompromised patients or pregnant women.Recommendations and Reports 42 MMWR / No vember 25, 2011 / Vol . 60 / No . 7TABLE 3.

To minimize confusion when differentiating between the roles of the administering healthcare professional (e.g., em ployee/occupational health nurse or the infection preventionist) and the healthcare personnel receiving the immunization, the term \"patient\" refers to the healthcare personnel receiving the immunization. The term \"provider\" or \"healthcare provider\" refers to the employee/occupational health nurse or infection preventionist involved in the immunization process Appropriate vaccine administra tion is a critical component of a successful immunizati on program . The following infor mation provides general guidance for those who ad minister vaccines and should be used in conjunction with professional stan dards of medication administration and vaccine manufacturers' guidelines. The \"Rights of Medication Administration\" should be applied to each encounter when vaccines are administered. These rights inclu de: the right patient; the right vaccine or diluent; the right time*; the right dosage; the right route, needle length, and technique; the right site; and, the right docu mentation. *(includes administering at the correct age, the appropriate interval, and before vaccine or diluent expires) Staff Training and Education All personn el who will administer vaccin es should receive competency -based training and education on vaccine administration before providing vaccines to patients. Providers need to orient new staff to vaccines used in their office and validate staff's knowledge and skills about vaccine administration with a skills checklist. Providers should remember to include temporary personnel who may be filling in on days when th e clinic is short staffed or hel ping during peak ti mes such as flu season. Continuing education should be provided for all staff on the use and adm inistration of new vaccines, new schedule s, and new or revised recom mendations. Patient Preparati on and Care Screening - All patie nts should be scree ned for con traindications and precautions every time a vacci ne is administered, even if the patient has previou sly received a dose of that vaccine. The patie nt's status can change from one visit to the next or a new contraindication or preca ution may have been added. Vaccine Safety & Ri sk Communication - There have been safety concerns about vaccines since the 18th cent ury when the first smallpox vaccination campaigns began. Specific vaccine concerns have changed through time. An inc reasing number of individuals raise vaccine safety concerns and are exposed to information about vaccines through the media, internet, family members, and friends. Some of this information is inacc urate and misleading. A provider's recom mendation for vaccination is a power ful motiv ator. Healthcare providers are consistently identified as the most trusted source of vaccine infor mation by parents and patients. Immunization providers should be prepared to discuss the benefits and risks of vaccines, as well as the risks of vaccine -preventable diseases (VPD), using Vaccine Infor mation State ments (VIS) and other reliable resources. Establishing an open dialogue pro motes a safe, trust -building environ ment in which individuals can freely evaluate inform ation, discuss vaccine concerns and make informed decisions regarding imm unizations. Providers are also encouraged to discuss after care instructio ns with patie nts. Atraumatic Care - Vaccine safety issues and the need for multi ple injections have increa sed the concerns and anxiety associated with imm unizations. Healthcare providers need to display confidence and establish an environ ment that promotes a sense of security and trust for the patie nt, utilizing a variety of techniqu es to minimize the stress and disco mfort associated with recei ving injections. Although pain from immuniza tions is, to some extent, unavoidable, there are some things that healthcare providers can do when administering vaccines. Everyone involved should work to provide imm unizations in the safest and least stressful way possible. Simple strategies that can be used by the employee/occupational health nurse to make the process of receiving vaccines easier include: display ing a positi ve attitude through facial expressions, body language, and comments; using a soft and calm tone of voice; making eye contact; explain ing why vaccines are needed (e.g., \"this medicine will protect you from getting sick\" or \"this shot is a shield to protect your body against infection\"); and, being honest and explaining what to expect (e.g., do not say that the injection will not hurt). Positioning & Comf orting Rest raint - The healthcare provider should accom modate for the patient 's comfort, safety, age, activity level, and the site of ad ministration when considering patient positioning and restraint. All providers who ad minister vaccines to older children, adolescents, and adults should be aware of the potential for syncope (fainting) after vaccination and take measures to prevent it. Clinicians should (1) make sure the person who is being vaccinated is always seated or lying down; (2) be aware of sympto ms that precede fainting (wea kness, dizziness, pallo r, etc.); and (3) provide supportive care and take appropriate measures to preve nt injuries if such symptoms occur. The Advisory Com mittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) a lso recom mends that providers consider observing the vaccine recipient (with the recipient seated or lying down) for 15 m inutes after vacci nation. Comfort Measures - Concern and anxiety about injections are com mon for all ages. Fear of injections and needles tick pain are often cited as reasons why childre n and adults, including healt hcare personnel, refuse vaccine s. Pain is a subjective phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including an individual' s age, anxiety level, previous healthcare experie nces, and cult ure. Managing the pain asso ciated with immunizations has the potential to improve satis faction with the immunization experience. Consider ation for these factors is importa nt as the provider develops a planned approach to manag ement of injection pain. Immunization providers are encouraged to deter mine the patient's previous experiences with needle sticks. Evidence -based strategies to ease the injection process in clude: Antipyretics - An age -appropriate dose of a non-aspirin -containing pain reliever may be considered to decrease disco mfort and fever if it should occur after vaccination. ACIP does not recom mend the prophylactic use of analgesics before or at the time of vaccination. Distraction techniques - Age-appropriate, non-phar macologic techniques may provide distraction from pain associated with injections. Psychological interventions such as distraction have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing stress and the perception of pain during the injection process. Distraction can be acco mplished through a variety of techniques (e.g., deep breathing techniques). Order of injections - Injecting the most painful vaccine (e.g., MMR) last when m ultiple injections are being administered may also decrea se the pain of injections. Tactile stimulation - Rubbing or stroking the skin near the injection site with moderate intens ity may decre ase pain in adults. Administr ation techni que - Perfor ming intramuscular injections rapidly without aspiration has also demonstrated a reduction in pain. Topical analgesia may be applied to decrease pain at the injection site. These products (e.g., 5% lidocaine -prilocaine emulsion or ref rigerant spray) should be used only for the ages recom mended and as direc ted by the product manufacturer. Infection Prevention and Control Healthcare providers should follow Standard Precautions to minim ize the risks of spreading disease during the administration of vaccines. Hand hygiene - Hand hygiene is critical to prevent the spread of illne ss and disea se. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and wate r or cleansed with an alcohol -based waterless antiseptic before vaccine prepa ration, between recipients , and any time hands beco me soiled. Gloves - Occupational Safety and Health Adminis tration (OSHA) regulations do not require gloves to be worn when ad ministeri ng vaccines unless t he person adm inistering the vaccine is likely to come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands. If gloves are worn, they should be chang ed between vaccine recipients . Gloves will not prevent needle stick injuries. Any needle stick injury should be reported imm ediately to the site supervisor, with appropriate care and follow -up given as directed by local/state guidelines. Equipment Disposal - Used needles should not be recap ped, cut, or detached from the syringes before disposal. All used syringe/needl e devices should be placed in puncture proof contai ners to prevent accidental needlesticks and reuse. Empty or expired vaccine vials are considered medical waste and should be disposed of according to state regulations. Vaccine Preparation Proper vaccine handling and prepara tion is critical in maintai ning the integrity of the vaccine during transfer from the manuf actur er's vial to the syringe and ultimately to the patient. Equipment Selection - Syringe Selection - A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. A parenteral vaccine may be delivered in either a 1-mL or 3-mL syringe as long as the prescribed dosage is delivered. OSHA requires that safety -engineered injection devices (e.g., needle -shielding syringes or needle -free injecto rs) be used for injectable vaccination in all cli nical settings to reduce risk for i njury and disease trans mission. Pers onnel who will be using these products should be involved in evaluation and selection of these products and should receive training with these devices before using them in the clinical area. - Needle Selection - Vaccine must reach the desired tissu e site for opti mal immune response to occur. Therefore, needle selection should be based on the prescribed route, size of the individ ual, volume and viscosity of the vacci ne, and injecti on techniq ue. A supply of needles in varying lengths appropriate for the clinic's patient population should be available to staff. Typically, vaccines are not highly viscous so a fine gauge needle (22-25 gauge) can be used. Inspecting Vaccine - Each vaccine and dilue nt vial should be carefully inspected for da mage or conta mination prior to use. The expirat ion date printed on the vial or box should be checked. Vaccine can be used thro ugh the last day of the month indicated by the expiration date unless otherwise stated on the package labeling. The expira tion date or time for some vaccines changes once the vacci ne vial is opened or the vaccine is reconstituted. This infor mation is available in the manufacturer's product information. Regardless of expiration date, vaccine and diluent should only be used as long as they are normal in appearance and have been stored and handled properly. Expir ed vaccine or diluent should never be used. Reconstitution - Several vaccines are prepared in a lyophilized (freeze -dried) form that requires reconstit ution with a liquid dilue nt. Vaccines should be recon stituted accor ding to manufacturer guidelines using only the specific diluent supplied by the manufacturer for that vaccine. Each dilue nt is specific to the corresp onding vaccine in volu me, sterility, pH, and chemical balance. If the wrong diluent is used, the vacci ne dose is not valid and will need to be repeated using the correct diluent. Reconstitute vaccine just before using. Use all of the dilue nt supplied for a single dose and then draw u p all of the vaccine after it is thorou ghly recon stituted. Once reconstit uted, the vaccine must be either administered within the time guidelines specified in the manufacturer's product infor mation or discarded. Changing the needle between drawing vaccine from the vial and ad ministering the vaccine is not necessary unless the needle is conta minated or dam aged . Filling Syringes - Agitate (shake) the vial to mix the vaccine thoroughly and obtain a uniform suspension pri or to withd rawing each dose. W henever solution and container permit, inspect vaccine visually for particulate matter and/or discolorat ion prior to administration. If proble ms are noted (e.g., vaccine cannot be resuspended), the vacci ne should not be administered. Standard medication preparation guidelines should be follo wed for drawing a dose of vaccine into a syringe. A vacci ne dose should not be drawn into the syringe until it is to be administere d. When syringes are filled, the type of vaccine, lot num ber, and date of filling should be labeled on each syringe and the doses should be administered as soon as possible after filling. Sometimes provid ers prefill many syringes the mselves, outside of appropriately controlled environments. This practice is strongly discoura ged by CDC. The facility pharmacy may prefill syringes, but it is expected that this be done in accordance with USP 797 and other relevant safety standards. Single -dose vials and manufacture r-filled syringes are designed for single -dose administration and should be discarded if vaccine has been withd rawn or rec onstitu ted and subseque ntly not used within the time fram e specified by the manufacturer. Typically, the maximum time for inactivated vaccines is no longer than the same clinic day. CDC also recom mends that when the rubber diaphragm on a single -dose vial is exposed, the vaccine in the vial should be used that clinic day or discarded. It is difficult to tell if a needle has punctured the rubber diaphragm and single -dose vials do not contain a preservative. The same guideline applies to manufacturer -filled syringes that have been activated (i.e., syringe cap removed or needle attached) because the sterile seal has been broke n. Vaccines should never be combined in a single syringe except when specifically approved by the FDA and packaged for th at specific purpose. Most co mbination vaccines will be combined by the manufacturer. Vaccine should never be transferred from one syringe to another. Partial doses from separate vials should not be combined into a single dose. Both of these practices increase the risk of conta mination. Instilli ng air into a multidose vial prior to withdrawing a vaccine dose may not be neces sary. It could cause a \"spritz\" of vaccine to be lost each time the air is injected, which through time can decrease the amount of vacci ne in the vial and lead to the loss of a dose (e.g., obtaining only 9 full doses from a 10-dose vial). Route and Site The recommended route and site for each vacci ne are based on cli nical trials, practical experience and theoretical considerations. This information is inclu ded in the manufactur er's product infor mation for each vacci ne. There are four routes used in the administrati on of vaccines ; oral, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, and intranasal. Oral administration will not be included in this administration information as there are no oral vaccines currently recommended for healthcare personnel. Deviation from the recom mended route may reduce vacci ne efficacy or increase local adverse reactions. Intranasal (NAS) Route - The live attenu ated influenza vaccine (LAIV, F luMist) is curre ntly the only vaccine administered by the nasal route. The vaccine dose (0.2 m L) is inside a special spra yer device. A plastic clip on the plunger divides the dose into two equal parts. The patient should be seated in an upright posit ion with head tilted back. Instr uct the patie nt to breathe normally. The provider should gently place a hand behind the patient's head. The tip of the nasal sprayer should be inserted slightly into the naris. Half of the contents of the sprayer (0.1 mL) are sprayed into the nostril. The dose -divider clip is then re moved and the procedure is repeated in the other naris. Detailed infor mation on the nasal administration of LAIV is included in the manufacturer's product information. The dose does not need to be repeated if the patient coughs, sneezes, or expels the dose in any other way. It is possible for the LAIV spray to cause low-level conta mination of the environ ment with vaccine virus, but there have been no reports of vaccine virus trans mission by this route. No instances have been reported of illness or attenuated vaccine virus infections among inadvertently exposed healthcare personnel or immunoc ompromised patients. Only healthcare personnel with severe immunosup pression (i.e., who require a protective environ ment, such as for he matopoietic cell transplant) should be restricted from receiving or administering LAIV. It is unlikely that healthcare personnel with this level of immunosuppression would be administering vaccines or working, but it is still a possibility . Other healthcare personnel at higher risk for influenza complications can administer LAIV. These include persons with underl ying medical conditions placing them at higher risk or who are likely to be at risk, including pregnant women, persons with asthma, and persons aged 50 years and older. Subcutaneous (SQ) Route. Subcutaneous inje ctions are administered into the fatty tissu e found below the dermis and above muscle tissu e. - Site - The recom mended subcuta neous site for vaccine a dministration in adults is the upper outer triceps of the arm. - Needle Gauge & Length - 5/8-inch, 23- to 25-gauge needle - Technique - Follow standard medication administration guidelines for site assessm ent/sele ction and site preparation. - To avoid reaching the muscle, pinch up the fatty tissue, insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 angle and inject the vacci ne into the tissue. - Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the injection site for several seconds with dry cotton ball or gauze. Intramuscular (IM) Route . Intramuscular inje ctions are administe red into muscle tissue below the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. - Site - All inacti vated vaccines, with the exception of one formulation of meningococcal polysacch aride vacci ne (MPSV4), are administered by the intramuscular route. Many inactivated vaccines contain an adjuvant, which is a vaccine component that enhances the immune response to the antigen. Adjuvants ca n cause an exaggerated local re action (e.g., pain, swelling, redness) if not injected into the muscle, so proper technique is critical. There are only two routinely recom mended IM sites for administr ation of vaccines, the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) and the deltoid muscle (upper arm). Injection at these sites reduces the chance of inv olving neural or vascular structure s. The site depends on the age of the individual and the degree of muscle develop ment. Because there are no large blood vessels in the recommended sites, aspiration before injectio n of vaccines (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but before injectio n) is not necessary. A study published in Archives of Disease in Childhood in 2007 found that when a vaccine was administered and withdrawn rapidly without aspiration there was less evidence of pain than when the vaccine was injected and withdrawn slowly with aspira tion. Also, some safety -engineered syringes do not allow for aspiration. -Needle Length - The needle should be long enough to reach the muscle mass and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcut aneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underlying nerves, blood vessels, or bone. The vaccin ator should be familiar with the anatomy of the area into which the vaccine will be injected. Decisions on needle size and site of injection must be made for each person on the basis of the size of the muscle, the thick ness of adipose tissue at the injection site, the volu me of the m aterial to be administered, and injection technique. - Adults (19 Years and O lder) For adults, the deltoid muscle is recommended for routine intramuscular vaccinations. The anterolateral thigh also can be used. For men and women weighing less than 130 lbs (60 kg) a 5/8- to 1-inch needle is sufficient to ensure intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle if a 90-degree angle is used and the tissue is not bunched. For men and women who weigh 130- 152 lbs (60-70 kg), a 1-inch needle is sufficient. For wo men who w eigh 152-200 lbs (70-90 kg) and men who weigh 152-260 lbs (70-118 kg), a 1- to 1\u00bd-inch needle is recom mended. For women who weigh more than 200 lbs (more than 90 kg) or m en who we igh more than 260 lbs (more than 118 kg), a 1\u00bd-inch needle is recom mended. - Technique Follow standard medication administration guidelines for site assessm ent/sele ction and site preparation. To avoid injection into subcutaneous tissue, spread the skin of the selected vaccine ad ministration site taut between the thum b and forefinger, isolating the muscle. Another techniq ble mostly for pe diatric and geriatric nts, is to grasp the tissue and \"bunch up\" the muscle. Insert the needle fully into the muscle at a 90\u00b0 angle and inject the vaccine into the tissue. Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the inject ion site for several seconds with a dry cotton ball or gauze. Special Situations Multiple Vaccinatio ns - If multiple vacci nes are administ ered at a single visit, administra tion of each preparation at a different anato mic site is desira ble. For adults, the deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intra muscular injection. The injections should be separated by 1 inch or more, if possible, so that any local reactions can be differentiated. Vaccines that are the most reactive (e.g., tetanus -containing) should be administered in differ ent limbs if possible. Use of co mbination vaccines can redu ce the number of injections. If a vaccine and an immune globulin prepa ration are administered simultaneously (e.g., Td/Tdap and tetanu s immune globulin [TIG] or hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG]), separate anatomic sites should be used. The location of all injection sites should be docu mented in the employee's health record. Healthcare practices should consi der using a vaccination site map so that all persons ad ministeri ng vaccines routinely use the same anato mic site for each different vaccine. Vaccinating Persons with Bleeding Disorders - Individuals with a bleeding disorder or who are recei ving antic oagulant therapy may develop hematomas in IM injection sites. When any intram uscularly administered vaccine is indicated for a patient with a bleeding disorder, the vaccine should be administered intramuscul arly if a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk determ ines that the vaccine can be administered by this route with reas onable safety. Prior to administration of IM vaccines the patient should be instructed about the risk of hematoma formation from the injection. If the person periodically receives antihe mophilia or similar therapy, IM vaccine administration should be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A 23 -gauge or finer needle should be used and firm pressure applied to the site for at least 2 minutes after injection. The site should not be rubbed or massaged. Persons receiving anticoagulation therapy presu mably have the same bleeding risk as those with clotting factor disorders and providers should follow the same guidelines for int ramuscular administration. Nonstandard Administration - CDC discourages deviating from the recom mended route, site, dosage, or nu mber of doses for any vacci ne. Deviation can result in reduced protection and increase the risk of an exaggerated local reaction. For certain vaccines, the ACIP recom mends revaccination if a nonstandard route or site is used. Larger than recom mended dosages can be hazar dous because of excessive local or systemic concentrati ons of antigens or other vaccine constitue nts deposited into the tissu e. Administering volu mes smaller than recom mended (e.g., inappropriately divided doses) might result in inadequate protection. Using reduced doses ad ministered at multiple vacci nation visits that equal a full dose or using smaller divided doses is not recommended. Any vacci nation using less t han the stan dard dose sh ould not be counted, and the person should be revaccinated accor ding to age unless serolo gic testing indicates that an adequate response has devel oped. If a partial dose of a parenteral vaccine is administered because the syringe or needle leaks or the patient jerks away, the dose sh ould be repeated. Hepatitis B vaccine administered by any route other than the intram uscular route, or in adults at any site other than the delto id or anterolateral thigh, should not be counted as valid and should be repeated. All vaccines should be administered by the manufacturer's recomm ended route, but there are no ACIP recomm endations to repeat doses of other vaccines ad ministered by another route. Managing Acute Vaccine Reacti ons - Severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions following vaccination are rare. Thorough scree ning for contraindicatio ns and preca utions prior to vaccination can often prevent reactions. Staff must have in place and be familiar with procedures for managing a reaction. Staff should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of anaphylax is because they usually begin within minutes of vaccination. These signs a nd symptoms can inclu de, but are not limited to: flushing, facial edema, urticaria, itchi ng, swelling of the mouth or throat, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each staff member should know their role in the event of an emergency and all vaccination providers should be certified in cardiopulm onary resuscitation (CPR). Epinephrine and equipm ent for maintaining an airway should be available for immediate use. Additional drugs may also be used. Documentation All vaccines administered should be fully documented in the healthcare personnel's employee health record. Best practice docu mentation guidelines for medicat ions include the abbreviations, http://www site. Accurate docu mentation can help prevent administration errors and curtail the nu mber and costs of excess vaccine doses ad ministered. Providers also should update the healthcare personnel records to reflect any docu mented episodes of adverse events after vaccination and any serologic test results related to vaccine -preventa ble diseases (e.g., those for rubella screening and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen). Particip ation in imm unization infor mation syste ms is encouraged. The healthcare personnel should be provided with an immunization record that includes the vaccines administered, including the dates of administr ation. Strategies to Prevent Administrati on Errors Vaccine administration errors can result in a person recei ving an ineffective imm unization. This can leave the person vulnerable to infection. In addition to strict adherence to the \"Rights of Medication Administration\" and ongoing training and education of staff, listed below are other strategies that can be imple mented to help prevent administration errors. When possible, involve staff in the selection of vaccine products to be used in your facility. Different brands of the same vaccine can have different schedules, age indications, or other indic ations. Stocking multip le brands might lead to staff confusion and vaccine administration errors. Keep curre nt refere nce materials available for s taff on each vaccine used in your facility. Keep reference sheets for ti ming and spacing, recommended sites, routes, and needle lengths posted for easy reference in your medication preparation area. Rotate vaccines so that those with the shortest expiration dates are in the front of the storage unit. Use these first and frequently check the storage unit to remove any expired vaccine. Consider the potential for product mix-ups when storing vaccines. Do not store sound -alike and look -alike vacci nes next to each other (e.g., DTaP and Tdap). Consider color coding labels on vaccine storage containers and/or including the vacci ne type and age indications. Administer only vaccines that you have prepared for ad ministration. Triple check your work before you ad minister a vaccine and ask other staff to do the same. Counsel healthcare personnel about vaccines to be administered and on how importa nt it is for them to maintain immunization records on all family members. Educated persons may notice a potential error and help prevent it. 0.2 mL (0.1 mL into each nostril)Administering Vaccines to Adults: Dose, Route, Site, Needle Size, and Preparation Tetanus, Diphtheria (Td) with Pertussis (Tdap) Measles, mumps, mL 0.5 mL mL 0.5 mLIMDeltoid muscle<19 yrs.: 0.5 mL >20 # P3084 (2/09)Vaccine Preparation Reconstitute just before using.

Note: Unused reconstituted MMR vaccine and multidose MPSV vaccine may be stored at 35-46\u00b0F (2-8\u00b0C) for a limited time. The recon - stituted MPSV vaccine must be used within 35 days; the reconstituted MMR vaccine must be used within 8 hours. Do not freeze either recon- stituted vaccine. Shake vial vigorously to obtain a uniform suspension prior to withdrawing each dose. Whenever solution and container permit, inspect vaccine visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration. If problems are noted (e.g., vaccine cannot be resuspended), the vaccine should not be administered. Please note: Always refer to the package insert included with each biologic for complete vaccine administration information.

For single-dose vaccine products (exceptions are Menomune in the multi- dose vial and Rotarix), select a syringe and a needle of proper length to be used for both reconstitution and administration of the vaccine. Following re - constitution, Menomune in a multi-dose vial will require a new needle and syringe for each dose of vaccine to be administered. For Rotarix, see the pack - age insert. 2. Before reconstituting, check labels on both the lyophilized vaccine vial and the diluent to verify the following: that they are the correct two products to mix together that the diluent is the correct volume (especially for Menomune in the multi-dose vial) that neither vaccine nor diluent has expired 3. Reconstitute (i.e., mix) vaccine just prior to use by removing the protective caps and wiping each stopper with an alcohol swab inserting needle of syringe into diluent vial and withdrawing entire contents injecting diluent into lyophilized vaccine vial and rotating or agitating to thoroughly dissolve the lyophilized powderVaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them Always refer to package inserts for detailed instructions on reconstituting specific vaccines. In general, follow these steps: 4. Check the appearance of the reconstituted vaccine. Reconstituted vaccine may be used if the color and appearance match the description on the package insert. If there is discoloration, extraneous particulate matter, obvious lack of resuspension, or cannot be thoroughly mixed, mark the vial as \"DO NOT USE,\" return it to proper storage conditions, and contact your state or local health department immunization program or the vaccine manufacturer. 5. If reconstituted vaccine is not used immediately or comes in a multi-dose vial (i.e., multi-dose Menomune), clearly mark the vial with the date and time the vaccine was reconstituted maintain the product at 35\u00b0-46\u00b0F (2\u00b0-8\u00b0C); do not freeze protect reconstituted vaccines from light use only within the time indicated on chart above The following vaccines must be reconstituted correctly before they are administered. Reconstitution means that the lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine powder or wafer in one vial must be reconstituted (mixed) with the diluent (liquid) in another. Only use the diluent provided by the manufacturer for that vaccine as indicated on the chart. ALWAYS check the expiration date on the diluent and vaccine. NEVER use expired diluent or vaccine. * If the reconstituted vaccine is not used within this time period, it must be discarded. Within 30 minutes or less. Rotarix vaccine is administered by mouth using the applicator that contains the diluent.

Vaccine package inserts and the full ACIP recommendations for these vaccines should be consulted for additional information on vaccine-related contraindications and precautions and for more information on vaccine excipients. Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administer - ing a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be administered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine should be administered. Whether and when to administer DTaP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on a case-by-case basis. 2. Hepatitis B vaccination should be deferred for preterm infants and infants weighing less than 2000 g if the mother is documented to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-neg - ative at the time of the infant's birth. Vaccination can commence at chronological age 1 month or at hospital discharge. For infants born to women who are HBsAg-positive, hepa - titis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 12 hours of birth, regardless of weight. 3.

Consider giving an analgesic (pain reliever) or antipruritic (anti-itch) medication.Reaction Symptoms ManagementAll vaccines have the potential to cause an adverse reaction. In order to minimize adverse reactions, patients should be care - fully screened for precautions and contraindications before vaccine is administered. Even with careful screening, reactions may occur. These reactions can vary from trivial and inconvenient (e.g., soreness, itching) to severe and life threatening (e.g., anaphylaxis). If reactions occur, staff should be prepared with procedures for their management. The table below describes procedures to follow if various reactions occur. (continued on page 2)Slight bleeding Continuous bleeding Place thick layer of gauze pads over site and maintain direct and firm pressure; raise the bleeding injection site (e.g., arm) above the level of the patient's heart.Apply an adhesive compress over the injection site. AnaphylaxisCheck the patient to determine if injury is present before attempting to move the patient. Place patient flat on back with feet elevated.

If itching and swelling are confined to the injection site where the vaccination was given, observe patient closely for the development of generalized symptoms. b. If symptoms are generalized, activate the emergency medical system (EMS; e.g., call 911) and notify the on-call physician. This should be done by a second person, while the primary nurse assesses the airway, breathing, circulation, and level of consciousness of the patient. c. Administer aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 dilution intramuscularly, 0.01 mL/kg/dose (adult dose ranges from 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL, with maximum single dose of 0.5 mL). d. In addition, for systemic anaphylaxis, administer diphenhydramine either orally or by intramuscular injection; the standard dose is 1-2 mg/kg, up to 100 mg maximum single dose. e. Monitor the patient closely until EMS arrives. Perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), if necessary, and maintain airway. Keep patient in supine position (flat on back) unless he or she is having breathing difficulty. If breathing is difficult, patient's head may be elevated, provided blood pressure is adequate to prevent loss of consciousness. If blood pressure is low, elevate legs. Monitor blood pressure and pulse every 5 minutes. f. If EMS has not arrived and symptoms are still present, repeat dose of epinephrine every 10-20 minutes for up to 3 doses, depending on patient's response. g. Record all vital signs, medications administered to the patient, including the time, dosage, response, and the name of the medical personnel who administered the medication, and other relevant clinical information. h. Notify the patient's primary care physician. Sources: 1. American Academy of Pediatrics. Passive Immunization. In: Pickering LK, ed.

These questions and scenarios have been gathered from a variety of sources including the 4th edition of the Team - Based Manual provided by the American College of Physici ans Guide to Adult Immunization, vaccine field representatives, infection preventionists and employee health/occupational health nurses. For additional information on how to best address these and other questions or situations , contact the local health department as well as review current APIC guidelines available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/default.htm Influenza Q. Who can receive the live attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist)? FluMist is indicated for immuniza tion of individuals 2 years to 49 years of age. It has not been adequately studied in persons 50 years of age and older. Q. Can healthcare workers receive FluMist? Yes, unless they are responsible for providing care for patients who are in protect ed environments due to their current receipt of a bone marrow transplant. Q. Does FluMist cause the flu? No. Flumist is engineered not to cause disease. It is attenuated (weakened) so it does not even cause influenza -like illness , although nasal stuffiness may occur following immunization . It is cold adapted so it r eplicates efficiently only in the cooler temperatures of the nasopharynx, and is temperature sensitive so it does not replicate efficiently in the warmer temperatures of the lower respiratory tract . Q. Does FluMist need to be readministered if the recipi ent sneezes after vaccination? No. Dripping, sneezing, or swallowing may occur after vaccination, but after administration, the spray effectively distributes the vaccine into the nasal cavity. 2 Q: Am I or others around me, at risk if the Live Attenuated I ntranasal Vaccine (LAIV) is inadvertently sprayed into the air? There have not been any reported cases of attenuated vaccine virus infections among patients or providers inadvertently exposed to the LAIV. However, prudent practice should include correct v accine administration techniques and not arbitrary spraying into the environment. Q: Can LAIV be administered to an employee if someone in the household is pregnant? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines state that having a pregnant household member is not a contraindication to LAIV vaccination. Further, it is also acceptable for nursing mothers to receive LAIV. Pregnant women should receive the inactivated vaccine TIV (trivalent inactivated influenza). Q: Can influenza vaccine be given with other vaccines? Yes. ACIP says TIV can be given with other inactivated or live vaccines. However, vaccines should be administered at different site and in a different syringe. If administering the LAIV, another live virus vaccine can be admi nistered at the same time (e.g., MMR), but if not given at the same time, let four weeks pass after administration of one live vaccine before administering another live vaccine. Q: Can influenza vaccine be given to persons who are receiving antiviral medi cations? The first thing to determine is what antivirals the recipient may be taking. If the antiviral agent(s) are for influenza (e.g., oseltamiv ir), TIV can be administered , but not LAIV. Those antiviral medications interfere with viral replication that is occurring in the nasal mucosa following LAIV administration. If the employee is currently taking an influenza antiviral (e.g., oseltamivir), do not administer LAIV until 48 hours after stopping antiviral medications. These antiviral medications should not be given until after two weeks after LAIV (unless medically necessary). Administering these antivirals before this two -week win dow may decrease vaccine effectiveness and repeat vaccination s hould be considered. Q: Can influenza vaccine be given to an employee who is immunodeficient? Yes. TIV inactivated influenza vaccine can and should be given to immunodeficient employees, but it is important for them, and their employer, to understand that they may not have as robust of an immunologic response after vaccination as do their immunocompetent counterparts. 3 Q: Is it safe for an employee to receive LAIV if someone in their household i s immunocompromised? It is important to ascertain the type of immunosuppression before deciding to vaccinate. In some cases it may be preferable for the household member to receive TIV instead. Tetanus Toxoid/Td/Tdap Q: Can an employee who has had pe rtussis get the disease again? Should you vaccinate someone with a history of pertussis infection? Employees who have a history of pertussis disease generally should receive Tdap according to the routine recommendation. Vaccination, regardless of history o f prior pertussis infection, is recommended because the duration of protection induced by natural disease is unknown. Waning of immunity can occur as early as seven years after infection. Administering pertussis vaccine to persons with a history of pertu ssis presents no theoretical risk so it should not be withheld. Q: Upon occasion, an employee sustains a tetanus -prone injury and requires immunization. Which vaccine should be given, Td or Tdap? Assuming that a prima ry series of the tetanus vaccine has been previously received (e.g., DTP/D TaP as childhood immunization) a dolescents and adults ages 10 to 64 years who require a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine as part of wound management should receive a single dose of Tdap instead of Td if they have not previously received Tdap. If Tdap is not available, then Td should be used. Adults generally over the age of 65 may receive Tda p if they have not received it, at the discretion of the provider. Q: When should an employee receive tetanus toxoid alone? Single antigen tetanus toxoid should only be used in the rare instance of a person with a documented prior severe allergic response to diphtheria toxoid. Meningococcus Q: How long does immunity last after vaccination? Immunity following administration of the meningococcal conjugate quadrivalent (MCV4) vaccines wanes after about five years. A 2 -dose series is recommended for some at -risk persons. 4 Hepatitis A Q: I realize that Hepatitis A imm unization is not a general recommendation for healthcare personnel, but what about the outbreaks that have involved food service workers? Should we make that group of employees an exception and provide them with the vaccine? Food -borne hepatitis A outbrea ks are relatively uncommon in the United States. Although food handlers have a critical role in common -source food borne outbreaks, they are not at increased risk of hepatitis A because of their occupation. Further, workers exposed to sewage (e.g., facilities maintenance) are not considered to be at increased risk. Routine infection prevention and control precautions are suitable for all healthcare personnel. In the event a community - wide outbreak was to occur, the state or local health department could request that certain groups be immunized. But immunizing this group as a part of your routine employee/occupational health program is outside the current ACIP recommendations. Hepatitis B Q: Can an employee receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine f orm one manufacturer and subsequent doses from another manufacturer? Yes. No differences in immune response are observed when vaccines from different manufacturers are used to complete the series. Q: Is it harmful to the employee to receive an extra dose(s ) of hepatitis A or hepatitis B vaccine or to repeat the entire vaccine series if documentation of the vaccination history is unavailable? No. If immunization history is unavailable, assume that the individual is susceptible and proceed with immunization. Q: When should post -Hepatitis B vaccination testing be performed? Post -vaccination testing for antibody to hepatitis B should generally be performed one to two months after completion of the vaccine series. If this is no evidence of sufficient response to the vaccine after two complete series, testing for chronic infection (testing for the antigen) should be the next step. Q: Is there any benefit or risk in vaccinating a person who has been infected with HBV? Persons who have already been infected with H BV will receive no benefit from vaccination. They will already have the antibody (immune) or the antigen (carrier). However, there is no risk to a previously infected person who receives vaccination. 5 Q: After receiving the hepatitis B vaccine series, what level of anti HBs is considered protective? Following immunization, an anti -HBs level of >10mlU/mL is considered protective. Know what your laboratory reports mean so you understand the results. Q: What should be done if hepatitis series is given but laboratory testing does not show seroconversion? The entire three- dose Hepatitis B series should be repeated then re -testing done for anti -HBs in one to two months after completion of the second series. If the test is still negative, the person may be initially viewed as a non -responder and should be considered to be susceptible to Hepatitis B infection until further investigation can be completed. They may be chronically infected , and not simply a non -responder, and an antigen test should be done. If the antigen test is negative, that person should be classified as a non -responder and counseling should be done to ensure they know how to prevent transmission to others. In addition, their job responsibilities should be evaluated to ensure that patients are protected. A comprehensi ve plan should be in place to assist with this complex process. Q: Do health care workers need to get additional Hepatitis B boosters if they demonstrated laboratory evidence of seroconversion after receiving the initial vaccine series even if current anti-HBs titer is less than 10 mlU/mL? Individuals who have seroconverted after a 3 dose series do not need a booster. These individuals are still protected because immune memory maintains anamnestic anti- HBs response. There is one exception to this rule, ho wever. If the healthcare worker is on hemodialysis, they should be retested each year. Generally this will be done as part of their medical care, so coordination of medical information will be important. Remember that healthcare personnel often experienc e the same health issues as the general public and may continue to work in order to maintain health insurance. Measles -Mumps -Rubella Q: Can MMR vaccine be administered on the same days as a tuberculin skin test (TST)? Yes. However, live MMR vaccine may in terfere with the immune response to tuberculin skin testing, if the TST test is administered more than one day following MMR administration. This effect is thought to last for only four to six weeks. 6 Q: If an employee is only susceptible to one of the thr ee viruses in the MMR vaccine, can the vaccine be given? There are no increased risks to giving the MMR vaccine even when the recipient is immune to one or more of its components. Q: What about antibody testing? Antibody testing is generally more expensi ve than the cost of the vaccine. Having an expectation that new employees provide immunization history is important to a cost efficient immunization program. Use of existing immunization registries can also provide rapid access to information. Q: Can the live viruses in the MMR vaccine be transmitted to others? There are no reports or evidence for transmission of MMR vaccine viruses. This means that healthcare personnel who are nursing mothers can safely receive MMR vaccine as can those who are close c ontacts/family members of immunocompromised individuals. Q: Why is recent blood product administration a contraindication for receipt of MMR vaccine? Immunogenicity, not safety, is the issue as the immune globulins in such products neutralize MMR vaccine viruses, preventing development of full immunity. Depending upon the blood product used, MMR vaccination should be delayed between three and 11 months. Q: Since measles vaccine virus, like influenza virus, is grown in chicken eggs, why is egg allergy not a contraindication to MMR vaccination? The quantities of any residual egg protein are so small that there has been no evidence of anaphylactic reaction in egg -allergic individuals directly challenged with MMR vaccine. In addition, the ACIP has issued new thoughts regarding egg allergy and influenza immunization so make sure policies reflect this rapidly changing ideology. Q: Can MMR vaccine be given to HIV -positive healthcare workers? MMR vaccine is indicated for all asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV -infecte d persons who do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression. For adolescents and adults, the total CD4+ T lymphocytes should be greater than 200/QL, or the CD4+ T lymphocytes should be greater than 14% of total lymphocytes. Administration of several vaccines is included in the care of HIV - infected individuals so coordination of medical treatment is important, if the healthcare worker will allow the sharing of that information. 7 Varicella Q: Can a nursing healthcare worker receive the varicella vaccine? Yes, varicella virus has not been observed to transmit through breast milk and passive transmission of antibodies through breast milk is not thought to occur. Q: Can a healthcare worker with HIV/AIDS be given the varicella vaccine? It depends on the CD4 co unts. Adult patients with absolute CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm^3 should not be given the vaccine. Patients whose CD4 cell count is above 200 cells/mm^3 may receive the vaccine. Again, immunization is likely to be part of that healthcare worker's routine medical care, so coordination and shared information is important, if the healthcare worker will allow. General information Q: What live viral vaccines are currently licensed and used in the United States for healthcare personnel immunization? Measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, herpes zoster, live attenuated influenza, and yellow fever vaccines are live viral vaccines. Zoster, smallpox and yellow fever vaccines are not routine healthcare personnel immunizations, but it is important that the employee/occupational health personnel know what additional live virus vaccines might have been given to employees for other purposes. Q: What live bacterial vaccines are licensed and used in the United States? Oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) and Bacillus Calmett e-Guerin (BCG) vaccine are live bacterial vaccines, but neither are included in routine healthcare personnel immunization programs. Q: What dose of corticosteroid is considered immunosuppressive? In general, the use of a steroid dose equivalent of either > 2 mg/kg of body weight or 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for persons who weigh >10 kg when administered for >2 weeks is thought to induce immunosuppression. ACIP states that \"vaccination providers should wait at least one month after discontinuation of high -dose systemically -absorbed corticosteroid therapy administered for more than two weeks before administering a live virus vaccine.\" Q: What if a healthcare worker has had their spleen removed? Are they at increased risk of a vaccine side effect? No. The vaccine side effect profile for each vaccine is the same as that of non -asplenics. 8 Q: Are any vaccines contraindicated for patients with asplenia? No. The only contraindications would be those otherwise true of any potential Q: Can multiple vaccines be administered on the same day? Yes. Multiple routine vaccines may be administered on the same day, but should be given using separate needles and at separate sites. If two vaccines are to be given in the same extremity, the injections should be given a t sites separated by at least one inch to help the clinician administering the vaccines determine the cause if there is a local reaction. Q: If a series of vaccines (e.g ., hepatitis B or MMR) is initiated but not completed, does the series need to be started again? If a vaccine series had not been completed, it does not have to be completely restarted. Pick up where it was left and continue according to the recommended schedule. Glossary of Terms Adjuvant: a chemical substance added to a vaccine in ord er to generate a stronger immune response Arthus: a type III hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by the deposition of immune (antigen- antibody) complexes in the walls of blood vessels, especially in the kidney or in serosal linings (such as pleura, peric ardium, synovium). It is named for Nicolas Maurice Arthus who, in the early 1900s, described the adverse reactions he noted when horse serum was injected subcutaneously into rabbits . Conjugate: a vaccine contain ing a chemical substance, frequently a protein, that is chemically bonded to the product in order to generate a more durable immune response. Contraindication: a condition for which a vaccine or other product should not be given. Relative contraindication s are those in which some exceptions can be made. Absolute contraindications are those in which no exceptions should be made under any circumstances. IgG: a long -lasting type of immunoglobulin or antibody found either late in the course of a first infec tion or vaccine exposure or after repeated exposures to it. IgM: a relatively short lived type of immunoglobulin or antibody found in persons with their first exposure to a microbe or vaccine. Immunosuppressive therapy: Treatments such a s radiation or chemotherapy that impair the normal antibody or cell- mediated response to an infection. When considering whether or not a vaccine recipient is taking immunosuppressive therapy, one accepted definition is two weeks or 9 more of daily receipt of 20 mg or more [or 2 mg/kg body weight or more] of prednisone or equivalent. Polysaccharide: a chemical compound with several sugar molecules chemically bonded together. Precaution: any measure taken to reduce the likelihood of an unwanted or potentially dangerous o utcome. Preservative: a chemical substance added to vaccine or other product to reduce the likelihood of microbial growth and thereby increase its shelf life. Toxoid: a toxin that is chemically altered to eliminate direct hazard to the body but that is still capable of generating a protective immune response to a future exposure to the toxin. Section 5 Healthcare Personnel (Vaccine Recipient) Information Information included in this section focuses on knowledge necessary for the vaccine recipient. It is important that the healthcare personnel receiving immunization also receive information about the vaccine and its effects. Likewise, the information prov ided must also proactively address questions and dispel myths such as the misperceptions regarding vaccines and autism. It is critical that the Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) provided to the receiving healthcare personnel be current, so immunizatio n processes must include a method that routinely and regularly seeks to identify updated VIS. This section includes the following documents: Vaccine Information Statements and Federal Law http:// www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2027.pdf Vaccine Information Statements (English) o Hepatitis B http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis Influenza, o Varicella http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/do What you should know http://www.chop.edu/export/download/pdfs/articles/vac cine-education- center/autism.pdf questions and address concerns that the recipient or the parent/legal representative may have. Use of the VIS is mandatory! Before a healthcare provider vaccinates a child or an adult with a dose of any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, mea - sles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), influenza, pneumococcal human papillomavirus (HPV), or varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, the provider is required by the National Child - hood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) to provide a copy of the VIS to either the adult recipient or to the child's parent/legal representative. How to get VISs All available VISs can be downloaded from the website of the Im - munization Action Coalition at www.immunize.org/vis or from CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm . Ready-to-copy versions may also be available from your state or local health department. You can find VISs in more than 30 languages on the Immuni - zation Action Coalition website at www.immunize.org/vis.

Most adverse reactions from vaccines are mild and self-limited. Serious complications are rare, but they can have a devastating effect on the recipient, family members, and the providers involved with the care of the patient. We must continue the efforts to make vaccines as safe as possible. Equally important is the need to furnish vaccine recipients (or the parents/legal representatives of minors) with objective information on vaccine safety and the diseases that the vaccines protect against, so that they are actively involved in making decisions affecting their health or the health of their children. When people are not informed about vaccine adverse events, even common, mild events, they can lose their trust in healthcare providers and vaccines. Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) provide a standardized way to present objective information about vaccine benefits and adverse events. What are VISs? VISs are developed by the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and undergo intense scrutiny by panels of experts for accuracy. Each VIS provides information to properly inform the adult vaccine recipient or the mi nor child's parent or legal representative about the risks and benefits of each vaccine. VISs are not meant to replace interactions with health care providers, who should answer (Page 1 of 2)Multi-vaccine VIS .......................................................................... 9/18/08 (for 6 vaccines versions of VISs As of November 2011, the most recent versions of the VISs are as follows: According to CDC, every time one of these vaccines is given \u2014 regardless of what combination vaccine it is given in \u2014 regard - less of whether it is given by a public health clinic or a private provider \u2014 regardless of how the vaccine was purchased \u2014 and regardless of the age of the recipient \u2014 the appropriate VIS must be given out prior to the vaccination. Source: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/vis-facts.htmPage 2 of 2 It's Federal Law . . . you must give your patients current (PCV), polio (IPV), or rotavirus (RV). The multi-vaccine VIS can also be used when giving combination vaccines (e.g., Pediarix, Pentacel, Comvax) or when giving two or more routine vaccines at other pediatric visits (e.g., 12-15 months, 4-6 years). However, when giving combination vaccines for which no VIS ex - ist (e.g., Twinrix), give out all relevant single VISs. For example, before administering Twinrix give your patient the VISs for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines. Fact 6 VISs are available in other formats, including more than 30 languages You may use laminated copies of VISs for patients and parents to read and return before leaving the clinic, but you must also offer the patient (parent/legal representative) a printed copy of the VIS to take home. If they prefer to download the VIS onto a mobile device, direct them to CDC's VIS Mobile Downloads web page: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/Pubs/vis/vis-downloads.htm To download VISs in other languages, visit www.immunize.org/vis Fact 7 Federal law does not require signed consent in or- der for a person to be vaccinated Signed consent is not required by federal law (although some states may require them). Fact 8 To verify that a VIS was given, providers must re- cord in the patient's chart (or permanent office log or file) the following information: The published date of the VIS The date the VIS is given to the patient Name, address (office address), and title of the person who administers the vaccine The date the vaccine is administered The vaccine manufacturer and lot number of each dose admin- istered Fact 9 VISs should not be altered before giving them to patients Providers should not change a VIS or write their own VISs. It is permissible to add a practice's name, address, or phone number to an existing VIS. Providers are encouraged to supplement the VIS with additional patient-education materials. Fact 10 Provide English-language VISs to all patients (even if the patient's first language is not English) For patients who don't read or speak English, the law requires that providers ensure all patients (parent/legal representatives) receive the appropriate VIS, regardless of their ability to read English. If available, provide a translation of the VIS in the patient's language as well. Translations of VISs in more than 30 languages are available from IAC. Go to www.immunize.org/vis for VISs in multiple languages as well as in other formats.Top 10 Facts about VISs Fact 1 It's federal law! Federal law requires that VISs must be used for the fol - lowing vaccines when vaccinating patients of ALL ages: DTaP (includes DT) Td/Tdap Hib hepatitis A hepatitis B HPV influenza (inactivated and live vaccines) According to CDC, every time one of these vaccines is given \u2014 regardless of what com - bination vaccine it is given in \u2014 regardless of whether it is given by a public health clinic or a private provider \u2014 regardless of how the vac - cine was purchased \u2014 and regardless of the age of the recipient \u2014 the appropriate VIS must be given out prior to the vaccination. There are also VISs for vaccines not covered by NCVIA: anthrax, Japanese encephalitis, pneumococcal polysaccharide, rabies, shingles, smallpox, typhoid, and yellow fe - ver. CDC recommends the use of VISs whenever these vaccines are given. The VIS must always be used if vaccine was purchased under CDC contract. Fact 2 VISs are required for both public and private sec- tors Federal law requires use of VISs in both the public and private sec - tor settings and regardless of the source of payment for the vaccine. Fact 3 VIS must be provided BEFORE vaccine is admi- nistered to the patient The VIS provides information about the disease and the vaccine and should be given to the patient before vaccine is administered. It is also acceptable to hand out the VIS well before administering vaccines (e.g., at a prenatal visit or at birth for vaccines an infant will receive during infancy), as long as you still provide the VIS right before administering vaccines. Fact 4 You must provide a current VIS for each dose of vaccine The most current VIS must be provided before each dose of vaccine is given, including vaccines given as a series of doses. If five doses of a single vaccine are required, the patient (parent/legal representa - tive) must have the opportunity to read the information on the VIS before each dose is given. Fact 5 You must provide VISs for combination vaccines too There is a VIS available for MMRV (ProQuad). An alternative VIS \u2014 the multi-vaccine VIS \u2014 is an option to providing single- vaccine VISs when administering one or more of these routine birth-through-6-month vaccines: DTaP, hepatitis B, Hib, pneumo - Immunization Action Ave. using the VISs with your patients, you are helping to develop a better educated patient population and you are doing the right thing.VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT Hepatitis B Vaccine What You Need to KnowMany Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de 1What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious infection that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus. In 2009, about 38,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. Each year about 2,000 to 4,000 people die in the United States from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Hepatitis B can cause: Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: loss of appetite diarrhea and vomiting tiredness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness, with symptoms, is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not have symptoms. Chronic (long-term) infection . Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Most of them do not have symptoms, but the infection is still very serious, and can lead to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are chronically infected can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they don't look or feel sick. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B virus is easily spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also be infected from contact with a contami - nated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days. A baby whose mother is infected can be infected at birth; Children, adolescents, and adults can become infected by: - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes, razors, or monitoring and treatment devices for diabetes; - having unprotected sex with an infected person; - sharing needles when injecting drugs; - being stuck with a used needle.2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of hepatitis B infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. Hepatitis B vaccine may be given by itself or in the same shot with other vaccines. Routine hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for some U.S. adults and children beginning in 1982, and for all children in 1991. Since 1990, new hepatitis B infections among children and adolescents have dropped by more than 95% - and by 75% in other age groups. Vaccination gives long-term protection from hepatitis B infection, possibly lifelong. 3Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when? Children and Adolescents Babies normally get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine: 1st Dose: Birth 2nd Dose: 1-2 months of age 3rd Dose: 6-18 months of age Some babies might get 4 doses, for example, if a combination vaccine containing hepatitis B is used. (This is a single shot containing several vaccines.) The extra dose is not harmful. Anyone through 18 years of age who didn't get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with hepatitis B, - men who have sex with men, - people who inject street drugs, - people with more than one sex partner, - people with chronic liver or kidney disease, - people under 60 years of age with diabetes, - people with jobs that expose them to human blood or other body fluids, - household contacts of people infected with hepatitis B, - residents and staff in institutions for the developmen- tally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients, - people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. Other people may be encouraged by their doctor to get hepatitis B vaccine; for example, adults 60 and older with diabetes. Anyone else who wants to be protected from hepatitis B infection may get the vaccine. Pregnant women who are at risk for one of the reasons stated above should be vaccinated. Other pregnant women who want protection may be vaccinated. Adults getting hepatitis B vaccine should get 3 doses \u2014 with the second dose given 4 weeks after the first and the third dose 5 months after the second. Your doctor can tell you about other dosing schedules that might be used in certain circumstances. 4Who should not get hepatitis B vaccine? Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information about these precautions. Note: You might be asked to wait 28 days before donating blood after getting hepatitis B vaccine. This is because the screening test could mistake vaccine in the bloodstream (which is not infectious) for hepatitis B infection. 5What are the risks from hepatitis B vaccine? Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The vaccine contains non-infectious material, and cannot cause hepatitis B infection. Some mild problems have been reported: Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). Temperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15).Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people in the United States have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine. 6What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or unusual behavior. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 7The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 8How can I learn more? Ask your doctor They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de LAIV?3 Infl uenza (\"flu\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the in fluenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get in fluenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: fever/chills sore throat muscle aches fatigue cough headache runny or stuffy nose Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for in fluenza. Young children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from influenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting flu vaccine you can protect yourself from influenza and may also avoid spreading in fluenza to others. Live, attenuated in fluenza vaccine - LAIV (nasal spray)2 There are types of in fl uenza vaccine: 1. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains live but attenuated (weakened) in fluenza virus. It is sprayed into the nostrils. 2. Inactivated (killed) in fluenza vaccine, the \" flu shot,\" is given by injection with a needle. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. Influenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including flu viruses not contained in the vaccine. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the vaccination. Protection lasts about a year. LAIV does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives. LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 through 49 years of age, who are not pregnant and do not have certain health conditions (see #4, below). Some people should not receive LAIV4 LAIV is not recommended for everyone. The following people should get the inactivated vaccine ( flu shot) instead: Adults 50 years of age and older or children from 6 through 23 months of age . (Children younger than 6 months should not get either in fl uenza vaccine.) Children younger than 5 years with asthma or one or more episodes of wheezing within the past year. Pregnant women. People who have long-term health problems with: - heart disease - kidney or liver disease - lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes - asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. Anyone with a weakened immune system. Anyone in close contact with someone whose immune system is so weak they require care in a protected environment (such as a bone marrow transplant unit). Close contacts of other people with a weakened immune system (such as those with HIV) may receive LAIV . Healthcare personnel in neonatal intensive care units or oncology clinics may receive LAIV . Children or adolescents on long-term aspirin treatment. Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to in fluenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of infl uenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. Tell your doctor if you have gotten any other vaccines in the past 4 weeks. Anyone with a nasal condition serious enough to make breathing dif cult, such as a very stuffy nose, should get the flu shot instead. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. When should I receive infl uenza vaccine? 5 Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur any time, but most in fluenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be bene cial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of in fl uenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. What are the risks from LAIV?6 A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Live in fluenza vaccine viruses very rarely spread from person to person. Even if they do, they are not likely to cause illness. LAIV is made from weakened virus and does not cause influenza. The vaccine can cause mild symptoms in people who get it (see below). Mild problems: Some children and adolescents 2-17 years of age have reported: runny nose, nasal congestion or cough fever headache and muscle aches wheezing abdominal pain or occasional vomiting or diarrhea Some adults 18-49 years of age have reported: runny nose or nasal congestion sore throat cough, chills, tiredness/weakness headache Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. If rare reactions occur with any product, they may not be identi ed until thousands, or millions, of people have used it. Millions of doses of LAIV have been distributed since it was licensed, and the vaccine has not been associated with any serious problems. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

Inactivated (killed) vaccine, the \"flu shot,\" is given by injection with a needle. 2. Live, attenuated (weakened) influenza vaccine is sprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. A \"high-dose\" inactivated influenza vaccine is available for people 65 years of age and older. Ask your doctor for more information. Influenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including flu viruses not contained in the vaccine. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts about a year. Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains a preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal-free influenza vaccine is available. Ask your doctor for more information. 3 Who should get inactivated influenza vaccine and when? WHO All people 6 months of age and older should get flu vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of severe influenza and their close contacts, including healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months. WHEN Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur at any time, but most influenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be beneficial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of influenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. 4 Some people should not get inactivated influenza vaccine or should wait Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to influenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of influenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. 5 What are the risks from inactivated influenza vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from inactivated influenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. Mild problems: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough fever aches headache itching fatigue If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Moderate problems: Young children who get inactivated flu vaccine and pneu - mococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time appear to be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information. Tell your doctor if a child who is getting flu vaccine has ever had a seizure. Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated influenza (swine flu) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current flu vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. One brand of inactivated flu vaccine, called Afluria, should not be given to children 8 years of age or younger, except in special circumstances. A related vaccine was associated with fevers and fever-related seizures in young children in Australia. Your doctor can give you more information. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

See www.immunize.org/vis. Why get vaccinated?1 Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Measles Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death. Mumps Mumps virus causes fever, headache, and swollen glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, rarely, death. Rubella (German Measles) Rubella virus causes rash, mild fever, and arthritis (mostly in women). If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. Y ou or your child could catch these diseases by being around someone who has them. They spread from per\u00adson to person through the air. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent these diseases. Most children who get their MMR shots will not get these diseases. Many more children would get them if we stopped vaccinating. Who should get MMR vaccine and when? 2 - Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: The first at 12-15 months of age - and the second at 4-6 years of age . These are the recommended ages. But children can get the second dose at any age, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have had either the vaccines or the diseases. Ask your provider for more information. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. 3Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait People should not get MMR vaccine who have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or to a previous dose of MMR vaccine. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get MMR vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after getting MMR vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get MMR vaccine, including anyone who: -Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system -Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer . -Has any kind of cancer -Is taking cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs -Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder) People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get MMR vaccine Ask your provider for more information. 4 What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing seri\u00ad ous problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting any of these three diseases. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any problems with it. Mild Problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare) If these problems occur, it is usually within 7-12 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) T emporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) T emporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child gets MMR vaccine. But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. These include: -Deafness -Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness -Permanent brain damage Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and feverin about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reportedmore often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5 What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.

See www.immunize.org/vis http://www.immunize.org/vis 1 Why get vaccinated? Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis can be very serious diseases. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle spasms and stiffness, usually all over the body. It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected. DIPHTHERIA can cause a thick membrane to cover the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells which can lead to difficulty breathing, vomiting, and disturbed sleep. It can lead to weight loss, incontinence, rib fractures and passing out from violent coughing. Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, including pneumonia and death. These three diseases are all caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds. The United States saw as many as 200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and pertussis before vaccines were available, and hundreds of cases of tetanus. Since then, tetanus and diphtheria cases have dropped by about 99% and pertussis cases by about 92%. Children 6 years of age and younger get DTaP vaccine to protec t them from these three diseases. But older children, adolescents, and adults need protection too. 2 Vaccines for adolescents and adults: Td and Tdap Two vaccines are available to protect people 7 years of age and older from these diseases: Td vaccine has been used for many years. It protects against tetanus and diphtheria. Tdap vaccine was licensed in 2005. It is the first vaccine for adolescents and adults that protects against pertussis as well as tetanus and diphtheria. A Td booster dose is recommended every 10 years. Tdap is given only once. 3 Which vaccine, and when? Ages 7 through 18 years A dose of Tdap is recommended at age 11 or 12. This dose could be given as early as age 7 for children who missed one or more childhood doses of DTaP. Children and adolescents who did not get a complete series of DTaP shots by age 7 should complete the series using a combination of Td and Tdap. Age 19 years and Older All adults should get a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Adults under 65 who have never gotten Tdap should get a dose of Tdap as their next booster dose. Adults 65 and older may get one booster dose of Tdap. Adults (including women who may become pregnant and adults 65 and older) who expect to have close contact with a baby younger than 12 months of age should get a dose of Tdap to help protect the baby from pertussis. Healthcare professionals who have direct patient contact in hospitals or clinics should get one dose of Tdap. Protection After a Wound A person who gets a severe cut or burn might need a dose of Td or Tdap to prevent tetanus infection. Tdap should be used for anyone who has never had a dose previously. Td should be used if Tdap is not available, or for: - anybody who has already had a dose of Tdap, - children 7 through 9 years of age who completed the childhood DTaP series, or - adults 65 and older. Pregnant Women Pregnant women who have never had a dose of Tdap should get one, after the 20th week of gestation and preferably during the 3rd trimester. If they do not get Tdap during their pregnancy they should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery. Pregnant women who have previously received Tdap and need tetanus or diphtheria vaccine while pregnant should get Td. Tdap or Td may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 4 Some people should not be vaccinated or should wait Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis containing vaccine should not get Td or Tdap. Anyone who has a severe allergy to any component of a vaccine should not get that vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine has any severe allergies. Anyone who had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a dose of DTP or DTaP should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found. These people may get Td. Talk to your doctor if the person getting either vaccine: - has epilepsy or another nervous system problem, - had severe swelling or severe pain after a previous dose of DTP, DTaP, DT, Td, or Tdap vaccine, or - has had Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Anyone who has a moderate or severe illness on the day the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting Tdap or Td vaccine. A person with a mild illness or low fever can usually be vaccinated. 5 What are the risks from Tdap and Td vaccines? With a vaccine, as with any medicine, there is always a small risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction or other serious problem. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking movements) can happen after any medical procedure, includ-ing vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls. Tell your doctor if the patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears. Getting tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis disease would be much more likely to lead to severe problems than getting either Td or Tdap vaccine. Problems reported after Td and Tdap vaccines are listed below. Mild Problems (Noticeable, but did not interfere with activities) Tdap Pain (about 3 in 4 adolescents and 2 in 3 adults) Redness or swelling at the injection site (about 1 in 5) Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in 25 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Headache (about 4 in 10 adolescents and 3 in 10 adults) Tiredness (about 1 in 3 adolescents and 1 in 4 adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in 4 adolescents and 1 in 10 adults) Chills, body aches, sore joints, rash, swollen glands (uncommon) Td Pain (up to about 8 in 10) Redness or swelling at the injection site (up to about 1 in 3) Mild fever (up to about 1 in 15) Headache or tiredness (uncommon) Moderate Problems (Interfered with activities, but did not require medical attention) Tdap Pain at the injection site (about 1 in 20 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Red ness or swellin g at the injection site (up to about 1 in 16 adolescents and 1in 25 adults) Fever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 250 adults) Headache (1 in 300) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 3 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Td Fever over 102\u00b0F (rare) Tdap or Td Extensive swelling of the arm where the shot was given (up to about 3 in 100). Severe Problems (Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention) Tdap or Td Swelling, severe pain, bleeding and redness in the arm where the shot was given (rare). A severe allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine. They are estimated to occur less than once in a million doses. 6 What if there is a severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction or a high fever. If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what h appened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986.

See www.immunize.org/vis. 1Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. 2Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-Up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your provider. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both chickenpox and MMR vac\u00ad cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: -Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system -Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer -Has any kind of cancer -Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your provider for more information. Chickenpox 3/13/08 4 What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild Problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe Problems Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reac\u00adtions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.

See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and the spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000 - 1,200 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 11%-19% lose their arms or legs, have problems with their nervous systems, become deaf or mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people 16-21 years. Children with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen, have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. College freshmen living in dorms are also at increased risk. Meningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such as penicillin. Still, many people who get the disease die from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2 Meningococcal vaccine There are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4) is the preferred vaccine for people 55 years of age and younger. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s. It is the only meningo- coccal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. Both vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. There are other types of meningococcal disease; the vaccines do not protect against these . Who should get meningococcalvaccine and when? 3 Routine Vaccination Two doses of MCV4 are recommended for adolescents 11 through 18 years of age: the rst dose at 11 or 12 years of age, with a booster dose at age 16. Adolescents in this age group with HIV infection should get three doses: 2 doses 2 months apart at 11 or 12 years, plus a booster at age 16. If the rst dose (or series) is given between 13 and 15 years of age, the booster should be given between 16 and 18. If the rst dose (or series) is given after the 16th birthday, a booster is not needed. Other People at Increased Risk College freshmen living in dormitories. Laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world where meningococcal disease is common, such as parts of Africa. Anyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleen has been removed. Anyone who has persistent complement component deciency (an immune system disorder). People who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. Children between 9 and 23 months of age, and anyone else with certain medical conditions need 2 doses for adequate protection. Ask your doctor about the number and timing of doses, and the need for booster doses. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people in these groups who are 9 months through 55 years of age. MPSV4 can be used for adults older than 55. 4 Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of MCV4 or MPSV4 vaccine should not get another dose of either vaccine. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. MCV4 is a fairly new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be used only if clearly needed. The manufacturers of MCV4 maintain pregnancy registries for women who are vaccinated while pregnant. Except for children with sickle cell disease or without a working spleen, meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking or seizure-like movements) can follow a vaccination. They happen most often with adolescents, and they can result in falls and injuries. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after getting the shot - especially if you feel faint - can help prevent these injuries. Mild problems As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a mild fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. 6 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction or a high fever. If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.

VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT Polio Vaccine What You Need to Know Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Hojas de http://www.immunize.org/vis 1 What is polio? Polio is a disease caused by a virus. It enters the body through the mouth. Usually it does not cause serious illness. But sometimes it causes paralysis (can't move arm or leg), and it can cause meningitis (irritation of the lining of the brain). It can kill people who get it, usually by paralyzing the muscles that help them breathe. Polio used to be very common in the United States. It paralyzed and killed thousands of people a year before we had a vaccine. 2 Why get vaccinated? Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) can prevent polio. History: A 1916 polio epidemic in the United States killed 6,000 people and paralyzed 27,000 more. In the early 1950's there were more than 25,000 cases of polio reported each year. Polio vaccination was begun in 1955. By 1960 the number of reported cases had dropped to about 3,000, and by 1979 there were only about 10. The success of polio vaccination in the U.S. and other countries has sparked a world-wide effort to eliminate polio. Today: Polio has been eliminated from the United States. But the disease is still common in some parts of the world. It would only take one person infected with polio virus coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccine. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won't need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Who should get polio vaccine3 and when? IPV is a shot, given in the leg or arm, depending on age. It may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children Children get 4 doses of IPV , at these ages: A dose at 2 months A dose at 4 months A dose at 6-18 months A booster dose at 4-6 years Some \"combination\" vaccines (several different vaccines in the same shot) contain IPV . Children getting these vaccines may get one more (5th) dose of polio vaccine. This is not a problem. Adults Most adults 18 and older do not need polio vaccine because they were vaccinated as children. But some adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination: (1) people traveling to areas of the world where polio is common, (2) laboratory workers who might handle polio virus, and (3) health care workers treating patients who could have polio. Adults in these three groups: who have never been vaccinated against polio should get 3 doses of IPV: -Two doses separated by 1 to 2 months, and -A third dose 6 to 12 months after the second. who have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine in the past should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. 4 It doesn't matter how long it has been since the earlier dose(s). who have had 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in the past may get a booster dose of IPV . Your doctor can give you more information. Some people should not get IPV or should wait. These people should not get IPV: Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to any component of IPV , including the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, should not get polio vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who had a severe allergic reaction to a previous polio shot should not get another one. These people should wait: Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting polio vaccine. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. Ask your doctor for more information. 5 What are the risks from IPV? Some people who get IPV get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people don't have any problems at all with it. However, any medicine could cause a serious side effect, such as a severe allergic reaction or even death. The risk of polio vaccine causing serious harm is extremely small. What if there is a moderate or severe problem? What should I look for? Look for any unusual condition, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever, or unusual behavior. If a serious allergic reaction occurred, it would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reac\u00adtion can include dif culty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat.

What are the symptoms of autism? A. Symptoms of autism, which typically appear during the rst few years of life, include dif culties with behavior, social skills and communication. Speci cally, children with autism may have dif culty interacting socially with parents, siblings and other people; have dif culty with transitions and need routine; engage in repetitive behaviors such as hand fl apping or rocking; display a preoccupation with activities or toys; and suffer a heightened sensitivity to noise and sounds. Autism spectrum disorders vary in the type and severity of the symptoms they cause, so two children with autism may not be affected in quite the same way. Q. What causes autism? A. The speci c cause or causes of autism in all children are not known. But one thing is clear: autism spectrum disorders are highly genetic. Researchers gured this out by studying twins. They found that when one identical twin had autism, the chance that the second twin had autism was greater than 90 percent. But when one fraternal twin had autism, the chance that the second twin had autism was less than 10 percent. Because identical twins have identical genes and fraternal twins don't, these studies proved the genetic basis of autism. More recently, researchers have successfully identi ed some of the speci c genes that cause autism. Some parents wonder whether environmental factors - de ned as anything other than genetic factors - can cause autism. It's possible. For example, researchers found that thalidomide, a sedative, can cause autism if used during early pregnancy. Also, if pregnant women are infected with rubella virus (German measles) during early pregnancy, their babies are more likely to have autism.Volume 1 Summer 2008Vaccines and Autism: What you should know Some parents of children with autism are concerned that vaccines are the cause. Their concerns center on three areas: the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine; thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative previously contained in several vaccines; and the notion that babies receive too many vaccines too soon. Q. Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? A. No. In 1998, a British researcher named Andrew Wake eld raised the notion that the MMR vaccine might cause autism. In the medical journal The Lancet , he reported the stories of eight children who developed autism and intestinal problems soon after receiving the MMR vaccine. To determine whether Wake eld's suspicion was correct, researchers performed a series of studies comparing hundreds of thousands of children who had received the MMR vaccine with hundreds of thousands who had never received the vaccine. They found that the risk of autism was the same in both groups. The MMR vaccine didn't cause autism. Furthermore, children with autism were not more likely than other children to have bowel problems. Q. Does thimerosal cause autism? A. No. Multiple studies have shown that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. Thimerosal is a mercury- containing preservative that was used in vaccines to prevent contamination. In 1999, professional groups called for thimerosal to be removed from vaccines as a precaution. Unfortunately, the precipitous removal of thimerosal from all but some multidose preparations of infl uenza vaccine scared some parents. Clinicians were also confused by the recommendation. Since the removal of thimerosal, six studies have been performed to determine whether thimerosal causes autism. Again, hundreds of thousands of children who received thimerosal-containing vaccines were compared to hundreds of thousands of children who received the same vaccines free of thimerosal. The results were clear: The risk of autism was the same in both groups.

Are the studies showing that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosal causes autism sensitive enough to detect the problem in small numbers of children? A. The studies showing that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosal causes autism, called epidemiological studies, are very sensitive. For example, epidemiological studies have shown that a rotavirus vaccine used between 1998 and 1999 in the United States caused intestinal blockage in 1 out of every 10,000 vaccine recipients; that measles vaccine caused a reduction in the number of cells needed to stop bleeding (platelets) in 1 out of every 25,000 recipients; and that an infl uenza (swine fl u) vaccine used in the United States in 1976 caused a type of paralysis called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in 1 out of every 100,000 recipients. About 1 out of every 150 children in the United States is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Even if vaccines caused autism in only 1 percent of those children - meaning 1 out of every 15,000 children - the problem would have easily been detected by epidemiological studies. Q. Is autism caused by children receiving too many vaccines too soon? A. Several facts make it very unlikely that babies are overwhelmed by too many vaccines given too early in life. First, before they are licensed, new vaccines are always tested alone or in combination with existing vaccines. These studies determine whether new vaccines alter the safety and ef cacy of existing vaccines and, conversely, whether existing vaccines affect the new vaccine. These studies, called concomitant use studies, are performed every time a new vaccine is added to the existing vaccination schedule. Second, although the number of vaccines has increased dramatically during the past century, the number of immunological components in vaccines has actually decreased. One hundred years ago, children received just one vaccine, for smallpox. The smallpox vaccine contained about 200 immunological components. Today, with advances in protein puri cation and recombinant DNA technology, the 14 vaccines given to young children contain only about 150 immunological components. Third, the immunological challenge from vaccines is minuscule compared to what babies typically encounter every day. The womb is sterile, containing no bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. But when babies leave the womb and enter the world, they are immediately colonized by trillions of bacteria that live on the linings of their nose, throat, skin and intestines. Each bacterium contains between 2,000 and 6,000 immunological components. And babies often make an immune response to these bacteria to prevent them from entering the bloodstream and causing harm. The challenge that vaccines present is tiny in comparison to that from the environment. Fourth, children have an enormous capacity to respond to immunological challenges. Susumu Tonegawa, a molecular biologist who won a Nobel Prize for his work, showed that people have the capacity to make between 1 billion and 100 billion different types of antibodies. Given the number of immunological components contained in modern vaccines, a conservative estimate would be that babies have the capacity to respond to about 100,000 different vaccines at once. Although this sounds like a huge number, when you consider the number of challenges that babies face from bacteria in their environment, it's not. Here's another way to understand the difference in scale between immunological challenges from vaccines and natural challenges from the environment. The quantity of bacteria that live on body surfaces is measured in grams (a gram is the weight of about one- fth of a teaspoon of water). The quantity of immunological components contained in vaccines is measured in micrograms or nanograms (millionths or billionths of a gram). Q. If I am concerned that vaccines cause autism, what is the harm in delaying or withholding vaccines for my baby? A. All of the evidence shows that vaccines don't cause autism, so delaying or withholding vaccines will not lessen the risk of autism; it will only increase the period of time during which children are at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Several of these diseases, like chickenpox, pertussis (whooping cough) and pneumococcus (which causes bloodstream infections, pneumonia and meningitis) are still fairly common. Delaying or withholding vaccines only increases the time during which children are at unnecessary risk for severe and occasionally fatal infections.Autism References Bailey A, LeCouteur A, Gottesman I, et al.

This section focuses on providing some background information regarding the importance of electronic health records, including immunizations. In addition a sampl e document is provided that can be used to maintain a record of all healthcare personnel immunizations. Since improving influenza immunization rates remains a patient safety focus and the need to evaluate and improve healthcare personnel immunization rate s, a sample influenza vaccination declination form is provided. The following documents are provided in this section: Electronic Health Records and Immunization Registries Sample Healthcare Personnel Immunization Record Sample Adult Vaccine Record Example of a Lifetime Immunization Record http://www.immunize.org/images/LifetimeCard.pdf Sample Influenza Vaccination Declination Form Electronic Health Records and Immunization Registries In the 2011 ACIP Immunization of Health -Care Personnel guideline update, there is a reminder statement that HICPAC and CDC have recommended that \"secure, preferably computerized, systems should be used to manage vaccination records for healthcare personnel so records can be retrieved easily as needed\". The guideline goes on to describe what information should be included in the record, the use of records as a means of rapidly identifying susceptible healthcare personnel, and the importance of ensuring that every healthcare personnel have their immunization records so they can be made available to future employers and maintained as part of their own personal health records. In order to ensure adequate im munization and quickly determine susceptibility, employee/occupational health records must be accessible, contain consistent information, be rapidly retrievable, and be maintained in a manner that enables the data to be aggregated for analysis. Clearly, t he old method of paper and pen recordkeeping is no long acceptable. Consequently, it is important that the individual(s) responsible for the healthcare personnel immunization program explore then utilize methods of maintaining these important health recor ds in an electronic format. At present, there exist a number of possibilities for accomplishing the goal of electronic employee/occupational health records. Proprietary software exists that can be customized to maintain records, generate reports and reminders. Most states also maintain immunization registries that, although not focused on healthcare personnel immunization recordkeeping, may allow for crossover use . Facilities may wish to utilize software that is currently available and in use within thei r facility such as Microsoft products (e.g., Excel or Access). The individual(s) responsible for the program should explore the alternatives and select a method that ensures records are accessible, consist, retrievable and available for analysis.

I acknowledge that I am aware of the following facts: Influenza is a serious respiratory disease that kills thousands of people in the United States each year. Influenza vaccination is recommended for me and all other healthcare workers to protect this facility's patients from influenza, its complications, and death. If I contract influenza, I can shed the virus for 24 hours before influenza symptoms appear. My shedding the virus can spread influenza to patients in this facility. If I become infected with influenza, I can spread severe illness to others even when my symptoms are mild or non-existent. I understand that the strains of virus that cause influenza infection change almost every year and, even if they don't change, my immunity declines over time. This is why vaccination against influenza is recommended each year. I understand that I cannot get influenza from the influenza vaccine. The consequences of my refusing to be vaccinated could have life-threatening consequences to my health and the health of those with whom I have contact, including all patients in this healthcare facility my coworkers my family my community Despite these facts, I am choosing to decline influenza vaccination right now for the following reasons: ____________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ I understand that I can change my mind at any time and accept influenza vaccination, if vaccine is still available.

Vaccin e Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Influenza, Storage and Handling Policies 1. We have designated a primary vaccine coordinator and at least one back-up coordinator to be in charge of vaccine storage and handling at our facility. 2. Both the primary and back-up vaccine coordinator(s) have completely reviewed either CDC's online vaccine storage and handling guidance or equivalent training materials offered by our state health department's immunization program. 3. We have detailed, up-to-date, written policies for general vaccine management, including policies for routine activities and an emergency vaccine-retrieval-and-storage plan for power outages and other problems. Our policies are based on CDC's vaccine storage and handling guidance and/or on instruction from our state or local health department's immunization program. 4. We review these policies with all staff annually and with new staff, including temporary staff, when they are hired. Log In New Vaccine Shipments 5. We maintain a vaccine inventory log that we use to document the following: a. Vaccine name and number of doses received b. Date we received the vaccine c. Condition of vaccine when we received it d. Vaccine manufacturer and lot number e. Vaccine expiration date Use Proper Storage Equipment 6. We store vaccines in refrigerator and freezer units designed specifically for storing biologics, including vaccines. Alternatively, we keep frozen and refrigerated vaccines in separate, free-standing freezer and refrigerator units. At a minimum, we use a household-style unit with a separate exterior door for the freezer and separate thermostats for the freezer and refrigerator. We do NOT use a dormitory-style unit (a small combination freezer-refrigerator unit with a freezer compartment inside the refrigerator). 7. We use only calibrated thermometers with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration* that are recalibrated as recommended by the manufacturer. 8. We have planned back-up storage unit(s) in the event of a power failure or other unforeseen event. We perform regular maintenance to assure optimal functioning. Ensure Optimal Operation of Storage Units 9. We have a \"Do Not Unplug\" sign next to the electrical outlets for the refrigerator and freezer and a \"Do Not Stop Power\" warning label by the circuit breaker for the electrical outlets. Both include emergency contact information. 10. We keep the storage unit clean, dusting the coils and cleaning beneath it every 3-6 months.Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling Here are the most important things you can do to safeguard your vaccine supply.

We always keep at least one accurate calibrated thermometer (+/-1\u00baC [+/-2\u00baF]) with the vaccines in the refrigerator; ideally, we have a continuous-temperature logger and/or temperature-sensitive alarm system. 12. We maintain the refrigerator temperature at 35-46\u00baF (2-8\u00baC), and we aim for 40\u00baF (5\u00baC).YES NO YES NO (Maintain Correct Temperatures continued on page 2) 13. We keep extra containers of water in the refrigerator (e.g., in the door, on the floor of the unit where the vegetable bins were located) to help maintain cool temperatures. 14. We always keep at least one accurate calibrated thermometer (+/-1\u00baC [+/-2\u00baF]) with vaccines in the freezer. 15. We maintain the average temperature in the freezer at +5\u00baF (-15\u00baC), preferably colder but no colder than -58\u00baF (-50\u00baC). 16. We keep ice packs or ice-filled containers in the freezer to help maintain cold temperatures. Store Vaccines Correctly 17. We post signs on the doors of the refrigerator and freezer that indicate which vaccines should be stored in the refrigerator and which in the freezer. 18. We do NOT store any food or drink in any vaccine storage unit. 19. We store vaccines in the middle of the refrigerator or freezer (never in the doors), with room for air to circulate. 20. We have removed all vegetable and deli bins from the storage unit. 21. If we are using a combination refrigerator-freezer unit, we do not store vaccines in front of the cold air outlet that leads from the freezer to the refrigerator (often near the top shelf). 22. We check vaccine expiration dates and rotate our supply of each type of vaccine so that we use the vaccines that will expire soonest. 23. We store vaccines in their original packaging in clearly labeled uncovered containers with slotted sides that allow air to circulate. Maintain Daily Temperature Logs 24. On days when our practice is open, we document refrigerator and freezer temperatures on the daily log twice a day \u2014 first thing in the morning and right before our facility closes. 25. We consistently record temperatures on the log in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. We NEVER mix in any way how we record our temperatures. For example, if the log prompts us to insert an \"x\" by the temperature that's preprinted on the log, we do not attempt to write in the actual temperature. 26. The logs show whom to call if the temperature in the storage unit goes out of range. 27. When we change the thermostat setting, we document it in the daily log sheet's note section. 28. If out-of-range temperatures occur in the unit, we document in the daily log sheet's note section who responded and when. 29. Trained staff (other than staff designated to record the temperatures) review the logs weekly. 30. We keep the temperature logs on file for at least 3 years. Take Emergency Action As Needed 31. In the event that vaccines are exposed to improper storage conditions, we take the following steps: a. We restore proper storage conditions as quickly as possible; if necessary, we move the vaccine to our planned back-up storage unit. We address the storage unit's mechanical or electrical problems according to guidance from the manufacturer or repair service. b. In responding to improper storage conditions, w e do NOT make frequent or large changes in thermostat settings. After changing the setting, we give the unit at least a day to stabilize its temperature. c. We temporarily label exposed vaccines \"Do not use\" and keep them separate from any unexposed vaccines. We do not use exposed vaccines until our state health department's immunization program or the vaccine manufacturer gives us approval. d. We document exactly what happened, noting the temperature in the storage unit and the amount of time the vaccines were out of proper storage conditions. We contact our state health department's immunization program or the vaccine manufacturer to determine how to handle the exposed vaccines. e. We follow the health department or manufacturer's instructions and keep a record detailing the event. Where applicable, we mark the exposed vials with a revised expiration date provided by the manufacturer. If we answer to all of the above, we give ourselves a pat on the back! If not, we assign someone to implement needed change s!

Dormitory -style refrigerators are not used to stored vaccine. 2. Vaccines are stored at the recommended temperature immediately upon arrival in the Employee Health department. 3. Refrigerated vaccines are maintained at a temperature range of 35 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0 F at all times . 4. A temperature log that has the ability to identify out of range conditions is used to document refrigerator temperature. 5. If a temperature is noted to be out of range, immediate investigation and respons e will occur. If vaccine is felt to have been out of adequate temperature control, the vaccine will be immediately sequestered and determination regarding the disposition of the vaccine will be investigated. 6. Frozen vaccines are maintained in the pharmacy due to the inability to maintain adequate temperature control in the Employee Health department. 7. Frozen vaccines are obtained from the pharmacy and are administered within 30 minutes of removal from the pharmacy freezer. 8. Temperature of the refrigerator is monitored and documented at least twice daily, usually at the beginning and end of the work day. 9. A calibrated thermometer with a certificate of traceability and calibration is kept in the refrigerator. 10. Recalibration of the thermometer is done in accordance with manufacturer recommendation. 11. Signage is posted next to electrical outlines and circuit breakers (e.g., Do Not Unplug and Do Not Stop Power) to maintain a consistent power source. 12. Vaccines are stored in bins or baskets (uncovered) with slotted sides or opening. 13. Bins are arranged in the refrigerator so that air flow around the vaccine is promoted. 14. Bins are clearly labeled with the name of the vaccine. Bins are to contain only one type of vaccine. 15. Vaccines are never stored in the refrigerator door. 16. Water bottles are stored in the refrigerator door to help maintain a constant temperature. Care is taken to prevent too much water storage such that the ability for the refrigerator door to close is not compromised and the seals are maintained. 17. Food an d drink (other than water for temperature control purposes) is not to be stored in the same refrigerator as vaccine. 18. Vaccines (opened and unopened) are stored in their original box with the lid in place. 19. Vaccines are prepared for administration at the time of their use. 20. Only the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer is used to reconstitute a vaccine. 21. Vaccine stock is rotated weekly so the vaccine and diluent with the shortest expiration date can be used first. During this process, assessment for ex pired vaccine occurs. 22. Expired vaccine is disposed of in accordance with hazardous waste regulation unless specific arrangements have been made to return it to the manufacturer. 23. Vials are dated as soon as they are opened unless they are single dose and will be disposed of immediately upon single use. 24. Multidose vials are disposed of on the date of the manufacturers' expiration date, or sooner. 25. Unused reconstituted vaccine is disposed of in accordance with manufacturer recommendation. 26. If vaccine is removed from the department (e.g., mobile carts during influenza immunization campaigns) it is maintained in a manner that monitors and maintains the temperature requirements. A mobile vaccine refrigerator, with AC power capabilities, and a calibrated thermometer is the acceptable transport alternative when frequent entry into the refrigerated environment is expected. Improving Immunization Rates Among Healthcare Personnel Checklist for Improvement A statement is posted in my department that cl early shows the commitment we have to immunization. This department has done an assessment to identify obstacles to immunization that may be in place (on purpose or inadvertently) . Written standing orders and protocols for immunization are in place. A process is in place so that immunization opportunities are assess ed during every healthcare personnel encounter . An audit has been done within the prior 12 months that focuses on missed opportunities for immunization. Results of all audits have been shared with the department staff and others and a plan of improvement has been developed with clear metrics for success. This department knows what our immunization rates are for each vaccine (e.g., # of vaccine doses administered/100 healthcare personnel in whom the vaccine is appropriate) . This department has determined and has set achievable goals including and timeframes to drive improvement. An action plan is in place to capture healthcare personnel needing followup on a routine basis either through emails, phone calls, or direct mail. Scripts addr essing questions and/or concerns regarding immunization have been developed and reviewed by all personnel in this office . Material regarding immunization is available in the waiting area. Material regarding immunization is available in the examination room (s). All department personnel have been involved in discussions regarding immunization as a means of addressing their conflicting thoughts or opinions that may negatively influence immunization decision- making. Ruth Carrico PhD RN FSHEA CIC Univers ity of Louisville ruth.carrico@louisville.edu December 2011 Safe Injection Practice: A Comprehensive Checklist for Monitoring Practice The transmission of pathogens to patients during routine care processes continues to occur primarily due to the use of unsafe and improper injection, infusion, and medical vial practices by healthcare workers. These unsafe practices occur in a variety of clinical settings and the results can be devastating for the patient. The areas of practice that are of greatest concern include: 1. Syringe and/or needle reuse 2. Contamination of medication vials 3. Contamination of intravenous bags 4. Failure to follow safety p ractices when preparing and administering parenteral medication 5. Inappropriate care/maintenance of single use medical devices 6. Inappropriate care/maintenance of reusable medical equipment 7. Lack of written policies/procedures/prevention protocols 8. Staff trainin g and education 9. Monitoring of healthcare personnel practice 10. Feedback of results as a part of the improvement process The following checklist has been developed by infection preventionists and can be used to evaluate care practices in any heal thcare setting and may provide insight and guidance regarding care improvements. When using the checklist, all \"Yes\" responses indicate that the observed practice(s) follow safe injection practices. A \"No\" response indicates that immediate corrective action is indicat ed.

Ruth.carrico@louisville.edu Sample Standing Orders Healthcare Personnel Immunization: Hepatitis B virus Purpose: To reduce morbidity and mortality associated with Hepatitis B among healthcare personnel through an effective and efficient immunization and infection prevention and control process. Policy Statements: 1. Identify all healthcare personnel at occupational risk of infection through exposure to blood or other potentia lly infectious materials at the time of hire and at least annually to ensure inclusion in the HBV immunization program of the facility 2. Review, at least annually, changes in occupational status (e.g., job category and responsibilities) and health status (e.g., hemodialysis) that may influence immunization of reimmunization. 3. Maintain immunization records in a manner that facilitates rapid retrieval, analysis, and programmatic improvement (e.g., electronic registries) 4. Incorporate basic infection pr evention and control strategies including hand hygiene, use of safety devices, personal protective equipment, proper waste disposal, and exposure prevention and response into work practices for all healthcare personnel. 5. Screen all healthcare personnel targeted for immunization for contraindications and precautions to Hepatitis B vaccine (For a list of vaccine components, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs /pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient- table -2.pdf ): Contraindication: history of serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) following a previous dose of Hepatitis B vaccine or to a component of the vaccine Precaution: moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 6. If the healthcare personnel is identified as HBsAg -positive, immunization is not necessary. 7. Provide all vaccine recipients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Stateme nt (VIS). Provide non -English speakers with the VIS in their native language, if available; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis . 8. Administer H epatitis B vaccine intramuscularly (22 -25g, 1- 1\u00bd\" needle) in the deltoid muscle. For persons age 20 years or older, give 1.0 mL dosage; for persons age 19 years or younger, give 0.5 mL dosage. 9. Provide subsequent doses of H epatitis B vaccine to complete each recipient 's 3-dose schedule by observing a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the first and second doses, 8 weeks between the second and third doses, and at least 4 months (16 weeks) between the first and third doses. 10. Follow immunization with an evaluation of response to the vaccine by obtaining serolo gy for HBsAb within 30 -60 days after completion of the first series. Positive response is demonstrated by anti -HBs of 10mIU/ml. 11. For non -respondents, repeat entire three dose series in accordance with spacing of vaccine doses as previously noted. Administration of more than two complete 3 -dose series is not to be done. 12. Repeat serology (HBsAb) 30 -60 days after second 3 -dose series. If negative, test for presence of the Hepatitis B surface antigen (ABsAg) and anti -HBcto determine is chronic infection is present. 13. Administration of booster doses of Hepatitis B vaccine is not currently recommended. However, if the healthcare personnel is receiving hemodialysis, they should be provided annual anti-HBs testing and should be administered a b ooster dose of vaccine if/when the anti -HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/ml. This monitoring should generally occur as part of their hemodialysis treatment, but if not, the healthcare personnel should be immunized through the employee/occupational health function to ensure patient and healthcare personnel safety. 14. Counsel non -respondent healthcare personnel to ensure their safety as well as the safety of their patients. Counseling should include at least the following: Modes of bloodborne pathogen transmission Use of personal protective equipment Use of safety devices Use of hand hygiene Avoidance of exposure prone procedures and situations Ethical responsibilities for known or potential patient exposure Prompt post -exposure reporting Documentation of expert counseling 15. Documentation regarding vaccine administration should include: Date the vaccine was administered Manufacturer and lot number Administration dose, site and route Name and title of person administering the vaccine If dose not given (e.g., contraindication, refusal), record the reason for non - receipt Publication date of the VIS and the date given to the vaccine recipient Name and location of the administering site (e.g., employee/occupational health department; off site clinic) 16. Maintain a written emergency response protocol as well as equipment and medication. 17.

For single-dose vaccine products (exceptions are Menomune in the multi- dose vial and Rotarix), select a syringe and a needle of proper length to be used for both reconstitution and administration of the vaccine. Following re - constitution, Menomune in a multi-dose vial will require a new needle and syringe for each dose of vaccine to be administered. For Rotarix, see the pack - age insert. 2. Before reconstituting, check labels on both the lyophilized vaccine vial and the diluent to verify the following: that they are the correct two products to mix together that the diluent is the correct volume (especially for Menomune in the multi-dose vial) that neither vaccine nor diluent has expired 3. Reconstitute (i.e., mix) vaccine just prior to use by removing the protective caps and wiping each stopper with an alcohol swab inserting needle of syringe into diluent vial and withdrawing entire contents injecting diluent into lyophilized vaccine vial and rotating or agitating to thoroughly dissolve the lyophilized powderVaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them Always refer to package inserts for detailed instructions on reconstituting specific vaccines. In general, follow these steps: 4. Check the appearance of the reconstituted vaccine. Reconstituted vaccine may be used if the color and appearance match the description on the package insert. If there is discoloration, extraneous particulate matter, obvious lack of resuspension, or cannot be thoroughly mixed, mark the vial as \"DO NOT USE,\" return it to proper storage conditions, and contact your state or local health department immunization program or the vaccine manufacturer. 5. If reconstituted vaccine is not used immediately or comes in a multi-dose vial (i.e., multi-dose Menomune), clearly mark the vial with the date and time the vaccine was reconstituted maintain the product at 35\u00b0-46\u00b0F (2\u00b0-8\u00b0C); do not freeze protect reconstituted vaccines from light use only within the time indicated on chart above The following vaccines must be reconstituted correctly before they are administered. Reconstitution means that the lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine powder or wafer in one vial must be reconstituted (mixed) with the diluent (liquid) in another. Only use the diluent provided by the manufacturer for that vaccine as indicated on the chart. ALWAYS check the expiration date on the diluent and vaccine. NEVER use expired diluent or vaccine. * If the reconstituted vaccine is not used within this time period, it must be discarded. Within 30 minutes or less. Rotarix vaccine is administered by mouth using the applicator that contains the diluent. It is not administered as an injection. www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3040.pdf Item #P3040 (6/11) Immunization Action Coalition 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.orgTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, June 2011.Section 8 Additional Resources Items included in this toolkit are continuously under review and revision by federal agencies and individuals.

Shefer, MD, Mary McCauley, MTSC, Peggy S. Webster, MD, Patricia N. Whitley-Williams, MD, Georges Peter, MD, and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee,Ad Hoc Working Group for the Development of Standards for Adult Immunization Practices Abstract: Since the Standards for Adult Immunization Practices were rst published in 1990, healthcare researchers and providers have learned important lessons on how to betterachieve and maintain high vaccination rates in adults. The success rate of childhoodimmunization far exceeds the success rate of adult immunization. Thus, information andpractices that will produce higher success rates for adult vaccination are crucial, resultingin overall societal cost savings and substantial reductions in hospitalizations and deaths.The Standards, which were developed to encourage the best immunization practices,represent the collective efforts of more than 100 people from more than 60 organizations.The revised Standards are more comprehensive than the 1990 Standards and focus on theaccessibility and availability of vaccines, proper assessment of patient vaccination status,opportunities for patient education, correct procedures for administering vaccines,implementation of strategies to improve vaccination rates, and partnerships with thecommunity to reach target patient populations. The revised Standards are recommendedfor use by all healthcare professionals and all public and private sector organizations thatprovide immunizations for adults. All who are involved in adult immunization should striveto follow the Standards in order to create the same level of success achieved by childhoodvaccination programs and to meet the Healthy People 2010 goals. (Am J Prev Med 2003;25(2):144-150) Introduction In the United States, years of clinical and program- matic experience have been translated into success-ful childhood immunization practices. As a result, vaccination rates among infants and children are nearor at all-time highs. Today, most childhood vaccine-preventable diseases rarely occur or are non-existent.However, similar success in vaccinating adults has notbeen achieved. Goals for adult immunization feature prominently in Healthy People 2010 , 1a comprehensive, nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda fromthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The target is 90% coverage for annual influenza immu-nization among adults aged /H1135065 years and 90% for one dose of pneumococcal vaccine. Success will require adramatic increase from rates in 2000, which were only66% for influenza vaccine and 50% for pneumococcal vaccine. 2 Increasing the use of these two vaccines among older adults could have tremendous health impacts. Influ-enza and its complications kill approximately 40,000individuals every year in the United States. 3Another 100,000 individuals suffer so severely from influenzathat hospitalization is required. 4The overwhelming majority of these deaths and hospitalizations occur inthe elderly. When vaccine viruses are well matched tocirculating viruses, vaccination lowers the risk of infec-tion among healthy adults by up to 90%. 4,5Although influenza vaccination is somewhat less effective amongthe elderly, vaccination has been estimated to reducetheir risk of influenza-related hospitalization and deathby up to 70%. 4,6-8The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)9estimate that for each additional 1 million elderly people vaccinated each year, 900 deathsand 1300 hospitalizations would be averted. Further-more, economic studies nd overall societal cost sav-ings and substantial reductions in hospitalizations anddeaths if people aged /H1135065 years receive the influenza vaccine. 4,6,7 In recent years, pneumococcal infections have ac- counted for /H11022100,000 hospitalizations for pneumonia, /H1102260,000 cases of bacteremia and other forms of inva- sive disease, and about 7000 deaths from invasivepneumococcal disease. 10-12In 1998, /H1102250% of these deaths occurred among people aged /H1135065 years.

Healthy People 2010 1targets are 60% coverage with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines amonghigh-risk adults aged 18 to 64 years. In 1999, only 31%of these adults reported receiving influenza vaccine,and only 17% received pneumococcal vaccine (Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, unpublished data,1999). In 1998, 41% of deaths attributed to invasivepneumococcal disease occurred among individualsaged 18 to 64 years who had a medical indication forthe pneumococcal vaccine. 12 Despite the availability of a vaccine that is /H1102295% effective in preventing hepatitis B, approximately80,000 individuals, mostly adolescents and adults, areinfected annually in the United States. 15,16About 6% of newly infected people become chronically infected andface a 15% to 25% lifetime risk of death from chronicliver disease. Annually, an estimated 4000 to 5000chronically infected people die prematurely fromchronic liver disease. 17Without an improvement in vaccinating adults at increased risk of hepatitis B infec-tion, transmission of hepatitis B will continue fordecades. Vaccines also remain underutilized among other groups of adults, especially among certain racial/ethnicpopulations. For example, the rates of influenza andpneumococcal vaccination in African-American andHispanic populations are signicantly lower than thoseamong whites. 18In addition, adult immunization is not limited to pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis Bvaccines. All adults should be immune to measles,mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and varicella, andadults who are susceptible to hepatitis A and polioshould be vaccinated if they are at risk for exposure.Further, certain vaccines, such as travel vaccines orvaccines occupationally required, should be reviewedand provided if appropriate. The CDC's Advisory Com-mittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recentlypublished an Adult Immunization Schedule (http://cdc.gov/nip/recs/adult-schedule.htm). Revising the Standards The Standards for Adult Immunization Practices, de-veloped to encourage best practices, were rst pub-lished in 1990. 19Since then, the healthcare system has changed dramatically. For example, there has been ashift toward managed care, resulting in a change inprovider incentives and reimbursement for preventive services. Also in the past decade, healthcare researchersand providers have learned many valuable lessonsabout what is needed to achieve and maintain highvaccination rates among adults. This revision of the Standards for Adult Immuniza- tion Practices (Table 1) reflects the experience of thepast 10 years. The Standards represent the collectiveefforts of more than 100 people from more than 60organizations, including professional societies, stateand local health departments, immunization programs,and immunization providers. The National VaccineAdvisory Committee (NVAC) led this effort. As theFederal Advisory Committee is charged by the Secretaryof Health and Human Services to ensure the adequatedelivery of safe and effective vaccination products inthe United States, the NVAC itself is composed ofpeople who represent the spectrum of those with aninterest in immunization, including physicians, re-searchers, developers, manufacturers, state and publichealth agencies, and more than 20 federal agencies.The revised Standards also incorporate informationfrom two important reports published by NVAC in thelast decade on the status of adult immunization 20and on adult immunization programs in nontraditionalsettings. 21Table 1.

Vaccination records for patients are accurate and easily accessible. 11. All personnel who have contact with patients are appropriately vaccinated. Implement strategies to improve vaccination rates.12. Systems are developed and used to remind patients and healthcare professionals when vaccinations are due andto recall patients who are overdue. 13. Standing orders for vaccinations are employed.14. Regular assessments of vaccination coverage levels are conducted in a provider's practice. Partner with the community.15. Patient-oriented and community-based approaches are used to reach target populations. Am J Prev Med 2003;25(2) 145Information published from the Guide to Community Preventive Services reviews strategies to improve immuni- zation service delivery and provides a broader base ofevidence to support the Standards. 22,23Based on re- search published in the 1990s concerning techniquesproven to improve immunization rates among adults,three new standards were constructed and require thefollowing: (1) systems that remind patients and provid-ers when an immunization is due, (2) standing ordersfrom physicians that enable other personnel to pre-scribe and deliver vaccinations, (3) regular assessmentsof coverage rates at clinics, and (4) pertinent informa-tion provided to clinic staff to ensure current patientimmunizations. The Standards supplement research with expert con- sensus in areas where research does not offer guidancebut experience does. The revised Standards are morecomprehensive than the previous version and orga-nized to focus on the provider's ongoing process ofminimizing barriers that prevent patients from receiv-ing vaccines, assessing for valid indications and contra-indications, keeping patients' immunizations current,and communicating effectively with patients aboutvaccines. Today, more tools are available to support immuni- zation providers. The revised Standards include links towebsites that contain information on model standing-order policies, instructions for setting up reminder/recall systems, and templates for personal vaccinationrecords. The tools are currently available free on CD-ROM, but will soon be available online. In addition,information about federal requirements and programs,including Vaccine Information Statements, the VaccineAdverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program(VICP) is current and has been made easily accessiblein the Standards. Applying the Standards Once the revised Standards are implemented on apractice-by-practice or program-by-program basis, im-mediate results can be expected for improved adultimmunization. Long-term sustainable improvement inadult immunization necessitates an infrastructure toorganize immunization efforts by providers and federalagencies, as well as state and local health departments.Such an infrastructure is lacking. 24Partnerships among healthcare professionals, state and local health depart-ments, medical and nursing organizations, and insur-ance companies will need to be strengthened. Factorsthat cause low vaccination coverage among adults mustbe addressed. These factors include provider behaviorsand practices that may affect accurate identication ofpatients in need of vaccination, attitudes toward thehealthcare system that may impact adults seeking andaccepting vaccines, and nancial issues that may im-pede appropriate vaccination of certain populations. For example, although Medicare ensures coverage ben-ets for vaccines for those aged /H1135065 years, in 2001 an estimated 17% and 13% of adults aged 35 to 44 yearsand 45 to 64 years, respectively, did not have healthinsurance. 2In addition, even though many adults may have insurance coverage, the medical insurance maynot cover vaccination. Overall improvement in our healthcare system will take time. However, we can do much now to improvethe delivery of vaccination services for adults. Thefollowing Standards for Adult Immunization Practicesand the accompanying discussion are intended to ad-dress these issues. The Standards Make Vaccinations Available Standard 1: Adult vaccination services are readily avail- able. Primary care healthcare professionals who serve adults should always include routinely recommendedvaccinations as part of their care. Specialists, whosepatients may be at increased risk of vaccine-preventablediseases, should also include routinely recommendedvaccinations as part of their care. For selected vaccines(e.g., meningococcal vaccine for college entrants andvaccines for international travelers), patients may bereferred to another provider. Standard 2: Barriers to receiving vaccines are identied and minimized. Barriers to receiving vaccines may in- clude requiring a physical examination before vaccina-tion, requiring an additional visit for vaccination, longwaiting periods, and lack of educational materials thatare culturally appropriate. Prior to vaccine administra-tion, simply observing the patient, asking if the patientis well and questioning the patient/guardian aboutvaccine contraindications is sufcient. Standard 3: Patient \"out-of-pocket\" vaccination costs are minimized. Resources should be identied to keep patient vaccination costs as low as possible, specicallyfor those patients aged /H1135065 years and for vaccines not covered by Medicare Part B. In the public sector,patient fees should include only the cost of vaccine andadministration that cannot be funded through anothersource. In the private sector, routinely recommendedvaccination services should be included in basic bene-ts packages. System and policy changes should beaddressed to provide adequate reimbursement to pro-viders for delivering vaccinations to their adultpopulation. Assess Patients' Vaccination Status Standard 4: Healthcare professionals routinely reviewthe vaccination status of patients. Healthcare profes- sionals should review and document the vaccination 146 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 25, Number 2status of all new patients during initial ofce visits and also review vaccination status on an annual basis there-after. Healthcare professionals should ascertain if thepatient has medical risk factors, lifestyle risk factors, oran occupation for which certain vaccines may be indi-cated. Healthcare professionals should record this in-formation in the patient's chart and preventive healthsummary. Healthcare professionals should also rou-tinely review pneumococcal vaccination status at thetime of influenza vaccination. Standard 5: Healthcare professionals assess for valid contraindications. Failure to differentiate between valid and invalid contraindications often results in theneedless deferral of indicated vaccinations. Healthcareprofessionals should ask about prior adverse events inconnection with a vaccination and about any conditionsor circumstances that might indicate vaccinationshould be withheld or delayed. Healthcare profession-als should refer to current ACIP recommendations onvalid and invalid contraindications as well as on validindications for vaccine use (www.cdc.gov/nip). Communicate Effectively with Patients Standard 6: P atients are educated about risks and bene- ts of vaccination in easy-to-understand language. Health- care professionals should discuss with the patient thebenets of vaccines, the diseases that the vaccinesprevent, and any known risks from vaccines. Theseissues should be discussed in the patient's native lan-guage, whenever possible. Printed materials, accuratelytranslated into the patient's language, should be pro-vided. For most commonly used vaccines, the U.S.federal government has developed Vaccine Informa-tion Statements for use by both public and privatehealthcare professionals to give to potential vaccinerecipients. For vaccines covered by the National Child-hood Vaccine Injury Act, including those vaccines usedin children, these forms are required. These statementsare available in English and other languages. Health-care professionals should allot ample time with patientsto review written materials and address questions andconcerns. Information and assistance can be obtainedby calling the Immunization Hotline (1-800-232-2522)or accessing the website (www.cdc.gov/nip). Healthcare professionals should respect each pa- tient's right to make an informed decision to accept orreject a vaccine or to defer vaccination until moreinformation is collected. Administer and Document Vaccinations Properly Standard 7: Written vaccination protocols are availableat all locations where vaccines are administered. The medical protocol should detail procedures for vaccinestorage and handling, vaccine schedules, contraindica-tions, administration techniques, management and re-porting of adverse events, and record maintenance and accessibility. These protocols should be consistent withestablished guidelines. CDC-recommended storage andhandling procedures are available on the Internet athttp://gravity.lmi.org/lmi_cdc/geninfo.htm. Healthcare professionals should promptly report all clinically signicant adverse events following vaccina-tion to VAERS, even if the healthcare professional doesnot believe that the vaccine caused the event. Report-ing is required for those vaccines given to adults andmedical conditions covered by the National ChildhoodVaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended. Healthcareprofessionals should be aware that patients may reportto VAERS; if they choose to do so, they are encouragedto seek the help of their healthcare professional. Re-port forms and assistance are available by calling 1-800-822-7967 or on the Internet at www.fda.gov/cber/vaers/vaers.htm. The VICP is a no-fault system that compensates people of any age for injuries or conditions that mayhave been caused by a vaccine recommended by CDCfor routine administration to children. Healthcare pro-fessionals should be aware of the VICP in order toaddress questions raised by patients. Information aboutthe VICP is available on the Internet at www.hrsa.gov/bhpr/vicp.htm or by calling 1-800-338-2382. Since VAERS and VICP are separate programs, a report of an event to VAERS does not result in thesubmission of a compensation claim to VICP. Such aclaim must be led independently in the U.S. Court ofFederal Claims. A brief description and contact infor-mation for both programs are provided on each Vac-cine Information Statement for vaccines covered by theVICP. Standard 8: People who administer vaccines are prop- erly trained. All people who administer vaccinations should be fully trained in vaccine storage and handling,vaccine schedules, contraindications, administrationtechniques, management and reporting of adverseevents, and record maintenance and accessibility. Of-ce staff should receive continuing education on theseissues annually. With appropriate training, peopleother than physicians and nurses can administer vac-cines. Healthcare professionals should contact publichealth authorities or other medical authorities in theirstate for more information concerning which individu-als are permitted to administer vaccines. Standard 9: Healthcare professionals recommend si- multaneous administration of all indicated vaccine dos-es.Administering indicated vaccines simultaneously is safe and effective. Simultaneous administration de-creases the number of required visits and the potentialfor missed doses. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)vaccine and tetanus and diphtheria (Td) toxoidsshould always be administered in their combined prod-uct. Giving influenza and pneumococcal vaccine at the Am J Prev Med 2003;25(2) 147same time (but in separate arms) is also safe and effective. Healthcare professionals should respect thechoices of patients and their caregivers. Standard 10: Vaccination records for patients are accu- rate and easily accessible. Patient vaccination histories should be recorded on a standard form in an easilyaccessible location in the medical record to facilitaterapid review of vaccination status. Accurate recordkeeping helps ensure that needed vaccinations areadministered and unnecessary vaccinations are notadministered. Records should indicate the vaccine, thedate of administration, the vaccine manufacturer andlot number, the signature and title of the personadministering the vaccine, and the address where thevaccine was administered. The medical record at theprimary care provider's ofce, clinic, or worksite shouldinclude all those re-ceived at a specialist's ofce, influenza vaccinationclinic, or pharmacy). Record keeping may be paper-based or computer- ized. Computer systems make record maintenance,retrieval, and review easier. Healthcare professionals should give patients a per- sonal record of vaccinations they have received, includ-ing the dates and places of administration. Patientsshould be encouraged to bring their vaccinationrecords to all medical visits. Information and a modiable template of these forms and records are available at www.ahcpr.gov/ppip/adultflow.pdf and are also available on CD-ROMand can be ordered on the Internet at www.atpm.org/Immunization/whatworks.html. Standard 11: All personnel who have contact with patients are appropriately immunized. Healthcare pro- fessionals and other personnel (including rst respond-ers) who have contact with patients should be appro-priately immunized (e.g., annual influenza vaccination,hepatitis B vaccination). Institutions should have poli-cies to review and maintain the appropriate vaccinationof staff and trainees. ACIP recommendations for vaccinating healthcare workers are available on the Internet at www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/ACIP-list.htm. Implement Strategies to Improve Vaccination Rates Standard 12: Systems are developed and used to re- mind patients and healthcare professionals when vacci-nations are due and to recall patients who are over-due. Evidence shows that reminder/recall systems improve adult vaccination rates. Systems may be de-signed to alert patients who are due (reminder) oroverdue (recall) for specic vaccine doses or they mayalert patients to contact their provider to determine ifvaccinations are needed. Reminders or recalls can bemailed or communicated by telephone; an autodialer can be used to expedite telephone reminders. Patientswho might be at high risk for not complying withmedical recommendations may require more intensivefollow-up. Provider reminder/recall interventions inform those who administer vaccinations that individual patients aredue or overdue for specic vaccinations. Reminderscan be delivered in patient charts, by computer, and/orby mail or other means, and content of the reminderscan be specic or general. Information about thesestrategies and resources to assist in their implementa-tion are available on CD-ROM and can be ordered onthe Internet at www.atpm.org/Immunization/what-works.html. Model reminder recall templates are alsoavailable at www.ahcpr.gov/ppip/postcard.pdf. Standard 13: Standing orders for vaccinations are em- ployed. Evidence shows that standing orders improve vaccination coverage among adults in a variety ofhealthcare settings, including nursing homes, hospitals,clinics, doctor's ofces, and other institutional settings.Standing orders enable nonphysician personnel such asnurses and pharmacists to prescribe or deliver vaccina-tions by approved protocol without direct physicianinvolvement at the time of the interaction. Standingorders overcome administrative barriers such as lackof physician personnel to order vaccines. Further,the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid allow stand-ing order exemption from Medicare rules (www.cms.hhs.gov/medicaid/ltcsp/sc0302.pdf). Information about this strategy and its implementa- tion is available on CD-ROM and can be ordered on theInternet at www.atpm.org/Immunization/whatworks.html. Standard 14: Regular assessments of vaccination cover- age rates are conducted in a provider's practice. Evi- dence shows that assessment of vaccination coverageand provision of the results to the staff in a practiceimproves vaccination coverage among adults. Opti-mally, such assessments are performed annually. Pro-vider assessment can be performed by the staff in thepractice or by other organizations, including state andlocal health departments. Effective interventions thatinclude assessment and provision of results may alsoincorporate incentives or compare performance to agoal or standard. This process is commonly referred toas AFIX (assessment, feedback, incentives, and ex-change of information). Coverage should be assessedregularly so that reasons for low coverage in the prac-tice, or in a subgroup of the patients served, can beidentied and interventions implemented to addressthem. Information about this strategy and its implementa- tion is available on CD-ROM and can be ordered on theInternet at www.atpm.org/Immunization/whatworks.html. Software to assist in conducting coverage rate 148 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 25, Number 2assessments and feedback is available at www.cdc. gov/nip. Partner with the Community Standard 15: Patient-oriented and community-basedapproaches are used to reach target populations. Vac- cination services should be designed to meet the needsof the population served. For example, interventionsthat include community education, along with othercomponents such as extended hours, have been dem-onstrated to improve vaccination coverage amongadults. Vaccination providers can work with partners inthe community, including other health professionals(e.g., pharmacists), vaccination advocacy groups, man-aged care organizations, service organizations, manu-facturers, and state and local health departments todetermine community needs and develop vaccinationservices to address them. Conclusion The revised Standards for Adult Immunization Prac-tices provide a concise, convenient summary of themost desirable immunization practices. The Standardshave been widely endorsed by major professional orga-nizations. This revised version of the Standards forAdult Immunization Practices is recommended for useby all healthcare professionals and payers in the publicand private sectors who provide immunizations foradults. Everyone involved in adult immunizationshould strive to follow these Standards. Not all practicesand programs have the resources necessary to fullyimplement the Standards; nevertheless, those lackingthe resources should nd the Standards useful to guidecurrent practice and to guide the process of deningimmunization needs and obtaining additional re-sources in the future. These Standards are approved by the National Vaccine Advi- sory Committee (NVAC), the National Coalition for AdultImmunization (NCAI), the Advisory Committee on Immuni-zation Practices (ACIP), and the U.S. Public Health Service,and endorsed, as of December 1, 2001, by the AmericanMedical Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America,American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academyof Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, Society of Adolescent Medicine, Health Resourcesand Services Administration, National Medical Association,National Association of County and City Health Ofcials,Association of State and Territorial Health Ofcers, Councilof State and Territorial Epidemiologists, Association of Pro-fessionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc., Chi-ron, State of Washington Department of Health, Society ofTeachers of Preventive Medicine, Immunization Action Coa-lition, Partnership for Prevention, National Coalition forAdult Immunization, American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery, American Health Care Association,Hepatitis B Foundation, American College of PreventiveMedicine, American Pharmaceutical Association, American Society for Health System Pharmacists, State of Maine Depart-ment of Health, National Alliance for Hispanic Health,American Academy of Physician Assistants, National Associa-tion of School Nurses, Memphis County Health Department, Maine Ambulatory Care Association, Institute for AdvancedStudies in Aging and Geriatric Medicine, The Arizona Part-nership for Adult Immunization, National Foundation forInfectious Diseases, and the National Partnership forImmunization. The NVAC was charted in 1988 to advise and make recommendations to the director of the National VaccineProgram and the assistant secretary for health, Department ofHealth and Human Services, on matters related to theprevention of infectious diseases through immunization andthe prevention of adverse reactions to vaccines. The NVAC iscomposed of 15 members from public and private organiza-tions representing vaccine manufacturers, physicians, par-ents, and state and local health agencies, and public healthorganizations. In addition, representatives from governmentagencies involved in health care of allied services serve asex-ofcio members of the NVAC.

Throughout the United States, an increasing number of adults are receiving vaccine in nontraditional settings (e.g., pharmacies and churches). Immunization programs in nontraditional settings are often more accessible and convenient than a health-care provider's office or a public health clinic, especially for medically underserved adults (e.g., economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations). Medically underserved adults might be at particular risk for undervaccination because they are often without a medical home (i.e., a regular point of contact where their health-care needs are met). Immunization programs in nontraditional settings might enhance the capacity of the health-care system to effectively deliver vaccine to adults by increasing the number and types of sites where adults can receive vaccine. NVAC has recognized that strategies need to be developed to make vaccines available to all adults and that the number of immunization programs in nontraditional settings is increasing. Therefore, the Committee issues the following report, including quality standards and guidance for program evaluation. BACKGROUND Approximately 45,000 adults in the United States die annually of complications from influenza, pneumococcal infections, and hepatitis B \u2014 the primary vaccine-preventable diseases affecting adults. The total economic cost of treating these vaccine-preventable diseases among adults, excluding the value of years of life lost, exceeds$10 billion each year. Although effective vaccines to prevent these diseases areavailable, they are widely underutilized ( 1,2). This underutilization reflects a lack of emphasis on vaccines for adults in comparison with the more substantial emphasis onvaccines for children. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine coverage rates for adults aged /G17965 years vary by race and ethnicity ( 2). In 1997, influenza vaccine coverage rates ranged from 67.2% among non-Hispanic whites to 50.2% among non-Hispanic blacks ( 2). Pneumococcal vaccine coverage rates were even lower: 47.3% of white adults aged /G17965 years reported receiving pneumococcal vaccine compared with 34.1% of Hispanics and 29.7% of blacks( 2). Disease burden also varies by race and ethnicity. Blacks have a threefold to fivefold increased risk for developing life-threatening invasive pneumococcal disease comparedwith whites ( 3-5).2 MMWR March 24, 2000 A recommendation by a health-care provider is a key factor determining whether an adult patient will be vaccinated ( 6). Medically underserved adults (e.g., economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations) might be at particular risk forunderimmunization because they are often without a medical home (i.e., a regular pointof contact where their health-care needs are met) and might not have regular access toa health-care provider ( 7-10). Therefore, to reach medically underserved adults, strat- egies to increase vaccine-seeking behavior are critically needed. One such strategyinvolves offering vaccine to adults in nontraditional settings (e.g., pharmacies andchurches) that might be more accessible and convenient than the office of a health-careprovider or a public health clinic. Immunization programs in nontraditional settingsmight enhance the capacity of the health-care system to effectively deliver vaccine toadults by increasing the number and types of settings in which adults can receive vac-cine. INTRODUCTION Purpose of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee Workshop The National Vaccine Program Office sponsored a public meeting of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee 's (NVAC) Adult Immunization Working Group on Decem- ber 1 -2, 1997, to explore adult immunization programs in nontraditional settings. The purpose of the workshop was to gain a better understanding of programs currently offering vaccines to adults in nontraditional settings, \u007fto identify potential benefits and challenges associated with administering vaccines in nontraditional settings, \u007fto identify additional nontraditional settings that could be explored and potentially used, \u007fto define areas where additional research is needed, \u007fto develop an effective immunization strategy integrating immunization programs in nontraditional settings with those in traditional settings, and \u007fto develop quality standards for immunization programs in nontraditional settings. The workshop was limited to discussion regarding vaccines for adults because na- tional vaccine coverage estimates for adults are substantially lower than the nationalgoals established for this population, whereas coverage estimates for children approachor exceed national goals ( 2,7,11 ). The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of discussions at the NVAC workshop so that persons who conduct or plan to conduct immunization programs in anontraditional setting will have guidance regarding how to safely operate such a pro-gram. This report also highlights the importance of evaluating these programs by col-lecting data regarding associated benefits (e.g., increases in the number of adults vac-cinated) and challenges (e.g., preventing fragmentation of care by reporting adminis-tration of vaccine to the primary-care provider of the vaccinee).Vol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 3 Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines constitute the majority of vaccines adminis- tered in nontraditional settings; therefore, this report focuses on these vaccines. If thetypes of vaccines administered in nontraditional settings increase, both the benefitsand challenges could change. Workshop Participants Workshop participants included members of the NVAC Adult Immunization Work- ing Group and representatives from approximately 50 organizations, including federaland state governments, community and professional organizations, and private com-panies. Participants were identified through discussions with staff at CDC, the HealthResources and Services Administration, the National Coalition for Adult Immunization(NCAI), and other organizations. NCAI is composed of nearly 100 professional medicaland health-care associations, advocacy groups, voluntary organizations, vaccine manu-facturers, and government agencies. Workshop presenters were selected to ensure thata spectrum of viewpoints was represented. SUMMARY OF WORKSHOP PRESENTATIONS Information regarding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Adult Immunization Action Plan ( 1), vaccine coverage rates, and incidence of morbidity and mortality attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases among adults was presented.The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the National Medical Association pro-vided physicians ' perspectives of administration of vaccine in nontraditional settings. The benefits and challenges highlighted by these physicians were similar to those ofother workshop participants. Benefits included increased access and convenience, re-duced cost for vaccination, and increased awareness of the importance of vaccination.Challenges included ensuring that trained staff are available to treat potential adversereactions to vaccines, keeping effective records, protecting health-care providers fromliability, preventing fragmentation of care, and removing restrictive legal regulations. NCAI and the National Council on Aging emphasized the importance of collabora- tion between public and private sectors and community-based organizations. A panelof representatives from community-based organizations providing services to tradi-tionally underserved populations presented ways in which their clients might be moreadequately cared for by the health-care profession (e.g., providing culturally and lin-guistically appropriate materials and outreach programs). Organizations that currentlyprovide vaccines to adults in several nontraditional settings (including pharmacies,nontraditional clinical settings, retail establishments, dental care facilities, churches,the workplace, and the home) provided examples of the benefits and challenges expe-rienced in these programs. Examples of Adult Immunization Programs in Nontraditional Settings The Health Care Financing Administration 's (HCFA) Horizons pilot project, a collabo- rative project between professional review organizations and nine historically blackcolleges and universities in eight southern states, was presented as an example of howthe Federal government works with communities to provide vaccine in nontraditionalsettings. The goal of the Horizons project is to produce effective community-based4 MMWR March 24, 2000 interventions for increasing vaccine coverage rates among black populations. Tennessee 's Horizons project has provided vaccines to adults in approximately 14 non- traditional settings, including shopping malls, senior citizen centers, nutrition sites, mo-bile units, grocery stores, voting sites, parks, and public housing projects. Pharmacies in the United States are increasing their participation in vaccination activities ( 12). Pharmacists are functioning as a) vaccine advocates, by educating their clients about the importance of vaccines; b) vaccine facilitators, by hosting vaccineclinics at pharmacies; and c) vaccine administrators, by vaccinating their clients. TheAmerican Pharmaceutical Association and CDC 's National Immunization Program have developed a training course to prepare pharmacists for active participation in immuni-zation programs ( 13). Twenty-six states have statutes that permit pharmacists to ad- minister vaccine. Accessability of pharmacists and the degree of trust between phar-macists and patients were suggested as factors that provide important opportunitiesfor pharmacists to educate adults about the benefits of vaccines and, in some cases,administer vaccine. Nurse practitioners, visiting nurses, and members of the National Black Nurses As- sociation (NBNA) also are involved in immunization programs in nontraditional set-tings. Nurse practitioners, using mobile-community health centers, often provide careto traditionally underserved homeless and migrant workers and a large population ofolder adults who reside in rural or inner city areas. NBNA and the Visiting Nurses Asso-ciation often staff immunization programs operating in nontraditional settings, includ-ing the workplace, pharmacies, and churches. A representative from the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses noted that employers can be involved in workplace immunization activities on three levels: a) providing vaccines at the work site, administered by their own medical staff;b) contracting with health-care providers to administer vaccine at the work site; and/orc) including preventive care benefits (e.g., vaccinations) in health plans for employees.Employers generally are interested in increasing employee productivity; therefore, de-creased employee absenteeism associated with receiving influenza vaccine should behighlighted ( 14). Potential barriers to workplace vaccination programs include employ- ers being reluctant to disrupt work schedules or to offer vaccine to employees coveredby health plans. Workplaces with a small number of employees might not be able toprovide vaccination programs on their own but might be able to unite with other officesand provide vaccines in a centralized site within an office park. New Settings and Incentives for Immunization Programs Several additional nontraditional settings in which vaccines might be provided in- clude soup kitchens, prisons, sheltered workshops for persons with disabilities, casi-nos, bingo halls, adult day care centers, major transit points, and polling stations onelection days. Designation of mass immunization days (analogous to national immuni-zation days for polio vaccination in endemic areas [ 15]) during which vaccinations are provided in several different settings was suggested. New incentive or endorsementprograms that might increase the demand for vaccinations were also presented. Forexample, retail coupons and endorsement by sports teams were suggested as poten-tial ways to enhance vaccine-seeking behavior among adults.Vol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 5 BENEFITS OF ADULT IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS IN NONTRADITIONAL SETTINGS Access and Convenience The most common benefits of administering vaccine in nontraditional settings noted by workshop presenters are increased access and convenience. Providing vaccines insettings readily accessible to adults who are most in need of the services is critical. Formany adults, the need to use transportation to reach a health-care provider is a barrierto receiving preventive services ( 7,9). This barrier might be eliminated by offering pre- ventive services (e.g., administration of vaccines) in a neighborhood retail establish-ment, church, or other convenient location. Eliminating the need for making an ap-pointment in advance and avoiding the waiting time often associated with a clinic oroffice visit are factors that also might increase the vaccine-seeking behavior of someadults ( 8,9). Reduced Cost for Vaccinations The reduced cost of receiving vaccines in nontraditional settings compared with traditional settings is another potential benefit. The current cost of administering influ-enza and pneumococcal vaccines in a nontraditional setting is $10 -$15 and $15 -$20, respectively. Adults without health insurance might be willing to pay for a vaccine ad-ministered in a nontraditional setting when they would be unwilling or unable to pay the greater cost associated with a physician 's office visit ( 16,17 ). For adults who are covered by Medicare, HCFA has mandated reimbursement for health-care providerswho administer influenza vaccine, regardless of the setting, even if the health-care pro-vider is not a member of the vaccinee 's health-care plan. Increased Awareness for Vaccinations Among Adults An indirect benefit of administering vaccine in nontraditional settings is increased public awareness of the need for adult immunization. This benefit is realized in twoways. First, many immunization programs operating in nontraditional settings use di-rect marketing to inform the community about their services and why they are impor-tant. Although marketing strategies might be directed toward promoting a specific site,the actual benefit is likely a general increase in public awareness regarding the impor-tance and availability of vaccines for adults. Secondly, immunization programs in non-traditional settings often elicit media attention, which might increase community aware-ness of the need for vaccination of adults. CHALLENGES OF ADULT IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS IN NONTRADITIONAL SETTINGS Adverse Reactions to Vaccines Vaccine providers should be trained to manage adverse reactions that might occur. Concerns regarding postvaccination observation included: \"Should direct observation6 MMWR March 24, 2000 of vaccine recipients be routine? If so, what is the duration of observation? If a severe adverse reaction occurs, are trained and skilled personnel on site to respond appropri-ately? \" Recordkeeping Important factors regarding recordkeeping include how to determine which adults are in need of vaccines and how to prevent inappropriate revaccination.* Immuniza-tion registries might play a role in resolving this issue; however, most existing immuni-zation registries do not include information regarding adults. Until immunization regis-tries routinely include this information, the primary-care provider and/or health depart-ment should be notified when a vaccine is administered in a nontraditional setting sothat patient immunization records can be updated. In addition, vaccinees should beprovided with wallet-sized vaccine records. These efforts will help ensure that adultsare offered appropriately timed vaccines and that their vaccination status is accessibleto their health-care provider in traditional or nontraditional settings and to other health-care providers who might offer them vaccines in nontraditional settings. Liability of Health-Care Providers Many workshop participants considered liability protection for health-care providers an important component of any adult immunization program. Health-care providers mightbe more likely to promote and administer vaccines if they could be assured of not beingheld liable for incidents of rare but serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Legal Regulations Workshop participants described several restrictive legal regulations regarding the administration of vaccines. In many states, legislation restricts who can administer vac-cines and under what circumstances. In some areas, new immunization programs thatmight reach populations at high risk for disease could be hampered by restrictive legalregulations. Integrating Vaccine Programs in Nontraditional and Traditional Settings One challenge of offering vaccines in a setting that does not provide other preven- tive services is fragmentation of care. Workshop participants acknowledged the impor-tance of having a medical home to ensure appropriate and comprehensive preventivecare, early diagnosis, and optimal therapy. Immunization programs in nontraditionalsettings should facilitate identification of medical homes for medically underservedadults who need a health-care provider. To promote integration of preventive care *Influenza vaccine should not be routinely administered more than once during an influenza season ( 18). Revaccination with pneumococcal vaccine one time, at least 5 years after initial vaccination, is recommended for persons at highest risk for pneumococcal infection (e.g., personswho are immunocompromised or who are asplenic) and those most likely to have a rapiddecline in antibody concentrations. In addition, for persons vaccinated before age 65 years, asecond dose should be administered at age /G17965 years, provided that /G1795 years have elapsed since the first dose ( 19).Vol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 7 services when an adult with a regular primary-care provider is vaccinated in a nontradi- tional setting, the primary-care provider should be notified by the vaccine provider ofthe patient 's vaccination status. Vaccination status is often a marker for other health- care needs. Therefore, adults seeking vaccines in nontraditional settings also mightneed other preventive health services (e.g., mammograms and lipid screenings). Inaddition, these programs need systematic procedures (e.g., providing lists of nearbyphysicians and offering to schedule appointments) to ensure that referrals to primary-care providers are offered when appropriate and that relevant health promotion anddisease prevention literature are available on site. Quality of Services The mission of an immunization program and the motivation of the health-care providers who operate the program might affect the quality of services provided. Im-portant components of quality care when administering vaccines in nontraditional set-tings include a) ability to handle adverse reactions, b) notification of the primary-careprovider or health department when vaccines are administered, c) physician referralservices, and d) providing education regarding other key preventive health measures. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS AND PRIORITIES The conclusions reached by workshop participants were based primarily on expert opinion and anecdotal information. Both workshop participants and NVAC recognizethe need for research targeted at providing data that addresses the effectiveness ofimmunization programs in nontraditional settings in reaching previously unvaccinatedadults. NVAC recommends that program evaluation be conducted to determine the impact of immunization programs in nontraditional settings on vaccine coverage rates andvaccine-preventive disease rates among adults. Specifically, the following concernsshould be addressed: \u007fDetermine characteristics of persons receiving vaccine in nontraditional settings, including demographic characteristics, previous vaccine-seeking behavior, andprevious and anticipated future use of the traditional medical system. A surveyof persons using nontraditional settings for vaccination could provide these data. \u007fDetermine characteristics of programs successfully reaching hard-to-reach, previously unvaccinated adults. Demonstration projects, including various typesof programs (e.g., those operated by service versus for-profit organizations) indifferent locations, including churches, work sites, and pharmacies, need to beassessed to determine which combination of features creates the mostsuccessful program. \u007fCatalogue the types of services provided. The catalogue could include the following features: reporting to primary-care physician, referral to physician,provision of educational materials regarding the importance of other preventivecare measures, the number of programs offering each service, and the effect ofthese services on program operating costs.8 MMWR March 24, 2000 \u007fDetermine if the nontraditional settings in which vaccines are administered are accessible locations and settings in which medically underserved populationsfeel comfortable receiving vaccine. This information could be obtained bysurveying these adults. \u007fDetermine the potential effect of liability protection on physician practice pat- terns by surveying physicians. \u007fDetermine reasons nonphysician providers in some states are not allowed to administer vaccines in nontraditional settings. These reasons could be ad-dressed by surveying state legislators and health officials. GUIDANCE FROM NVAC FOR CONDUCTING ADULT IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS IN NONTRADITIONAL SETTINGS Although no formalized, coordinated effort to provide vaccinations in nontraditional settings exists at the national level, many adults are already receiving vaccine in thesesettings. To ensure the safety of persons receiving vaccines in these settings, NVAC hasestablished seven quality standards for vaccine providers conducting or planning toconduct adult immunization programs in nontraditional settings. Quality standards for immunization programs in nontraditional settings generally coincide with the quality standards for programs in traditional settings. NVAC 's quality standards for immunization programs in nontraditional settings are consistent with existing adult immunization standards of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) ( 20), ACP ( 21), the Infectious Disease Society of America ( 22), and NCAI ( 23), with additional caveats specific to nontraditional settings. Standard 1: Information and Education for Vaccinees Before receiving vaccine, the vaccinee must be given information about the risks and benefits associated with vaccination, including the CDC-developed Vaccination In-formation Statements that address the risks and benefits for 12 commonly adminis-tered vaccines, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. This information shouldbe culturally and linguistically appropriate and written at a reading level that can beeasily understood. The vaccine provider should be available to accurately address ques-tions and concerns posed by the vaccinee. Vaccinees should also be informed regarding the importance of having a medical home and receiving other preventive medical services. In addition, health promotionand disease prevention literature should be available on site and offered to the vac-cinee. Standard 2: Vaccine Storage and Handling Adherence to vaccine handling and storage recommendations included in vaccine package inserts is critical because mishandling and inappropriate storage can rendervaccines ineffective. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are the primary vaccinesadministered in nontraditional settings. These vaccines should be stored at tempera-tures between 2 C and 8 C (38 F and 48 F), and records of storage temperature shouldVol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 9 be maintained. Temperatures below freezing destroy the potency of these vaccines (24). Vaccine providers are responsible for ensuring appropriate storage of vaccines and should be trained accordingly. Storage procedures will become more complex ifthe types of vaccine offered in nontraditional settings increase. Standard 3: Immunization History Prevaccination screening interviews should be conducted and immunization histo- ries of vaccinees obtained before administering vaccines. At a minimum, the followinginformation should be obtained from the vaccinee: vaccines previously received, pre-existing health conditions, allergies, and adverse events that occurred after previousvaccinations. Consulting the vaccinee 's medical record is the most reliable method of determining immunization status; however, this is not always feasible, especially amongadults receiving vaccines in nontraditional settings. In many cases, the medical recordmight not be available or, if available, might not contain the most recent information,particularly if a vaccine was not administered by the vaccinee 's primary-care provider. Although repeated pneumococcal vaccination (especially within 24 months) might beassociated with local adverse reactions more severe than those occurring after initialvaccination ( 19,25 ), ACIP and ACP recommend that the vaccine be offered when vacci- nation status cannot be determined ( 19,21 ). Standard 4: Contraindications Before administering vaccine, vaccine providers must assess the presence of contraindications. This assessment, part of the process of assessing the vaccinee 's im- munization history (Standard 3), should be made during the prevaccination screeninginterview. If a contraindication to immunization exists, this information should be pro-vided to the primary-care provider or local health department and the vaccinee. Severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to egg protein, gelatin, neomycin, or streptomycin are contraindications for vaccines that contain theseproducts (e.g., influenza vaccines). Live virus vaccines are generally contraindicated foradults who are immunocompromised and for women who are pregnant. These impor-tant contraindications affect only a small number of adults. Adults who need vac-cine are more likely to not be offered it because of misconceptions concerningcontraindications (see Box). Standard 5: Recordkeeping Each time an adult receives a dose of vaccine, the following information should be recorded: vaccinee 's name, age, preexisting health conditions, type of vaccine, dose, site and route of administration, name of the vaccine provider, date vaccine was ad-ministered, manufacturer and lot number, and date that the next dose is due. If pos-sible, this information should be recorded in the vaccinee 's medical file, sent to their primary-care provider, and given to the vaccinee. Retrievable files also should be main-tained by the vaccine provider in compliance with general medical practice and staterequirements. Many adults do not have a primary-care provider and, even if they do, vaccine is often not administered by their primary-care provider. Geographic and occupational10 MMWR March 24, 2000 mobility, changes in sources of health care, and economic factors often cause adults to see several health-care providers throughout their lifetime. As a result, vaccinationrecords are often dispersed among a number of health-care providers. When vaccine isadministered by a health-care provider other than the vaccinee 's primary-care provider (e.g., vaccine received in a nontraditional setting), a vaccine card with the informationnoted in this standard should be provided to the primary-care provider or local healthdepartment (if no such provider can be identified) and the vaccinee. When possible,reminder notices should be sent to adults alerting them of when they are due for an-other vaccination. BOX.

Standards for pediatric immunization practices:recommendations of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee. MMWR 1993;42[No. RR-5]).Please consult with CDC 's National Immunization Program for updates.Vol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 11 Standard 6: Vaccine Administration Health-care providers who administer vaccine must have the legal authority to do so and must be appropriately trained and licensed in all aspects of vaccine administra-tion, including a) proper storage and handling of vaccines, b) information to be elicitedfrom clients before vaccination (Standard 3), c) information to be given to clients be-fore vaccination (Vaccine Information Statements), d) techniques for vaccine adminis-tration ( 20), and e) ability to handle adverse reactions. Specific information regarding the recommended route of administration and ap- propriate dose is included in the package insert of each vaccine. Most vaccines areadministered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The dose indicated in the insert shouldbe the dose administered. Administering one half of the recommended dose to poten-tially reduce the risk for adverse reaction has not been demonstrated to be an effectivemethod of reducing adverse reactions and could result in inadequate protection againstdisease ( 26). Standard 7: Adverse Events Vaccine providers must be trained to recognize and treat adverse reactions, and the equipment needed to do so must be available on site. Vaccines are safe and effective;however, adverse events, ranging from minor, local reactions to severe systemic ill-ness, occasionally occur following vaccination. Although severe, systemic reactionsare rare, they can be life-threatening. Vaccine providers should be trained to use medi-cations (epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate) and conduct procedures nec- essary to maintain the airway and manage cardiovascular collapse (basic and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], operation of a defibrillator, and use of a self-reinflating ventilating bag [Ambu bag] to provide positive pressure ventilation duringresuscitation). Vaccine providers must be in close proximity to a telephone so that emer-gency medical personnel can be summoned immediately, if necessary. Vaccinees should be monitored for adverse reactions after receiving vaccine. If a severe adverse reaction occurs while the vaccinee is on site or any time after receivingvaccine, the primary-care provider or local health department should be notified. To improve knowledge about vaccines and vaccine-associated adverse reactions, all serious adverse events should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse EventReporting System (VAERS) ( 21).

CONCLUSION The ability of vaccines to save lives and prevent suffering extends beyond child- hood. As with childhood vaccines, adult vaccines are a cost-effective means of prevent-ing disease ( 27,28 ). To realize these benefits, vaccines must be made readily available to the public. Although rates of vaccine coverage among adults are increasing, manyadults (especially among economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority popula-tions) are not receiving appropriate vaccinations ( 2). Enhancing educational efforts and increasing the number and types of programs (e.g., standing orders [29] and non-traditional settings) safely administering vaccine to adults might increase the numberof adults receiving vaccines and the associated benefits.12 MMWR March 24, 2000 Educating health-care providers and the public is the cornerstone of an effective vaccination strategy. The Adult Immunization Action Plan ( 1) emphasizes the need for physicians and other health-care providers to recognize both the severity of influenzaand pneumococcal disease and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines so they consis-tently offer vaccines to their patients. Physicians ' recommendations influence patients ' decisions to receive vaccine, regardless of the patients ' initial attitude ( 6). However, some adults who need vaccination receive medical care but are not offered vaccine,whereas others might not have regular contact with traditional health-care settings.For these reasons, increased efforts to educate the public as well as health-careproviders are needed. The 1994 NVAC report on adult immunization concluded that\"better public understanding of the seriousness of vaccine-preventable diseases and the benefits of vaccination will be essential if there are to be improvements in adultimmunization \" ( 30). An essential step toward creating an effective immunization infrastructure integrat- ing traditional and nontraditional immunization programs is to determine the role eachtype of program has in the overall immunization strategy. Data from immunizationprograms in traditional and nontraditional settings are needed to assess who receivesvaccine in which settings and why they choose that setting. Data characterizing per-sons who do not receive vaccine and their reasons for not getting vaccinated also areneeded. These data will facilitate the development of a comprehensive immunizationstrategy to increase immunization coverage in all segments of the adult population. Integration of nontraditional immunization programs with the existing health-care infrastructure provides the potential to increase vaccine coverage rates and decrease vaccine-preventable diseases among adults. To do so most effectively, the specific con- tributions of immunization programs in traditional and nontraditional settings need tobe established, and the quality standards in this report need to be implemented. Theefforts that effectively lowered vaccine-preventable disease rates among children nowneed to be targeted toward developing new and effective immunization programs thatwill make appropriate vaccines readily accessible to adults.

Two recent, systematic reviews of the health services research literature recommended standing orders programs as an effective organizational intervention to improve vaccination coverage rates among adults. This report briefly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of standing orders programs, describes standards for program implementation, and recommends initiating these programs to improve immunization coverage in several traditional and nontraditional settings. INTRODUCTION Standing orders programs authorize nurses and pharmacists to administer vaccina- tions according to an institution- or physician-approved protocol without a physician 's exam. These programs have documented improved vaccination rates among adults.Standing orders programs can be used in inpatient and outpatient facilities, long-term - care facilities, managed-care organizations, assisted living facilities, correctional facili-ties, pharmacies, adult workplaces, and home health-care agencies to vaccinate pa-tient, client, resident, and employee populations. The Advisory Committee on Immuni-zation Practices (ACIP) recommends standing orders for influenza and pneumococcalvaccinations ( 1,2). Recently, systematic literature reviews by the Task Force for Com- munity Preventive Services ( 3) and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center -RAND endorsed these programs for adult populations ( 4). This report briefly reviews the evidence regarding the effectiveness of standing or- ders programs in improving adult vaccination coverage rates and recommends priori-tizing these programs for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, to have the great-est impact on the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. Stand-ing orders programs are also recommended for other vaccines, including hepatitis Bvaccine and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccines, when feasible. BACKGROUND Epidemics of influenza occur during the winter months nearly every year and are responsible for an average of approximately 20,000 deaths per year in the United States( 5,6). Influenza viruses cause disease in all age groups ( 7,8), but rates of serious mor- bidity and mortality are highest among persons aged /G17965 years and persons of any age who have medical conditions that place them at high risk for complications from influ-22 MMWR March 24, 2000 enza ( 2,9-11). Pneumococcal disease accounts for approximately 3,000 cases of men- ingitis, 50,000 cases of bacteremia, and 500,000 cases of pneumonia each year ( 1) and is responsible for more deaths than any other vaccine-preventable bacterial disease( 12). Despite antimicrobial therapy and intensive medical care, the overall case-fatality rate for pneumococcal bacteremia is 15% -20% among adults (i.e., persons aged /G17918 years) ( 1). Among persons aged /G17965 years, case-fatality rates can be as high as 40% ( 13). In recent years, a rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci, especially to penicillin, has occurred. Increasing pneumococcal vaccination rates couldhelp prevent invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine-type, multidrug-resistant pneumococci. Outbreaks of pneumococcal disease caused by a single drug-resistant pneumococcal serotype have occurred in institutional settings, including nurs-ing homes ( 14,15 ). In 1999, because of concerns about pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance and underuse of pneumococcal vaccine, the American Medical Associationand several partner organizations issued a Quality Care Alert that supports ACIP 's rec- ommendations for pneumococcal vaccination ( 16). Health services research indicates that influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are underused in institutional settings, even after they became covered benefits of Medi-care Part B (1981 for pneumoccocal vaccine and 1993 for influenza vaccine) ( 17,18 ). Despite the availability of suitable vaccines, persons hospitalized with conditions forwhich influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are indicated are not usually assessed forvaccination status or vaccinated. Among persons who reported at least one hospital-ization during the preceding year to the 1997 National Health Interview Survey, 83% of persons aged 18 -64 years with medical conditions that put them at high risk and 55% of all persons aged /G17965 years reported not receiving pneumococcal vaccinations (CDC, unpublished data, 1999). Sixty-nine percent of persons aged 18 -64 years with medical conditions that put them at high risk and 32% of all persons aged /G17965 years reported not receiving influenza vaccination (CDC, unpublished data, 1999). In 12 western states,80% of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for pneumonia during September -Decem- ber 1994 did not receive influenza vaccines; 65% did not receive pneumococcal vac-cines ( 17). The 1995 National Nursing Home Survey estimated influenza and pneumo- coccal vaccination rates among residents in long-term -care facilities to be approxi- mately 63% and 22%, respectively ( 18). These rates are far below the Healthy People 2010 objective of 90% for both vaccines among all persons aged /G17965 years (objective 14-29) ( 19). Coverage estimates for 1997 were approximately 64% for influenza vac- cines and 28% for pneumococcal vaccines (CDC, unpublished data, 1999). Many long-term -care facilities have inadequate policies and procedures to prevent vaccine-pre- ventable diseases among their vulnerable populations ( 20). Several studies suggest that standing orders programs are more effective than other institution-based strategies in improving vaccination services. In one New York hospi-tal, instituting a standing orders program for pneumococcal vaccination among per-sons aged /G17965 years and other patients at high risk increased the pneumococcal vacci- nation rate from 0% to 78% ( 21). In another study, pharmacists increased pneumococ- cal vaccination rates from 4.2% to 94% in one nursing facility and from 1.9% to 83% ina second facility, whereas the rates at a control facility increased from 0.9% to 4.0%( 22). In a study of six small community hospitals in northern Minnesota, standing or- ders programs achieved an influenza vaccination rate of 40.3% among patients, com-pared with 17% using physician reminders and 9.6% using educational programs ( 23).Vol. 49 / No. RR-1 MMWR 23 A study conducted in an ambulatory care clinic compared the use of nurse standing orders combined with other interventions, including patient and health-care providerreminders, with the use of patient and provider reminders alone. Pneumococcalvaccination rates per total patient population were 22% -25% for the nurse standing orders programs, compared with 5% when patient and provider reminders were usedalone ( 24). Based on the scientific evidence of effectiveness in improving vaccination rates in institutions, the Task Force for Community Preventive Services and the Southern Cali-fornia Evidence-Based Practice Center -RAND recommend standing orders programs for the vaccination of adults in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes ( 3,4). Standing orders policies are acceptable to most primary-care physicians ( 25) and have resulted in higher vaccination rates than other vaccination delivery methods ( 4,26 ). IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES Successful standing orders programs begin by documenting a plan for the program 's infrastructure, key service-delivery components, and quality assurance. To ensure suc-cess, a committee should be formed that includes the organization 's medical director, nursing director, infection-control and quality-control personnel, and medical or nurs-ing staff representatives. This committee should write protocols for the following pro-cedures: \u007fIdentifying persons eligible for vaccination based on their age, their vaccination status (e.g., persons previously unvaccinated or due for vaccination according to the recommended schedule), or the presence of a medical condition that puts them at high risk. \u007fProviding adequate information to patients or their guardians regarding the risks for and benefits of a vaccine and documenting the delivery of that information. \u007fRecording patient refusals or medical contraindications. \u007fRecording administration of a vaccine(s) and any postvaccination adverse events, according to institution- or physician-approved protocol. \u007fProviding documentation of vaccine administration to patients and their primary-care providers. Standing orders protocols should also specify that vaccines be administered by health-care professionals trained to a) screen patients for contraindications to vaccina-tion, b) administer vaccines, and c) monitor patients for adverse events, in accordancewith state and local regulations. Vaccine information statements developed by and avail-able from CDC can be useful for risk/benefit counseling before administering a vaccine.All health-care personnel administering vaccines or providing care to vaccinated per-sons should be trained to report adverse outcomes to the Vaccine Adverse Events Re-porting System (VAERS). The appropriate VAERS forms and contact information shouldbe readily available in all facilities delivering vaccines. The standards for adult immunization practice established by the National Coalition for Adult Immunization recommend that standing orders programs include a standardpersonal and institutional immunization record to verify the immunization status of24 MMWR March 24, 2000 patients and staff members and to reduce the risk for inappropriate revaccination ( 27). A patient 's primary-care provider should be able to override institutional standing or- ders when medically appropriate. Ongoing communication between the primary-careprovider, vaccinee, and institutional staff members is recommended to reduce the pos-sibility of inappropriate vaccinations. None of the studies of standing orders programs for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination reported unnecessary or inappropriate If re- peated pneumococcal occur, studies have indicated that the risk foradverse events beyond self-limited local reactions was minimal for a second dose ad-ministered 2 -5 years after the primary dose ( 1,28 ). The risk for self-limited local injec- tion site reactions does not represent a contraindication to revaccination with pneumo-coccal vaccine in recommended groups. The policies and protocols for standing orders programs should include a quality assurance process to maintain appropriate standards of care. The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of standing orders programs in several settings need ongoing evalua-tion, with particular attention to safety and tracking of vaccinations ( 29). For example, preprinted admissions orders could improve the effectiveness of program staff mem-bers to assess the vaccination status of patients and to provide information about therisks for and benefits of administering vaccinations routinely upon admission to facili-ties. Facility staff members should consider other potential benefits (e.g., sustainability over time) when developing standing orders programs ( 30). These programs could be adapted to other preventive services (e.g., mammography) to improve delivery of those services, and they could be used to improve clinic efficiency by reducing pressures on physicians ' time ( 3). CONCLUSION ACIP recommends that standing orders programs be used in long-term -care facili- ties under the supervision of a medical director to ensure the administration of recom-mended vaccinations for adults. ACIP also encourages the introduction of standingorders programs for vaccination of adults in other settings (e.g., inpatient and outpa-tient facilities, managed-care organizations, assisted living facilities, correctional facili-ties, pharmacies, adult workplaces, and home health-care agencies). Implementationof standing orders programs alone or combined with other effective interventions canhelp improve vaccination coverage by institutional providers ( 3,4,31 ). Because of the societal burden of influenza and pneumococcal disease, implementation of standingorders programs to improve adult vaccination coverage for these diseases should be anational public health priority.

DOI: 10.1086/650298executive summary This guideline provides the updated recommendations of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) re-garding the management of healthcare providers who areinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus(HCV), and/or the human immunodeciency virus (HIV).For the reasons cited in the guideline, SHEA continues torecommend that, although some aspects of the approach toand administrative management of each of these infectioussyndromes in healthcare providers are similar, separate man-agement strategies for healthcare workers who are infectedwith these unrelated viruses remain appropriate. As we didin both prior iterations of this document, SHEA emphasizesthe use of appropriate infection control procedures to min-imize exposure of patients or providers to blood, emphasizesthat transfers of blood from patients to providers and fromproviders to patients should be avoided, and recommendsthat infected healthcare providers should not be totally pro-hibited from participating in patient-care activities solely onthe basis of a bloodborne pathogen infection. The types ofprocedures assessed by the panel as associated with an in-creased risk for provider-to-patient transmission of thesepathogens are discussed in detail. For each pathogen, rec-ommendations are graduated according to the relative viralload level of the infected provider (Tables 1 and 2). However,SHEA emphasizes that, because of the complexity of thesecases, each such case will be slightly different from the next,and each should be independently considered in context. HBV SHEA recommends that HBV-infected healthcare providers who test either positive for HBV \"e\" antigen (HBeAg) ornegative for HBeAg but who have circulating HBV burdens of greater than or equal to 10 4genome equivalents (GE) per milliliter of blood routinely use double-gloving for all invasive procedures, for all contact with mucous membranes or non- intact skin, and for all instances in patient care for which gloving is recommended, and that they not perform those Category III activities identied as associated with a risk forprovider-to-patient HBV transmission despite the use of ap- propriate infection control procedures (details of the pro- cedures identied as associated with increased risk for trans- mission are given in Table 2). SHEA recommends that a healthcare provider who has a circulating HBV burden of less than 10 4GE/mL be allowed to perform those Category III activities identied as associated with a risk for provider-to-patient transmission of blood- borne pathogens, so long as the infected provider (1) is not detected as having transmitted infection to patients; (2) ob-tains advice from an Expert Review Panel (the function of the Expert Review Panel is discussed in more detail in Rec- ommendation 8, below) about continued practice; (3) un- dergoes follow-up routinely by Occupational Medicine staff (or an appropriate public health ofcial), who test the pro-vider twice per year to demonstrate the maintenance of a viral burden of less than 10 4GE/mL; (4) also receives follow- up by a personal physician who has expertise in the man- agement of HBV infection and who is allowed by the providerto communicate with the Expert Review Panel about theprovider's clinical status; (5) consults with an expert aboutoptimal infection control procedures (and strictly adheres to the recommended procedures, including the routine use of double gloving for Category II and Category III proceduresand frequent glove changes during procedures, particularly204 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 table 1.

HCV SHEA recommends that HCV-infected providers who have circulating HCV viral burdens of greater than or equal to 10 4 GE/mL routinely use double-gloving for all invasive proce-dures, for all contact with mucous membranes or nonintactskin, and for all instances in patient care for which glovingis routinely recommended, and that they not perform thoseCategory III activities identied as associated with a risk forprovider-to-patient transmission of bloodborne pathogen in-fection despite the use of appropriate infection control pro-cedures. SHEA also recommends that an HCV-infected pro-vider who has a viral burden of less than 10 4GE/mL not be excluded from any aspect of patient care, including the per-formance of Category III procedures (Tables 1 and 2), so longas the infected provider (1) is not detected as having trans-mitted infection to patients; (2) obtains advice from an ExpertReview Panel about continued practice; (3) undergoes follow- up routinely by Occupational Medicine, who tests the pro-vider twice annually to demonstrate the maintenance of aviral burden of less than 10 4GE/mL; (4) also receives follow- up by a personal physician who has expertise in the man-agement of HCV infection and who is allowed by the providerto communicate with the Expert Review Panel about theprovider's clinical status; (5) consults with an infection con-trol expert about optimal infection control procedures (andstrictly adheres to the recommended procedures, includingthe routine use of double-gloving during Category II andCategory III procedures and frequent glove changes duringprocedures, particularly if performing technical tasks knownto compromise glove integrity [eg, placing sternal wires]); 6)agrees to the information in and signs a contract or letterfrom the Expert Review Panel that characterizes her or hisresponsibilities (discussed in more detail in Recommendation8, below).

SHEA recommends that an HIV- infected provider who has a viral burden of less than 5# GE/mL not be excluded from any aspect of patient care, 210including the performance of Category III procedures, so long as the infected provider (1) is not detected as having trans- mitted infection to patients; (2) obtains advice from an Expert Review Panel about continued practice; (3) undergoes follow-up routinely by Occupational Medicine (or an appropriatepublic health ofcial), who tests the provider twice annuallyto demonstrate the maintenance of a viral burden of less than GE/mL; (4) also receives follow-up by a personal 25#10 physician who has expertise in the management of HIV in- fection and who is allowed by the provider to communicate with the Expert Review Panel about the provider's clinicalstatus; (5) consults with an expert about optimal infectioncontrol procedures (and strictly adheres to the recommendedprocedures, including the routine use of double-gloving for Category II and Category III procedures and frequent glove changes during procedures, particularly if performing tech-nical tasks known to compromise glove integrity [eg, placingsternal wires]); and (6) agrees to the information in and signsa contract or letter from the Expert Review Panel that char- acterizes her or his responsibilities (discussed in more detail in Recommendation 8, below). General Recommendations The rationale for these recommendations is presented below (in the section Background and Rationale). SHEA argues for comprehensive education concerning bloodborne pathogensfor all healthcare providers and trainees. SHEA recommendsmanaging infected providers in the context of a comprehen- sive approach to the management of all impaired providers. SHEA emphasizes the importance of patient safety as well asprovider privacy and medical condentiality. The Society alsoemphasizes the importance of offering employees who havedisabilities reasonable accommodation for their disabilities.The guideline discusses exposure management in detail and,in general, recommends adherence to existing guidelines for managing exposures to these viruses. SHEA underscores thatpractitioners who are institutionally based and who developone of these bloodborne pathogen infections are ethicallybound to report their infections to their institutions' occu-pational medicine providers and to engage in the processesoutlined below. Further, practitioners who are not institu- tionally based and who develop one of these bloodborne path-ogen infections are ethically bound to engage their publichealth departments (consonant with state and local laws), asdescribed below. Finally, the society encourages routine vol- untary, condential testing of providers, emphasizing thatproviders who conduct Category III procedures should knowtheir immune or infection status with respect to each of these3 bloodborne pathogens. Specic details and the rationale forthese recommendations are included in the body of theguideline. introduction In 1990, in response to public and professional concern thatarose in the wake of a highly publicized cluster of cases ofprovider-to-patient transmission of the human immunode-ciency virus (HIV) in a Florida dentist's practice, 3-8,SHEA, in collaboration with the Association for Practitioners in In-fection Control, published a position paper concerning theadministrative management of healthcare providers who are infected with certain bloodborne pathogens. 9As additional information became available, in 1997 SHEA issued an up- dated position paper discussing the management of health- care workers infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitisC virus (HCV), HIV , or other bloodborne pathogens. 10The purpose of the present guideline is to provide updated guid- ance from SHEA regarding the administrative managementof providers infected with these bloodborne pathogens, giventhe progress in the eld since 1997. Despite the widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine, HBV remains the most commonly transmitted bloodborne path- ogen in the healthcare setting. Although continued wide- spread administration of the vaccine should eventually mit- igate this risk, any guideline for the years 2009 and beyondmust include recommendations for HBV-infected providers.Similarly, the past 12 years' experience has provided insightin the factors influencing the risk for provider-to-patient transmission of HCV . Because we do not have a hepatitis C vaccine yet, and, with the prevalence of HCV infection risingaround the world, this flavivirus is likely to become the most frequently transmitted bloodborne pathogen in health care in the years ahead. Provider-to-patient transmission of HIV has been extremely rare, with no cases reported worldwidesince 2003. Nonetheless, the rst instance of transmission ofHIV from an infected provider to a patient was the drivingforce for the creation of guidelines and recommendations about providers infected with bloodborne pathogens. This document provides updated information about each virus and the healthcare risks associated with infected prac-titioners and then addresses a series of questions relevant to the management of providers infected with each of these viruses. We then make recommendations about the manage-ment of providers infected with these bloodborne pathogens,citing the available evidence supporting the recommenda-tions. The evidence base for these recommendations is limit- ed at best. By the very nature of the topics being discussed, di-rect hypothesis-driven experimentation is virtually impossi- ble, and may be complicated further by a low rate of voluntarytable 2.

Most data that we have aboutthis subject come from documented instances of transmis-sion. Many if not most of the conclusions from these studiesare inferential. Some evidence comes from experimental lab-oratory studies or models. Thus, this guideline cannot havethe scientic evidence-base found in many other guidelines.Nonetheless, we do have a broad experience working withthese pathogens in the healthcare setting and the science baseis much more robust than it was at the time the last guidancewas published by SHEA in 1997. epidemiology Provider-to-Patient Transmission of HBV With respect to HBV transmission, through 1994, investi- gators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) had identied 42 instances of provider-to-patienttransmission of HBV (375 patients). 11Subsequently, 2 ad- ditional clusters of provider-to-patient transmission of HBVinfection were reported that involved surgeons who testedpositive for HBeAg. 12,13 In one of these more recent clusters, 4 patients acquiredclinical hepatitis B infection from an orthopedic surgeon fol- lowing surgeries conducted by the infected provider.13In a second, more recent cluster, 19 of the 144 susceptible patientswhose surgical team included an HBV-infected thoracic sur-gery resident became infected. 12No specic events or breaks in technique were identied in either cluster that could ex-plain the transmissions, although the thoracic surgery resi-dent did not wear double gloves. Since 1996, there have beenan additional 10 reports of hepatitis B transmission fromproviders to patients. These cases have generally been asso-ciated with HBV-infected surgeons; one case was associatedwith an infected dentist 14,15(I. Williams, CDC, personal com- munication). An important report from the United Kingdomunderscored the potential for transmission from providerswho are infected with so-called \"pre-core\" mutants of HBV . 14 Such providers are HBeAg negative but have a high circulatingviral burden. This report 14underscores the importance of directly measuring viral burden, as opposed to assaying forsurrogate markers of viral burden (such as HBeAg). Only onerelatively recent report is from North America: in this largeoutbreak, 75 patients were infected from procedures involvingplacement of subdermal electroencephalogram electrodes by208 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 table 3.

CI, condence interval. aMore than 97% of the procedures (ie, procedures in 270 of 278 patients) that the provider had participated in were classied by the incident team as \"high-risk exposure-prone procedures.\" bPatient notication was performed in 2 stages: the identication of 4 transmissions triggered an extension of the look-back exercise, resulting in the identication of 3 additional infections. cAll the patients included in the analysis had procedures that met investigators' denition of \"high risk exposure- prone procedures,\" characterizedas \"high risk exposure-prone procedures.\" dAll these patients had undergone exposure-prone procedures. Investigators assumed that this general surgeon's workload was similar to that of the other general surgeon (ie, 84% of exposure prone procedures were \"high-riskexposure prone procedures\"). eAll the patients tested and included in the table (ie, accounting for 198 of 228 of the provider's procedures) were patients who had high \"high risk exposure-prone procedures.\"an HBeAg-positive technician.16Although infection control procedures in this electroencephalography clinic were deemedinadequate, no specic mechanism for transmission wasidentied. Although such clusters continue to occur (acknowledging that the United States does not have systemic surveillancemeasures to detect such cases), they appear to be occurringless frequently than in the past. In contrast, the problem ofpatient-to-patient transmission of HBV and HCV arisingfrom inadequate infection control precautions, such as reuseof multidose vials of medication, has become increasinglyimportant as a iatrogenic bloodborne pathogeninfection. 17 Provider-to-Patient Transmission of HCV Provider-to-patient transmission of HCV has been extremely uncommon in the United States and has had a reasonablyunique epidemiology in this county. Conversely, transmissionof HCV from infected providers has been somewhat morefrequently detected in Europe (Table 3). As noted above, forall of these pathogens, provider-to-patient transmission ofHCV is extremely unlikely in the course of routine (ie, non-invasive) patient care. The risk for provider-to-patient trans-mission of HCV appears to be even smaller than the risk forHBV transmission in the course of noninvasive patient care,presumably because most individuals chronically infected with HCV have circulating viral loads that are orders of mag- nitude lower than those of the hepatitis B carriers who have been identied as transmitting infection to their patients. Several instances of provider-to-patient transmission of HCV have been reported in the literature. 18-32The rst doc- umented instance of provider-to-patient transmission of HCV was reported from England in 1995 (Table 3).23Ap a - tient who had undergone cardiac surgery developed acute HCV infection and had no risk factors for infection. The rst assistant surgeon on the operative team was found to beinfected with HCV . A \"look-back\" study of the patients for whom the surgeon had provided care revealed that only one of the surgeon's 278 patients developed HCV infection with a strain identical to the surgeon's. 21During the time the UK investigation was in process, an additional instance of pro- vider-to-patient transmission of HCV was reported from Spain.22The detection of 2 unexpected cases of HCV infection among cardiac surgery patients participating in a study of transfusion-transmitted infections prompted a look-backstudy of the patients of a chronically HCV-infected surgeon.The Spanish look-back study identied an additional 4 HCVinfections (ie, totaling 6 [2.7%] of the 222 patients who had been operated on by the surgeon). 22Five of the 6 HCV strains isolated from these patients were closely related to the strainguideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 209 isolated from the surgeon, and each of these patients had undergone valve replacement surgery.22 An HCV-infected gynecologist in the UK transmitted in- fection to several patients. After a single patient became in-fected after a gynecological procedure, 24,33a detailed look- back study tested more than 4,500 patients, of whom 3,628had undergone \"high risk, exposure-prone procedures\" thatwere performed by the surgeon in the previous 20 years. Sevenadditional patients were found to have HCV infection causedby strains of HCV closely related to the strain recovered fromthe surgeon (Table 3). 26 Ross and coworkers28from Germany reported the results of a look-back study of 207 of the 229 patients operated onby an HCV-infected orthopedic surgeon. Three of the 207were found to be HCV infected, but only 1 (a patient whohad undergone a total hip arthroplasty with trochanteric os-teotomy) was infected with a strain that was similar to thestrain recovered from the HCV-infected orthopedist. 28Sub- sequently, these same investigators also conducted a look-back study of the patients of an HCV-infected obstetrician/gynecologist. The look-back study was prompted by the de-tection of an unanticipated instance of HCV infection in apatient who had undergone a cesarean delivery. This patientwas found to be infected with an HCV strain that was virtuallyidentical to the strain infecting the obstetrician/gynecologistwho had performed the procedure. 29The investigators screened 2,286 of the obstetrician/gynecologist's 2,907 pa-tients and found no further evidence of transmission. 29 Three additional patient-to-provider look-back studies in- volving the potential for transmission of HCV from health-care worker to patient have been reported from the UnitedKingdom (Table 3). 27,34,35In the rst of these studies, 3 in- fections (among 1,900 patients) were attributed to an HCV-infected provider. In the second, 1 infection was found among749 patients of an HCV-infected provider. 35In the third, a look-back study has been reported as being initiated in theUnited Kingdom, although no results from the study havebeen published; 27letters were sent to 228 patients of an HCV- infected practitioner offering follow-up testing, after an indexcase was identied as linked to the practitioner following an\"exposure-prone\" procedure. Several reports involve HCV-infected anesthesiologists. In the United Kingdom, 31an HCV-infected anesthesiologist in- fected a patient during a procedure in which the anesthesi-ologist endotracheally intubated the patient, inserted a pe-ripheral venous catheter, and provided general anesthesia. Hedid not participate in any procedure considered to be \"ex-posure-prone.\" The anesthesiologist vehemently denied in-jection drug use 31; however, in several similar cases described below, drug diversion was implicated as the cause of blood-borne pathogen transmission. Ross and colleagues 36reported a cluster of 5 cases of HCV infection from an anesthesia assistant. The anesthesia assistantpurportedly acquired acute HCV infection as a result of anoccupational exposure to an HCV-infected patient in the op-erating room (presumably, by contaminating an open wound on a nger of his right hand). This assistant may have pre-sented an increased risk for transmission, since he was work-ing while developing acute HCV infection and before havinga detectable immunologic response at a time when his viralburden was likely high. In the course of 3 weeks (duringwhich his nger was purportedly still weeping) he infected 5patients. He vehemently denied drug abuse, but the similarityof this case to the case described by Sehulster and colleagues 37 (discussed below) is striking. An important feature of thiscluster is the fact that the anesthesia assistant did not followuniversal/standard precautions. He did not wear gloves (evenwhen he had the open lesion on his right hand). Ross andcolleagues 36suggest that if the anesthesia assistant had fol- lowed universal/standard precautions, these infections wouldhave likely been prevented. In another highly unusual case, a child acquired HCV in- fection from his mother, who was functioning as his health-care provider. 38The child was a hemophiliac whose mother administered his frequently required clotting-factor concen-trate infusions. The mother (who had chronic HCV infection)did not wear gloves and recalled several instances in whichshe stuck her own nger with the needle (often with her ownblood visible). Sequence analysis demonstrated that the HCVisolates from the mother and the child were identical. 38 For reasons that are not certain, look-back studies from the United Kingdom have found substantially more cases oftransmission. Grouping the various studies from the UnitedKingdom yields a transmission rate of 0.19% (15 patientsinfected of 7,656 patients tested) without inclusion of indexcases, and 0.26% with the inclusion of index cases. In contrast,studies from Germany have found no additional cases oftransmission among more than 3,000 people tested, beyondthe index cases that prompted the look-back studies. How-ever, if one includes the index cases, the transmission ratefor these studies is 0.13% (similar to the rate for the studiesfrom the United Kingdom). The experience in the United States is quite different. In- jection drug use on the part of the infected provider appearsto play a more central role in provider-to-patient HCV trans-mission. Williams and colleagues 39recently reviewed the US experience, noting that 4 episodes of transmission have beendetected. The rst involved an HCV-infected surgical tech-nician who infected approximately 40 of 346 patients duringa 3-month period. 37,39This healthcare provider admitted self- injecting anesthesia medications and then using the samesyringe to administer drugs to patients. The second involvedan anesthesiologist who acquired HCV infection from onepatient and subsequently, during the anesthesiologist's acutephase of infection, transmitted the same strain of HCV to apatient; no further transmissions were identied. This an-esthesiologist was also suspected to be abusing narcotics. 20,39 The third case of HCV transmission is more similar to thoseseen in the United Kingdom. An HCV-infected cardiac sur-geon was found to have infected as many as 14 of the 937210 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 patients who could be evaluated from over a decade of sur- gical practice.39Narcotics abuse was not suspected. Interest- ingly, following an expert review of the surgeon's practice, the surgeon was treated for his HCV infection and was al- lowed to continue to practice; he continued to perform car- diovascular procedures that would by any measure be con-sidered exposure-prone. He made modications to his tech- nique, including the use of double gloves and other safety devices, and in addition, his patients were prospectively tested for HCV infection; to date no additional instances of trans- mission have been detected. The fourth report describes acertied registered nurse anesthetist who transmitted HCV to at least 15 of 164 patients during a 4-month period co- inciding with the acute phase of his own HCV infection. The certied registered nurse anesthetist did not perform expo- sure-prone procedures and a specic mechanism of trans-mission was not identied; however, similar to the rst 2cases, the nurse anesthetist was suspected of abusing patientmedications. 39A fth instance of provider-to-patient trans- mission of HCV in the United States is currently under in- vestigation, but the details are not yet available (J. Perz, CDC, personal communication). Although the precise mode of transmission for HCV for the majority of these cases remains unknown, the circum-stances surrounding several of the cases suggest that trans-mission was associated with percutaneous exposures. Clearly,at least in the United States, a number of the instances ofprovider-to-patient HCV transmission have been associatedwith diversion of patients' drugs to healthcare providers whowere abusing injectable narcotics. Although the contributionof injection drug use to provider-to-patient transmission ofHCV has been most noticeable in the United States, 2 ad-ditional cases, one from Spain, the other from Israel, under-score its potential importance. In the cluster of cases fromSpain, an anesthesiologist who was addicted to opiates wasdiverting some of patients' narcotics for personal use andthen injecting the patients with the same syringe that he hadused, thereby infecting more than 200 patients. 18,40In the report from Israel, an injection drug-using anesthesiologistinfected 33 patients by diverting some patients' drugs to him-self and then using the same apparatus for injecting the drugsinto the patient. 32Detection of underlying injection drug use in these circumstances is difcult, at best, so one cannot sayfor certain the extent to which this behavior may have in-fluenced the other cases reported in the literature. Summarizing the world literature and excluding those re- ports in which injection drug use was considered to be acontributing factor for transmission, there were 2 gynecol-ogists, 3 cardiac or thoracic surgeons, 1 anesthesiologist, and1 orthopedic surgeon involved in the instances of transmis-sion. These data lend credence to the hypothesis that \"ex-posure-prone, invasive procedures\" are likely to pose the larg-est risk for provider-to-patient transmission of HCV .Provider-to-Patient Transmission of HIV In the 25 years since HIV was rst isolated, only 4 instances of HIV transmission from infected health care workers to 1 or more patients have been reported. 3-8,41-45One cluster of infections occurred in the United States in 1990;3-82 cases occurred in France,41,42,44,45and 1 instance of transmission occurred in Spain.43 The US cluster involved a dentist who had acquire immune deciency syndrome (AIDS); 6 of his patients became HIV infected. Their HIV isolates were linked to his, both epide-miologically and by DNA sequencing. 3-8A thorough inves- tigation CDC and viral suggest- ed practitioner-to-patient spread, though the precise mecha- nism or mechanisms of transmission were not determined. Although the dentist was a patient in his own practice, noinfection control deciencies were identied that would read-ily explain HIV transmission to the 6 patients. Additionally,the dentist did not recall occupational injuries that could havecreated an opportunity for cross-contamination. Despite sub- stantial speculation, no data were uncovered suggesting in- tentional transmission. The second instance of provider-to-patient HIV transmis- sion involved an orthopedic surgeon in France who trans-mitted HIV to 1 patient. Transmission was conrmed through DNA sequence analysis of viral isolates obtained from the surgeon and the patient. 42,45The surgeon was not aware of his infection until surveillance case denition AIDS was di- agnosed. French investigators initiated a look-back study ofthe surgeon's 3004 patients since 1983. Investigators suc- cessfully contacted 2458 patients and performed HIV sero- logic tests on 983. One patient was found to have acquiredHIV infection. This patient had 3 procedures performed bythe surgeon, had a negative HIV serology before undergoingthe rst of the 3 procedures, and was found to be infect- ed with HIV when she underwent testing before the third procedure. 42,45The authors of the manuscript speculated that both the extended length of the initial procedure (10 hours) and the high likelihood that the surgeon had a high viralburden (since he had far advanced, untreated disease) con-tributed to the transmission. No breaches in recommended infection-control practices were identied in retrospect. The third episode of provider-to-patient HIV transmission also was detected in France. In this unusual case, transmissionof HIV is suggested to have occurred from an infected nurseto a patient, although no clear mechanism for transmissioncould be identied. 44The investigators conducted a look-back study focusing on 7,580 patients for whom the infected nursehad provided care. They were able to locate 5,308 patients,and they serologically tested 2,293. 41No additional infections The nurse was coinfected with HCV and hadboth a high HIV viral burden and advanced HCV-inducedhepatic disease, including clotting abnormalities. HCV wasapparently not transmitted to the patient, but the HIV isolatesfrom patient and provider were closely related. The nurse wasguideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 211 unaware of either viral infection, though she became symp- tomatic enough to require hospitalization within 2 weeks ofthe date on which transmission was thought to have occurred. She denied injection drug use. The fourth case occurred in Spain; a woman was infected with HIV by her obstetrician/gynecologist during cesarean delivery. Spanish ofcials conducted a look-back evaluationof the physician's patients. Of 275 patients on whom thepractitioner had performed procedures, 250 could be tested,and none were found to be infected. 43 More than 4 dozen look-back studies have been conducted evaluating the HIV antibody status of patients retrospectivelyidentied as having received medical or dental care from anHIV-infected practitioner 5,46-57(Lisa Panlilio, CDC, personal communication). None of these studies identied transmis- sion of HIV infection. To our knowledge, only the reportfrom France described above, in which an orthopedic surgeon infected one of his patients, identied iatrogenic transmission of HIV in a look-back study. 42,45In the United Kingdom, no cases of HIV transmission from a healthcare worker to a patient have been detected, despite 28 patient noticationexercises and testing of more than 11,000 patients between 1988 and 2006 (F. Ncube, MD, Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, United Kingdom, personal commu- nication). One unusual cluster of patient-to-patient HIV transmission in a surgical practice in Australia has been de-scribed in the literature; 58however, the practitioner providing the care was not infected. pathogenesis and transmission risk HBV , HCV , and HIV are most readily transmitted either par- enterally or across mucous membranes. Therefore, experts uniformly agree that the risk for transmission of these viruses from an infected provider to a patient during the provision of routine healthcare that does not involve invasive proce- dures is negligible. In instances in which invasive procedures,and even exposure-prone invasive procedures, are being con- ducted, these risks are still quite small, but are clearly elevated when compared with other routine patient-care activities. For this reason, a precise assessment of the magnitude of risk fortransmission of each of the viruses\u2014in the context of pro-cedures associated with risks for exposing patients to the infected provider's blood or virus-containing body fluids\u2014 becomes critical to the overall risk assessment. At least in partbecause these transmission events occur uncommonly for each of these 3 pathogens, such information is difcult toaccumulate. Several studies have attempted to measure the risk that is associated with single discrete exposures (eg, the \"needlestick\" transmission rate) for transmission of these 3 pathogens. Onlya few manuscripts have addressed the risk to patients whoare cared for by an HBV-infected practitioner, 11,14,59-63an HCV-infected practitioner,22,23,64-66or an HIV-infected prac-titioner5,46-51,54,57,67Several variables are likely to influence the transmission rate. The rst factor to influence risk is the intrinsic transmis- sibility of a specic pathogen. With respect to HBV , studiesfrom the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated a risk for transmis-sion associated with a percutaneous (ie, needlestick) exposure to blood from an HBV-infected individual that ranged from 6% to 37% (19%-37%, if the donor blood is HBeAg-pos-itive). 68,69The risk for transmission of HCV associated with such exposures has been estimated at 1%-2% (summarizedin Henderson 65). The risk for transmission of HIV associated with needlestick or percutaneous exposures has been esti- mated at 0.3% (summarized in Henderson70). With the ex- ception of the HBV studies (which do make the distinctionbetween HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative source pa- tients), none of the HCV or HIV transmission studies con-siders the circulating viral burden of the source patient inthe risk calculation. With respect to HIV transmission from provider to patient, since the previous version of this guideline 10was published in 1997, only 3 instances of transmission have been de- tected,41-45and in each instance only 1 patient was found to be infected, despite exhaustive look-back investigations. A second important issue for consideration in assessing the risk for provider-to-patient transmission of bloodborne path- ogens is the frequency with which providers sustain injuriesthat might present a risk for transmission to their patients. 71-79 Since the previous version of this guideline10was published, numerous strategies and interventions designed to reduce the risk for occupational exposures for providers have been im-plemented (discussed in more detail in the later part of this section). Many of these interventions have been shown to be efcacious in reducing risks for occupational exposures; 80-86 however, in many instances, the use of such interventionshas been suboptimal. 87-89Another set of factors that relates directly to the frequency with which exposures occur includesboth the experience of the practitioner and the expertise of the practitioner. With respect to experience, clearly, students and trainees are more likely to sustain such exposures. A special problem arises when a training institution becomes aware that a trainee is chronically infected with a bloodborne pathogen. Such instances should be handled on a case-by- case basis, in consultation with the institution's legal counsel,the house staff training director, infection control profes-sionals, the dean of the school, and others who are involvedstakeholders. To date, these cases have been handled unevenly across the country, with some institutions focusing on thedisability-law aspects and others focusing on liability. 90The institution should assist the trainee in selecting a career pathbest suited to her or his specic situation and should providereasonable accommodation to students and trainees who havedisabling conditions. The expertise of the practitioner is morecomplex to measure, but may be indirectly assessed by eval-uating postprocedure infection rates, bleeding and other pro-212 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 cedure-related complications, and other adverse events as- sociated with the performance of the practitioner. The third issue that warrants consideration is how fre- quently such an exposure occurs and is then followed byexposure to a patient (ie, the so-called \"recontact\" or \"bleed-back\" risk). For example, intraoperative injuries sustained bysurgical care providers offer an opportunity for \"recontact\"to occur. In 2 studies of intraoperative provider injuries,11.4%-29% of the sharp objects that caused injury to theprovider \"recontacted\" the patient. 73,79These exposures can be prevented by immediately replacing the contaminated su-ture needle or other sharp object before reuse. Recontacts canalso occur when the provider is injured by bone spicules ormaterials permanently embedded in the patient's body. 73,79 These sources of potential patient exposure might be pre-vented by the use of safety devices or other interventions.For example, such exposures might be prevented by the useof reinforced gloves, 91,92double-gloving, glove-liners, or other devices or materials to protect the provider's hands.89,91,93-96 Gloves constructed of monolament polymers or other ma-terials resistant to tears have become available for use whenmanipulation of bone fragments or suture wires is needed,but their use has been associated with a decrease in tactilesensation. In addition, the use of blunted suture needles hasbeen shown to decrease the risk of percutaneous injuries tothe surgeon. 86,97-99 A fourth factor to consider in the risk assessment is the effect of the infected provider's circulating viral burden. How-ever, with the exception of the HBV studies (which do makethe distinction between HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negativesource patients), none of the HCV or HIV transmission stud-ies considers the circulating viral burden of the source patientin the risk calculation, although the likelihood of HIV trans-mission is increased if a source case patient has advancedAIDS and, presumably, an elevated HIV viral load. For HBV ,5 studies have attempted to measure the viral burden of theprovider associated with transmission of infection. In thesestudies, source case surgeons were found to have circulatingHBV DNA levels between and GE/mL. 496.4#10 5.0 #10 In a modeling study designed to assess the inoculum asso-ciated with the most common types of exposures, viral bur-dens equivalent to 10 4GE/mL or less were associated with exposures to fewer than 1 virion.100An analysis of the tech- nique used by one HBeAg-positive cardiovascular-thoracicsurgeon implicated as the source of a cluster of HBV infec-tions may shed some light on the risk for transmission as-sociated with very high viral burdens. 12,101In this study, when the surgeon repeatedly tied knots, snugging them against hisindex nger, shear injuries occurred through his gloves, andboth the saline irrigant used to rinse the inside of his glovesand the outer surface of the gloves tested positive for hepatitisB surface antigen (HBsAg). 12,101Despite evidence suggesting a decreased risk for contamination with blood and/or bodyfluids associated with the practice of double-gloving, 71this surgeon did not wear 2 pairs of gloves\u2014neither during clin-ical care nor for the experiments described above. Nonethe- less, because of the extremely high viral burden associatedwith HBeAg positivity (100 million to 10 billion HBV par- ticles per milliliter of blood), 102barriers may be relatively ineffective in preventing transmission, so the establishmentof some cutoff value makes implicit sense. A fth issue to consider is the magnitude of risk of trans- mission of bloodborne pathogens following various types ofexposures (summarized in Henderson 70). For HIV , this risk has been studied extensively. The average risk of transmissionassociated with percutaneous exposures to blood-contami- nated sharp objects that have been used on HIV-infected individuals is 0.32% (21 infections associated with 6,498 ex-posures; 95% condence interval, 0.18%-0.46%) (summa-rized in Henderson 70). The risk for transmission of HBV from an HBeAg-positive source subject is approximately 2 log10 higher; the likelihood of transmission of HCV from an HCV-infected source subject is intermediate, and is estimated tobe approximately 10-fold less than that for HBV (ie, ap- proximately 1%-2% per exposure). 65The estimated risk for transmission of HIV associated with mucocutaneous expo- sure is 0.03% (1 infection associated with 2,885 exposures), but this estimate is biased, because the single transmission occurred before prospective data were collected from the in- volved institution.103The risk of infection associated with intact skin exposure to blood from an HIV-infected individualis below detection in the few studies that have attempted to measure it. 104Data estimating these latter risks are not avail- able for either HBV or HCV , though one might reasonably assume that the risks might be higher for HCV and higheryet for HBV , given the numbers of cases infection detected for the hepatitis viruses, as well as the higher average cir- culating viral burdens in chronically infected individuals. Because the risks for provider-to-patient transmission of these 3 bloodborne pathogens are apparently quite different (albeit there is a small risk for each of the 3 viruses), SHEAdecided in the previous version of this guideline in 1997 to consider them individually. 10This updated version also fol- lows that approach. In 1991, the US Public Health Service published guidelines designed to prevent provider-to-patient transmission of HBV and HIV .105Since that document was published, we have gained substantial insight into the factors that contribute tothe risks for healthcare-associated transmission of these path-ogens; we have witnessed substantial progress in the man-agement of HBV , HCV , and HIV infection; we have seen the development of sensitive molecular tests designed to measurecirculating viral burdens for these infections; and we have implemented a variety of interventional strategies designedto reduce these risks. More than 20 infectious diseases have been transmitted by needlestick injuries. 106However, HBV , HCV , and most important diseases toconsider in provider-to-patient transmission. Other blood-guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 213 borne diseases remain of hypothetical concern only. For this reason, this guideline will focus only on HBV , HCV , and HIV . clinical progress since publication of the 1997 shea guideline HBV The previous version of this SHEA guideline10relied on the presence of HBeAg as a surrogate marker of infectivity anddid not consider direct measurement of the HBV DNA viralburden in making recommendations about practice restric-tions. One major advance since the publication of the pre-vious guideline is the recognition that presence of HBeAg isnot a sensitive marker for HBV infectivity. Indeed, severalinstances of provider-to-patient transmission of HBV haveinvolved providers who were infected with strains of HBVthat did not produce HBeAg (so-called \"pre-core\" mu-tants). 14,107The use of HBeAg as a surrogate marker for in- fectivity has been effectively replaced by molecular tests thatmeasure a patient's circulating viral burdens with precision.A third major advance is the availability of antiviral medi-cations and other approaches to treat HBV infection. Thepast decade has seen the development of treatment strategiesthat, for the rst time, offer some hope of reducing patients'viral burdens, and also of producing durable remissions, ifnot cures. The US Food and Drug Administration has ap-proved 7 antiviral agents (interferon- a, peg interferon, la- mivudine, telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir) forthe treatment in the United States;others (eg, emtricitabine and clevudine) are currently underevaluation. Of patients who received monotherapy with oneof the approved agents for 1 year, and 21%-67% developed undetectable HBV combination therapies is at too prelim- inary a stage to judge their efcacy; however, some studies have suggested that therapy with combinations of some ofthe newer nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (eg, to monotherapy for patients whohave HBeAg or high circulating levels of HBV DNA. 108Al- though the evidence base for the use of antiviral and/or im- munological therapy for hepatitis B is not yet fully adequate (ie, current therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection mostoften does not eradicate HBV and most studies demonstratelimited long-term efcacy), the role of therapy, the impacton the potential transmission risk, and the impact on practice restrictions have not yet been fully investigated. HCV As is the case with HBV , in the past decade we have gained more sophistication and precision in our ability to measurethe circulating viral burdens of patients infected with HCV .In addition, new antiviral agents and combinations of agentshave been employed with increasing success to treat individ-uals who have acute and chronic HCV infection. A NationalInstitutes of Health Consensus Development Conference and 2 academic professional societies have published congruenttreatment guidelines for individuals who are chronically in-fected with HCV . 109-112These guidelines emphasize that in- dividuals who have chronic hepatitis C infection who are 18years of age or older, have detectable HCV RNA in serum,and evidence of chronic hepatitis (either elevated serum al-anine aminotransferase levels or active hepatitis and/or -brosis) should be treated, assuming they are willing to par-ticipate in the therapy and that there are no contraindicationsto the use of the indicated antiviral agents. Also of importanceare the several published studies that suggest that acute HCVinfection can be treated with nearly 100% success. 113-116 Whether these recommendations might apply to HCV-in-fected practitioners who want to be able to perform exposure-prone invasive procedures (whether or not they have evidenceof chronic hepatitis) is not addressed in this guideline. HIV Substantial progress also has been made for HIV . T ests to monitor HIV RNA viral load are now routine, and highlyactive antiretroviral therapy has been routinely given for morethan a decade. None of the existing guidelines have incor-porated treatment of the infected practitioner into the de-cision about practice restriction for HIV-infected providerswho wish to continue performing exposure-prone invasiveprocedures. current published guidelines In the United States, in the aftermath of the national andinternational publicity surrounding the instances of iatro-genic HIV infection linked to the Florida dentist, 3-8the CDC issued guidelines for HIV-infected and HBV-infected provid-ers 105in July of 1991. From an implementation perspective, 3 aspects of these guidelines were problematic: (1) the needto classify a subset of invasive procedures as \"exposure-prone,\" (2) the requirement that an infected practitioner no-tify prospective patients of her or his infection status, and(3) the legal and administrative implementation strategiesconcerning the establishment and workings of the ExpertReview Panel, an administrative requirement of the guide-lines. Although we have witnessed substantial clinical progressand much has been written about these issues, these problemsremain largely unresolved 18 years after publication of theoriginal CDC guideline. 105 The anxiety associated with the publicity surrounding the Florida dentist case-cluster prompted Congressional scrutinyof the 1991 CDC guideline, 105and, ultimately, resulted in the US Congress passing Federal legislation (PL. 102-141) re-quiring states to certify that they have implemented the July1991 CDC guideline 105or \"equivalent\" guidelines. Interest- ingly, since the 1991 CDC guideline105was published, the United States has identied no additional instances of pro-vider-to-patient HIV transmission and only rare instances of214 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 either HCV or HBV transmission. The fact that only a small number of cases have been detected is attributable to a varietyof factors, including less aggressive case-nding by the CDCand other local and state public health ofcials (ie, no activeongoing surveillance), the use of primary strategies to pre-vent exposure, and the efcacy of highly active antiretroviraltherapy, which has lowered the viral burden in HIV-infect-ed \"source patients,\" has reduced the likelihood of hospital-ization, and has decreased the need for and the numbers ofinvasive procedures that place healthcare workers at risk forexposure. To date, the management of infected practitionerstherefore appears to have been effectively managed at theindividual, the institutional or at the state level. Although no new US Public Health Service guidelines re- garding infected providers have been published since 1991,guidelines have been published outside the United States, andseveral articles have been published that argue differing pointsof view about this complex issue. The issue remains contro-versial for several complicated reasons. First, at least in partbecause of the manner in which HIV infection rst presentedin society, American public opinion has consistently reflecteda \"zero-risk\" stance. Second, although most guidelines havefocused on practice restrictions for infected providers whoconduct exposure-prone procedures, a panel of experts con-vened by the CDC was unable to come to consensus aboutwhich invasive procedures are \"exposure-prone,\" at least inpart because of the substantial variability from provider toprovider. The United Kingdom guidelines detail their de-nition of \"exposure-prone\" procedures. 117Also, recently, a group convened at the University of Virginia created a tableof procedures, divided into 3 categories: (1) procedures withde minimis risk of viral transmission, (2) procedures forwhich viral transmission is theoretically possible but unlikely,and (3) procedures that are associated with a denite risk ofviral transmission or that are directly characterized as ex-posure prone procedures. 1We have included a similar table in this guideline (Table 2), modied slightly from the tablecreated by the University of Virginia group; the committeethat drafted this guideline also expressed the strong opinionthat some procedures listed under Category III might wellbe moved to Category II if the practitioner follows recom-mended work practice controls and uses appropriate safetydevices. Third, this topic offers a unique confluence for thedisciplines of epidemiology, medicine, ethics and law, andexperts in these disciplines express widely divergent viewsabout the optimal approach. Each of these issues deservesadditional discussion. Despite the fact that experts uniformly agree that infected providers who are not conducting invasive procedures presentvirtually no risk to their patients, as recently as 2005, a studyfound that 89% of respondents acknowledged that they wouldwant to know whether their doctor or dentist is infected withHIV; 82% agreed that disclosure of HBV or HCV infectionin a provider should be mandatory; and only 38% thoughtthat infected providers should be allowed to provide patientcare of any kind. 118Some have argued that by not completely restricting providers infected with bloodborne pathogens, thediscipline of medicine has betrayed its responsibility to pa-tients. 119Because public opinion is far from aligned with the existing science base, a major issue becomes \"What level ofrisk will society tolerate?\" ethical issues A useful perspective is to consider the accommodations so-ciety has made for medical or psychiatric conditions in thehealthcare worker, or a history of substance use, which alsocould put patients at risk. In certain cases, these conditionsmay necessitate restriction of the healthcare worker from cer-tain aspects of healthcare practice. Restriction is not viewedas justied, however, when these conditions are well treated and the healthcare provider is able to practice in a safe and competent way. Similarly, we feel that infection with a bloodborne pathogen does not itself justify restriction on the practice of an oth-erwise competent healthcare provider. As with providers whohave medical, psychiatric, or substance-use problems, health-care providers infected with bloodborne pathogens shouldseek ongoing care and treatment. SHEA recommends theadditional protection of restricting health care providers fromperforming Category III procedures if the healthcare provider is infected with a bloodborne pathogen and meets other cri- teria, as delineated in this document. The ethics of this issue are also complex. Healthcare pro- viders have an ethical, professional and duciary responsi-bility to act in the best interests of their patients. Healthcare providers have a duty to ensure patient safety. The fact that healthcare providers are bound by the principle of nonma-lecence, which requires them to do no harm to patients andto do what is possible to prevent harm, is widely accepted.Nonetheless, this simple formulation of the principle of non- malecence provides limited guidance, because many bene- cial interventions also present risks to patients. Consistentwith the principle of nonmalecence or \"do not harm,\"healthcare providers are expected to act in accordance withthe standards of their profession to prevent harm in the prac- tice of patient care. Accordingly, healthcare providers have an obligation to follow the accepted standards of practice toprevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens to pa-tients. These standards include knowledge about and diligentutilization of infection control procedures, as well as care- ful attention to individual factors that can be controlled to re- duce any risk of transmission. Over the last 2 decades, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of HIV , HCV , and HBV infec-tions. Sensitive tests to measure levels of circulating virus havebeen developed, as well as an impressive armamentarium ofinterventions to control the infections, including effective an-tiviral therapies for each disease. We know that when indi-viduals are treated so that their viral load becomes and re-guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 215 mains low or undetectable, the risk of transmission to others is greatly decreased. Technological and other advances inequipment and infection control procedures, as well as work-practice controls that have reduced the risk of occupationalinjuries to healthcare providers and, therefore, indirectly im-proved patient safety, have further reduced the risk of trans-mission in healthcare settings. The accumulated experience and data provide reassuring evidence that the magnitude of risk for provider-to-patienttransmission of HIV , HCV and HBV , although not zero, isexceedingly small. At the same time, the burdens of certainrestrictions that have been placed on healthcare providers outof concern for patient safety have been disproportionatelyhigh. Qualied and experienced healthcare providers have suffered from discrimination, loss of privacy, liability, and loss of their jobs and their livelihoods. These burdens, as- sociated with highly personal and stigmatizing diagnoses, seem unjustied in the face of an extremely low risk that canbe further reduced by reasonable accommodations in theworkplace and the diligence of healthcare providers andinstitutions. All healthcare providers should comply with institutional policies and procedures designed to protect patients. Health-care providers have an ethical responsibility to promote their own health and well being, and a responsibility to remove themselves from care situations if it is clear that there is asignicant risk to patients despite appropriate preventivemeasures. Infection with a bloodborne pathogen does not itself justify restriction on the practice of an otherwise competent health- care provider. Healthcare providers infected with bloodbornepathogens should seek ongoing care and treatment. Restric-tions may be justiably imposed when a healthcare providerhas a physical or mental impairment that affects his or her judgment and/or jeopardizes patient safety. Examples might include exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis; a history ofpoor infection-control technique or adherence to propertechnique; mental confusion; or a prior incident of trans-mitting a bloodborne pathogen to a patient. legal issues From the legal perspective, the courts have been relativelyunsupportive of infected healthcare providers. Although someauthorities have argued that proscriptive state regulations are responding \"to a problem that does not exist,\" 120many legal actions were led against infected healthcare providers and their institutions, based either on the CDC guidelines of July1991, 10professional societies' adoption of these guidelines, or both. In many, if not most of these actions, a practitionerwas sued, not for infecting patients, but rather for inflictingmental anguish, for causing \"pain and suffering,\" for assault,for the practitioner's failure to comply with the \"duty towarn\" the patient of risk, or for various other legal issues.Virtually all of these suits were led because of the possibilitythat patients may have been unnecessarily exposed to the risk for infection, not because the patients were infected with bloodborne pathogens. Outcomes for these cases have been highly variable, and have not, to our knowledge, established a denitive precedent. HBV Existing US guidelines, published in 1991 and not, to date, ever revised, 105recommend that \"healthcare providers who perform exposure-prone procedures and who do not have serologic evidence of immunity to HBV from vaccination orfrom previous infection should know their HBsAg status and, if that is positive, should also know their HBeAg status. If infected with HBV (and HBeAg positive) providers should not perform exposure-prone procedures unless they have sought counsel from an Expert Review Panel and been advised under what circumstances, if any, they may continue to per-form these procedures. Such circumstances would include notifying prospective patients of the healthcare worker's se-ropositivity before they undergo exposure-prone invasiveprocedures.\" 105 Several countries have issued modied guidelines for the management of HBV-infected providers based on the infectedprovider's circulating viral burdens. Unfortunately, the evi-dence base for these recommendations is minuscule, and theexisting recommendations are quite disparate. In the United Kingdom, HBV-infected providers who are HBeAg positive may not conduct exposure-prone invasive procedures; HBV-infected providers who are HBeAg negative but have HBV DNA levels of greater than 10 3GE/mL may not conduct exposure-prone invasive procedures; and HBV-infected providers who are HBeAg negative and have HBVDNA levels of less than 10 3GE/mL may conduct exposure- prone invasive procedures but must be retested at least every12 months to ensure that the level of viremia remains below10 3GE/mL.121More recently, authorities in the United King- dom have also recommended122that HBV-infected healthcare providers who are HBeAg negative and who have pretreat-ment HBV DNA levels of 10 3-105GE/mL could be allowed to perform exposure prone procedures if they are receivingsuppressive oral antiviral therapy and if their viral loads have decreased to below 10 3GE/mL. The major challenge asso- ciated with this latter recommendation is the development of an effective monitoring strategy to make certain that thecirculating viral burden remains less than 10 3GE/mL.122The availability of various testing systems further complicates monitoring. A European consortium was convened to create recom- mendations for HBV-infected providers and reached slightlydifferent conclusions. 123In their recommendations, HBV-in- fected providers who are HBeAg positive are instructed thatthey may not perform exposure-prone procedures. 123HBV- infected providers who are HBeAg negative but have HBVDNA levels of less than 10 4GE/mL may conduct exposure-216 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 prone invasive procedures but must be retested at least an- nually to make certain that the circulating viral burden re- mains below 104GE/mL.123These guidelines also emphasize that providers who are detected as having transmitted HBV should not perform exposure-prone procedures, and HBV- infected providers who have been treated and whose post-treatment DNA levels have fallen to less than 10 4GE/mL may conduct exposure-prone procedures but must be retested ev- ery 3 months to ensure that the viral burden remains below 104GE/mL.123 Scientists from the Netherlands published a third set of rec- ommendations suggesting that HBV-infected providers who have HBV DNA levels of less than 105GE/mL may conduct exposure-prone invasive procedures, but must be retested at least annually.124 In a thoughtful analysis, van der Eijk et al125listed the chal- lenges to standardizing recommendations for practice restric- tions for HBV-infected providers, emphasizing that guidelines have to strike a balance between excluding providers unnec- essarily and patient safety. More recently, the Viral HepatitisPrevention Board, a European consortium whose mission isto contribute to the control and prevention of viral hepatitis,convened a meeting of international experts from the public and private sectors to try to harmonize these recommenda- tions. 126This meeting identied a number of issues that the contributors felt needed to be addressed before development of standardized recommendations, and consensus could not be achieved.126Included in this list of issues are the following: (1) the variability of HBV DNA levels among chronicallyinfected individuals; (2) the paucity of data linking levels ofviremia to risk for transmission; (3) the variable reliability and reproducibility of the molecular tests used to measure HBV DNA, as well as the variability between the differing test systems; (4) the lack of standardization among the dif- ferent tests used to detect HBV DNA; and (5) the variabilityand durability of therapeutic antiviral effects and, specically,the length of time viremia can be effectively suppressed before\"escape\" mutant viruses emerge. HCV No US Public Health Service guidelines address the man- agement of providers infected with HCV , including the 1991 CDC recommendations. 105The UK guidelines109are quite pro- scriptive regarding hepatitis C, stating that HCV-infected pro-viders who have circulating HCV RNA may not conductexposure-prone invasive procedures. Further, trainees foundto have circulating HCV RNA should be restricted from start- ing training in exposure-prone invasive procedures. 127The UK guidelines also address treatment, noting that HCV-in-fected providers who have circulating HCV RNA who receiveantiviral treatment and become HCV RNA negative for aperiod of 6 months can be permitted to return to performingexposure-prone invasive procedures but must be retested in6 months to conrm the durability of the response. 109The European Consortium could not reach consensus about the management of HCV-infected providers, conclud-ing that \"on balance it is not recommended that exposure-prone procedures be forbidden for HCV-infected healthcareworkers.\" 123Similarly, the scientists from the Netherlands ad- dressed only HBV infection, and did not discuss HCV-in-fected providers. 124Furthermore, the ndings of the Viral Hepatitis Prevention Board with respect to HBV (eg, variableHBV DNA levels, paucity of data linking levels of viremia torisk for transmission, variable rates of reliability and repro-ducibility of molecular tests used to measure HBV DNA,variability and lack of standardization of the differing testsystems, variability and durability of therapeutic antiviral ef-fects, and length of time viremia can be effectively suppressedbefore \"escape\" mutant viruses emerge) also apply to indi-viduals chronically infected with HCV . HIV The UK guidelines 117recommend restriction of the practice of HIV-infected providers.105The US guidelines recommend that HIV-infected practitioners, \"not perform exposure-proneprocedures unless they have sought counsel from an ExpertReview Panel and been advised under what circumstances, ifany, they may continue to perform these procedures. Suchcircumstances would include notifying prospective patientsof the HCW's seropositivity before undergo exposure-prone invasive procedures.\" 105Neither guideline bases rec- ommendations on the clinical status of the infected provideror on the viral burden of the HIV-infected provider. current assessment SHEA emphasizes that, more than 20 years after the publi-cation of the \"Universal Precautions\" guidelines, 128blood and potentially fluid, fluid, pleural semen, vaginal secretion, and any blood-contaminated fluid) from any patient must be considered tohave the potential to transmit bloodborne pathogens, irre-spective of the patient's primary or secondary diagnosis. Al-though this principle was initially intended to apply to pa-tients, we nd it equally relevant to healthcare providers whomay be infected with HIV , HBV , HCV , another blood-borne for provider-to-pa-tient transmission of bloodborne pathogens may never beknown with precision; however, the additional experiencegained over the past 20 years provides reassuring evidencethat these risks are extremely small. In the previous version of this guideline, SHEA expressed the opinion that most of the issues applicable to HBV-infectedproviders would generally apply to providers who are infectedwith HIV and might also hold for providers infected withHCV . In this revised version, SHEA decided to deal with eachof the pathogens individually\u2014at least with respect to settingpolicies for infected providers. This decision was made for aguideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 217 table 4.

The classication scheme is that developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America,134which are adapted from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.135 variety of reasons. First, the \"average\" risk for transmission following a single parenteral exposure is at least 10-fold andprobably 100-fold higher for HBV than for HIV . The risk forHCV transmission appears to be intermediate between thosefor HIV and HBV . 65Second, chronic carriers of these 3 viral pathogens typically exhibit substantial differences in viral bur-den (ie, the number of intact virions per milliliter of blood);thus, circumstances that might involve a measurable risk fortransmission of HBV may not necessarily be associated witha measurable risk for transmission of HIV . Third, postex-posure management strategies, including treatment, haveevolved considerably, and treatment for each of these diseasessince the previous version of this guideline was published.Pre-exposure receipt of hepatitis B vaccine has led to a dra-matic decrease in the incidence of HBV infection in healthcarepersonnel. Further, postexposure prophylaxis for HBV infec-tion using hepatitis B immune globulin and/or hepatitis Bvaccine is both safe and highly effective. Although its efcacyhas not been proven in a clinical trial, postexposure pro-phylaxis for HIV infection using 2-drug or 3-drug combi-nations has likely contributed to the dramatic decrease inoccupationally acquired HIV infection in healthcare workersin the United States. The last such case documented by theCDC occurred in 1999. 70,129Unfortunately, neither pre-ex- posure nor postexposure prophylaxis exist for HCV . For these reasons, the version of this guideline will continue to consider each pathogen individually. The following rec-ommendations are based on the following information: (1)available scientic information about the magnitude of riskfor provider-to-patient transmission of the bloodborne path-ogens; (2) clinical hospital epidemiology and infection controlexperience and management of HBV , HCV and HIV relatedproblems in the healthcare setting since 1981; and (3) expe-rience with the implementation and interpretation of priorrecommendations and guidelines, including those issued pre-viously by the US Public Health Service. 102,130-133The recom- mendations are classied according to the scheme developedby the Infectious Diseases Society of America 134(Table 4). guideline recommendations background and rationale These recommendations are based on the thorough consid- eration of the risks for provider-to-patient transmission ofthese pathogens, from the information provided by (1) thepast 50 years' experience with these pathogens in the health-care setting; (2) the reported experience with HBV-infectedproviders and their patients 11-16,61-63,136(I. Williams, CDC, Per- sonal Communication), providers and theirpatients, 18-32,35,37,39,40,64and HIV-infected providers and their patients3-8,41-57; (3) studies of the frequency of various types of occupational exposures65,71-79,137,138; (4) studies of the mag- nitude of risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens fol-lowing various types of exposures 70,104,139,140; (5) the substantial progress biomedical science has made in accurately measuringviral burden as an indicator of disease activity, and, possibly,infectivity, for all 3 viral infections; (6) the availability of aneffective vaccine for HBV; (7) the development of effectivepostexposure management strategies, as well as therapy thatcan substantially suppress HIV and HBV infection and cansuppress and even cure HCV infection; (8) progress made inmodifying procedures and devices to create a safer healthcareenvironment; and (9) the resources required to develop aunique administrative approach for the management of pro-viders infected with these 3 bloodborne pathogens. The major changes in the risk calculus since the publication of our prior set of recommendations are, rst, that effectiveantiviral therapeutic interventions have been developed for218 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 all 3 pathogens, and, second, that a number of engineering and work-practice controls have been introduced into thehealthcare environment that have contributed substantiallyto decreasing the risk for occupational injuries to healthcareproviders and, therefore, indirectly, to improving patientsafety. i. practice issues 1. Should healthcare providers who are infected with HBVbe allowed to practice? If so, under what clinical,serological, or viral burden parameters? Recommendation All blood and potentially blood-containing fluids (ie, cerebro-spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, pleural fluid, synovialfluid, pericardial fluid, semen, vaginal secretion, and any blood-contaminated fluid) from patients and providers must be regardedas potentially infectious for HBV (A-III). All providers shouldfollow the tenets of Standard Precautions (A-III). Only the fol-lowing body fluids have been implicated in the transmission ofbloodborne viruses: blood, blood products, semen, cervical se-cretions, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, syn-ovial fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid. Transfers of bloodor other potentially infectious materials from providers to patientsmust be avoided (A-III). T ears, saliva, vomitus, sputum, urine andstool are not considered to be capable of transmitting bloodborneviruses unless contaminated with blood. Nonetheless, healthcareproviders should practice Standard Precautions and avoid contactwith these fluids, as they are potentially infectious for additionalpathogens (eg, saliva for herpes simplex virus, stool for hepatitis Avirus). HBV-infected healthcare providers should not be prohibited from participating in patient-care activities solely on the basis oftheir HBV infection (A-III). HBV-infected providers should notbe restricted from participating in Category I or Category II Pro-cedures (Table 2) (A-III). Providers infected with HBV who areeither HBeAg positive or who have circulating viral burdensgreater than or equal to 10 4GE/mL should refrain from per- forming Category III procedures (A-III). Healthcare providerswho have circulating HBV burdens of less than 10 4GE/mL should be allowed to perform those Category III activities identied asassociated with a risk for provider-to-patient transmission ofbloodborne pathogens, so long as the infected provider (1) is notdetected as having transmitted infection to patients; (2) obtainsadvice from an Expert Review Panel about continued practice;(3) undergoes follow-up routinely by Occupational Medicine staff(or an appropriate public health ofcial), who tests the providertwice per year to demonstrate the maintenance of a viral burdenof less than 10 4GE/mL; (4) also receives follow-up by a personal physician who has expertise in the management of HBV infectionand who is allowed by the provider to communicate with theExpert Review Panel about the provider's clinical status; (5) con-sults with an expert about optimal infection control procedures(and strictly adheres to the recommended procedures, includingthe routine use of double-gloving for Category II and Category III procedures and frequent glove changes during procedures,particularly if performing technical tasks known to compromiseglove integrity [eg, placing sternal wires]); and (6) agrees to theinformation in and signs a contract or letter from the ExpertReview Panel that characterizes her or his responsibilities (dis-cussed in more detail in Recommendation 8, below) (A-III). Discussion. We have chosen a cut-off of 104GE/mL to sep- arate providers who can and cannot perform Category IIIprocedures. This level was chosen in the absence of data thatdenitively associate a given level with either a clear risk fortransmission or, more importantly, an absence of risk. Asnoted above, one modeling experiment suggested that themost common types of exposure to a provider who had aviral burden of 10 4GE/mL would be associated with an ex- posure to less than 1 virion.100In addition to that modeling experiment, another important piece of evidence that sup-ports this threshold is the fact that, in all of the instances oftransmission from an HBeAg-negative provider to a patientin which the source provider's viral burden has been mea-sured, the implicated provider had a circulating viral burdenin excess of 10 4GE/mL,123except in one case,141and the validity of that one case has been questioned, because thesample was taken from the provider more than 3 monthsafter the transmission occurred. 124Setting the cutoff for the circulating HBV viral burden at 103GE/mL would have re- sulted in restricting the practices of 58% of the HBV-infectedproviders in the United Kingdom and nearly 95% of suchproviders in the Netherlands. 126 These guidelines suggest a cutoff of 104GE/mL and allow an individual who has a circulating viral load of less than 104 GE/mL to continue to conduct Category III procedures aslong as the individual (1) is not detected as having transmittedinfection to patients; (2) obtains advice from an Expert Re-view Panel about continued practice; (3) undergoes follow-up routinely by Occupational Medicine staff (or an appro-priate public health ofcial), who tests the provider twice peryear to demonstrate the maintenance of a viral burden of lessthan 10 4GE/mL; (4) also receives follow-up by a personal physician who has expertise in the management of HBV in-fection and who is allowed by the provider to communicatewith the Expert Review Panel about the provider's clinicalstatus; (5) consults with an infection control expert aboutoptimal infection control procedures (and strictly adheres tothe recommended procedures, including the routine use ofdouble-gloving for Category II and Category III procedures,use of puncture-resistant gloves, use of blunted surgicalneedles, 86,97-99use of \"hands-free\" technique,142and other work practice controls, among many others); and (6) agreesto the information in and signs a contract or letter from theExpert Review Panel that characterizes her or his responsi-bilities (discussed in more detail in Recommendation 8, be-low). If a provider is receiving treatment for this infection,the efcacy of the treatment should be considered in theguideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 219 context of the specic infection being treated. In general, because of their very high viral burdens, providers who haveacute HBV infection and those who have HBV infection inthe absence of immunological responses should not performCategory III procedures. Providers whose infections have re-solved and who have no evidence of circulating virus shouldnot be restricted in any way. Individuals relying on these guidelines must keep in mind that each such case must be evaluated on its own merit andthat the molecular testing strategies discussed in the docu-ment are subject to several limitations. These include (1) thefact that infected individuals' HBV DNA levels may vary overtime, (2) there are limited scientic data linking levels ofviremia to risk for transmission, (3) the fact that the differentcurrently marketed test for measuring HBV viral burden mayproduce variable results (4) the varying level of reproduci-bility of these molecular tests, (5) the fact that antiviral ther-apy may produce transient or limited responses (particularlywith respect to monotherapy for HBV), and (6) the varietyof virological and patient-related factors (eg, adherence to therecommended antiviral regimen) that may contribute to thedevelopment of \"escape\" mutants. SHEA underscores thatthese guidelines are, of necessity, malleable and modiableas more information becomes available. Antiviral therapy clearly reduces the circulating HBV viral burden to levels below acceptable cutoff values. 143Since, to date, therapies have been suppressive and not curative, thisapproach is associated with the clear possibility of antiviralagent-related toxicity, as well as the theoretical possibility offostering resistance among viruses from the infected provider.The effect of therapy should be considered carefully by theOccupational Medicine physician and the Expert ReviewPanel, as well as by the provider's personal physician whohas expertise in the management of HBV infection. 2. Should healthcare providers who are infected with HCV be allowed to practice? If so, under what clinical,serological or viral burden parameters? Recommendation HCV-infected providers should not be prohibited from partici-pating in patient-care activities solely on the basis of their HCVinfection (A-III). HCV-infected providers should not be restricted from partic- ipating in Category I or Category II Procedures (A-III); providersinfected with HCV who have circulating viral burdens of greaterthan or equal to 10 4GE/mL should refrain from performing Category III procedures (B-III). Healthcare providers who have circulating HCV burdens of less than 104GE/mL should be allowed to perform those Category III activities identied as associated with a risk for provider-to-patient transmission of bloodborne pathogens, so long as theinfected provider (1) is not detected as having transmitted in-fection to patients; (2) obtains advice from an Expert ReviewPanel about continued practice; (3) undergoes follow-up rou-tinely by Occupational Medicine staff (or an appropriate public health ofcial), who tests the provider twice per year to dem-onstrate the maintenance of a viral burden of less than 10 4GE/ mL; (4) also receives follow-up by a personal physician who hasexpertise in the management of HCV infection and who is allowedby the provider to communicate with the Expert Review Panelabout the provider's clinical status; (5) consults with an expertabout optimal infection control procedures (and strictly adheresto the recommended procedures, including the routine use ofdouble-gloving for Category II and Category III procedures andfrequent glove changes during procedures, particularly if per-forming technical tasks known to compromise glove integrity [eg,placing sternal wires]); and (6) agrees to the information in andsigns a contract or letter from the Expert Review Panel that char-acterizes her or his responsibilities (discussed in more detail inRecommendation 8, below) (B-III). Discussion. These guidelines recommend that HCV-in- fected healthcare providers who have circulating viral burdensof less than 10 4GE/mL not be restricted from any aspect of health care so long as the infected provider follows the detailof the recommendation. Specically, the provider must bewilling to consult with, and follow the recommendations of,an infection control expert. The infected provider muststrictly adhere to the recommended procedures (eg, routineuse of double-gloving for Category II and III procedures,frequent glove changes during procedures, particularly if per-forming technical tasks known to compromise glove integrity[eg, placing sternal wires], use of puncture-resistant gloves,blunted surgical needles, 86,97-99\"hands-free\" technique142,144 and other work practice controls, among many others). Fi-nally, the infected provider must agree to the information in,and sign, a contract or letter from the Expert Review Panelthat characterizes her or his responsibilities. One might haveeasily argued for no restrictions whatsoever for HCV-infectedproviders, on the basis of the experience in the United Statesalone. The selection of a practice-restriction-threshold of 10 4GE/ mL is arbitrary, but, as noted above (in the section LegalIssues), some European guidelines have taken a far morerestrictive tack. Because there have been virtually no suchcases in the United States, we have, nonetheless, chosen aconservative cutoff for restricting practitioners. We have rec-ommended practice restrictions for providers who performCategory III procedures whose viral burdens are 10 4GE/mL or greater. We have based this decision on the in vitro HBVdata cited above (in the section Pathogenesis and Transmis-sion Risk), as well as the clinical experience with patient-to-provider transmission of HCV in the United Kingdom. Inaddition, we note that therapy for HCV is becoming increas-ingly effective, so that many providers who are identied asinfected with HCV can have their infections eradicated. Stud-ies of the efcacy of the treatment of acute HCV infectionoften demonstrate cure rates in excess of 95%, with studiesof the treatment of chronically infected individuals demon-220 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 strating cure rates of up to 70% or 80%, particularly for individuals infected with a treatment-favorable genotype.145-147 Individuals relying on these guidelines must keep in mind that each such case must be evaluated on its own merit andthat the molecular testing strategies discussed in the docu-ment are subject to several limitations. These include (1) thefact that infected individuals' HCV RNA levels may vary overtime, (2) the paucity of scientic data linking levels of viremiato risk for transmission, (3) the fact that the different cur-rently marketed test for measuring HCV viral burden mayproduce variable results, (4) the varying level of reproduci-bility of these molecular tests, (5) the fact that antiviral ther-apy may produce transient or limited responses, and (6) thevariety of virological and patient-related factors (eg, adher-ence to the recommended antiviral regimen) that may con-tribute to the development of \"escape\" mutants. SHEA un-derscores that these guidelines are, of necessity, malleable andmodiable as more information becomes available. 3. Should healthcare providers who are infected with HIV be allowed to practice? If so, under what clinical,serological or viral burden parameters? Recommendation HIV-infected healthcare providers should not be prohibited fromparticipating in patient-care activities solely on the basis of theirHIV infection (A-III). HIV-infected providers should not be re-stricted from participating in Category I or Category II proce-dures; providers infected with HIV who have circulating viralburdens equal to or in excess of GE/mL should refrain 25#10 from performing Category III procedures (A-III). Healthcare pro-viders who have circulating HIV burdens of less than 25#10 GE/mL should be allowed to perform those Category III activitiesidentied as associated with a risk for provider-to-patient trans-mission of bloodborne pathogens, so long as the infected provider(1) is not detected as having transmitted infection to patients;(2) obtains advice from an Expert Review Panel about continuedpractice; (3) undergoes follow-up routinely by Occupational Medicine staff, who test the provider twice per year to demon- strate the maintenance of a viral burden of less than GE/ 25#10 mL; (4) also receives follow-up by a personal physician who hasexpertise in the management of HIV infection and who is allowedby the provider to communicate with the Expert Review Panelabout the provider's clinical status; (5) consults with an expertabout optimal infection control procedures (and strictly adheresto the recommended procedures, including the routine use ofdouble-gloving for Category II and Category III procedures andfrequent glove changes during procedures, particularly if per-forming technical tasks known to compromise glove integrity [eg,placing sternal wires]); and (6) agrees to the information in andsigns a contract or letter from the Expert Review Panel that char-acterizes her or his responsibilities (discussed in more detail inRecommendation 8, below) (B-III). Discussion. These guidelines recommend that HIV-infectedhealthcare providers who have circulating viral burdens of less than GE/mL not be restricted from any aspect25#10 of health care, so long as the infected provider follows thedetail of the recommendation. Specically, the provider mustbe willing to consult with, and follow the recommendationsof, an infection control expert. The infected provider muststrictly adhere to the recommended procedures, (eg, routineuse of double-gloving for Category II and III procedures;frequent glove changes during procedures, particularly ifperforming technical tasks known to compromise glove in-tegrity [eg, placing sternal wires]; 86,97-99and \"hands-free\" tech- nique,142,144and other work practice controls, among many others). Finally, the infected provider must agree to the in-formation in, and sign, a contract or letter from the ExpertReview Panel that characterizes her or his responsibilities. As is the case for our recommendations for HBV-infected practitioners and HCV-infected practitioners, we acknowl-edge that the selection of a practice-restriction-threshold of GE/mL is arbitrary; however, as noted above (in the 25#10 section on Legal Issues), European guidelines have taken afar more restrictive tack. Because no provider-to-patienttransmissions of HIV infection have been detected in theUnited States since the initial cases involving the Florida den-tist (discussed in more detail in the sections Epidemiologyand Current Published Guidelines, above), we have chosento recommend permitting an HIV-infected practitioner toconduct Category III procedures if his or her viral burden issuppressed below GE/mL. We chose GE/mL 225#10 5 #10 as the threshold, in part, because individuals who typicallyhave their viral burdens suppressed to the \"undetectable\"range (generally !50 copies/mL) occasionally have levels that spike to GE/mL, despite ongoing effective antiret-25#10 roviral therapy. We have recommended practice restrictionsfor a provider who performs Category III procedures and hasa viral burden of GE/mL or greater. Because this 25#10 recommendation represents a substantial departure from oth-er similar guidelines, we have recommended a relatively lowthreshold for restriction. Since data do not exist to provideevidence for the most appropriate threshold, this lower thresh-old was selected solely on the basis of opinions of the committeethat drafted this guideline. This threshold should be revisitedon a regular basis and modied on the basis of additionalaccumulating experience. Our committee also noted that highlyactive antiretroviral therapy is continuing to improve to thepoint that most HIV-infected providers can have their infec-tions suppressed to this level or below. SHEA underscores thatthese guidelines are, of necessity, malleable and can be modiedas more information becomes available. Individuals relying on these guidelines must keep in mind that each such case must be evaluated on its own merit andthat the molecular testing strategies discussed in the docu-ment are subject to several limitations. These include (1) thefact that infected individuals' circulating HIV levels may varyover time, (2) the paucity of scientic data linking levels ofguideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 221 viremia to risk for transmission, (3) the fact that the different currently marketed test for measuring viral burden may pro-duce variable results, (4) the current variability in the levelof reproducibility of these molecular tests, (5) the fact thatantiviral therapy may produce transient or limited responses,and (6) the variety of virological and patient-related factors(eg, adherence to the recommended antiviral regimen) thatmay contribute to the development of \"escape\" mutants. Ingeneral, because of their very high viral burdens, providerswho are experiencing the HIV seroconversion illness shouldnot perform Category III procedures. 4. For providers who are infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV and who have circulating viral burdens greater thanthe recommended cutoff values, which procedures shouldthey be precluded from performing? Recommendation HBV , HCV , and HIV infected providers should not be restrictedfrom participating in Category I or Category II Procedures solelyon the basis of their bloodborne pathogen infection (A-III). HBV-infected providers who are either HBeAg positive or who havecirculating HBV burdens greater than or equal to 10 4GE/mL should refrain from conducting procedures listed in Category III(A-III). HCV-infected providers who have circulating viral bur-dens greater than or equal to 10 4GE/mL should refrain from conducting procedures listed in Category III (B-III). HIV-infectedproviders who have circulating viral burdens greater than or equalto GE/mL should refrain from conducting procedures 25#10 listed in Category III (A-III). Discussion. Historically, the concept of \"exposure-prone\" procedures has been a point of controversy, though severalmore recent guidelines and manuscripts have suggested that\"exposure-prone\" procedures can be dened. 1,109,117,121In the previous version of this guideline, SHEA suggested that \"ex-posure-prone\" procedures might be dened as those that havebeen \"epidemiologically implicated\" in patient-to-providertransmission. This approach has proved forexample, one recent case-cluster of provider-to-patient trans-mission of HBV suggested that the implantation of electro-encephalography electrodes was implicated in the transmis-sion of HBV . 16No guideline would include implantation of electroencephalography electrodes as an \"exposure-prone\"procedure. Some authorities have suggested that providers,rather than procedures, might be exposure-prone, suggestingthat technical expertise and experience may play a more sub-stantive role in the risk for provider-to-patient exposure,rather than the procedures themselves. We favor a modi-cation of the approach taken by Reitsma et al 1; namely, 3 tiers of procedural risk (Table 2). Most guidelines do notconsider the impact of the introduction of safer devices andsafer work practice controls to the risk calculus for infectionswith these 3 pathogens. As noted above in the section Path-ogenesis and Transmission Risk, the use of reinforced gloves, 91,92double gloves, glove-liners, or other devices or materials to protect the provider's hands,89,91,93-96and use of blunted suture needles,86,97-99as well as a variety of other safer devices and work practices, have been shown to decrease therisks for percutaneous injuries. The members of the com-mittee drafting this guideline emphasized that the consistentuse of safety devices by a practitioner should be one factorconsidered by the Expert Review Panel when deciding aboutpractice restrictions. Some members of the committee feltthat consistent use of these procedures and techniques mightmove some procedures from Category III to Category II forindividual practitioners. 5. If restricted from performing certain types of procedures, should providers who are infected with HBV ,HCV , and/or HIV be restricted on the basis of (A) clinicalstatus, (B) laboratory parameters of disease activity and/orprogression (and, if so, at what specic \"set-points\" foreach infection), and/or (C) clinical performance (eg,technical skill or lack of adherence to important infectioncontrol procedures); and if so, who measures and whodecides, and what are the criteria for restriction? Recommendation Healthcare practice restrictions should be based on several factors,including (1) evidence of transmission of infection to patients;(2) advice from the Expert Review Panel about continued practice,(3) advice from the Occupational Medicine specialist who is fol-lowing up the provider, (4) advice from the provider's physicianwho has expertise in the bloodborne pathogen infection, (5) viralburden measurements of greater than or equal to 10 4GE/mL (for HBV or HCV infection) or greater than or equal to GE/25#10 mL (for HIV infection), (6) lack of adherence to recommendedinfection control procedures, and (7) inability to safely providepatient care (eg, development of another contagious disease suchas tuberculosis or development of a bloodborne pathogen-as-sociated disorder, such as HIV-associated neurological disease)(A-III). Discussion. SHEA recommends that restrictions should be based on various combinations of these data. Anyone clearlyimplicated in the transmission of one of these organismsshould become the subject of scrutiny. The factors listedabove (ie, clinical status, laboratory parameters, and clinicalperformance) all contribute to the assessment of the indi-vidual's ability to practice safely. This ongoing assessment isone of the important roles that should be assumed by theExpert Review Panel (discussed in detail in Recommendation8, below). The expert review panel and the occupational med-icine physician should also consider the possibility of nar-cotics diversion in the transmission of these infections. Pro-viders identied as acutely infected with any of these path-ogens should be carefully evaluated for viral burdens and222 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 should engage the expert review panel through their occu- pational medicine and/or public health practitioners. 6. Should students, residents, fellows, and other trainees who are infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV bediscouraged from entering certain specialties and/orsubspecialities? How and by whom should these decisionsbe made? Recommendation Healthcare institutions should make certain that students andtrainees are fully educated about the risks associated with testingof themselves for, and management of patients with, bloodbornepathogen infections (A-III). All providers who are at risk foroccupational exposure to blood should be immunized with thehepatitis B vaccine, unless it is contraindicated (A-I). All health-care providers should know their serological status with respectto antibody to HBsAg, which should be measured 1-6 monthsafter the completion of their HBV immunization series (A-III).Institutions should assist students and trainees who are deter-mined to be infected with bloodborne pathogens in identifyingand selecting career choices that will be the least influenced bytheir infection(s) (A-III). Healthcare institutions should maintainthe privacy and medical condentiality of students and traineesidentied as infected with bloodborne pathogens (A-III). HBV-infected students and trainees who are either HBeAg positive orwho have circulating HBV burdens greater than or equal to 10 4 GE/mL should refrain from training in or conducting procedureslisted in Category III (A-III); HCV-infected students and traineeswho have circulating viral burdens in excess of 10 4GE/mL should refrain from training in or conducting procedures listed in Cat-egory III (B-III); HIV-infected students and trainees who havecirculating viral burdens greater than or equal to GE/mL 25#10 should refrain from conducting procedures listed in Category III(B-III). Students and trainees who are not receiving optimal ther-apy for their bloodborne pathogen infection(s) should seek suchtreatment (A-I). Discussion. A special problem arises when a training insti- tution becomes aware that a trainee is chronically infectedwith a bloodborne pathogen. Each of these instances shouldbe handled on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with theinstitution's legal counsel, the house staff training director,infection control professionals, the Dean of the school, andothers who are involved stakeholders. To date, these caseshave been handled unevenly across the United States, withsome institutions focusing on the disability-law aspects andothers focusing on liability. 90The law concerning these issues is changing rapidly and is relatively untested in the highercourts. The institution, however, does have responsibility tomake certain that the trainee is fully informed about therisks\u2014both to the trainee and to his or her patients\u2014asso-ciated with clinical practice. The institution should under-score the importance of appropriate treatment and the im- portance of adherance to infection control recommendations.The institution should assist the trainee in selecting a career path best suited to her or his specic situation and shouldprovide reasonable accommodation to students and trainees who have disabling conditions. By adopting the modication of the position initially proffered by Reitsma et al 1(ie, the 3- tiered risk schema), SHEA advocates encouraging traineeswho are infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV and whoseinfection(s) cannot be effectively cleared or whose infections cannot be suppressed below the thresholds identied in Rec-ommendations 1, 2, and 3 (above), to select career paths thatdo not involve the highest-risk procedures. In instances in which the decision is made to continue training, SHEA ad- vocates having the student be closely supervised by an at- tending provider who is aware of the student's status when the student is learning or performing Category II procedures. 7. Should providers infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV be subject to specic monitoring programs, and, if so,how and by whom and to whom should the data bereported? Recommendation Providers infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV who performCategory III procedures should have their circulating viral bur- dens measured at least every 6 months by an engaged occupational medicine practitioner and should undergo periodic evaluations (at a minimum, twice per year) by a physician selected by the provider who has demonstrated expertise in the management ofthe provider's infection. Results of the viral burden tests should be reviewed by the Occupational Medicine physician, should be reviewed with the provider's personal physician, and should be evaluated by the provider's Expert Review Panel (A-III). Discussion. Because the guidelines recommend viral burden cutoffs for practice restrictions, SHEA believes that an on-going monitoring program is essential. Most molecular assayresults are reproducible only within about half an order of magnitude. A fraction of infected individuals have fluctuating viral burdens. SHEA recommends a major role for the Oc-cupational Medicine practitioner in supervising the moni-toring program. This role would include, but not be limitedto, measuring the provider's circulating viral burden at least twice annually and providing advice to the Expert ReviewPanel about the provider's progress and ongoing clinical status. For independent practitioners working only from anofce, these functions should be fullled by the city, countyor state health department (consonant with state and locallaws). Elements of follow-up are summarized in Table 5.guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 223 table 5. Functions of the Expert Review Panel 1. Evaluation of the infected provider's clinical status 2. Assessment of the provider's viral burden data3. Assessment of the provider's experience and expertise4. Assessment of the procedures performed by the provider and the specic techniques used to perform these procedures 5. Determination of the extent to which the provider adheres to accepted infection control precautions 6. Provision of recommendations about the use of specic barri- ers, work practice controls, and infection prevention strategiesfor the conduct of specic procedures and assess the provider'swillingness to adhere to these recommendations 7. Provision of counseling to the provider about her or his ethical obligation to report a patient exposure, should one occur, andabout the appropriate procedures to follow, should an exposureoccur 8. Develop and execute a contract between the infected provider and the Expert Review Panel and/or institution (see Table 5) 9. In instances in which transmission is suspected, consider the potential for narcotics diversion 10. Notify Risk Management should a breach in procedure or a patient exposure occur 11. Notication of the appropriate licensure board for breaches of the signed contract with the Expert Review Panel (if requiredby state regulations) note. In instances in which an infected provider is not institutionally based, this responsibility should fall to the local or state health department(consonant with existing state laws). 8. Prior recommendations have suggested the creation of an Expert Review Panel for assisting institutions inmanaging providers infected with bloodborne pathogens.Is there a role for such a panel in 2009 and beyond? If so,what is that role, and at what level should the committeebe convened (eg, at the institutional, city, or state level),who should comprise such a committee, what should bethe committee's charge, and how and by whom shouldthe committee be managed? Do committee membersaccept liability for participation? Recommendation Healthcare providers infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV shouldhave their clinical status and laboratory data reviewed by anExpert Review Panel (A-III). Such a panel could exist at a state,regional, county, city, or institutional level, consonant with theindividual provider's circumstance and with state and local laws.The review panel should include, but not necessarily be limitedto, individuals who have expertise in the infected provider's spe-cialty or subspecialty, Healthcare Epidemiology, Infectious Dis-eases or Hepatology (specically with expertise in the bloodbornepathogen[s] being discussed), Occupational and/orhospital administration; the infected provider's physician; a publichealth ofcial (in states in which this issue is managed at the statelevel); a human resources professional; and, perhaps, an individ-ual with legal and/or ethics expertise. The review panel will advisethe healthcare provider, the Occupational Medicine physician, and/or the patient's primary physician about the provider's prac-tice and about the advisability of her or his performing CategoryIII procedures, as well as about the use of infection control in-terventions (A-III). The panel will create a contract or letter de-tailing the provider's responsibilities and those of the panel (Fig-ure 1). Before the provider returns to practice, this documentmust be agreed to and signed by the provider and the panel chair(A-III). The panel should reconsider the provider's performancein the event any of the following occurs: the provider's viral loadincreases to above the recommended level for consideration ofrestrictions from performing Category III procedures; the pro-vider develops another contagious disease (eg, tuberculosis); theprovider develops another condition that might adversely effectpatient safety (eg, HIV-associated neurological impairment or he-patic encephalopathy); the provider fails to strictly adhere to rec-ommended infection control practices; a patient is exposed to apotentially contaminated body fluid of the provider; and/or ifthere is evidence of provider-to-patient transmission (A-III). Theentity chartering the panel should indemnify the panel membersagainst any legal risks and/or costs (A-III). Discussion. SHEA believes that the creation of an Expert Review Panel to assist in the management of these providersis an important aspect of a patient safety program. Such aprogram could exist at a state, county, city or institutionallevel. We believe that the fact that no such cases have receivedpublicity in the United States since the early part of thisdecade is an indirect reflection of the efcacy of this approach.The basic functions of the Expert Review Panel are describedin Table 5. The panel, at a minimum, should include rep-resentation from Hospital Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases,the provider's specialty or subspecialty, Occupational Medi-cine (ie, the individual involved in monitoring the provider),hospital administration, and, perhaps, legal representation.Each case will be slightly different from the next, and eachshould be considered independently in context. These subtledifferences underscore the importance of the Expert ReviewPanel. The panel should develop a formal letter or contractdelineating its specic recommendations regarding the pro-vider's performance, training in infection control, conduct ofspecic procedures, follow-up, and management, amongother issues (Figure 1). Table 6 provides a list of issues forthe infection control professional and the Expert ReviewPanel to consider when providing advice to infected providersregarding the performance of various procedures. Table 7provides detail concerning the elements of this letter or con-tract. The requirement for a twice-annual meeting of thepanel may be met by a condential conference call or secureelectronic communication. The Occupational Medicine phy-sician, the infection control professional, and/or the state ep-idemiologist can serve as gatekeepers for the twice-annualreview. So long as the contract is being fullled and no guide-line violations are identied, additional face-to-face meetingsgure 1. Sample contract letter between an Expert Review Panel and a healthcare provider infected with a bloodborne pathogen. The letter delineates the specic recommendations of the panel and the responsibilities of the panel and of the infected provider. Table 7 providesmore detail on the elements of such a letter or contract.guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 225 table 6. Issues for the Hospital Epidemiologist and the Expert Review Panel to Consider When Pro- viding Advice to Infected Healthcare Providers Regarding the Performance of Various Procedures 1. The precise procedures for which permission is sought, the historical risks for provider-to-patient bloodborne pathogen transmission associated with these procedures, the provider's experience withsuch procedures, and the likelihood of patient exposure to provider blood during these procedures 2. Gather evidence of the infected provider's skills, practices, and adherence to the institutional infec- tion control plan (particularly with respect to standard precautions) 3. Investigate and discuss with the provider the availability of safer devices that will reduce the risk for patient exposures (eg, spring-loaded retractable needles, guards that shield dangerous tips, andblunted surgical needles) 4. Investigate and discuss the availability of barriers that will reduce the risks for exposures (eg, rein- forced gloves, 91,92double gloves, gloves constructed of monolament polymers or other materials re- sistant to tears, glove-liners, and other devices or materials to protect the provider's hands89,91,93-96) 5. Discuss work process controls, such as the \"hands free\" technique in the operating room142 6. Emphasize the need and ethical obligation to notify the hospital epidemiologist, immediate supervi- sor, or other individual, as detailed (or identied) in the contract, should a breach and/or patientexposure occur 7. Emphasize a detailed description of the process to be used in the event of breach of infection con- trol procedures or a patient exposure of the Expert Review Panel may not be needed. In instances in which guideline violations are identied or in instances inwhich the provider's clinical status has changed signicantly,the entire review panel should meet to consider the newinformation. The committee emphasizes that the Expert Re-view Panel should not advise the practitioner about his orher health and treatment options; this responsibility falls tothe provider's personal physician. ii. disclosure issues 9. Are there any medical settings in which a healthcareprovider infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV should beroutinely required to notify patients of his or herbloodborne pathogen status; and, if so, what are thespecic types of circumstances requiring notication? Recommendation Providers infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV who are adheringto the guidelines above should not be required to disclose theirinfection status to any patient (unless the provider has been thesource for an exposure for a patient, as discussed in Recommen-dation 11A, below) (A-III). Discussion. Societal views of patients' rights are strong, and most patients feel that they have a right to know if theirphysician or other healthcare provider is infected with a po-tentially transmissible bloodborne pathogen (irrespective ofthe magnitude of risk). 118,148,149A national survey conducted in 2004 demonstrates little change in public views of thisissue. 118Case law has generally concluded that informed con- sent includes disclosure of risks that may be perceived bypatients as being important even if, by rational consideration,they are negligible. These positions aside, in both previousversions of this guideline, we concluded that a requirementfor such disclosure would very likely require a provider toabandon or substantially modify his or her practice\u2014an un-warranted outcome in light of our current understanding of the risks for provider-to-patient transmission of these blood-borne pathogens. The existing 1991 US Public Health Serviceguidelines 105require that patients who are to have \"exposure- prone invasive procedures\" performed by HIV-positive orHBeAg-positive, HBV-infected practitioners be notied of thepractitioner's infection status prior to the procedure. On thebasis of the substantial changes in the risk prole since theprevious version of this guideline was published (eg, newsafety devices, new infection control strategies, better tech-niques for monitoring diseases, effective postexposure man-agement, and effective therapy), SHEA feels even morestrongly that such a position is unwarranted. If practitionersadhere to the components of this guideline with respect tomodifying their practices when an increased level of risk ispresent, in the absence of an adverse patient exposure toblood or blood-containing body fluids (discussed in Rec-ommendation 11, below), the risk for provider-to-patienttransmission is so small that it cannot be accurately mea-sured. SHEA's position on these issues remains essentiallyunchanged. An earlier iteration of the American HospitalAssociation Patients' Bill of Rights argues for disclosure ofrelevant information to patients, 150,151although this \"Bill of Rights\" has subsequently been replaced by a plain-languagedocument that does not directly address this issue. The Amer-ican Medical Association Council on Judicial Affairs also in-cludes a general statement in favor of patient disclosure. 152 10. Are there circumstances for which an infectedhealthcare provider should be required to obtain informedconsent that includes disclosure of the provider'sserostatus from a patient prior to a procedure? Recommendation Providers infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV who are adheringto the guidelines above should be required to obtain informedconsent for a procedure but should not be required to disclose226 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 table 7. Elements of the Contract between an Infected Healthcare Provider and the Expert Review Panel Responsibilities of the healthcare provider 1. Agrees to twice yearly follow-up by Occupational Medicine, including measurement of viral burden using tests specied by the panel 2. Agrees to twice yearly evaluations by a private physician who has expertise in the provider's specic blood- borne pathogen infection and agrees to have this physician discuss the results of these evaluations with theprovider's Expert Review Panel 3. Agrees to formal training in infection control via a course identied by the infection control expert, or, alter- natively agrees to counseling by the infection control professional concerning the use of appropriate infectioncontrol procedures, safety devices and work practice controls 4. Agrees to follow the recommended procedures and practices identied in the previous item (responsibility 3)5. Agrees to notify the occupational medicine or the public health authority participating in the panel regarding any change in provider status that may increase risk to the patient (eg, new neurological ndings, developmentof another contagious disease [eg, tuberculosis]) 6. Acknowledges the ethical obligation to do so, and agrees to report instances immediately in which a patient exposure may have occurred to the hospital epidemiologist or to appropriate institutional/public health author-ities identied in the contract, so that the potentially exposed patient may receive appropriate postexposuremanagement and counseling 7. If receiving treatment, agrees to continue treatment as prescribed and agrees to notify occupational medicine if the treatment regimen is modied for any reason 8. Agrees to re-evaluation by expert panel and revision of contract should clinical status or viral burden change Responsibilities of the institution and/or public health authorities 1. Agrees to convene Expert Review Panel at least twice annually (see text) to assess provider's clinical and viro- logic status as well as the provider's ongoing performance and her or his ability to continue to perform re-quested procedures 2. Agrees to maintain provider's medical privacy and condentiality3. Agrees to develop and follow institutional or provider-based follow-up procedure for potential patient expo- sure that makes every effort to ensure practitioner condentiality 4. Panel participants should have no liability5. Develops process for notifying hospital Risk Management note. Some aspects of this contract may be mandated by state laws, so the contract should carefully consider the legal requirements for the state in which the contract is being issued. A sample contract letter is shown in Figure 1. their serostatus as part of the process of informed consent from patients on whom they are about to perform a procedure (A-III). Discussion. If a practitioner adheres to the guidelines out- lined in detail above, SHEA concludes that the risk for trans-mission would be so small that informed consent about therisk of transmission would not be required. In special cir-cumstances associated with a known or anticipated increasedlevel of risk (eg, a provider who has previously transmittedinfection to a patient or a provider who has a viral burdenin excess of those listed in these guidelines is performing aCategory III procedure), obtaining informed consent is ra-tional, prudent, and advised. iii. exposure management 11. How should a provider-to-patient blood exposure orother hazardous body fluid exposure HCV , and/or HCV be managed? 11A. Should a provider who is the source of a patient exposure be required to undergo testing for bloodbornepathogen infection? Recommendation A provider who is aware that he or she is the source of a signicantpatient exposure to his or her blood or hazardous body fluidshould undergo testing for infection with bloodborne pathogens,even if not known to be infected with HBV , HCV , and/or HIV (A-III). Healthcare institutions should develop specic policies todeal with such exposures and should establish sanctions for pro-viders who refuse testing for bloodborne pathogens in these cir-cumstances (A-III). Such policies should be formally drawn andapproved by institutional attorneys and governing boards (A-III). Recommendation In the event of possible or documented patient exposure to bloodor potentially hazardous body fluids from an infected provider,the involved provider is ethically obligated to notify immediatelyeither the Occupational Medicine physician who is conductingfollow-up for the provider or the chair of the provider's ExpertReview Panel (A-III). Whoever is notied should immediatelyengage the infection control team, the hospital administration,and institutional risk management team to ensure there is ap-propriate follow-up and medical management for the potentiallyexposed patient (A-III). In the event of possible or documentedpatient exposure to blood or potentially hazardous body fluidsfrom an infected provider who is not institutionally based, theprovider is ethically bound to contact the ofcial in the publichealth establishment who is providing Expert Review Panel over-sight (A-III). This individual, in turn, should immediately ensurethat there is appropriate follow-up and medical management forthe potentially exposed patient (A-III). Discussion. State laws and State policies and procedures vary substantially with respect to testing for bloodborne path-guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 227 ogens. Healthcare institutions electing to develop policies that compel testing of the source individual should make certainthat such polices are legal in their jurisdictions and shouldapply such policies only to exposures for which scienticprecedent establishes that HBV , HCV , or HIV transmissioncould occur. 11B. Should an inadvertently exposed patient be notied of the exposure? Recommendation A patient who has been exposed (ie, by way of percutaneous,mucous membrane, or nonintact-skin exposure) to the blood orpotentially contaminated body fluid of any provider should benotied of the exposure promptly and given clear options forfollow-up testing and management (A-III). An exposed patient(1) should be notied about the exposure promptly; (2) shouldsubsequently be notied of the outcome of the source provider'sHBV , HCV , and HIV test results; (3) should receive expert coun-seling regarding the implications of the event; and (4) should beoffered effective postexposure treatment appropriate for the ex-posure in instances in which an exposure to a bloodborne path-ogen is documented (consistent with current CDC guide-lines 153,154) (A-III). Institutions should establish policies requiring self-reporting to the infection control program or occupationalhealth program and to the exposed patient's primary physicianof provider-to-patient blood or hazardous body fluid exposure(A-III). The exposed patient should not be notied of the sourceprovider's name or of the exact circumstances of the exposurebut should be provided with enough information to understandthe implications of the exposure fully (A-III). Discussion. For a variety of reasons, in instances in which a provider-to-patient blood exposure occurs, the patient hasa right to know that the exposure has occurred, irrespectiveof whether the provider is known to be infected with a blood-borne pathogen. The patient must be notied about the ex-posure and presented with options for postexposure treat-ment (as appropriate), as well as appropriate follow-up. 153,154 In addition, the patient must receive counseling about therisk for transmission and the strategies that are effective inpreventing subsequent transmission of the bloodborne path-ogen to which the patient was exposed. Since any exposureto blood may place patients at risk for acquiring a bloodborneinfection, patients should always be notied of such occur-rences. The identity of the source (ie, the infected provider)should not be disclosed. Needlestick transmissions (as nonintact-skin transmissions) ofHBV , HCV , and HIV infection have all been amply docu-mented. Since negative serologic test results do not completelyeliminate the possibility of transmission of bloodborne path-ogens, any blood exposure creates a requirement for noti-cation of the exposed patient. Notication also allows theexposed patient to have the option of receiving recommendedpostexposure management (eg, appropriate chemoprophy-laxis or immunoprophylaxis). Institutions should designatea responsible person for informing an exposed patient and ensuring patient follow-up. Ultimate responsibility for fol-low-up should be assigned to the patient's physician, even ifthe physician is the source of the exposure. The physicianproviding the follow-up should receive expert guidance froma member of the Infection Control and/or OccupationalHealth staff. SHEA would not recommend that the source ofthe exposure be involved in counseling, informed consent,or test explanation, in light of the potential for conflict ofinterest. The hospital epidemiologist, infection control prac-titioner, or other staff knowledgeable both about the risksand routes of transmission of bloodborne pathogens, as wellas the counseling of individuals exposed to bloodborne path-ogens, should be available for support and consultation. 11C. Should an inadvertently exposed patient be required to undergo baseline serologic testing? Recommendation The exposed patient and his or her physician should be askedfor consent to perform baseline testing for bloodborne infections(when consonant with state and/or local laws) (A-III). If consentis obtained, the patient's serum should be tested evidence ofHBV , HCV , and HIV infection (A-III). If the patient refuses test-ing, the institution should seek the permission of the patient orthe patient's representative to store available baseline serum fromthe patient (A-III). If neither testing nor storage can be accom-plished, the patient or the patient's proxy should be asked to signa formal declination emphasizing that these services were offeredand declined (A-III). Discussion. Although the exposed patient cannot be com- pelled to have and may clearly choose not to have such testingperformed, such testing would help establish the basis (andsome of the best evidence) for a claim against the institutionand/or the practitioner. Exposed patients should be madeaware of the potential value and detriment of negative andpositive test results. For patients who refuse testing (and con-sonant with state and local laws regarding testing), institu-tions should attempt to obtain informed consent from thepatient to allow the institution to preserve a carefully labeledand dated baseline serum sample from the exposed patient.Although such samples cannot be tested against the patient'swill, these samples ultimately represent important evidencein such a case. Patients refusing to consent to serum storageshould be asked to sign a form noting their declination forboth serologic testing and serum storage. 11D. How (and by whom) should an inadvertently exposed patient be followed and, if appropriate, treated? Recommendation Exposed patients should be counseled regarding the risks for in-fection and the symptoms of acute HBV , HCV , HIV infection(A-III), should be offered postexposure chemoprophylaxis and/or immunoprophylaxis as is characterized in current CDC guide-lines for an exposed healthcare worker 153,154(A-II), and should be228 infection control and hospital epidemiology march 2010, vol. 31, no. 3 followed in a manner analogous to the existing CDC guidelines for providers who sustain occupational exposures to HIV or otherbloodborne pathogens. 153,154Institutions and/or providers in- volved in such exposures should provide testing at no cost to thepatient and should provide the details of appropriate follow-upto the patient and her or his physician (A-I). iv. testing issues 12. Should any, or perhaps all, providers be routinely tested for HIV infection? Recommendation Mandatory HBV , HCV , or HIV screening of healthcare providersis not recommended (A-III). A provider who conducts CategoryIII procedures is ethically obligated to know his or her infectionstatus with respect to HBV , HCV , and Institutionsshould provide voluntary condential testing for their employees(A-III). A provider who knows that he or she is the source of apatient exposure (ie, as dened by the CDC\u2014a percutaneous,mucous membrane or nonintact-skin exposure) to his or herblood or hazardous blood or body fluid should report the ex-posure and should undergo testing for infection with bloodbornepathogens (A-III). v. look-back studies 13. If an infected provider is identied, under what circumstances should a look-back study be conducted? Recommendation Look-back studies should be conducted only on a case-by-casebasis in instances in which compelling evidence for increased riskfor provider-to-patient transmission is identied (A-III). A de-cision to initiate a look-back study should be made in collabo-ration with the infected provider's Expert Review Panel, insti-tutional leadership, and appropriate local and/or state publichealth authorities (A-III). Discussion. Although look-back studies may occasionally provide useful information, most look-back studies haveyielded no useful information, and all such investigations areextremely labor-intense and resource-intense. 48,57SHEA rec- ommends that such studies be conducted only when factorsare identied that suggest an increased risk for provider-to-patient transmission of one of these bloodborne pathogens. A variety of circumstances may prompt initiation of a look- back study. These include (1) if an infected healthcare workeris identied during the investigation of a possible instance ofhealthcare-associated transmission of one of these viruses, (2)if provider-to-patient transmission infection is documentedor presumed, (3) if there is disclosure of a bloodborne path-ogen infection associated with a viral burden higher than thethresholds dened in Recommendations 1, 2, and 3 (above),by a healthcare worker who has been conducting CategoryIII procedures, or (4) if an ongoing screening program iden- ties an infected healthcare worker who has been conductingCategory III procedures and who has a viral burden in excessof the thresholds noted in Recommendations 1, 2, and 3(above). The goals for such an investigation include (1) theprovision of information to patients regarding the nature andmagnitude of risks to which they may have been exposed,(2) the identication of patients who may have become in-fected with one or more of these bloodborne pathogens as aresult of healthcare interventions and who may benet fromtreatment, (3) the prevention of additional instances of trans-mission, (4) the management of institutional risks, and (5)the reassurance of the public. The decision about whether to conduct a look-back study should be made on a case-by-case basis. Factors that wouldsuggest an increased risk for provider-to-patient transmissionthat would prompt such a study include (1) identication ofan infected patient in the practice of an infected provider(and the demonstration of that the patient's and the pro-vider's viral isolates are related), (2) the healthcare provider'sclinical specialty and the types of procedures performed areamong those associated with increased risk for transmission,(3) concern that a given provider fails to follow recommendedinfection control procedures, (4) evidence of substandardclinical practice (eg, high postoperative infection rates or fre-quent occupational exposures), and (5) comorbid medicaldiagnoses in the infected provider that might elevate risk (eg,conditions resulting in, for example, nonintact skin or earlydementia). The identication of a documented instance of provider- to-patient transmission of one of these 3 bloodborne path-ogens should invariably result in a thorough look-back ex-ercise. In the absence of a documented instance of provider-to-patient transmission, the Expert Review Panel should eval- uate the risk for transmission on a case-by-case basis. If a look-back study is implemented, every effort should be madeto preserve the privacy and medical condentiality of theinfected provider. In instances in which the infected provider is institutionally based, the provider's institution should be responsible for the notication program, with appropriate collaboration with the local and state public health authorities. In instances in whichthe provider is not institutionally based, local or state publichealth authorities should decide about the need for such a study. If the decision is made to initiate such a study, the decision should be made, and the study conducted, by the appropriate public health authorities. summary SHEA favors a comprehensive approach to managing health-care providers who have been identied as being infectedwith HBV , HCV , and/or HIV in the broader context of allinstitutional health and credentialing programs. Such an ap-guideline on hcws infected with hbv, hcv, and/or hiv 229 proach allows the assessment of the provider-to-patient trans- mission risks in appropriate perspective. Thus, reasons forbroadly restricting practice should be consonant with existingimpaired-provider and disability guidelines, and should bebased on the following criteria: (1) the provider has a viralburden above the recommended threshold for the relevantvirus, (2) the provider has a medical condition or conditionsresulting in the provider's inability to perform assigned tasks,(3) the provider has documented untoward events (ie, theprovider is known to have transmitted HBV , HCV , or HIV),(4) the provider refuses or is unable to follow recommendedguidelines to prevent transmission of infectious diseases, and/or (5) the provider is unable to perform regular duties, as-suming that \"reasonable accommodation\" has been offeredfor the disability. authorship statement A subcommittee of the Guidelines Committee of The Societyfor Healthcare Epidemiology of America drafted this guide-line.

For all vaccines being recommended on the Adult Immunization Schedule: a vaccine series does not need to be restarted, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. Licensed combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated and when the vaccine' s other components are not contraindicated. For detailed recommendations on all vaccines, including those used primarily for travelers or that are issued during the year , consult the manufacturers' package inserts and the complete statements from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm ).

Influenza vaccination Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons 6 months of age and older. Persons 6 months of age and older, including pregnant women, can receive the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). Healthy, nonpregnant adults younger than age 50 years without high-risk medical conditions can receive either intranasally administered live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist), or TIV. Health-care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons (i.e., those who require care in a protected environment) should receive TIV rather than LAIV. Other persons should receive TIV. The intramuscular or intradermal administered TIV are options for adults aged 18-64 years. Adults aged 65 years and older can receive the standard dose TIV or the high-dose TIV (Fluzone High-Dose). 3. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination Administer a one-time dose of Tdap to adults younger than age 65 years who have not received Tdap previously or for whom vaccine status is unknown to replace one of the 10-year Td boosters. Tdap is specifically recommended for the following persons: \u2014pregnant women more than 20 weeks' gestation, \u2014adults, regardless of age, who are close contacts of infants younger than age 12 months (e.g., parents, grandparents, or child care providers), and \u2014health-care personnel. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the most recent tetanus or diphtheria- containing vaccine. Pregnant women not vaccinated during pregnancy should receive Tdap immediately postpartum. Adults 65 years and older may receive Tdap. Adults with unknown or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. Tdap should be substituted for a single dose of Td in the vaccination series with Tdap preferred as the first dose. For unvaccinated adults, administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. If incompletely vaccinated (i.e., less than 3 doses), administer remaining doses. Refer to the ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td/Tdap as prophylaxis in wound management (See footnote 1). 4. Varicella vaccination All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella (as defined below) should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine or a second dose if they have received only 1 dose. Special consideration for vaccination should be given to those who \u2014have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of persons with immunocompromising conditions) or \u2014are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers; child care employees; residents and staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and international travelers). Pregnant women should be assessed for evidence of varicella immunity . Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility . The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first dose. Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: \u2014documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart; \u2014U.S.-born before 1980 (although for health-care personnel and pregnant women, birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity); \u2014history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella by a health-care provider (for a patient reporting a history of or having an atypical case, a mild case, or both, health- care providers should seek either an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a Footnotes \u2014 Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule\u2014United States - 2012 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination (cont'd) Rubella component: For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, rubella immunity should be determined. If there is no evidence of immunity, women who are not pregnant should be vaccinated. Pregnant women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. Health-care personnel born before 1957: For unvaccinated health-care personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps, and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should consider routinely vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval for measles and mumps or 1 dose of MMR vaccine for rubella. 8. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV) vaccination Vaccinate all persons with the following indications: \u2014age 65 years and older without a history of PPSV vaccination; \u2014adults younger than 65 years with chronic lung disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and asthma); chronic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes (e.g., sickle disease and other hemoglobinopathies, congenital acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction, or splenectomy [if elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before surgery]); \u2014residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities; and \u2014adults who smoke cigarettes. Persons with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection should be vaccinated as soon as possible after their diagnosis. When cancer chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy is being considered, the interval between vaccination and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy should be at least 2 weeks. Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided. Routine use of PPSV is not recommended for American Indians/Alaska Natives or other persons younger than 65 years of age unless they have underlying medical conditions that are PPSV indications. However, public health authorities may consider recommending PPSV for American Indians/Alaska Natives who are living in areas where the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease is increased. 9. Revaccination with PPSV One-time revaccination 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons 19 through 64 years of age with chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy); and for persons with immunocompromising conditions. Persons who received PPSV before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the vaccine at age 65 years or later if at least 5 years have passed since their previous dose. No further doses are needed for persons vaccinated with PPSV at or after age 65 years. 10. Meningococcal vaccination Administer 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine quadrivalent (MCV4) at least 2 months apart to adults with functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies. HIV-infected persons who are vaccinated should also receive 2 doses. Administer a single dose of meningococcal vaccine to microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis , military recruits, and persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. First-year college students up through age 21 years who are living in residence halls should be vaccinated if they have not received a dose on or after their 16th birthday . MCV4 is preferred for adults with any of the preceding indications who are 55 years old and younger; meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is preferred for adults 56 years and older. Revaccination with MCV4 every 5 years is recommended for adults previously vaccinated with MCV4 or MPSV4 who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., adults with anatomic or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies). 11. Hepatitis A vaccination Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications: \u2014men who have sex with men and persons who use injection drugs;laboratory-confirmed case or evidence of laboratory confirmation, if it was performed at the time of acute disease); \u2014history of herpes zoster based on diagnosis or herpes zoster by a health-care provider; or \u2014laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. 5. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination Two vaccines are licensed for use in females, bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) and quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4), and one HPV vaccine for use in males (HPV4). For females, either HPV4 or HPV2 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at 11 or 12 years of age, and for those 13 through 26 years of age, if not previously vaccinated. For males, HPV4 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at 1 1 or 12 years of age, and for those 13 through 21 years of age, if not previously vaccinated. Males 22 through 26 years of age may be vaccinated. HPV vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of infection (including HIV infection), disease, or medications. Vaccine is recommended for immunocompromised persons through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. The immune response and vaccine efficacy might be less than that in immunocompetent persons. Men who have sex with men (MSM) might especially benefit from vaccination to prevent condyloma and anal cancer. HPV4 is recommended for MSM through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual activity; however, persons who are sexually active should still be vaccinated consistent with age-based recommendations. HPV vaccine can be administered to persons with a history of genital warts, abnormal Papanicolaou test, or positive HPV DNA test. A complete series for either HPV4 or HPV2 consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 1-2 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose). Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for health-care personnel (HCP) based on their occupation, HCP should receive the HPV vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 6. Zoster vaccination A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older regardless of whether they report a prior episode of herpes zoster . Although the vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among and can be administered to persons 50 years and older, ACIP recommends that vaccination begins at 60 years of age. Persons with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication, such as pregnancy or severe immunodeficiency. Although zoster vaccination is not specifically recommended for health-care personnel (HCP), HCP should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination Adults born before 1957 generally are considered immune to measles and mumps. All adults born in 1957 or later should have documentation of 1 or more doses of MMR vaccine unless they have a medical contraindication to the vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps disease. For rubella, documentation of provider-diagnosed disease is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity. Measles component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who \u2014are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014work in a health-care facility; or \u2014plan to travel internationally. Persons who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type from 1963 to 1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Mumps component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who \u2014are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014work in a health-care facility; or \u2014plan to travel internationally. Persons vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for mumps infection (e.g., persons who are working in a health-care facility) should be considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. \u2014persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; \u2014persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates; \u2014persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and \u2014unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. (See footnote 1 for more information on travel recommendations). The first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at month 12. 12. Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccinate persons with any of the following indications and any person seeking protection from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: \u2014sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months); persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); current or recent injection-drug users; and men who have sex with men; \u2014health-care personnel and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids; \u2014persons with diabetes younger than 60 years as soon as feasible after diagnosis; persons with diabetes who are 60 years or older at the discretion of the treating clinician based on increased need for assisted blood glucose monitoring in long-term care facilities, likelihood of acquiring hepatitis B infection, its complications or chronic sequelae, and likelihood of immune response to vaccination; \u2014persons with end-stage renal disease, including patients receiving hemodialysis; persons with HIV infection; and persons with chronic liver disease; \u2014household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection; clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities; and international travelers to countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection; and \u2014all adults in the following settings: STD treatment facilities; HIV testing and treatment facilities; facilities providing drug-abuse treatment and prevention services; health- care settings targeting services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; end-stage renal disease programs and facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients; and institutions and nonresidential daycare facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. Administer missing doses to complete a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine to those persons not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated. The second dose should be administered 1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be given at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, give 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose Twinrix schedule, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at month 12 may be used. Adult patients receiving hemodialysis or with other immunocompromising conditions should receive 1 dose of 40 g/mL (Recombivax HB) administered on a 3-dose schedule or 2 doses of 20 g/mL (Engerix-B) administered simultaneously on a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. 13. Selected conditions for which Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine may be used 1 dose of Hib vaccine should be considered for persons who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection, or who have anatomic or functional asplenia if they have not previously received Hib vaccine. 14. Immunocompromising conditions Inactivated vaccines generally are acceptable (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, and influenza [inactivated influenza vaccine]), and live vaccines generally are avoided in persons with immune deficiencies or immunocompromising conditions.
