Some of the misleading negative studies that have been cited were using it as a rescue drug and it was ineffective in that role.

A widely used antiparasitic drug that's listed on the World Health Organization's essential medicines list1 and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ivermectin is widely available, inexpensive and has a long history of safe usage.

I wonder if the original bioengineered strain of COVID19 was being used as a test platform to determine what tweaks are necessary to make the weapon more effective against therapeutics? I'm not going to be too surprised if there's a COVID19 strain in the near future that is not effectively treated with ivermectin, HCQ, zinc, vitamin D, etc. If this ^^^ occurs I'm sure the pharmaceutical companies will have their MRNA Juice jabs perfected and this will be the grounds for the next attempt by the illegitimate regime to make COVID19 jabs a mandate.

These positions have received persistent criticism.[2] Mercola is a member of several alternative medicine organizations as well as the political advocacy group Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which promotes scientifically discredited views about medicine and disease.[4] He is the author of two books.[5] quote: Mercola claimed that inhaling 0.5-3% hydrogen peroxide solution using a nebulizer could prevent or cure COVID-19.[41][42] A tweet from Mercola advertising this method was removed from Twitter on April 15, 2020, for violating the platform rules,[42] but he continued to make these claims on other platforms, including during a speech at a major conference of anti-vaccination activists in October.[38] He was warned by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2021 for selling fake COVID-19 cures.[43][44] In March, the Center for Countering Digital Hate named Mercola as one of the 12 most prominent sources of COVID misinformation in a report later cited by US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.[45] In September his accounts on YouTube were removed by the company for breaking their policies on COVID-19 misinformation.[46] Mercola then moved some of his content to Substack. According to Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Mercola's content is \"so bad no one else will host it\".[47] [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mercola) Sounds legit.
