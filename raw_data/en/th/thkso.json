Adults 65 years of age have a higher risk of severe illness, complications, hospitalization, and death from the flu compared to younger populations. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends Fluzone High-Dose vaccine for adults 65 years. Fluzone High-Dose? Fluzone High-Dose is an inactivated quadrivalentflu vaccine that protects against 4 strains of the flu. It contains 4 times the antigen content than the standard flu vaccine formulation to cause a stronger immune response (antigens are the proteins contained in vaccines that cause an immune response). As people age there is a natural weakening of the immune system which causes older adults to become less responsive to the standard-dose flu vaccine. Fluzone High-Dose has been shown to be more efficacious than the standard-dose vaccine in adults 65 years. Influenza strains contained in Fluzone High-Dose: A/Victoria/2570/2019(H1N1)pdm09-like virus (new strain this year) A/Darwin/9/2021(H3N2)-like virus (new strain this year) B/Austria/1359417/2021-like virus High-Dose vs. Fluad Fluzone High-Dose and Fluad are both recommended for adults 65 years of age. NACI recommends either vaccine for this age group over the standard-dose vaccine because they are expected to be more effective than the standard-dose flu vaccine.
