[What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. This supplement has been used in connection with the following health conditions: |Used for||Why| | | 3 Stars Hypertension 2-3 mg daily of sustained-released melatonin at bedtime | | Melatonin helps to restore normal circadian control over blood pressure and reduces nighttime hypertension. Normally, blood pressure declines at night. People with a blunted or no nighttime blood pressure dip are at increased risk of developing and dying from heart disease. Melatonin is a hormone regulator of circadian cycles and appears to play a vital role in relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure at night. Melatonin also has decreases oxidative stress, reduces inflammatory signaling, and improves blood vessel function. Decreased production of melatonin, such as occurs naturally with aging, is strongly correlated with high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems. In healthy individuals, single doses of melatonin ranging from 1 to 3 mg have been shown to substantially decrease systolic, diastolic, and mean (average) blood pressures. A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found taking melatonin at bedtime for three to four weeks reduced systolic blood pressure by 3.43 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.33 mmHg. Some evidence suggests melatonin may only lower blood pressure in those with a blunted nocturnal blood pressure dip. In a meta-analysis of seven trials examining the effects of melatonin on nocturnal blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, only extended-release melatonin, at doses of 2-3 mg at bedtime, was found to have a significant nocturnal blood pressure-lowering effect. However, in one placebo-controlled trial with 40 participants, high-dose melatonin (24 mg in a sustained release formulation) taken for four weeks was not effective for lowering nocturnal blood pressure in hypertensive African Americans. | | 2 Stars Alzheimer's Disease Refer to label instructions | | In a double-blind trial, supplementation with melatonin significantly improved cognitive function and sleep quality, compared with a placebo, in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In a double-blind trial, supplementation with prolonged-release melatonin (2 mg each night for 24 weeks) significantly improved cognitive function and sleep quality, compared with a placebo, in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The beneficial effect of melatonin was more pronounced in patients who were suffering from insomnia than in those who were not, suggesting that poor sleep quality contributes to impaired cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease. | | 2 Stars Cluster Headache Take under medical supervision: 10 mg daily in the evening | | Taking melatonin before bedtime has been shown to reduce the frequency of cluster headaches. Researchers have found low levels of the hormone in cluster headache patients. In a small double-blind trial, a group of cluster headache sufferers took a 10 mg evening dose of melatonin for 14 days. About half of the group saw a significant decrease in the frequency of their headaches within three to five days, after which no further headaches occurred until melatonin was discontinued. Melatonin appears to be effective against both types of cluster headache (e.g., episodic and chronic). More research is needed to establish the long-term effects of melatonin supplementation on cluster headache. | | 2 Stars Depression .25 to 10 mg daily under medical supervision | | Melatonin might help relieve depression. However, there is a possibility that it could exacerbate depression, so it should only be used for this purpose under a doctor's supervision. might help some people suffering from depression. Preliminary double-blind research suggests that supplementation with small amounts of melatonin (0.125 mg taken twice per day) may reduce | | 2 Stars Insomnia Take under medical supervision: 0.5 to 3.0 mg daily one to two hours before bedtime | | Taking melatonin before bedtime may help reset your body's internal clock. Caution: Melatonin is a potent hormone and its long-term safety is not established. Melatonin should only be taken with medical supervision. is a natural hormone that regulates the human biological clock. The body produces less melatonin with advancing age, which may explain why elderly people often have difficulty sleeping and why melatonin supplements improve sleep in the elderly. Middle-aged adults (average age, 54 years) with insomnia also have lower melatonin levels, compared with people of the same age without insomnia. However, there is not much research on the use of melatonin for sleep problems in middle-aged people. Double-blind trials have shown that melatonin facilitates sleep in young adults without insomnia, but not in young people who suffer from insomnia.However, one trial found that children with sleep disturbances stemming from school phobia had improved sleep after taking 1 mg of melatonin per night for one week, then 5 mg per night for one week, then 10 mg per night for a third week. The results of one double-blind trial also indicate that a controlled release melatonin supplement providing 2 mg per day improves sleep quality in people with schizophrenia. Normally, the body makes melatonin for several hours per night\u2014an effect best duplicated with controlled-release supplements. Trials using timed-release melatonin for insomnia have reported good results. Many doctors suggest taking 0.5 to 3 mg of melatonin one and a half to two hours before bedtime. However, because melatonin is a potent hormone, the long-term effects of which are unknown, it should be taken only with the supervision of a doctor. | | 2 Stars Insomnia and Tinnitus Take under medical supervision: 3 mg daily at bedtime | | Supplementing with melatonin may improve sleep quality and relieve other symptoms of severe tinnitus. Caution: Melatonin is a potent hormone and its long-term safety is not established. Melatonin should only be taken with medical supervision. In a double-blind trial, melatonin supplementation (3 mg taken nightly) improved symptoms of tinnitus. Although improvement did not reach statistical significance for all participants, the results were significant in those who reported more severe symptoms (such as two-sided vs. one-sided tinnitus). Among participants who had difficulty sleeping due to tinnitus, 47% of those who took melatonin reported sleep improvement after one month, compared with only 20% of those who took the placebo. Similar improvements in tinnitus were reported in a preliminary trial that used 3 mg of melatonin each night for four weeks. | | 2 Stars Irritable Bowel Syndrome Take under medical supervision: 3 mg daily at bedtime | | Melatonin helps regulate gastrointestinal function and sensation. In one trial, people with irritable bowel syndrome who took melatonin experienced significantly less severe abdominal pain. plays a role in the regulation of gastrointestinal function and sensation. In a double-blind trial, people with irritable bowel syndrome and associated sleep disturbances received 3 mg of melatonin or a placebo at bedtime for two weeks. Compared with the placebo, melatonin significantly decreased the severity of abdominal pain, although it did not affect bloating, stool frequency, or sleep patterns. Melatonin was also effective in another double-blind trial. | | 2 Stars Jet Lag Take under medical supervision: 0.5 mg daily at bedtime for four days after arriving at your destination | | Taking melatonin at bedtime may improve sleep quality and daytime alertness. is a natural hormone that regulates the human biological clock and may be helpful in relieving symptoms of jet lag, according to some, though not all, double-blind studies. One double-blind trial, involving international flight crew members, found that melatonin supplementation was helpful when started after arriving at the destination but not when started three days before leaving. Another double-blind study compared various amounts and forms of melatonin taken at bedtime for four days after the flight by people who traveled through six to eight time zones. Fast-release melatonin supplements were found to be more effective than the controlled-release supplements. A 5 mg and 0.5 mg fast-release melatonin were almost equally effective for improving sleep quality, time it took to fall asleep, and daytime sleepiness. | | 2 Stars Macular Degeneration Take under medical supervision: 3 mg daily at bedtime | | In one trial, melatonin improved eye abnormalities in the majority of cases. It appears to work by regulating eye pigmentation and by functioning as an antioxidant. In a preliminary trial, supplementation with (3 mg per day at bedtime for at least three months) resulted in an improvement in the abnormalities observed on eye examination in the majority of cases. Melatonin is believed to work by regulating eye pigmentation (and, consequently, the amount of light reaching the retina) and by functioning as an antioxidant. | | 2 Stars Migraine Headache Refer to label instructions | | Pineal gland function and melatonin secretion may be disturbed in people with migraine headaches. Taking melatonin may correct this problem and reduce symptoms. The function of the pineal gland and its cyclic secretion of may be disturbed in people with migraine headaches. Preliminary evidence suggests that 5 mg per day of melatonin, taken 30 minutes before bedtime, may reduce symptoms of migraine headache. A double-blind trial found that taking 3 mg of melatonin at bedtime each day for 12 weeks significantly decreased the frequency of migraines in people suffering from recurrent migraines. Another double-blind trial found that taking 2 mg of melatonin 1 hour before bedtime each day for 8 weeks was not more effective than a placebo for decreasing migraine frequency. In the positive study described above, the reduction in migraine frequency was assessed only in the third month of treatment. It is possible that it takes a few months for melatonin to start working. The negative results in the other study cited above could have been due either to the shorter duration of treatment or to the lower amount of melatonin given. | | 2 Stars Osteoporosis Refer to label instructions | | In a double-blind trial, supplementation with melatonin increased bone mineral density at the neck of the femur and at the lumbar spine, compared with a placebo, in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (osteopenia). In a double-blind trial, supplementation with 3 mg of melatonin each night for 1 year significantly increased bone mineral density at the neck of the femur and at the lumbar spine, compared with a placebo, in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (osteopenia). Melatonin in the amount of 1 mg per day was not beneficial. The mechanism by which melatonin preserves bone density is not known. Melatonin is a hormone, so its use should be supervised by a doctor. | | 2 Stars Schizophrenia and Sleep Disturbances Take under medical supervision: 2 mg daily of a controlled-release preparation before bedtime | | Supplementing with melatonin appears to improve sleep quality and duration in people with schizophrenia. The results of one double-blind trial indicate that supplementation improves sleep quality in people with schizophrenia. In one study, all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were found to have low melatonin output. Replacement of melatonin with 2 mg of a controlled-release supplement per day for three weeks improved sleep duration and quality compared to placebo. When patients receiving placebo were crossed over to the melatonin group, they too experienced improved sleep quality. | | 2 Stars Tardive Dyskinesia Take under medical supervision: 10 mg daily at bedtime | | Taking melatonin may help reduce abnormal movements. In a double-blind trial, supplementation with 10 mg of each night for six weeks reduced abnormal movements by 23.8% in patients with TD, compared with 8.4% in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference. | | 2 Stars Tinnitus Take under medical supervision: 3 mg dailly at bedtime | | Supplementing with melatonin may improve sleep quality and relieve other symptoms of severe tinnitus. Caution: Melatonin is a potent hormone and its long-term safety is not established. Melatonin should only be taken with medical supervision. In a double-blind trial, melatonin supplementation (3 mg taken nightly) improved the symptoms of tinnitus. Although improvement did not reach statistical significance for all participants, the results were significant in those who reported more severe symptoms (such as two-sided vs. one-sided tinnitus). Among participants who had difficulty sleeping due to tinnitus, 47% of those who took melatonin reported sleep improvement after one month, compared with only 20% of those who took placebo. Similar improvements in tinnitus were reported in a preliminary trial that used 3 mg of melatonin each night for four weeks. | | 1 Star Age-Related Cognitive Decline Refer to label instructions | | Cognitive function is linked to adequate sleep and normal sleep-wake cycles, which are partially regulated by the hormone melatonin. The long-term effects of melatonin are unknown, use under a doctor's supervision. is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in the brain. It is partially responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. Cognitive function is linked to adequate sleep and normal sleep-wake cycles. Cognitive benefits from melatonin supplementation have been suggested by preliminary research in a variety of situations and may derive from the ability of melatonin to prevent sleep disruptions. A double-blind trial of ten elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment showed that 6 mg of melatonin taken two hours before bedtime significantly improved sleep, mood, and memory, including the ability to remember previously learned items. However, in a double-blind case study of one healthy person, 1.6 mg of melatonin had no immediate effect on cognitive performance. The long-term effects of regularly taking melatonin supplements remain unknown, and many healthcare practitioners recommend that people take no more than 3 mg per evening. A doctor familiar with the use of melatonin should supervise people who wish to take it regularly. | | 1 Star Epilepsy Refer to label instructions | | A small, preliminary trial found that melatonin improved sleep and improved seizure symptoms among children with one of two rare seizure disorders. A small, preliminary trial found that 5 to 10 mg per day of improved sleep and provided \"clear improvement of the seizure situation\" among children with one of two rare seizure disorders. More research is needed to determine whether or not melatonin could benefit other people with epilepsy. | | 1 Star Fibromyalgia Refer to label instructions | | In one study, supplementing with melatonin reduced tender points and improved sleep in people with fibromyalgia. supplementation may be useful in the treatment of fibromyalgia. In a preliminary trial, 3 mg of melatonin at bedtime was found to reduce tender points and to improve sleep and other measures of disease severity, though pain and fatigue improved only slightly. | | 1 Star Glaucoma Refer to label instructions | | Supplementing with melatonin lowered intraocular pressure of healthy people in one study. Supplementing with 0.5 mg of lowered intraocular pressure of healthy people, but there have been no studies on the effects of melatonin in people with glaucoma. | | 1 Star Myoclonus Refer to label instructions [] How It Works How to Use It Normally, the body secretes melatonin for several hours per night\u2014an effect best duplicated with time-release supplements. Studies using timed-release melatonin for [insomnia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1222004#hn-1222004-need-to-know) have reported good results.1 Many doctors suggest 1-3 mg of melatonin taken one to two hours before bedtime. Studies with people suffering from sarcoidosis or cancer have used very high amounts of melatonin\u2014typically 20 mg per night. Such levels should never be taken without the supervision of a doctor. Melatonin should not be taken during the day. Where to Find It Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, located within the brain. Levels of melatonin in the body fluctuate with the cycles of night and day. The highest melatonin levels are found at night. Melatonin is present in foods only in trace amounts. Possible Deficiencies Although elderly people often have difficulty sleeping2 and melatonin supplements have been shown to improve sleep in the elderly,3 melatonin secretion does not appear to decline in healthy older adults to a significant degree, despite many preliminary reports to the contrary.4 Most of these preliminary studies failed to verify that older subjects were healthy and not using drugs that suppress melatonin secretion (e.g., [aspirin](/medical-topics/id/hn-1088008#hn-1088008-001), [ibuprofen](/medical-topics/id/hn-1144004#hn-1144004-001), beta-blockers). Routine replacement of melatonin in elderly persons is, therefore, not recommended. Adults with [insomnia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1222004#hn-1222004-need-to-know) have been shown to have lower melatonin levels.5 Frequent travelers and shift workers are also likely to benefit from melatonin for the resynchronization of their sleep schedules,6 though a melatonin \"deficiency\" as such does not exist for these people. Patients with [heart disease](/medical-topics/id/hn-1184008#hn-1184008-need-to-know) have been reported to have low melatonin levels, but whether this abnormality increases the risk of heart disease or whether heart disease leads to the low melatonin level is not yet known.7 People with [schizophrenia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1259003#hn-1259003-need-to-know) were found to have low melatonin output and experienced significantly improved sleep following melatonin replacement supplementation.8 [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Interactions with Medicines Certain medicines interact with this supplement.

Controlled research is needed to determine whether melatonin supplementation might enhance either the beneficial or the adverse effects of mirtazapine. [] Side Effects Side Effects Melatonin is associated with few side effects. However, morning grogginess, undesired drowsiness, sleepwalking, and disorientation have been reported. Researchers have hypothesized that certain people should not use melatonin supplements, including [pregnant](/medical-topics/id/hn-1251000#hn-1251000-need-to-know) or breast-feeding women, people with [depression](/medical-topics/id/hn-1200006#hn-1200006-need-to-know) or [schizophrenia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1259003#hn-1259003-need-to-know), and those with autoimmune disease, including [lupus](/medical-topics/id/hn-1233001#hn-1233001-need-to-know), at least until more is known.9, 10 In one study, administration of 3 mg per day of melatonin for three months resulted in a marked decline in sperm counts and a decline in sperm quality in two of eight healthy young men.11 In one of these two men, sperm count and quality became normal after melatonin was discontinued. Although this was a small study, it raises the possibility that long-term use of melatonin could lead to infertility. In a group of children suffering from neurological disorders, 1-5 mg of melatonin per night led to an increase in the rate of seizures despite the fact that sleep improved.12 Until more is known, children with neurological conditions should take melatonin only under medical supervision. Many other side effects have been attributed to melatonin supplementation, including inhibition of sex drive, severe headaches, abdominal cramps, and formation of rudimentary breasts in men.13, 14 However, these associations have not been supported by solid evidence.15, 16, 17, 18 Since none of these claims have been well documented or independently confirmed, these problems may not have been due to melatonin. Though most research reports that melatonin improves the quality of sleep, at least one trial has found that four of fifteen men given melatonin had their sleep patterns disturbed by supplemental melatonin.19 One case of painful gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) has been reported involving a 56-year-old man who had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), and was taking 1-2 mg melatonin per day for one and a half years.20 As the signs and symptoms disappeared after melatonin was discontinued, the authors of the report suspected that melatonin caused this side effect. According to a preliminary report, blood levels of melatonin may be elevated in women with [fibromyalgia](/medical-topics/id/hn-1215007#hn-1215007-need-to-know).21 Data in this report did not indicate toxicity from melatonin, nor did the report suggest that melatonin causes or exacerbates the symptoms of fibromyalgia. It did suggest there is no current rationale for melatonin supplementation in people with fibromyalgia. One-time oral administration of 1 mg of melatonin to post- [menopausal](/medical-topics/id/hn-1041009#hn-1041009-need-to-know) women reduced glucose tolerance and [ insulin](/medical-topics/id/hn-1399002#hn-1399002-001) sensitivity when tested 45 minutes after administration.22 This finding suggests that people with [diabetes](/medical-topics/id/hn-1202003#hn-1202003-need-to-know) should use melatonin with caution and only under the supervision of a doctor.
