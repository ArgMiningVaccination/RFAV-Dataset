Chinese herbal medicine recognizes the value of combining herbs to activate the actions of other botanicals to yield greater therapeutic potency.

It is this adaptability and flexibility that makes Chinese herbal medicine so effective in modern day, busy lifestyles. Ultimately, Chinese herbs aim to harmonize and strengthen the body's foundation and resilience when up against stress and disease. Are there side effects from taking Chinese herbs? We don't expect you'll experience negative side effects from herbal prescription. Chinese medicinals have been taken for thousands of years and a multitude of research indicates side effects from Chinese herbs are rare. However, you may notice mild stomach upset or change in bowel movements as your body adjusts to the herbs- which can be a good thing. This likely resolves after a few days. Can I take Chinese herbs with other medications? Research has discovered few legitimate herb-drug interactions. Rest assured our herbalists are extensively trained and remain up to date on new findings in scientific studies that examine potential benefits or risks in taking herbal supplements with prescriptions or over the counter medications. Are there any medications I shouldn't take with the herbs? There are several contraindications in prescribing Chinese herbs with pharmaceuticals. We collect your list of medications and review them with you in order to avoid negative interactions or outcomes when prescribing. Do I take them with food or away from food? Typically you want to take Chinese herbs on an empty stomach. We often recommend thirty minutes before a meal or 1-2 hours after. This improves absorption in the body. In the rare event that your stomach is bothered when doing this, you can take the supplements with a small amount of food or even with a cup of almond or coconut milk. How long will it take for them to work? In alignment with other therapeutic approaches and alongside your treatment plan, herbs will begin working within 3-5 days of starting your formulation. This of course depends on the condition being treated and how long it has been bothersome. For example, if you've had sleep problems for a decade, herbs need a longer period of time to begin regulating your sleep cycle. But if you just sprained your ankle, then herbs will work and benefit the healing within a day or two and we'd likely prescribe them for just a couple of weeks. "}
