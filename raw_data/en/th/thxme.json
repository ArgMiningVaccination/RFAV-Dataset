Spiritual healing received significant attention globally from many renowned personalities due to its holistic approach and positive influence on emotional, psychological, and physical health. Many people turn to expert spiritual healers like Mohan Joshi to seek help and support for improving their physical, emotional, and psychological health. Mohan Sadashiv Joshi is a spiritual and yogic healer who helped thousands of people suffering from or dealing with psychological, emotional, and physical health issues. Many spiritual healers pursue the activity as a profession while focusing on earning revenues and profits. However, spiritual healing is a cathartic and altruistic endeavor for Joshi rather than simply a vocation. He is devoted to helping others with his healing touch while alleviating the pain, stress, and health problems that have affected their lives for many years. Spiritual healing is a form of alternative medicine that focuses on a holistic and integrative approach to healing the mind and body. Spiritual healers use their positive energy and healing powers to heal people and help them restore balance and harmony. Joshi uses his healing energy to heal and cure people of psychological and physical health issues. Mohan Joshi was not always a spiritual healer and was unaware of the power or energy he had to heal others by restoring balance and harmony. Born on April 27, 1950, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, Joshi completed his early education in his hometown. He later completed a degree in humanities and started working for the State Bank of India (SBI) in the 1980s. He worked at the bank for about three decades in various positions and roles before getting interested in astrology and spiritual healing. Joshi's interest in astrology compelled him to meet an experienced astrologer, spiritual healer, and guru to pursue his interest. The astrologist and guru revealed to Joshi that he had special healing powers and was destined to help others alleviate their health issues and pain. The guru told Joshi he could use his energy to heal people with various acute and chronic disorders through spiritual healing. Joshi started on his journey of healing others when he was 32 and treated his boss as the first patient who completely recovered and healed after Joshi's treatment. The spiritual healer started operating out of a small space in Mumbai, India, holding healing camps and sessions throughout India to cure people suffering from various ailments. Joshi treated and healed several prominent people, including the late Dhirubhai Ambani. Joshi treated a 14-month-old baby suffering from an untreatable condition called mitochondrial disease. He also treated famous theater actor Suresh Khare, former chief minister of Karnataka, India, Dharam Singh, former Karnataka minister for rural development, H. K. Patil, and several other influential people. Karnataka minister H. K. Patil could not walk before Joshi's treatment but started walking without support after being entirely healed by the spiritual healer. Mohan Joshi traveled across India, healing over 100,000 patients suffering from various ailments, including paralysis, migraine, tumors, arthritis, and asthma. "}
