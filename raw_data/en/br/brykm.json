The inhaled aroma from these \"essential\" oils is widely believed to stimulate brain function. Essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin, where they travel through the bloodstream and can promote whole-body healing. Each and every patient that gets treated in our office can personally customize their essential oil blend for their treatment that day at no additional cost. "}
