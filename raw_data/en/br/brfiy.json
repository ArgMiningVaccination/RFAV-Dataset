As if its name didn't sound dystopian enough, it contains [extreme doses](/wiki/Vitamin_and_mineral_supplements#Megavitamin_therapy) of [Vitamin C](/wiki/Vitamin_C), under the rubric of [orthomolecular medicine](/wiki/Orthomolecular_medicine), enough to cause diarrhea and fever. Some of its proponents also claim it can help with [ADHD](/wiki/ADHD).

It then presents itself as a solution to \" [detox](/wiki/Detox)\" autistic kids.

Some of the alleged \"cure\" of CEASE therapy may be from the fever effect, a poorly-understood phenomenon in which autistic people tend to be calmer and more communicative when they have a fever. Researchers are still studying the effect and developing treatment options such as sulforaphane supplements (though these currently have issues with side effects). [[4]](#cite_note-4) It does NOT mean that you should make your child sick. Cure[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=CEASE_therapy&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Autism is a lifelong neurological difference that's predominantly [genetic](/wiki/Genetic). There's no \"curing\" autism, [[5]](#cite_note-5) only providing therapy and support (which can make a big difference). And quality support is often not about \"eliminating\" autism, but helping the person lead an autistic-friendly lifestyle. But proponents of CEASE therapy take advantage of unsuspecting parents to lure them into an unwinnable war against their child's own [brain](/wiki/Brain). The UK Advertising Standards Agency has cracked down on CEASE \"therapists\" for making false claims about curing autism.
