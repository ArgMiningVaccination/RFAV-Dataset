Here are all the immunizations that protect your child's health, from day 1 through year 18. Bringing your baby, toddler or middle schooler to the doctor for their shots (immunizations) can be tough. They may not be thrilled to get them. And you're not thrilled to see them cry. But in the end, the prick \u2014 and tears \u2014 may help prevent kids [from getting sick](https://www.optum.com/health-articles/article/healthy-living/how-do-you-raise-healthy-child/) with dangerous diseases. \"We're so fortunate to be able to fight deadly illnesses,\" says Michael W. Karp, MD. \"And it's thanks to vaccines and antibiotics.\" He's an Optum pediatrician in Vista, California. It may seem like a lot of shots, especially for babies and toddlers. But it's important not to miss any. Each one is timed for optimal protection and given early enough so that your child is protected when they're at the greatest risk of getting sick, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).1 Following the immunization schedule helps keep your child safe from illness, says Dr. Karp. What's more, vaccinating your child can help protect other members of your family. This includes older relatives whose bodies may be less able to fight illness. But if your child misses a shot, they don't need to start over. You can call your child's doctor's office and discuss the best way to catch up. Here's a look at all the shots for children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):2,3 Shots (vaccines) schedule, birth to 18 years 1.

Here are some common questions parents have: Do the shots hurt my baby? Yes, but only for a few seconds. What can help: Keep up with your child's doctor visits so that your child can get multiple vaccinations in a single visit. \"It's likely more uncomfortable for a child to have three painful visits compared to one,\" Dr. Karp says. \"When children get their shots all together, it's just as safe and effective as if you were to spread them out.\" Some shots can be combined into a single dose. So, that may change your child's schedule slightly. The timing of when they'll need certain shots will be based on when they're recommended to be given. If you're not sure, you can call their doctor to figure out the best timing. Why does my kid need so many shots? You're right that the vaccination schedule includes a lot of shots, but it's for good reason. A vaccine contains either a dead or reduced \"live\" particle that can stimulate your immune system, notes Dr. Karp. \"That way if you get exposed to the real disease, your immune system recognizes it and can kill it without it leading to illness.\" (In some instances, such as the flu, your child may still get sick. But the illness will be less severe.4) A different number of vaccine doses and boosters are needed to create a robust immune system response. I've heard vaccines cause autism. Is that true? No. There are no studies that show higher rates of autism in people who are vaccinated compared with those who are not, Dr. Karp says. Many children with autism begin to show signs of the condition during their infant and toddler years, according to the AAP.5 That's the same time when kids are also getting many vaccinations. But the two things are not related. What side effects can I expect? Soreness where they got the shot (usually in the arm) is the most common side effect of vaccinations, Dr. Karp says. (Infants usually get shots in the upper leg.) Other side effects may include a low-grade fever or general fussiness in younger children. Experiencing side effects does not mean your child is allergic to the immunization. All medications may cause side effects. But only about 5% to 10% of those side effects are allergic, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology.6 If your child is having an allergic reaction, they could need emergency care. Dr. Karp recommends treating discomfort, fever and fussiness with children's acetaminophen (Tylenol). If you have any concerns, talk with your provider and read the vaccine information sheet you received at the appointment. Does my child really need the HPV vaccine? HPV is a virus that can cause cancer. It is most commonly spread during sex.7 Some parents are reluctant to start HPV vaccination at the recommended age of 11 or 12. They feel it is too early because they know their child is not yet sexually active, Dr. Karp says. But there's a reason the vaccination schedule works that way. Your child's immune system responds better to certain vaccinations when they're younger. The protection will be in place for when they get older and may need it. That's why children who start HPV vaccinations between ages 9 and 14 only need two doses, while those who start at age 15 and older need three doses.1,3 Sources - American Academy of Pediatrics.
