Both branches design their products based on [anthroposophic](/wiki/Anthroposophy) principles, an [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). [[1]](#cite_note-1) The company takes its name from the German form of the name of the 1st-century [Bructeri](/wiki/Bructeri) [v\u00f6lva](/wiki/V%C3%B6lva) [Veleda](/wiki/Veleda). As well as being known to use green energy, Weleda uses natural ingredients grown using [biodynamic methods](/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) and none of their ingredients or products are [tested on animals](/wiki/Animal_testing). [[2]](#cite_note-2) Weleda Group is \"Der Kommende Tag AG\" (an incorporated company with the mission of encouraging economic and spiritual values) in [Stuttgart](/wiki/Stuttgart), Germany. Their operating profits were meant to contribute to the financing of various anthroposophic undertakings such as constructing the [Goetheanum](/wiki/Goetheanum) and establishing the Free [Waldorf School](/wiki/Waldorf_education) in Stuttgart. [[6]](#cite_note-6) In 1920, Der Kommende Tag acquired the former \"Colonial-Werke Paul Rumpus\" in [Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd](/wiki/Schw%C3%A4bisch_Gm%C3%BCnd). Today, this is the location of the Weleda headquarters. [[7]](#cite_note-7) In 1921, the two companies wanted to merge for financial reasons. In 1922, the Futurum AG was renamed Internationale Laboratorien AG (ILAG) and new shares were issued. At a general meeting, Rudolf Steiner asked the shareholders to give their shares in Der Kommende Tag to ILAG in order to secure the assets of both companies, which were in financial difficulties. The companies were merged under a new name: Internationale Laboratorien und Klinisch-Therapeutisches Institut Arlesheim A.G. The facilities in Germany became branches of the Swiss parent company. Following a suggestion by Rudolf Steiner, the name Weleda was registered as a trademark: on September 20, 1924, in Germany and on September 25, 1924, in Switzerland. It was also proposed to rename ILAG, the parent company accordingly. On 10 December 1928, the company officially registered under the new name Weleda AG, and it is still known as such today. [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) The name Weleda derives from the Germanic prophet and healer [Veleda](/wiki/Veleda)\". [[10]](#cite_note-10) The Weleda company logo was designed by Rudolf Steiner. The logo is based on the [Rod of Asclepius](/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius), a staff entwined with a snake, which is a symbol of the medical and pharmaceutical professions. The establishment of Weleda coincided with [Lebensreform](/wiki/Lebensreform), \"life reform\", a social movement in Germany that advocated alternative medicine and health food. [[11]](#cite_note-11) From 1925: Internationalisation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] During the 1920s, Weleda expanded its product range. Some of the newly developed cosmetics are still part of the range today: toiletry milk (later [iris](/wiki/Iris_(plant)) milk), massage oil, rosemary bath, skin cream, soap, shaving soap, skin food, sun protection cream, hair washing powder, pine bath essence, and [arnica](/wiki/Arnica) essence. Weleda's total turnover doubled between 1925 and 1928 and Weleda expanded internationally. A number of subsidiaries are founded in the 1920s: The British Weleda Co. Ltd. (1924), Handelsonderneming [[12]](#cite_note-12) From 1933: parts of the [Nazi Party](/wiki/Nazi_Party) (NSDAP) viewed anthroposophy as a movement that was contrary to [National Socialism](/wiki/Nazism). As a consequence, Rudolf Steiner's books were banned from Bavarian public libraries. [[13]](#cite_note-13) In 1935, the [Anthroposophical Society](/wiki/Anthroposophical_Society) was proscribed. Several times, Weleda was threatened with a ban on production, which it could avoid with considerable effort. In 1943, Weleda delivered a one-off consignment of frostbite protection cream to the German armed forces, the [Wehrmacht](/wiki/Wehrmacht). Since Weleda did not have the [petroleum jelly](/wiki/Petroleum_jelly) needed to produce the frostbite protection cream that had been ordered, it was provided with this ingredient from the Wehrmacht's own stock. The frostbite protection cream was delivered to Staff Surgeon [Sigmund Rascher](/wiki/Sigmund_Rascher) of the German air force. Rascher performed [hypothermia](/wiki/Hypothermia) experiments on prisoners at [Dachau concentration camp](/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp). [[14]](#cite_note-14) In the 1990s, Weleda distanced itself from these actions and apologized to the survivors' association [Aktion Kinder des Holocaust](/wiki/Aktion_Kinder_des_Holocaust) (AKdH). Weleda facilitated a comprehensive scholarly investigation of the events concerned, carried out by the history department of the [University of Basel](/wiki/University_of_Basel). Weleda overcame the period of National Socialist rule and the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War) relatively unscathed, as the German branches belonged to a company with its headquarters in neutral Switzerland. [[15]](#cite_note-15) From 1945: Later developments[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] During Europe's economic boom in the 1950s and 1960s, Weleda expanded its product range: therapeutic tea (1950), [sea buckthorn](/wiki/Hippophae_rhamnoides) elixir (1955), [facial toner](/wiki/Toner_(skin_care)) (1959), shaving cream (1960), lavender bath milk (1961), foot balm (1962), and chestnut shampoo (1966). From the 1950s onwards, Weleda continued to pursue an international course. Foreign subsidiaries were established in [Italy](/wiki/Italy) (1953), [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand) (1955), [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden) (1956), [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil) (1959), and [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina) (1965). The global demand for natural cosmetics increased continually during the 1990s and thereafter. By 1992, Weleda was represented in 30 countries with a range of over 10,000 products. Weleda established further international subsidiaries, such as Weleda (2004). [[16]](#cite_note-16) At the end of 2018, Weleda opened City Spas in the Dutch cities of [The Hague](/wiki/The_Hague), [Rotterdam](/wiki/Rotterdam) and [Oegstgeest](/wiki/Oegstgeest). [[17]](#cite_note-17) At the beginning of 2020, another City Spa opened in [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg). In 2021, two more City Spas opened in [[19]](#cite_note-19) 2021: 100 years Weleda[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] In 2021, the company turned 100 and marked this event with a partnership with the British [charity](/wiki/Charity_(practice)) treesisters to support [reforestation](/wiki/Reforestation) projects worldwide. Weleda aims to plant one million trees with this project sponsoring global reforestation projects and initiatives run by women or supporting women. [[20]](#cite_note-20) The project started with a Christmas gift sale in 2020 that funded 47,255 trees. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Until today 78,355 trees have been planted. [[22]](#cite_note-22) Anthroposophic philosophy and biodynamics[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] Weleda [Holistic medicine](/wiki/Holistic_medicine) and [Anthroposophic medicine](/wiki/Anthroposophic_medicine). [[23]](#cite_note-23) Anthroposophic medicine is a medicine inspired by the philosophy called [Anthroposophy](/wiki/Anthroposophy). Weleda's botanical ingredients are grown using a farming method known as [biodynamics](/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture). Biodynamic farming was developed by one of Weleda's founders, Rudolf Steiner in 1924. Biodynamics treats the whole farm as one living ecosystem with soil fertility, plant growth und livestock care as ecologically interrelated tasks. [[24]](#cite_note-24) Products[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Weleda is world's leading manufacturer of holistic, natural, organic cosmetics and pharmaceuticals for anthroposophic therapy. [[25]](#cite_note-25) The product catalogue includes a complete line of skin care products, like Weleda Skin Food, items for baby and mother care, as well as homeopathic preparations. [[26]](#cite_note-26) Following the philosophy of so-called lead plants, the company develops products that do not only focus on the raw materials, as all ingredients and the entire formula contribute to the overall effect. Lead plants include the historical and main producer of fermented white mistletoe extract (Viscum album), marketed under the name of Iscador. This treatment stems from a 1917 Steiner vision: \u00abAccording to Rudolf Steiner, it is only through the appropriate blend of mistletoe summer and winter extracts that the mistletoe can deploy its \"real healing power\" on cancer\u00bb. [[29]](#cite_note-29) Sold as an anti-tumor, and widely used in the 1980s to cure different cancers in Switzerland and Germany (centers of Anthroposophic doctrine), its ineffectiveness has since been established and its use is not recommended by the Swiss Cancer Congress and the Swiss cancer league. [[30]](#cite_note-30) [[31]](#cite_note-31) Sustainability[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] [[32]](#cite_note-32) [[33]](#cite_note-33) Weleda has created several gardens to grow ingredients for its products according to [biodynamic cultivation methods](/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) that involve sustainable farming, avoiding pesticides and working with the seasons. Following the concept of lead plants, various [medicinal plants](/wiki/Medicinal_plants) are cultivated in the gardens, such as [calendula](/wiki/Calendula), Weleda Benelux has been [climate-neutral](/wiki/Carbon_neutrality) for several years. The companies in the [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands) and [Belgium](/wiki/Belgium) have also been participating in a Soil & More Impacts project in 2008 and the Dutch company organizes composting operations worldwide. [[36]](#cite_note-36) Weleda partnered with [TerraCycle](/wiki/TerraCycle), a waste management company, to bring customers to recycle their packaging. Consumers can send in their empty packaging from the entire Skin Food line of products to be recycled for free. The collected packaging is cleaned and melted into hard plastic used to make new recycled products. [[37]](#cite_note-37) [[38]](#cite_note-38) Environmental projects[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Weleda&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] Weleda Australia and the [Kitchen Garden Foundation](/wiki/Kitchen_Garden_Foundation) have formed a partnership to educate children about the important role of [pollinators](/wiki/Pollinator) by building a network of Bee B&B Hotels' at primary schools. [Borneo Orangutan Survival](/wiki/Borneo_Orangutan_Survival) (BOS) to protect orangutans and committing to sourcing sustainable palm oil. Weleda has pledged $100,000 to the 20-month project that aims to create harmony between nature conservation and human needs in the [Mawas](/wiki/Orang_Mawas) area. [[41]](#cite_note-41) In 2018, Weleda received the first-ever [Union for Ethical Biotrade](/wiki/Union_for_Ethical_Biotrade) (UEBT) Certification and label for sourcing with respect. The UEBT certification is designed to show consumers that the product they want to buy is produced by a company that treats people and biodiversity with respect.
