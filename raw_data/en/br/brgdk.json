Second Class postage paid at Burlington, Vermont 05401. University of Vermont The University is located at Burlington, Vermont, overlooking an at\u00ad tractive tree-shaded city situated on the shores of Lake Champlain. J Burlington, the largest city in the State, with a population of 40,000, is 95 miles from Montreal, 230 miles from Boston, and 300 miles from New York City. The city has daily plane and bus service to these points. 5 Chartered in 1791, the University is the twentieth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States authorized to grant degrees and the second institution founded by state legislative action to offer instruction at the university level. J Although its legal title is The University of Vermont and State Agri\u00ad cultural College, the University is known to its students and alumni as UVM. This popular abbreviation is derived from the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis. J Within the seven divisions of the University, instruction is offered in more than one hundred and fifty-one programs leading to thirty-one degrees. J The University is accredited by the following associations: The New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education The National Association of Schools of Music The American Medical Association The American Dental Association The National League for Nursing The Engineers Council for Professional Development The American Chemical Society The iii Philosophy and Objectives Y Today, more than ever before, higher education is in need of a basic philosophy\u2014one which will clarify its pur\u00ad poses and goals, and which, at the same time, will protect it from any loss of its essential characteristics. It is important to note well that a uni\u00ad versity, the home of higher education, is not a barometer of public opinion, and that it cannot conceivably bend to meet every demand of society if it is to carry out effectively its major responsibilities to scholarship and learning. A university must be committed to scholarship, it must be dedicated to education in the very highest branches of learning, and it must aspire to the supreme level of excellence. If, in the constantly changing environment of modern civilization, a university finds itself in the role of a service agency, ready to meet every demand that society may make upon it, then there is real danger that the vital purposes and goals of higher education may be lost. If the danger is recognized and guarded against, however, the integrity of our educational program will not be jeopardized. What, then, is the basic purpose of the University of Vermont\u2014what is its philosophy of education? Basically, the University is an institution dedicated to pure learning in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Our respon\u00ad sibility is that of creating a community of scholars, both old and young; of providing an atmosphere for the discovery, exchange, and transmission of ideas; and of furnishing continuing generations with the intellectual means for leading full and purposeful lives. Institutional Goals Quite naturally there is a diversity of goals among American institu\u00ad tions of higher education, and inevitably there are differences in the goals of public and private institutions. As a publicly supported institution, the University has accepted the responsibility of providing an educational opportunity for all qualified men and women residing in the State of Vermont. iv The University continues to meet this responsibility at the same time that it is able to enhance the educational opportunity afforded Ver- monters by the admission of students coming from many large and small communities outside Vermont's borders. This tradition, not enjoyed by many state universities, not only provides a heterogeneity of background and experience for all students, but also makes possible a breadth and depth of academic offerings which the University of Vermont otherwise might not be able to provide for Vermonters alone. Thus our institutional goals are . . . ... to provide a liberal education through individual capacity for the making of intelligent decisions. Such an education becomes meaningful with a knowledge of our historical heritage; it becomes operational through the use of all disciplines, including mathematics and science; and it becomes influential through the art of effective communication ... to extend an opportunity for the development of a cultural life by virtue of the arts and the formulation of philosophical and moral values ... to provide skill training in preparation for specific professions and careers ... to create an atmosphere conducive to research and scholarship through the development of programs which will implement both undergraduate and graduate education ... to develop graduate programs leading to the master's and doctor's degree in areas supported by faculty, laboratory, and library facilities as a means of specialization and of complementing desired research and study in selected fields ... to carry on a program of adult education through the Evening Di\u00ad vision, off-campus activities, cooperative extension, and modern com\u00ad munication media ... to provide services to state and local government where University personnel, data, or organization are particularly adaptable to a public need which otherwise may not be filled. Institutional Means Clearly, our institutional goals cannot be achieved without a faculty of distinction aided by an administration which recognizes that its obliga\u00ad tion is both to provide the facilities and to help create the conditions in which the faculty and students can pursue their educational responsi\u00ad bilities. One of the most important of the University's means to the desired end is the development of an undergraduate curriculum which provides a liberal education in every professional program. This is not to say that every student should matriculate in the College of Arts and Sciences. It does mean that the professional and vocational must not crowd out a liberal education simply because the subject matter of each professional field is increasing. It is impossible today to teach everything there is to know in the professions, whether in medicine, law, engineering, business, or agriculture. For this reason it is important that we continually review the curriculum to reevaluate, modify, and consolidate the fundamentals of professional education so that the teaching of effective communication \u2014mathematics, history, science, and the arts\u2014retains its central im\u00ad portance. Facilitating this is the emphasis placed upon individual excellence, wherein the gifted student may advance more rapidly through small seminars, conferences, individual research assignments, the use of original sources, and student advisory services. Further means include a constant reviewing of admissions requirements to insure an educational opportunity to those applicants who will receive the greatest benefit from a college education; a fostering of research proj\u00ad ects which are related to the teaching program and to our established in\u00ad stitutional goals, providing opportunity for research in the social sciences and the humanities as well as in the natural sciences; the development of a full graduate program as rapidly as resources permit; and finally, a sus\u00ad tained plan of university self study to provide a continuing evaluation of achievement and a basis for the consideration of new techniques and methods. Basic to these means, of course, and a resource without which the insti\u00ad tution ceases to be a university, is the library. To make our philosophy of education meaningful, to make our goals realizable, and to make our other means workable, a truly fine library is indispensable. The University's philosophy of education, then, is to create a commu\u00ad nity of scholars and provide facilities and an environment for full edu\u00ad cational development. Our goals are to ensure the undergraduate a well- rounded academic background, regardless of the field of concentration; to offer sound graduate programs at the master's and doctor's levels; to pursue a program of continuing adult education; and to provide the State and community with professional and cultural services. vi CORRESPONDENCE Admissions Requests for a catalogue, or information concerning admission policies and procedures, rooms and tuition Director of Admissions Academic Divisions College of Agriculture and Home Economics Dean College of Arts and Sciences Dean College of Education Dean College of Technology Dean Graduate College Dean Division of Health Sciences Dean College of Medicine Dean School of Nursing Director School of Allied Health Sciences Director Continuing Education Dean Summer Session Assistant Dean Evening Division Director Conferences and Institutes Director Cooperative Extension Service Director Employment of Seniors and Alumni Director of Placement Matters of Alumni Interest Alumni Secretary Matters of General University Interest The President Scholarships and Loans Director of Financial Aid Student Personnel Dean of Students Technical Information Center Director Transcripts of Records Registrar University Development Vice President for Development Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station Director Vermont Educational Television ETV Station Manager VII THE CONTENTS PERSONNEL 1 INTRODUCTION 34 STUDENT LIFE 44 THE ADMISSION OF STUDENTS 54 STUDENT EXPENSES 58 GENERAL INFORMATION 63 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS 75 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 92 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION 106 THE COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY 116 DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES 125 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 136 CONTINUING EDUCATION 139 COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 142 ENROLLMENT STATISTICS 306 DEGREES 310 LOAN FUNDS, SCHOLARSHIPS, AND PRIZES 332 GENERAL INDEX 344 ACADEMIC CALENDAR 347 viii University of Vermont Personnel THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES EDWARD CLINTON ANDREWS, JR., A.B., M.D. DEANE CHANDLER DAVIS, LL.B.

The University was the fifth New England college chartered, the second established by a state to grant the bachelor's degree, and the twentieth in the nation to do so. Though it has enjoyed a long tradition which has seen it receive sub\u00ad stantial private support, University development has been closely identi\u00ad fied with that of the State since 1791, when Vermont's founding Gen\u00ad eral Assembly granted a charter to the University and set aside about 29,000 acres throughout the State with the intent that rents from this land would support the new educational institution. That same Vermont General Assembly established that the by-laws of the University should give no preference to any religious sect or denomination or discriminate against any, making the University of Vermont the first in this country and possibly in history to be on public record as supporting freedom of religion upon its campus. Colleges and Curricula The University consists of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Col\u00ad lege of Agriculture and Home Economics, the College of Technology, the College of Education, the Division of Health Sciences with its Col\u00ad lege of Medicine, School of Nursing, and School of Allied Health Sci\u00ad ences; the Graduate College, and the Summer Session and Evening Divi\u00ad sion. Regional Cooperation The University of Vermont is an active participant with the Universi\u00ad ties of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island; and with Lowell Technological Institute, and the public two- year colleges and technical institutes in a program of regional coopera\u00ad 34 INTRODUCTION 35 tion aimed at increasing educational opportunities for qualified young men and women of the New England states. Under the program New England residents are given admissions preference and resident tuition privileges in certain specialized curricula. A special brochure detailing these specialized curricula, has been prepared by the New England Board of Higher Education and is available through the Board, 20 Wal\u00ad nut Street, Wellesley, Mass. 02181, the University of Vermont admis\u00ad sions office, and from the other New England participants. The University of Vermont offers the following programs in which the Vermont in-state tuition rate is available for students from the states named.

The University's inaugural president and his first four students felled trees from ground which is today's College Green for timber for the first college building. From their labors and from financial contribu\u00ad tions of the citizens of Burlington, the first college building rose. When, in the early 1820's fire destroyed this first structure, it was rebuilt, again through support of Burlington residents. General Lafayette laid the 36 INTRODUCTION cornerstone in 1825 for that second building, the Old Mill. A classroom addition, Lafayette Hall, was dedicated in 1958 with a descendant of General Lafayette present for the ceremonies. Following its earliest tradition, much of the University's growth in terms of buildings has been the result of alumni and private philan\u00ad thropy. The Billings Library, now serving as a student center, was one of several buildings constructed in the late 1800's. A fine example of the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, the well-known American archi\u00ad tect, the Library was the gift of Frederick Billings of Woodstock. The gift of Dr. and Mrs. Edward H. Williams of Philadelphia, Williams Science Hall, the first completely fire-proofed college building in this country, was built in 1896 to house the expanding departments of the several sciences. It was built and furnished at a cost of $160,000. Converse Hall, an unusual design of Gothic architecture, was com\u00ad pleted in 1895. John H. Converse, class of 1861, purchased the land on which Converse stands, erected the building, and presented the com\u00ad pleted gift to his alma mater. He also gave two houses for faculty mem\u00ad bers on the \"south common\". Morrill Hall, named to honor Vermont's Senator Justin S. Morrill, father of the Land-Grant Act, was the first university building to be provided by an appropriation from the State of Vermont. It was erected in 1907 and houses administrative offices for the College of Agriculture and Home Economics. The twentieth century has seen the construction of several buildings of Georgian architecture. The Ira Allen Chapel, with an imposing bell tower was completed in 1927. It was the gift of James B. Wilbur, who also made a generous gift to provide scholarships for Vermont residents. In 1955 a sixty-four-bell electronic carillon was installed in the tower, a gift of winter carnival funds, and dedicated to all men and women of the University who served in the armed forces. Mr. Wilbur's bequest also contributed to the building of the Fleming Museum. Named for Robert Hull Fleming, class of 1862, the Museum was made possible by a gift from Miss Katherine Wolcott of Chicago, Mr. Fleming's niece, and by gifts from other friends of the University. Completed in 1931, it houses the University's art collection, and a fine Arena Theater. The Waterman Building, dedicated in 1941, was the gift of Charles W. Waterman, class of 1885, and Anna R. Waterman. It contains ad\u00ad ministrative offices, classrooms, laboratories, and a dining hall. A lan\u00ad guage laboratory in Waterman offers tape-recording facilities and listen\u00ad ing stations as an aid to pronunciation, aural comprehension, and pat\u00ad tern practice in French, German, Hebrew, Russian and Spanish. Also INTRODUCTION 37 housed in Waterman are the Computation Center and Data Processing facilities. In 1949, a group of buildings financed by state appropriation was erected on the East campus: the Hills Agricultural Science Hall, named to honor Joseph L. Hills, for many years Dean of the College of Agri\u00ad culture; the Bertha M. Terrill Home Economics Building, named in honor of the originator and first chairman of the department of home economics; and the Joseph E. Carrigan Hall which houses the depart\u00ad ment of animal sciences and the popular Dairy Bar. The University dedicated a new $3,000,000 physical education fa\u00ad cility in 1962, with alumni and private philanthropy contributing $1,000,000 of the total. The State of Vermont provided a $2,000,000 bond issue, the major share of which will be repaid by student fees. The gymnasium is named to honor Roy L. Patrick, '98; the pool to honor Frank D. Forbush, '86; and the Field House to honor Albert L. Gut- terson, a 1912 graduate who won in that same year an Olympic Gold Medal in the broad jump. The baseball facilities in the Field House Cage honor two Vermont alumni who achieved prominence in Major League baseball\u2014Larry Gardner and Ray Collins, both members of the Class of 1909. A new $1,895,000 engineering building, made possible by a state appropriation, houses electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering de\u00ad partments. Opened in the spring semester of 1964, it is named to honor the late Josiah Votey, a graduate of 1884, who served as dean of the then College of Engineering at Vermont from 1901 until his death in 1931. Alumni and private philanthropy has proved the key to a modern building program of the College of Medicine. Vermont medical alumni led the nation in terms of the total amount given in the first year of a three-year fund drive which saw alumni contributions more than match a federal grant which permitted completion of the $1,200,000 Medical Alumni Building. So impressive was this record of alumni giving that it attracted the interest and support of private philanthropy which made it possible for the University to match a second federal grant in completing in 1962 the second $1,500,000 unit of the program. Construction of the $8,700,000 third unit of the medical building program marks the successful completion of the most ambitious single building fund campaign ever undertaken by the University of Ver\u00ad mont. A $2,000,000 gift from the Given Foundation, the largest single building gift ever received by the University was included in the total raised to match grants made under the Medical Facilities Act of 1964. 38 INTRODUCTION The College of Medicine, together with the affiliated Medical Center Hospital, has meant for Burlington and Vermont a modern medical center which serves citizens of all three northern New England states, as well as many residing in upper New York. In 1968, the University and the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont joined to dedicate three new facilities\u2014a new hospital wing named to honor David G. Baird; the Given Medical Building, named to honor Irene Heinz Given and John LaPorte Given; and a new Life Sciences Building, named to honor George Perkins Marsh. New library and audi\u00ad torium facilities of the Given Building are named to honor Charles A. Dana, and Harlow and Martha Carpenter, respectively. The auditorium of the Marsh Life Sciences Building is named to honor George Wyllys Benedict. A new University Bookstore was completed in 1967 on the East Campus as an adjunct to this instructional area. The Redstone campus for women was originally a large estate. The mansion and the carriage house now serve as Redstone and Robinson Halls. Mable Louise Southwick Memorial Building was completed in 1936 as a center for women's activities. A gift from the family of Miss Southwick, a University graduate in the class of 1903, a bequest from Miss Shirley Farr, federal funds, and a student subscription provided the building and its furnishings. Slade Hail, built in 1929, is of Colonial-type architecture. Mrs. Wil\u00ad liam G. Slade made a gift toward this building, in memory of her daugh\u00ad ter, Harriet Slade Crombie. In 1947, the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Hall, a residence hall for women, was built adjacent to Southwick. Grace Goodhue, class of 1902, was the wife of President Calvin Coolidge. Coolidge Hall and the three men's residence halls, Buckham, Chitten\u00ad den and Wills Halls, were the first University residence halls to be financed by a bond issue guaranteed by the State of Vermont. Room rents are used to liquidate the bond issue. Also built on these terms are the three residence halls for women south of Coolidge. Mason, Simpson, and Hamilton Halls were completed in 1937 and named to honor three distinguished women. Mason Hall arid Hamilton Hall honor Vermont's first two women graduates, Lida Mason Hodge and Ellen Hamilton Woodruff, class of 1875, who were also the first women admitted to Phi Beta Kappa at the University. Simpson Hall honors Dean of Women Emeritus Mary Jean Simpson, class of 1913. A three-unit residence and dining facility for men is named to honor James Marsh, distinguished scholar who served as presi\u00ad dent of the University from 1826-33, and who introduced the works of Coleridge in this country; Professor Frederick Tupper, a noted scholar INTRODUCTION 39 of Chaucer; and for Warren R. Austin, a Vermont graduate of the class of 1899, who served as the U.S. Representative to the United Na\u00ad tions from 1946-53. The units were completed in the fall of 1961 under the federal housing loan program. A unit for women, named to honor former Dean of Women Marian Patterson was also completed in 1961, and two new units, Wright and Christie, the former containing a dining hall, were added in September, 1964. These are named to honor Jessie Elvira Wright Whitcomb, a Vermont graduate of 1887, and Jean Alice Christie Chandler Bull, a graduate of 1886. In the fall of 1969, the University dedicated three new residence halls to honor Gertrude Severance Davis and H. Sylvia Wilks, whose generous gifts have enriched opportunities for young men and women at Ver\u00ad mont, and Margaret Wing, who served the University for many years as assistant dean of women. Ground was broken in 1969 for a new $6.5 million physical sciences building which will provide new and expanded resources for the de\u00ad partments of chemistry and physics. The building is named to honor the late Dr. Clinton D. Cook, former chemistry chairman and the Univer\u00ad sity's first Dean of Faculties and Academic Vice President. Other buildings of interest include Grassmount, a gracious Georgian mansion which was the home of a former Governor of Vermont; Pom- eroy Building, erected in 1829 for the medical department and now used to house the department of speech. The Wasson Infirmary, be\u00ad lieved to have been an underground railway stop for escaping slaves at the time of the Civil War, was purchased for the University in 1944 by a group of faculty and alumni, and named for the first dean of women, Pearl Randall Wasson. A modern home management labora\u00ad tory, named to honor the late Miss E. Blundell, a member of the Univer\u00ad sity's home economics faculty, was completed on the Redstone campus in 1961. To support the teaching, research and Extension programs of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics, the University maintains animal, dairy and poultry science facilities on Spear Street in South Bur\u00ad lington, approximately a mile from the main campus; has entered into a contract with the U. S. Forest Service for establishment of a forestry research center nearby; maintains the Blasberg Horticultural Research Center off Shelburne Road in South Burlington; the Vermont Research Forest with units in Charlotte, Jericho, Williston, and Wolcott; the Proctor Maple Research Farm in Underhill; and the Weybridge Re\u00ad search Center and Morgan Horse Farm at Weybridge, about 35 miles south of the University's main campus at Burlington. The Weybridge 40 INTRODUCTION facility attracts many viators each year who come to admire, and many to buy, the University's Morgan Horses. The University Libraries The main Library, dedicated in 1961, is named to honor the late Guy W. Bailey, thirteenth president of the University. It holds the largest book collection in Vermont, and acquires regularly the major periodi\u00ad cals, scholarly journals and indexing and abstracting services. The Uni\u00ad versity collections also include books in medicine and health-related sciences, and a strong collection in medical periodical literature, main\u00ad tained in the Dana Medical Library of the Division of Health Sciences. Support of the Library is derived mainly from University operating funds, with some additional income available from endowments desig\u00ad nating the Library as beneficiary. The Bailey Library is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications, and acquires newspapers, pamphlets, maps, and materials in microfilm. The collections include the books and manu\u00ad scripts from the library of George P. Marsh, the Howard-Hawkins Civil \"War collections, and the Whittingham-Stevens collection of Chiswick imprints. The James B. Wilbur collection, rich in books and manuscripts relat\u00ad ing to Vermont, the Dorothy Canfield collection of books, correspon\u00ad dence and manuscripts, and the papers of Ira Allen, Henry Stevens, and Warren Austin are significant holdings of the Bailey Library Special Collections Department. The Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Clinton D. Cook Physical Sciences building. The Robert Hull Fleming Museum The Museum, an integral part of the University's teaching program, provides a fourfold educational service to the University and the people of Vermont through its permanent collections covering the history of art, temporary exhibitions, the Fleming Museum Association, and chil\u00ad dren's classes. The permanent collection is arranged to augment in so far as possible the University's teaching in varied fields. Particular galleries are devoted to ancient, medieval, and renaissance art; baroque and modern painting and sculpture; American art; primitive art; and the Orient. Two galler\u00ad ies are devoted to temporary exhibitions that survey various aspects of painting, sculpture, graphic arts, and architecture. The Museum has a INTRODUCTION 41 collection of several thousand photographs of painting and sculpture, and study area for courses in art. The Fleming Museum Association, open to the public, is composed of friends of the Museum whose support makes possible certain special exhibitions, guest lectures and films. Gallery talks related to exhibitions and the permanent collections are given from time to time and guide service for schools and clubs is available. Children's classes offer instruc\u00ad tion in art to youngsters of the community. The ground floor of the Museum houses an arena theater with about three hundred seats. The arrangement provides the intimate atmosphere of a small theater and has contributed much to the dramatic offerings of the college year. It also houses the annual summer Shakespeare Festi\u00ad val. The George Bishop Lane Artists Series The George Bishop Lane Artists Series is one of the major collegiate artists series in the country, inaugurated in 1955 by a gift from the late Mrs. Lane, in honor of her husband, George Bishop Lane of the Class of 1883. The Lane Series brings to the campus and community a continuing program of musical, theatrical, dance and other artistic productions. The Series is planned and produced by a student-faculty committee, with townspeople serving with student and faculty members on an ad\u00ad visory committee. The Lane Series has presented many of the world's finest artists, in\u00ad cluding the London Philharmonia, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Phila\u00ad delphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra with David Oistrakh, the Royal Ballet of London, the American Ballet Theatre, Rudolf Serkin, Artur Rubinstein, Van Cliburn, Isaac Stern, Nathan Milstein, Andres Segovia, The Vienna Choir Boys, the \"Weavers, the Robert Shaw Chorale, the Budapest String Quartet, Dave Brubeck, Errol Garner, Benny Good\u00ad man, Victor Borge, Al Hirt, Flarry Belafonte, Joan Baez, Maurice Chevalier, Bill Cosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Henry Mancini, Sir John Gielgud, Roberta Peters, the New York City Opera Company, the Metropolitan National Opera Company, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Com\u00ad pany, and a number of plays including Tea and Sympathy, Li'l Abner, Camelot, Man for All Seasons, Look Homeward, Angel, J.

In addition to three major series presented during each academic year, the Lane Series also sponsors a Chamber Arts Series in the spring semes\u00ad42 INTRODUCTION ter, the Lane Summer Series, several youth concerts and special events, and extension series in St. Johnsbury and Springfield. Conferences and Institutes An increasing number of groups hold educational conferences, insti\u00ad tutes and seminars on the campus of the University, which is pleased to cooperate in making its facilities available for this purpose whenever it is possible to do so. Charges are made to cover costs to the University. Further information may be obtained through the Office of Con\u00ad ferences and Institutes. Educational Television Vermont Educational Television is a state-wide network serving the schools and general public of the State of Vermont, and is owned and operated by the University of Vermont. The UHF television facility transmits in-school programming for grades 1 through 12 each week day. Evening programming includes network and locally-produced pro\u00ad grams of both entertainment and instructional variety. In-service pro\u00ad grams for specific vocational interests are aired, and courses are given for credit through the Evening Division of the University of Vermont. Vermont Educational Television has received several national awards for locally produced programs.

Student Activities The University officially recognizes the activities of a number of organ\u00ad izations supplementing the social and recreational needs of students, de\u00ad veloping their cultural and religious interests, providing them with valuable business and executive experience, and broadening their con\u00ad tacts. Because it is within this area that qualities of leadership may be developed, the University encourages participation consistent with its scholastic requirements. The students manage the affairs and finances of these organizations within the framework of the University's regulations. RELIGIOUS LIFE Although the University cannot itself attempt to guide the religious life of its students, this work is carried out by several independent agencies: the B'nai B'rith Hiilel Foundation; the Catholic Center; the Council for a Cooperative Ministry (sponsored by the American Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, and the United Church of Christ); and the Episcopal Church at the University of Vermont. In addition, the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, the Christian Science College Organization, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are represented on campus. Students desiring in\u00ad formation on any of these groups are referred to the office of the Con\u00ad sultant on Religious Programs.

Financial Aid Many worthy and deserving students are unable to meet college expenses and for them the University provides, so far as its resources permit, aid in the form of scholarships, loans, and employment. The extent of need and the type of financial assistance which can be awarded is determined by the Director of Financial Aid. New students should request application forms for aid from the Director of Admissions, the Director of Financial Aid, or from their principal if they are attending a Vermont high school. All applicants for financial assistance must submit a Parents' Confidential Statement to the College Scholarship Service in addition to the application for financial aid. These forms may be obtained from the local high school principal. Applications for students entering the University should be filed before Feb. 1. Only in cases of emergency will applications after that date be considered. A complete list of scholarships and loan funds will be found on page 332. A brochure presenting in more detail the types of aid available may be obtained from the Financial Aid office. \"VI General Information The following rules of residence, adopted by the Board of Trustees on October 18, 1952, used in determining a student's eligibility to benefit from the re\u00ad duced tuition rate for residents of Vermont, be and hereby are amended, effec\u00ad tive with the beginning of the fall semester in 1971, to read as follows: Definition of \"Vermont Resident\" 1. A student who is of age at the beginning of a semester of the University shall be deemed to be a Vermont resident during such semester if, and only if, he had his domicile in Ver\u00ad mont for a period of one year next preceding the beginning of such semester, except as otherwise provided by these rules. 2. A student who is a minor at the beginning of a semester of the University shall be deemed to be a resident of Vermont during such semester if, and only if, his parents had their domicile in Vermont for one year preceding the beginning of such semester, except as otherwise provided in these rules. 3. A student who at the beginning of a semester of the University has his domicile fixed by a special rule of law (as a student under guardianship, a married woman, etc.) shall be deemed to be a Vermont resident during such semester if, and only if, the circumstances claimed to have made the student a resident shall have taken place at least one year prior to the beginning of such semester; provided, however, that a guardianship of a minor student shall not be deemed a basis for residence if the primary purpose of the guardian\u00ad ship is to qualify the minor for resident tuition. 4. Whenever a resident student shall lose his Vermont domicile (as in the case of a minor whose parent or guardian moves from Vermont but excepting women who lose such domicile by marrying non-residents) the student shall be reclassified as a non-resident effective at the beginning of the next semester for which the student enrolls; and it shall be incumbent upon any student whose status so changes from resident to non-resident to inform the Dean of his college, or the Registrar, promptly, of the facts relating to his residence. 5. The burden of proof shall in all cases rest upon the student claiming to be a resident of the State of Vermont. 6. The Board of Trustees may whenever justice requires make exceptions to these rules. The Committee on Residence has been authorized by the Board of Trustees to consider exceptions as stated in rule 6 above. Appeals from the decision of the committee may be made to the Board of Trustees. Application for change of residence classification should be made to the Director of Admissions who is chairman of the Committee on Residence. Academic Discipline CONDUCT The general principle governing the conduct of students is set forth in the following \"ancient law\" of the University: The conduct of the students toward all men is to be regulated by those plain rules of politeness, honor, and religion which are binding on every 63 64 GENERAL INFORMATION free and virtuous community. They are to conform to every requirement of the faculty, which may arise from their relations as instructors, coun\u00ad selors and guardians, and as upright men and good citizens they shall use all lawful exertions to prevent and expose all violations of the laws of God and of the country, and whatever is at variance with the objects of the University. Toward this end, the University expects each student to maintain high stan\u00ad dards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of all local, State and Federal regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt by him of academic credits, his graduation and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel his registration at any time on any grounds, if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University students and their parents are referred to the booklet Privileges mtd Regulations for Students in which University rules concerning discipline and academic procedures are given in detail. Each student is responsible for knowledge of these. Policy Statement on Campus Dissent and Disruption Adopted by the Trustees on December 5, 1970 The University of Vermont is a place to learn and to teach. It is not a cloister\u2014it does not live in a vacuum. It is both in the world and of the world. Its mission is to educate people for leader\u00ad ship in society. Board of Trustees, May 1969 As the above quotation suggests, the University functions within the rules governing a larger society. It was created by that society for a special purpose: the facilitation of learning and teaching. It follows that the University's regulations must conform with the law as well as take account of the particular role of educational institutions. Fundamental to our entire philosophy is our firm belief that rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States must be protected on the campus as elsewhere in our society and further, that civil laws must prevail on the campus. Within the University setting as within society at large, the exercise of one's rights must be tempered by recognition of the rights of others. For example, the exercise of free speech may unreasonably infringe upon the right to learn. It should not be surprising that conflict may arise between parties engaged in activities which are individually lawful, for a fundamental function of social organization is the reconciliation of competing interests. Within the University setting more than any other, the appropriate means for conflict resolution is rational discourse. The processes fundamental to the GENERAL INFORMATION 65 existence of the University cannot be abandoned under stress, especially since they represent the most effective means for progress. Further, the criteria em\u00ad ployed to seek lawful accommodation of various interests must grant special attention to the central mission of the University; learning and teaching. The laws of society and the mission of the University establish the frame\u00ad work within which disagreement, dissent, demonstration, and advocacy may, indeed must, occur. For mankind to progress, the educational process must be dynamic even if fraught with controversy, for change cannot take place until the first question is raised. The discovery of new propositions or new solutions also may be followed by passionate advocacy. Such advocacy must never replace the continued pursuit of the University's essential purpose of learning and teaching. It is within this context that the University rejects the use or threat of force as a means of resolving differences. Violence is both unnecessary and inappropri\u00ad ate for those who have access to reasoned discourse and is unacceptable within an institution dedicated to reason. For those who will not or cannot contend within this arena, the University must, after efforts at persuasion have failed, resort to the use of any legal remedy deemed necessary. Such persons, conse\u00ad quently, may expect appropriate responses from either the University or civil authorities or both. Normally, the University will respond first, when failure to do so would present a clear and imminent threat to proper functions of the University. Civil action will be invoked when non-students are involved or when the severity of disruption requires such a step. GUIDELINES Since a clear differentiation between legitimate dissent and coercive disrup\u00ad tion is difficult, it is the purpose here to provide explanatory guidelines: 1) The Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Staff, Alumni, and Stu\u00ad dents recognize the crucial importance of maintaining open communication and dialogue in the process of identifying and resolving problems which evolve from the dynamics of University life. 2) Coercive disruption initiated by any person or persons within the Uni\u00ad versity community will be met by that action of the University which is neces\u00ad sary to restore order and the communication required for rational solution of problems. Such action may include suspension, expulsion and/or arrest. Coercive disruption is generally defined here as activity which imposes the will of other persons or groups within the University community, outside of established pro\u00ad cedures for the expression of opinion and the resolution of differences. Coercive disruption is construed to include activity which: a) Denies the rights of students, the faculty, the staff or guests of the Uni\u00ad versity. b) Disrupts or obstructs educational and other activities of the University. c) Reacts to the expression of the peaceful discourse of dissent of others by attempting to deny their rights. d) Obstructs or restricts free movement of persons on any part of the Uni\u00ad versity campus. e) Denies the proper use of offices or other facilities to the students, faculty, officers, staff, or guests of the University. 66 GENERAL INFORMATION f) Endangers the safety of any person on the University campus. g) Threatens, or results in, the destruction of property. It is to be understood that the phrase \"educational and other activities of the University,\" includes the duly registered and lawful activities of recognized student organizations as well as other agencies of the University. 3) Because of its purpose, nature and function, it would be self-defeating for a University to attempt to prohibit or to even discourage dissent. Lawful and peaceful demonstration as an expression of favor or dissent should be per\u00ad mitted and protected. 4) Members of the academic community must be free to organize, discuss, pass resolutions, distribute leaflets, circulate petitions, picket and take other ac\u00ad tion which is not only lawful, but consistent with University policies and pro\u00ad cedures; but they have an obligation to preserve the University's free and un\u00ad hampered search for truth. J ) The activities of an individual or group of individuals cannot be allowed, in the name of free speech, to disrupt or interfere with the educational program. 6) Trespassers may be arrested and removed from University premises. Failure of a person on University property to follow a reasonably founded request to leave University facilities, expressed by one duly authorized to make such a re\u00ad quest, makes him a trespasser. 7) The University may decide to exercise its authority as property owner to eject members of the public who seriously abuse their privilege of coming upon the campus. 8) When groups organize a demonstration on campus which becomes dis\u00ad ruptive, action may be taken against the group as well as individuals involved. 9) Becoming a member of the University community in no way abrogates, or compromises the rights which the Constitution of the United States guaran\u00ad tees to all persons. This principle applies to the adjudication of violations of campus policies as well as all other areas. Policy Statement on Discrimination Adopted by the University Senate September 13, 1968 As a public institution, the University of Vermont opens its doors and facili\u00ad ties to any student on the basis of his or her character and ability and irrespec\u00ad tive of race, religion, color or nationality. Use of English Correct English usage is demanded by all departments in the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regardless of contents. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usage may be remanded to the English department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. GENERAL INFORMATION 67 Reserve Officers' Training Corps The mission of the Army ROTC is to produce qualified leaders with the train\u00ad ing and attributes essential to their progressive development in the United States Army as reserve or career officers. The objective is to prepare college students for positions of responsibility commensurate with their education. The University offers Military Science as an important contribution to national defense. The U.S. Army ROTC is a recognized part of the University's organization, and all qualified male students are encouraged to satisfy in part, their military obligation under the Universal Military Training and Service Act by participating in the program on a voluntary basis. The Military Science curriculum is designed to provide a basic education in military subjects and to develop the leadership potential of the student. Instruc\u00ad tion is given in subjects common to all branches of the Army with emphasis on national security policy, military technology, U.S. military history, military management, logistics, instruction, and the exercise of command. Qualified graduates are commissioned as lieutenants of armor, military intelligence, artil\u00ad lery, engineers, finance, infantry, medical service, signal, ordinance, quarter\u00ad master, transportation, or other branch, depending upon aptitudes, the indi\u00ad vidual's choice, and the needs of the Army. ROTC SCHOLARSHIPS Students motivated toward a career as an Army officer may qualify for one of 5,500 Army ROTC scholar\u00ad ships authorized by Public Law 88-647 (ROTC Vitalization Act), which pro\u00ad vides full payment of tuition, books, laboratory fees, and similar educational expenses, plus $10.00 a month subsistence pay. Grants are made on a competitive basis for a two-year, three-year or four-year period, but are contingent on en\u00ad rollment in the four-year ROTC program. Student agrees to serve on active duty for four years. Applications for the four-year scholarships are made during the senior year in high school. Normally the cut-off date for submission is in January. News media keep the public informed as to the exact date. Interested students should request application forms from the U.S. Army Headquarters nearest to their home. Students living in the Eastern United States should write to: Commanding General, First United States Army, ATTN: AHAAG-CA, Fort George C. Meade, Maryland 2071 J. OPTIONAL PROGRAMS TWO programs are offered: (1) A four-year program comprising 90 hours of classroom and laboratory work per academic year during the freshman and sophomore years (basic course) and 120 hours during the junior and senior years (advanced course). (2) A two- year program (advanced course) identical to the junior and senior years of the four-year program, with the following prerequisite: a student who wishes to enroll in the two-year program is required to attend a basic ROTC camp for six weeks during summer vacation at one of the five U.S. Army Basic Training Centers located regionally throughout the United States. Basic camp pay is approximately $170.00, plus travel and major living expenses. The basic camp must be completed prior to entering the junior academic year. Advanced course students become members of the Army Reserve during the period of enrollment, receive $50.00 a month subsistence pay during the junior and senior years, and are required to attend an advanced ROTC camp for six 68 GENERAL INFORMATION weeks during summer vacation at the end of their junior year. A student nor\u00ad mally attends a camp within the army area in which his home is located. Camp pay for advanced course students is approximately $290.00, plus travel and major living expenses. The advanced course camp may be deferred for one year for cogent reasons when approved by the department. ADVANCED PLACEMENT With the concurrence of the Military Science Depart\u00ad ment, advanced placement may be granted for equivilent training as substantiated by a military training certificate issued by an accredited military or secondary school. UNIFORMS Uniforms are furnished without cost to each student enrolled in the ROTC program. Upon graduation he receives a uniform allow\u00ad ance of $300.00 which is ample to meet the initial cost of uniforms required of an Army officer on active duty. FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM The Army ROTC Flight Training Program is open to qualified seniors. It is designed to train a reserve pool of Army aviators and affords students the opportunity to qualify for a Federal Aviation Agency private pilot's license. On-campus ground and flight instruction under FAA licensed instructors is provided without cost. DISTINGUISHED MILITARY STUDENTS Members of the senior class, including ROTC scholarship students, who have demonstrated outstanding motivation toward a military career, and whose aca\u00ad demic standing is well above average, may be designated Distinguished Military Students and offered a commission in the Regular Army. POSTGRADUATE DEFERMENT Upon graduation, ROTC students are normally commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army Re\u00ad serve and agree to serve on active duty for two years, subject to call to such duty. However, active duty may be deferred for as many as four years for those who wish to pursue an advanced degree while studying as full-time graduate students. Physical Education One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore years, is required of all undergraduate students. Medical examina\u00ad tions are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of Student Health. Students twenty-five years of age or older are exempt from physical education require\u00ad ments. The semester hours listed for physical education are in addition to the total number of hours required for graduation in a specific curriculum. University Responsibility Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is expected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, GENERAL INFORMATION 69 the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is pro\u00ad vided by the Student Health Service. Student Health Insurance Through an arrangement with a commercial insurance company, students are able to procure a policy providing for payment up to $2,000.00 for each illness or each accident. The present cost for one year's coverage is $24.00. Married students may procure coverage for their spouse and children. Further details may be obtained from the Treasurer's Office, Room 358, Waterman Building. Enrollment and Registration Every student is required to enroll and register for each semester on the desig\u00ad nated days, unless excused in advance by the dean of the college concerned. Any student in attendance who does not enroll and register for the next semester at the designated time will be considered as a dropped student and may apply for readmission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Changes in Enrollment Any changes in enrollment must be authorized by the dean of the college in which the student is registered. A student may add a course only during the first week of classes, but may drop a course without academic penalty during the first five weeks of classes. Change of enrollment forms are obtained from the departmental offices or advisers. Auditing Courses With the approval of the Dean and the instructor concerned, a regularly en\u00ad rolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor, the course is not entered on the permanent record, and no grade credit is given for the work. For students paying full tuition, no additional charge is made; for all others, tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow for courses audited. The approval of the Dean of Evening Division and Summer Session is neces\u00ad sary for auditing courses in those divisions. Undergraduate Degree Requirements Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the several colleges and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective col\u00ad leges. In addition to the course requirements of the several curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average of 1.70 or higher in the. courses for which he has been officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. 70 GENERAL INFORMATION Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 3 0 of the last 42 semes\u00ad ter hours of credit in residence at the University, except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the University are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only on recommenda\u00ad tion of the Academic Council and in cases of undue hardship. To qualify for a second bachelor's degree the candidate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. Honors The Bachelor's degree may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are dis\u00ad tinguished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum Irnde. In the College of Medicine, the five students who have attained the highest average of marks during the entire four years' course are graduated cum laude. The names of those who receive these honors and of those who win academic awards are printed in the commence\u00ad ment program. Dean's List The deans of the undergraduate colleges publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students who have attained an average of at least 3.0 in their college credit courses during the preceding semester. Grades and Reports Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A Excellent 4 points per semester hour B Good 3 points per semester hour C Fair 2 points per semester hour D Poor 1 point per semester hour F Failure 0 points per semester hour Penalties for Low Scholarship The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholarship standing. The Studies Committee of each college may determine addi\u00ad tional or supplementary requirements. Students with questions regarding their academic standing should consult with their college dean. 1. \"On Trial\"\u2014 a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. The student remains enrolled but under stated academic conditions ac\u00ad cording to college policies. b. Students are placed \"on trial\" by the dean, or the designated committee of the college concerned, who may also set the special academic conditions of the trial in each case. Normally the period of trial is one semester. GENERAL INFORMATION 71 c. The circumstances under which students are placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Any student who is readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enters \"on trial.\" (2) Generally a student is placed \"on trial\" if in any semester he has failed half or more of the hours of his enrollment but has been per\u00ad mitted to continue in college. (3) A student whose record has been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or continued \"on trial\" even though he does not come within the provisions of section (2). d. A student who has earned fewer than thirty semester hours of credit and is \"on trial\" is barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation\u2014 a. A student is dismissed from the University if he receives grades below passing in one-half or more of the semester hours of his enrollment in any semester unless he is allowed to continue by action of the designated committee. b. A student who fails to meet the condition of his trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though he does not come within the provision above. c. A student dismissed for low scholarship must address his application for readmission to the college from which he was dropped. PASS\u2014NO PASS course enrollments have been approved by the University Senate for implementation in September 1968. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program student, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (or as many courses as he has semesters remaining for future transfer students) during his undergraduate career on a Pass\u2014No Pass basis, beginning in his Sophomore year. These courses may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. The student must complete all work normally required in these courses and he will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instruc\u00ad tor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS, ^either \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade-point average. SECOND, that, in addition, any John Dewey Fellow may be permitted to take all his courses in a given semester on a Pass\u2014No Pass basis, including his required courses. He may do this, after consultation with his adviser, as many semesters as he chooses, beginning in his sophomore year. The instructor will be informed of the student's status and may impose special work requirements for the course. The student will receive full credit for passing these courses. He may request any of his instructors to file a written evaluation of his work (NOT a grade) with the Registrar to be available, at the student's request, to admissions committees, employers, and the like. 72 GENERAL INFORMATION Procedure\u2014> 1. Obtain a PASS\u2014NO PASS Request Form from the Registrar's Office and consult your academic adviser. 2. Obtain your adviser's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as Pass\u2014No Pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college dean. 3. Submit your request to be placed on Pass\u2014No Pass status at the Regis\u00ad trar's Office during the first five weeks of the semester. Requests:- to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Repeated Courses A student who repeats a course loses any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade is included in computing his cumulative grade average. Academic Advisers The policy regarding the selection of academic advisers is determined by each college. Students having questions, or requesting a change of academic adviser, should consult the dean of their college. Intercollege Transfers A student who is or has been a member of any college of this University may transfer to another college of the University only with the consent of the deans of the two colleges concerned. In the case of veterans receiving educational bene\u00ad fits through the Veterans Administration, the change must also be approved by the adviser to veterans in the Financial Aids Office. Withdrawal A student who wishes to withdraw from college must first notify his academic dean and the Student Personnel Deans, in person or in writing. Attendance Class Attendance\u2014Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Absence from Classes\u2014Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused ab\u00ad sence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. GENERAL INFORMATION 73 Absence from Semester Final Examinations\u2014 1. A student who is absent from an examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to his academic dean within twenty-four hours. If the absence was due to illness, a statement from the University physician must be presented. On the basis of this information, the dean may excuse the absence, in which case the grade is reported as \"incomplete,\" and the student may take the examination at a designated time. 2. If the absence is not reported as described above, or is not excused by the academic dean, the course is recorded as failed. Absence from Graduation Exercises All recipients of degrees will attend graduating exercises. Priority of University Exercises University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Attendance at: 1. Regularly scheduled classes have priority over special scheduled common hour examinations. 2. Common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other ac\u00ad tivities. Tardiness A student not present at the beginning of an exercise may be marked absent. Right of Appeal Any student who believes that he has been unfairly treated in regard to ab\u00ad sences may appeal to his academic dean. Other grades are: Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to work of acceptable quality when the full amount is not completed because of illness or other emergency. It can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college dean. The dean may set the limit of time when the work of the course is to be completed. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next aca\u00ad demic year. NP Not Passed, not used in average computation. P Passed, not used in average computation. W Withdrawn, without penalty, not used in average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the compu\u00ad tation of averages. A quality point average of 1.70 is the minimum graduating average. All stu\u00ad dents enrolled in the undergraduate colleges receive reports of final grades from the Registrar after the close of each semester. These reports are also sent to the parent or guardian of each freshman student and to the principal of the secon\u00ad74 GENERAL INFORMATION dary school from which he was graduated. Reports of upperclass students are sent to parents only upon request. Special reports of low standing are sent by the deans' offices about the middle of each semester to the students concerned. Each student, former student, or graduate student may procure one photo\u00ad static transcript of his record without charge.

These four areas of work are performed respectively by the resi\u00ad dent instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Cooperative Ex\u00ad tension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division prepare students for professional careers. Upon receiving the bachelor's degree, students are offered employment in management, specialized services, education, and research\u2014all these in areas related to agriculture, family and consumer science, conservation, recreation, and international service. The evolution of society necessitates continual progress and change, especially in technology, management of natural resources, and human relationships. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is being met through programs designed to give a foundation in the social sciences and humanities plus a fundamental technical education. These programs encompass such areas of study as agriculture, forestry, home economics, preveterinary medicine, and biological sciences. Most programs in the College of Agriculture and Home Economics leading to the Bachelor of Science degree require 120 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, plus credit for required courses in physical education. The Forestry Program requires 138 semester hours of pre\u00ad scribed and elective courses, eight hours of which are earned during an eight-week summer program of instruction between the sophomore and junior years. (See page 59 for expenses.) The normal semester program includes fifteen to eighteen credit hours of courses plus physical educa\u00ad tion. In each area of study certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and integrated educational program and to insure reasonable concentra\u00ad 75 76 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS tion. Faculty advisers counsel students in the selection of elective courses and educational problems. THE HONORS PROGRAM This program of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics is designed to help the superior student. It provides an environment for such students which will insure that they are constantly challenged by the most advanced work their talents will allow. Students are selected on the basis of their academic performance\u2014 usually after the completion of the sophomore year. Their curricula are developed in consultation with their adviser and an honors committee. Special colloquia or consultations may be arranged in lieu of regular class work. Prerequisites may be waived, and in general the student is en\u00ad couraged to work as an individual. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The degree of Bachelor of Science is awarded in each of the following pro\u00ad grams: Biological Science Environmental Studies General Studies Recreation Resource Management Agricultural Economics Resource Economics Foreign Service Agricultural Engineering Technology Professional Agricultural Engineering Laboratory Animal Technology Preveterinary Animal Industry Animal Technology Basic Animal Science Dairy Technology Botany Forest Management Wildlife Management Biochemical Science Plant and Soil Science Agricultural Education Industrial Education Technical Education Clothing, Textiles and Design Early Childhood Development Home Economics in Education Human Development Housing and Home Management Human Nutrition and Food Social Welfare The programs are broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student.

Individual programs may be adjusted to meet requirements of different colleges. The School of Veter\u00ad inary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania now requires 3 years (90 semester hours) of preveterinary college work. Cornell University requires two years but as in the past, only exceptional two-year students will be considered for admission. In addition Cornell requires farm experience and applicants are encouraged to work With a practicing veterinarian if possible. As a result the Department of Animal Pathology now offers the following four-year preveterinary program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science. Candidates must complete a total of 120 semester hours plus credit for required physical education. Students with a 3 point (B) average or better can apply to colleges of veterinary medicine at any time after they have completed ad\u00ad mission requirements. In recent years over half of the applicants admitted to colleges of veterinary medicine have the Bachelor of Science degree. Opportuni\u00ad ties for graduate veterinarians include general practice, the armed services, public health, teaching and research, pharmaceutical laboratories, and federal, state and municipal disease control work. Elective courses will be selected in consultation with department advisers to provide concentration in a major undergraduate area. Students not accepted in colleges of veterinary medicine will thus have a field of concentration and could qualify for graduate college if they so desire.

It prepares the student for employment as a farm owner, manager, or field work with state and federal extension services, breed associations, hatcheries, farm organizations, and various commercial companies. ANIMAL INDUSTRY This option is primarily for those students who are in\u00ad terested in business. It prepares them for supervisory and management positions in industries related to Animal Science, such as those in\u00ad volved with the processing and sales of dairy, meat and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; farm equipment and supply agencies; advertising and public relations; and other areas of public service. Department of Botany BOTANY Botany is that sub-division of Biology concerned with plants. Students in both the College of Agriculture and Home Economics and the College of Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. An undergraduate together with a departmental adviser selects a program suitable to provide a liberal educa\u00ad tion including broad areas of botanical and other biological sciences, as well as physical sciences. Both the botany courses and related courses emphasize con\u00ad cepts, intellectual skills, and the techniques and methodology of modern bio\u00ad logical and physical science. An apprenticeship program in environmental action enables an undergraduate to work closely with a faculty member who is concerned with environmental preservation or planning, and gives the student the opportunity for decision making related to the Vermont environment. Stu\u00ad dents may choose to prepare themselves for careers that do not require education beyond the Bachelor's degree. On the other hand, they may prepare for graduate education in Botany. They may also receive preparation for advanced work lead\u00ad ing to careers in botanical and biological fields such as medicine, dentistry, agricultural biology, biochemistry, environmental sciences, government service, secondary school teaching, and research. Required courses; Biology 1, 2 Principles of Biology Botany-Zoology 101 Genetics Botany 104 Physiology of the Plant Body Botany 105 Developmental Plant Structure Botany 109 Phylogeny and Systematics or or Botany 160 Plant Ecology Chemistry 131, 132 Organic Chemistry Physics 5, 6 General Physics Mathematics 11, 12 Calculus Two additional semester courses in Botany. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recommended. Students may petition the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the planning of individual programs. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS 85 Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowl\u00ad edge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well-advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end the program in \"Biochemical Science\" provides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1) Cellular Biochemistry which emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology which focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemis\u00ad try which emphasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these options normally commences in the Junior Year after completion of the Biological Sciences Program (pg. 77). Students are required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of physical chemistry (or 8 hours for the Molecular Biology option), 12 hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their specialty (e.g., Nutrition, Physiology, Genetics, etc.). Department of Plant and Soil Science PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCE Students interested in horticultural plants, agrono\u00ad mic plants, or in soils as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber production or recreation and management may select a course of study in areas including agronomy, horticulture, soils, or plant environ\u00ad ment. These areas provide a liberal education in biological sciences as a basis for understanding how man grows and uses plants. Students may place their primary interest in either science or in agri-business. The program is flexible and allows students to concentrate in one of several different areas. Students interested in technical positions or in graduate study usually select more of the basic science courses such as botany, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. These courses help lay good foundations for future teaching and research careers. Students interested in careers in industry, business, marketing, sales, or pro\u00ad duction generally select several courses in marketing, economics, accounting, business, and management. Required courses: Each student must take Introductory Plant Science, In\u00ad troductory Soil Science, and two semesters of Plant and Soil Science Seminar, in addition to the courses in science and humanities required of all agricultural students. Majors in the department also are required to take four courses in Plant and Soil Science at or above the 100 level. These are usually courses con\u00ad cerned with horticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, or plant environment, depending on where the student wishes to specialize. Certain advanced courses in other departments may be taken in lieu of one or two of these four 100 level courses with the consent of the student's adviser. 86 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS Department of Vocational, Technical and Extension Education Students in other departments or programs in the college may find it possible to develop a double major by combining either the Agricultural Education or Technical Education program with their major. They may also earn a minor in Extension Education by completing 11 hours of course work in this department. AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION Graduates will be certified to teach agricultural subjects in high schools and area vocational centers. Completion of this program requires 19 hours of course work in educa\u00ad tion, including 14 hours in vocational and technical education, and 40 hours in an agricultural area. Majors in this department may wish to concentrate their study in production, agricultural supplies and services, agricultural machinery sales and services, ornamental horticulture, forestry, conservation or recreation. TECHNICAL EDUCATION The course requirements are similar to the Agricul\u00ad tural Education program. A student may prepare to teach agricultural subjects in a junior college or post high school technical institute and also meet the requirements for teacher certification. Students should plan to complete an advanced degree in their agricultural field of study. The course work includes an eight-week teaching practicum in a junior college or post high school technical institute. INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION A student electing this program will prepare to teach one of the trade or industrial subjects offered in high schools and area vocational centers. Each student will complete 19 hours of course work in education, including 14 hours of course work in vocational and technical education. This program includes a summer and junior year industrial internship during which students may receive pay while earning 30 semester hours of credit. The industrial internship is arranged and supervised by the de\u00ad partment staff. Students having previous industrial experience may receive up to 30 semester hours credit upon examination. This program is not open to stu\u00ad dents in other departments. Department of Forestry Curricula in the Department of Forestry provide a liberal education in the humanities and sciences and a professional education in forestry or wildlife ecology. The programs are designed to prepare individuals for positions in fores\u00ad try, in wildlife ecology, or for graduate study in the forest or wildlife sciences.

MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work, but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should dur\u00ad ing his sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which he expects to apply, and arrange to include in his program courses required by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his adviser, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum requirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: (a) Mathematics 11, 12 (recommended for able students) (b) Mathematics 11 (adequate) (c) Mathematics 9, 11 or 9, 2 (adequate) (d) Mathematics 7, 8 (acceptable but not recommended for most students) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1-2 or 11-12 (Chemistry 1-2 preferred) Chemistry 131, 132 (required) Chemistry 123 (required by many medical colleges, including UVM) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory Physics 5, 6 or 17, 18, 27 (Physics 5, 6 preferred) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1, 2 Zoology 101 or 103 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least two years of college work. In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a 100 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES dental school. A student should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which he expects to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, including student teaching, can count as electives in the Arts and Sciences pro\u00ad gram (utilizing the right to count 14 hours in non-Arts and Science courses plus certain education courses that can be counted without restriction). Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. College Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior levels is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a student enters a program of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his choice. A student may take honors in either or both years. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences who, at the end of his junior year, has an average of 3.00 or above for the work of the sophomore and junior years may become an applicant for college honors in a particular subject. His program for the senior year must be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the department in which honors are sought and by the Committee on Honors, and he must present a satisfactory written report and pass an oral examination on the field of special study. A program called junior honors, which may be considered introductory to but distinct from college honors, is available to juniors who have a sophomore average of 3.00 or above and who have the permission of their department chairmen. The program for each junior honors candidate will be determined by the depart\u00ad ment concerned. Departmental Honors A senior whose overall average is 2.50 or above, or who has been specially recommended by the department in which he is concentrating, is eligible to take a comprehensive examination. Upon successfully completing the examination he will be granted his degree \"with Departmental Honors.\" Some departments have instituted seminars or other programs designed to help the student gain the requisite breadth and depth of knowledge. The Center for Area Studies The Center for Area and International Studies is an inter-departmental ac\u00ad tivity of the University conducted by the Committee on Area Studies appointed by the President, and an Executive Committee elected by the faculty of the individual programs. The chairman of the Committee serves as Director of the Center. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 101 The purposes of the Center are to encourage and coordinate interdisciplinary and comparative study and research of selected foreign areas. The Center spon\u00ad sors also interdisciplinary seminars and guest lectures. The Center for Area Studies administers the program of concentration in Area Studies and offers the B.A. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, based on the successful completion of courses in several academic disciplines with concen\u00ad tration in one of the four foreign areas: Asia, Canada, Latin America, and Russia and Eastern Europe. For the general requirements for concentration in Area Studies see under the Liberal Arts curriculum. Undergraduates interested in taking Area Studies should consult as early as possible in their college careers, the Chairman of the Committee on Area Studies and/or the directors of the individual programs. The Center is located at 479 Main Street. Undergraduates who select to major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credits enabling-them to also fulfill departmental requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. Study Abroad The Vermont Overseas Study Program at the University of Nice in France provides a year of study abroad for a selected group of undergraduates from the University of Vermont and from other Vermont colleges and universities. In\u00ad tended primarily for students concentrating in French, the program is also open to qualified students from other fields, such as the fine arts or the social sciences. Student selection will be based on the following criteria: 1. Sophomore, junior, or senior class standing with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C). 2. A working knowledge of French. 3. An interest in and potential for capitalizing on a year of study abroad. 4. A sound educational program. 5. Creditable personal qualifications. Upon the successful completion of his work, the student receives appropriate credit (usually thirty hours) toward his degree. For further information about the Vermont Overseas Study Program, an interested student should speak to his academic dean or to the director of the program. A student wishing to attend a foreign university on his own or under another program and receive transfer credit should consult with his academic dean and obtain approval, in advance, of his plans. In general, to gain approval a student will be expected to have completed two full years of work, to have an average of at least 2.5, to have a valid academic objective, and to have a good working knowledge of the language of the country to which he proposes to go. The University is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome. Properly qualified students may attend one or two semesters at the Center and receive full credit. For further information consult with the chair\u00ad man of the Department of Classics. 102 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES The Government Research Center The Government Research Center, established in 1950 as the Government Clearing House, provides research and informational services for students, state and local officials, members of civic groups, and the public. Activities include the following: developing opportunities for students to become acquainted with, and to gain practical experience in, the operation of government; maintaining liaison with state and local officials relative to the use of University resources in the study of problems in state and local government; operating a public affairs research center, conducting research projects, and publishing studies in state and local government; and preparing background materials for conferences on public questions. Many of the activities of the Government Research Center are sponsored in cooperation with state officials, local officials, or civic groups. The annual Listers' Schools are sponsored jointly with the Governor and the Vermont State Tax Department. Many state and local officers participate in the series of one-day Town Officers Educational Conferences, which originated in the late 1930s and which are held annually in several locations throughout Vermont. A two-day conference on citizenship, in which high school juniors, high school faculty members and administrators, and University personnel participate, has become an annual event, with the cooperation of the State Department of Education and various educational associations. A Public Affairs Library collection is maintained as a memorial to the late James P. Taylor, whose effort to expand citizen interest in effective government is well known throughout the State. The Government Research Center also sponsors the annual Taylor Town Report Contest in Vermont and cooperates with the New England Council relative to the region-wide contest. The Government Research Center is a program of the Department of Political Science. The Experimental Program The Experimental Program of the College of Arts and Sciences is based on the \"living-learning\" residential college concept of decentralized university work. Students who are selected for the program live in a designated dormitory com\u00ad plex (if they choose to live on campus) and take a special instructional pro\u00ad gram based on small seminar groups, graded on a pass-fail basis. Upon successful completion of two years in the Experimental Program, students are awarded 60 credit hours and the distribution requirements in Arts and Sciences are con\u00ad sidered satisfied. Students then take regular Arts and Sciences courses and com\u00ad plete departmental majors during their junior and senior years. However, they may continue to reside with the Experimental Program as upperclass participants. Specific departmental major requirements and advanced course prerequisites must still be met. (Students should consult their advisers as to the Experimental Pro\u00ad gram work that may be counted toward departmental major requirements and advanced course prerequisites.) Students are admitted to the Experimental Program by invitation only, on the basis of a random sample of the entering freshman class in the College of Arts and Sciences. Invited students are not obliged to enroll in the Program, and those who do enroll may transfer to the regular program at the end of any THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 103 semester, with appropriate credit being decided by the faculty of the Program. However, it is not possible for a student to transfer into the Experimental Pro\u00ad gram once he has begun work in the regular program. Students in the Experimental Program normally take three seminars together with one conventional course in the regular program. All students have an adviser who is teaching in the program, and individual tutorials are occasionally provided in the case of special interests and preparation.

Selected Activities Personal Component Students in each teacher education program, beginning with the Class of 1974 (with the exception of those in Music Education), are also required to include in their program the Personal Component (Ed. 198). The personal com\u00ad ponent offers students an opportunity to pursue an activity under self-direc\u00ad tion. Each student is required to state the objectives for his study and to make a contractual arrangement with his personal component adviser to fulfill the terms of the contract. Multiple contracts and renewal contracts are possible. Options such as education colloquia, community action experience, seminars and discussion groups, individual counseling, group counseling, and others will be provided during the four years. The College of Education has the responsibility for maintenance of standards approved by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion (NCATE). Although initial acceptance to the University freshman year may be as a student in the College of Education, official admission to the College is made during the sophomore year. During the freshman and sopho\u00ad more years special tests in communication skills and other screening measures are administered. Students must also meet personal, academic, and professional criteria established for teacher education candidates. This admission procedure is in accordance with the College's standards as approved by the National Coun\u00ad cil for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. All teacher education candidates are expected to complete admission pro\u00ad cedures before the beginning of the junior year in order to fulfill degree require\u00ad ments. Throughout one's program a Coordinator of Educational Career Plan\u00ad ning, whose office is in 404 Waterman Building, will assist students in career planning and placement. The programs to be described are the programs through which the UVM College of Education achieves accreditation by the National Council for Ac\u00ad creditation of Teacher Education and the Vermont State Department of Edu\u00ad cation Program Approval Plan. Students completing an NCATE accreditated program are qualified to receive certification in most states. Those completing a program evaluated through the Vermont State Department of Education's Program Approval Plan will have reciprocity certification in neighboring states. Further information may be obtained from the Student Information Service Center, 311 Waterman Building. Admission and Accreditation 108 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION Art Education The program in Art Education qualifies candidates to teach art in grades K through 12. Students fulfill general education requirements and complete 42 hours in professional art education and required education courses, 48 hours in studio art, art history or related subjects, and the Personal Component (Ed. 198). Graduates satisfy College of Education requirements for teacher certifi\u00ad cation and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for an Art Major. The program allows sufficient additional advanced courses as recommended by the Art Department for admittance to Graduate School. Students must be enrolled in the College of Education and application to the Art Education program must be made before the end of the sophomore year. A typical program is as follows: 1st 2nd 1st 2nd Freshman Year SEMESTER Sophomore Year SEMESTER English (select from 1-18) 3 or 3 English (select from 21-198) 3 or 3 Speech 11 or 31 (81 with Psychology 1 3 or 3 permission) 3 or 3 Participation (Ed.

Students are responsible for obtaining information regarding teacher certifi\u00ad cation and degree requirements from the appropriate College of Education offices. Elementary Education The elementary education program is intended to prepare teachers for the elementary schools. Elementary education majors may be certified for Vermont kindergarten teaching by satisfactorily completing a program with advisement THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION 109 by the College of Education and the Home Economics Department. The Bache\u00ad lor of Science in Education is awarded upon satisfactory completion of an ap\u00ad proved program. The elementary education curriculum includes a general component of a minimum of sixty credits selected from the following five academic areas: Arts and Letters, Science and Mathematics, Social Sciences, Humanities, and Health and Physical Education (two semesters of Physical Education activities are required). The student may use electives during the four years to build an academic area of concentration of twenty-four to thirty-three credits. Specific information about academic majors or general education requirements may be obtained from advisers or from the Student Information Services Center, 311 Waterman Building. In addition, the program includes a planned sequence of professional courses, laboratory experiences, and the Personal Component (Ed. 198). The professional program begins with the introduction of the student to edu\u00ad cation as a field of study during his freshman year. Each student is made aware of the social foundations and relationships of education, introduced to the ex\u00ad tensive resources available to him for learning about the field in depth, and impressed with the developmental need for his delving into the literature and research as a basis for making critical judgments concerning education. The characteristics of teaching as a profession are also stressed. In the sophomore year, the students are offered field experiences with chil\u00ad dren's groups in the community. These experiences serve the dual purpose of giving first-hand information about children and of providing opportunity for determining the satisfaction which association with children of different age levels brings to the student. The junior year emphasizes professional course work and special content courses for elementary teaching. Professional courses include classroom observa\u00ad tion and participation in local elementary schools. The senior year continues the professional methods courses and includes eight full weeks of student teaching in the elementary schools of the Greater Bur\u00ad lington area and adjacent communities. In addition to the above academic and professional requirements, the follow\u00ad ing courses are recommended to meet specific state and national certification requirements, in elementary education: six credits of English (selected from Eng. 1-198), Human Geography (Geog. 11), Music Methods & Literature (Ed. Ill & Music 10), American History (History 23 & 24), Fundamental Con\u00ad cepts of Elementary School Mathematics (Math 123-126), and American Gov\u00ad ernment (Political Science 21). Applications for all field experiences must be made one semester in advance of assignments, and the student must assume responsibility for meeting dead\u00ad lines. Information about application and assignment procedures may be obtained from the Coordinator of Professional Laboratory Experiences, 412 Waterman Building. A grade of at least C must be attained in the one required course in each of the five general education areas, in the Area of Concentration if one is selected, and in minimum required credits in professional education courses. 110 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION A typical program is as follows: Freshman Year 1st 2nd SEMESTER Sophomore Year 1st 2nd SEMESTER Foundations of Education Child and Community (Ed. 2) 3 or 3 (Ed. 3 or 4) 1 or Speech 11 or 31 (81 with *Music Methods and Literature permission) 3 or 3 (Ed.

Fifth-Year Certificate in Education A special fifth-year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered for students who wish to work beyond the bachelor's degree but who need or desire more flexibility than is possible in any of the standard programs for master's degrees. The certificate program is especially designed to meet the needs of teachers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meeting requirements for state certification, and for experienced teachers who desire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Each certificate program is individualized to fit the qualifications and the professional objectives of the candidate. Undergraduate courses may be approved for the program when such courses appropriately support the candidate's pro\u00ad fessional objectives. The program for the Fifth-Year Certificate is governed by the following regu\u00ad lations: 1 Botany, Biology, Zoology, Chemistry, Physics, Sociology, Psychology, or Mathematics 2 Recommended elective 3 Accelerated course the college of education 115 (1) Candidates must hold a bachelor's degree. (2) Candidates must make written application on forms obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Education.

International Education Field Study The College of Education now offers comparative education programs in Eng\u00ad land, Japan, Africa, and Europe. The purpose of these programs is twofold: 1) to provide an in-depth experience in the educational system of another coun\u00ad try; and 2) to give the students an opportunity to live in a society different from their own. Traveling abroad has a number of advantages. First, it broadens the out\u00ad look of the person involved in the experience whether it be social, educational, or political. Second, it affords one an opportunity to observe people in their indigenous environment. Third, it allows for an exchange of ideas and philoso\u00ad phies. Finally, it adds a new dimension to one's life in being able to share one's thoughts and feelings with others of a different culture. Specifically, these programs are designed primarily to offer students some\u00ad thing more than the usual \"study abroad\" experience. In addition to the usual visits to places of local cultural interest, this program offers an opportunity for each student to relate his professional needs, interests, goals and aspirations to a specific educational area. Students will have the opportunity to visit many areas of cultural and personal interest but, in addition, will live with a family in the host country and work as a paraprofessional in one or more of the host nation's schools.

It offers a number of special\u00ad ized professional curricula in these fields, and in physics, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in the field of specialization. Details are given in the sections immediately following. In addition to the courses listed in the several curricula, all students must fulfill the general require\u00ad ments in physical education and hygiene. Students whose curricula re\u00ad quire them to take two years of mathematics are referred to the footnote under the offerings of the Department of Mathematics for information concerning the possible sequences of courses in freshman mathematics. The Chemistry Curriculum The Department of Chemistry offers a specialized curriculum leading to the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. This curriculum is de\u00ad signed to give a sound basic training in chemistry, to prepare the student for service in some branch of the chemical profession, and to qualify him adequately for advanced study in graduate school. The department is accredited by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society, which has established minimum requirements for the training of chemists at the bache\u00ad lor's level. In accepting accreditation, the department has planned a curriculum which permits the student to reach these minimum objectives and will qualify the graduate for certification. Those who wish a less intensive training in chemistry may take the liberal arts curriculum with a concentration in chemistry and receive the Bachelor of Arts degree. These students may also qualify for accreditation by satisfactorily com\u00ad pleting certain courses beyond the minimum required for concentration. A stu\u00ad dent can elect to concentrate in chemistry at the end of the freshman year or even as late as the end of the sophomore year and still qualify for accreditation. However, the department strongly recommends that the student choose before the start of his sophomore year. In the first year, and to some degree in the second year, prescribed courses are such that a student can transfer into the curriculum from liberal arts, or vice versa. 116 THE COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY 117 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Freshman Year SEMESTER The Sophomore Year SEMESTER General Chemistry 11, 12 5 5 Organic Chemistry 131, 132 3 3 English Electives 3 3 Organic Laboratory 134 .2 Mathematics 11, 121 5 5 Physical Chemistry 141 3 Physics 17, 18 3 3 Mathematics 121, 1241 3 3 \u2014 \u2014 Physics 27 4 16 16 German2 or Elective 3-4 3-4 Humanities and/or Social Sciences3 3 3 16 -17 17-18 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Junior Year SEMESTER The Senior Year SEMESTER Physical Chemistry 142 3 Advanced Chem.

The Engineering Curricula The engineering curricula are designed to help students learn to approach and deal in a professional manner with problems and situations they will meet as engineers, citizens and individuals. From this basic preparation they should con\u00ad tinue to learn from experience and to grow in stature throughout their profes\u00ad sional life. The Departments of Engineering offer instruction in four curricula, Civil, Electrical, Management, and Mechanical Engineering, each leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in the field of specialization. Each curriculum includes the general subjects: mathematics, chemistry, physics, graphics, elements of electrical engineering, mechanics, thermodynamics, economics and English. The College of Technology also offers the Bachelor of Science Degree to those qualified students in the community who are unable to attend regularly sched\u00ad uled courses. Consult the Evening Division Bulletin for further information. The required courses in each curriculum are shown arranged for a four-year program. These courses may be arranged in a five-year sequence if desired. Also, 1. Mathematics 11, 12, 121, and 124 or their equivalent is required. 2. German through the intermediate level (11, 12) is required. Russian or French is advised as a second language for students proficient in German. 3.

May be taken only with permission of the department. 7. Advanced courses in physics and mathematics are highly recommended. 118 THE COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY the courses can be arranged to accommodate transfer from other curricula. One year of physical education is normally required of all students. All junior engineering students visit Northeastern industrial centers during spring vacation. This plant inspection trip is required for graduation. The ex\u00ad pense for the trip of several days is borne by the student. Students enrolled in the civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering curricula may become affiliated with their respective national professional engineering so\u00ad cieties, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, as each organization has authorized a student chapter at the University of Vermont. Engineering students demonstrating high scholarship attainment combined with exemplary character are recognized by membership in the Vermont Alpha Chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society. These student organizations' meetings present opportunities for students to conduct activities similar to those of the national societies. These include: technical papers pre\u00ad sented by students and engineers actively engaged in their profession; attendance at conventions; and inspection trips. These provide helpful contacts with engi\u00ad neering practice and assist in the development of leadership qualities essential to success in the engineering profession. - The curricula in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineers' Council for Professional Development. HUMANISTIC-SOCIAL STUDIES FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS The objective of humanities and social studies is to broaden the engineering student's understand\u00ad ing of man and the relationships in human society. Each student should plan, in consultation with his adviser, an integrated sequence of courses to meet this objective. A minimum of twenty-four credit hours is required in humanistic-social studies.

The Professional Nursing pro\u00ad gram is four years in length and leads to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The Technical Nursing program is two years in length. Upon its completion the Associate Degree is awarded. Direct transfers from one program to the other are not possible. Professional Nursing Program The Department of Professional Nursing offers a curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. This curriculum is designed to provide the op\u00ad portunity for qualified individuals to prepare for professional practice in begin\u00ad ning positions in various settings, to acquire a foundation for continued formal study in nursing, and to enhance growth toward maturity as individuals, pro\u00ad fessional persons, and citizens. The graduates of this program are eligible for licensure as registered nurses, and may advance without further formal educa\u00ad tion to positions which require beginning administrative skills. The program is designed to assist the student in nursing to achieve progres\u00ad sively higher levels in the development of: knowledge, skills, and understandings necessary to help in meeting the physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs of people; skill in establishing effective relationships by the understanding of be\u00ad havior and its effect on interpersonal relations; understanding of the responsibil\u00ad130 division of health sciences ities inherent in the professional practice of nursing and the profession's role in meeting the health needs of a changing society; and appreciation of the thought and achievement of man as a basis for enrichment of personal life. The curriculum, conducted in four academic years, provides an approximate balance in general and professional education. Courses in the sciences\u2014biological, physical and social\u2014serve as a foundation for the professional nursing courses which begin in the second year with concentration in the third and fourth years. Facilities used for clinical laboratory experience include the Medical Center Hos\u00ad pital of Vermont, the Burlington Visiting Nurses' Association, Inc., the Ver\u00ad mont State Hospital, Waterbury, Sheraton House, and other selected commu\u00ad nity agencies. The program is approved by the Vermont Board of Nursing and is fully ac\u00ad credited by the National League of Nursing, Inc. A minimum of 123 approved semester hours is required for the Bachelor of Science degree plus required courses in physical education.

These are: Philosophy 3 Fine Arts 3 Psychology or Sociology 3 Physical Education 2 History, Political Science, Economics or Geography English, Foreign Language or Speech Electives 3 15 Students are encouraged to pursue the study of a foreign language if able to enter the intermediate level of instruction. Students desiring to learn a new for\u00ad eign language may need to plan on summer sessions. Students admitted in the fall of 1971 and thereafter will follow a revised curriculum. The general education courses will be similar to the present but dis- 1. The semesters may be reversed dependent on the student's program. division of health sciences 131 tributed differently. Clinical nursing courses will be scheduled in the junior and senior years. Technical Nursing Program The two-year program in nursing is designed to prepare qualified individuals for technical nursing practice and to promote the development of the individual as a responsible member of society. The graduates of this program receive the Associate Degree, are eligible to apply for licensure as registered nurses, and are prepared to give direct nursing care to patients of all age groups in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other health agencies. The curriculum is two academic years and one four-week summer session in length. General education courses account for approximately one-half of the total required credits, and nursing courses for the remaining one-half. General education content includes courses in the humanities, behavioral and social sci\u00ad ences, and the biological and physical sciences. Nursing courses are taught con\u00ad currently with general education courses throughout the two years and include classroom instruction and guided experiences in giving nursing care to patients in the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Vermont State Hospital, Water- bury, the Green Mountain Nursing Home, Winooski, and other health agencies. The Program is approved by the Vermont State Board of Nursing and is de\u00ad signed to meet the standards for accreditation by the National League for Nurs\u00ad ing. (A school of nursing is not eligible for National League for Nursing ac\u00ad creditation until the graduation of its first class.)

Admission of Registered Nurses The School of Nursing will consider for admission to the baccalaureate pro\u00ad gram qualified registered nurses currently licensed to practice. Admission to the program is essentially the same as for other applicants to the University. In ac\u00ad132 division of health sciences cord with University policy, the registered nurse student may apply for credit by examination in general education and selected nursing courses. Registered nurses planning to seek admission are urged to write to the School of Nursing for more detailed information and to arrange for a personal inter\u00ad view prior to applying for admission or taking courses for college credit at this or other institutions. General Information Applicants must satisfy the general admission requirements for the Univer\u00ad sity. High School courses in biology, chemistry, and physics are highly recom\u00ad mended. Grades in nursing courses are based on achievement in theory and in labora\u00ad tory practice, both of which must be satisfactory to receive a passing grade. The School of Nursing reserves the right to require the withdrawal from nursing of any student whose health, academic record, or performance and behavior in nursing is judged unsatisfactory. All students in the School of Nursing are responsible for transportation to and from the agencies which are used for clinical experiences. Financial aid is available in the form of scholarships, loans, prizes and employ\u00ad ment (see page 332). Of special interest to students in nursing is the Nursing Student Loan Program. Anyone interested should make application for financial aid by February 1. In addition to funds handled through the University, students in the bacca\u00ad laureate program may apply for appointments in the Army Student Nurse Pro\u00ad gram or the Navy Nurse Corps Candidate Program at the beginning of their junior year. The appointments carry generous financial allowances. A student who participates twelve months or less serves on active duty in the respective service for twenty-four months. If two years of financial support have been received, thirty-six months of service are required. Continuing Education Continuing education is arranged to meet the demands of both employed and unemployed professional nurses. Special classes, seminars, institutes, and work\u00ad shops are scheduled throughout the year, on the campus and in accessible com\u00ad munities of the state. These activities are designed to aid the nurse to keep abreast of new knowledge and to develop greater skill in nursing care.

Required are one year each of the following college level courses: Biology Physics (including laboratory) General or inorganic chemistry Organic chemistry In addition, because a physician requires a broad and balanced cultural background as well as a technical education, the College recommends as appropriate to an adequate premedical program: English\u2014at least one and preferably two years of composition and/or literature. Mathematics\u2014dependent upon secondary school preparation but should include at least an introduction to calculus. Behavioral Sciences\u2014one or two years in the areas of psychology, sociology or anthropology. The Humanities\u2014at least two years of course work in history, philosophy, religion or the arts. The College of Medicine encourages its prospective students to con\u00ad centrate while in college in a field of knowledge of their choice, whether in the sciences or humanities, and to pursue these interests in depth. Eligibility of an applicant for admission is determined by the Admis\u00ad sions Committee of the College of Medicine on the basis of the following: The scholastic record of the applicant in his premedical work. Aptitude and motivation for the study and practice of medicine as determined by information from the applicant's undergraduate faculty and by personal interview with the Admissions Commit\u00ad tee. 134 division of health sciences The applicant's scores on the Medical College Admission Test. Applicants are urged to take the Test in May preceding applica\u00ad tion. A maximum of seventy-five students is admitted to each entering class. The faculty sincerely hopes that each entering student will success\u00ad fully complete the medical curriculum and graduate with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Preference for admission is according to the following priorities: Qualified residents of Vermont. Qualified residents of other New England States having con\u00ad tractual arrangements with the College of Medicine through the New England Board of Higher Education. Contracts are present\u00ad ly in effect with the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Massa\u00ad chusetts and Rhode Island. Qualified residents of other areas. The number of places for resi\u00ad dents of other areas is limited and competition for these places is especially keen. Sons and daughters of alumni of the College of Medicine are given special consideration within the framework of the above policy. The final closure date for receiving applications is November 1 pre\u00ad ceding the September admission. An application fee of $15.00 (not refundable) is payable on request of the Office of Admissions. When an applicant is offered admission to the College of Medicine and wishes to accept the place offered, a deposit of $100.00 must be paid no later than two weeks following notice of acceptance in order to reserve a place in the entering class. This deposit is refundable up to March 1 preceding admission, should the applicant release his place in the class. The deposit is applied toward the applicant's tuition upon matriculation in the College of Medicine. THE CURRICULUM The curriculum consists of three parts: the basic science core, the clinical core, and the major program. Basic Science Core The forty-eight weeks of instruction in the basic science core spans the fresh\u00ad man year and fall semester of the sophomore year. During this period students are instructed in the basic sciences that undergird clinical medicine. Emphasis is placed on that body of knowledge common to all types of medical practice, division of health sciences avoiding the minute details relevant only to individual specialties. Comprehen\u00ad sive clinics, seminars in Behavioral Science and the elective faculty tutorial pro\u00ad gram provide for the first year medical student clinical contacts, an awareness of social, cultural and psychologic factors affecting health and illness, and insight into the major issues influencing the practice of medicine. Clinical Science Core The clinical core extends from January of the sophomore year until December of the junior year. During this twelve-month period each student receives twelve weeks of instruction in medicine, twelve weeks of instruction in surgery, eight weeks in pediatrics, eight weeks in obstetrics and gynecology, and eight weeks in psychiatry. There will be a brief summer vacation. During this year students work within the hospitals and clinics and instruction is based on the care of patients. Major Program The Major Program extends from January of the junior year until graduation in May of the following year. This sixteen-month period is divided into ten rotations of approximately six weeks duration. The Major Program enables each student to select that course of study best suited to his career objectives. Majors are offered in each of the preclinical sciences and Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, and the Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry. An integral part of each clinical major is a review and extension of basic science relevant to that discipline. Each major includes a limited number of required clinical and/or laboratory experiences as well as elective rotations. These electives are not restricted to the discipline in which the student is major\u00ad ing and may include experiences in approved programs outside of Burlington. Each of these programs has sufficient flexibility to meet the interests and goals of each student. During the 1969-70 academic year, for instance, students with career goals in family practice selected major programs in Medicine, Pediatrics and Surgery, while those with future careers in Psychiatry selected major pro\u00ad grams in Medicine and Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry, and so forth. A system of faculty advisers has been developed to counsel each student on a one-to-one basis throughout the planning and course of his major program. Although the majority of students elect a clinical major, students so desir\u00ad ing may commit the full Major Program to study in the preclinical sciences. While these programs are individualized, it is expected that graduate study, re\u00ad search and a thesis will form the basis for each. Qualified students may enroll in the Graduate College as candidates for the Master of Science degree while fulfilling the requirements of the M.D. degree within the Major Program. \"\\1 The Graduate College The purpose of the Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desires a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields. The College offers the following programs leading to the Master's degree and to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Each student is expected to be familiar with the general regulations and procedures of the Graduate College, and with the specific degree requirements in his chosen field of study. For detailed information refer to the Graduate College Bulletin available from the Graduate College Office, 335 Waterman Building. Master of Arts Programs are offered in the following fields: Communication Latin Economics Mathematics English Music F/ench Philosophy Geography Political Science German Psychology Greek Spanish History Master of Science Programs are offered in the following fields: Agricultural Economics Forestry Anatomy Geology Animal Sciences Home Economics Animal Pathology Mechanical Engineering Biochemistry Medical Microbiology Biomedical Engineering Medical Technology Biostatistics Microbiology Botany Pathology Chemistry Pharmacology Civil Engineering Physics Economics of Natural Physiology and Biophysics Resource Planning Plant and Soil Science Electrical Biophysics Speech Pathology Electrical Engineering Zoology Master of Arts in Teaching This degree is appropriate for teachers who are interested primarily in increas\u00ad ing their knowledge of their subject matter fields and thereby the effectiveness of their classroom instruction.

Programs are planned on an individual basis. Mathematics Biology (Botany & Zoology) Physical Sciences (Chemistry & Physics) Master of Education The master of education degree is intended to give those who work in edu\u00ad cation the kind of background and professional preparation needed for leader\u00ad ship in teaching and functions related to it. Programs are planned on an indi\u00ad vidual basis with special attention to such fields as: Administration Foundations of Education Reading and Language (Elementary and Secondary) School Counseling (Elementary and Secondary) Special Education Student Personnel Services in Higher Education Teacher Education Vocational and Technical Education Master of Business Administration Study leading to the degree of Master of Business Administration is designed to provide opportunity for the individual to develop knowledge and understand\u00ad ing in a wide range of business activities that will provide foundation for growth and success in a business career. Programs are planned on an individual basis. Master of Extension Education This degree is designed to provide opportunity for those who work in non- school educational and counseling programs to develop knowledge and under\u00ad standing in activities related to program management and educational meth\u00ad odology. Programs are planned on an individual basis with special attention to fields such as: Agriculture Home Economics Youth Organizations Family Centered Services Business and Industry 138 the graduate college Doctor of Philosophy Programs are offered in the following fields: Anatomy Biochemistry Botany Chemistry Electrical Engineering Mathematics Mechanical Engineering Microbiology Pharmacology Physics Physiology and Biophysics Plant and Soil Science Psychology Zoology Fifth Year Certificate in Education A special fifth year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered by the Department of Education for students who wish to work beyond the bachelor's degree. It is especially designed to meet the needs of teach\u00ad ers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meet\u00ad ing requirements for state certification, and for experienced teachers who de\u00ad sire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Information about the certificate program may be obtained by contacting the Dean of the College of Education. Post-sophomore fellows in medicine are permitted to use credit from appro\u00ad priate medical courses toward an M.S. or a Ph.D. They are enrolled in the Graduate College for one or more years to pursue research and enroll in such courses as would normally not be included within a medical program. Such persons, therefore, are working toward an M.D. and M.S. or Ph.D., but com\u00ad pletion of each degree may occur at a different time. All courses for which graduate credit is received at UVM in a master's degree program, whether a master's degree is received or not, may be applied toward a Ph.D. at UVM provided they are appropriate for the Ph.D. program. No provision is made for a person to employ the same credit to satisfy two master's degrees at the University of Vermont. Concurrent Degrees Continuing Education The University, through Continuing Education, aims to broaden the horizon of those who have not attended col\u00ad lege, to afford an opportunity for those who have attended college and subsequently wish to keep in touch with academic thought in their favorite fields or to gain information about subjects which were not studied in college, and to provide undergraduate opportunities in addition to the regular classroom experience. The Summer Session Summer Session offers courses on both the graduate and undergraduate level in many subjects, including agriculture, art, astronomy, botany, chemistry, clas\u00ad sics, dramatic art, economics, education, English, French, geography, German, history, home economics, journalism, library science, mathematics, music (in\u00ad strumental and vocal), philosophy, physical education, physics, political science, psychology, reading, sociology, Spanish, speech and zoology. The offerings are diversified to meet the needs of the following various groups of students: those with adequate preparation who desire courses leading to a bachelor's degree; those with adequate preparation who wish to do graduate work for the master's degree; principals and superintendents of schools who de\u00ad sire fundamental or specialized courses in the fields of educational administra\u00ad tion and supervision; teachers in elementary or secondary schools who seek cred\u00ad it toward state teachers' certificates, or who desire to broaden their knowledge of special subjects; persons who desire college level courses for self-improvement. Students must have sufficient maturity and background to profit from the courses in which they enroll. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Summer Session. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. The master's degree in several, but not all, areas may be earned through work in the Summer Session. All students desiring graduate credit for courses taken in the Summer Session must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. Enrollment in courses for graduate credit does not imply admission to the Graduate College. Fuller details on available courses and programs will be sent on request by the Director of the Summer Session. 139 140 continuing education Evening Division Continuing education for adults in the State of Vermont is provided under the Evening Division Program offered by the University. Members of the fac\u00ad ulty at the University and others, working under temporary appointment, offer evening or extension courses in arts and sciences and education. A variety of courses is presented in evening sessions on campus throughout the college year. Some of these may be taken for credit while others are non-credit and are de\u00ad signed for the adult who is interested in continuing his education for the plea\u00ad sure of self-improvement. Courses are given in towns and cities throughout the state wherever a group of ten or more individuals register for a course. Arrangements for Evening Division courses are made through the Evening Division, Waterman Building. Length of courses varies from ten to fifteen weeks. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Evening Division. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. All persons desiring graduate credit must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. Non-Degree Student Enrollment Through Continuing Education Non-Degree students have an opportunity to enroll in courses offered in the day program. Non-degree students are those who have presented minimum credentials and are permitted to enroll in one of the colleges of the University to undertake course work for a purpose other than the earning of a degree. Previously earned credits for non-matriculated students who later matricu\u00ad lated will be evaluated and included in the particular degree program if per\u00ad tinent. Undergraduate Non-degree Students, those seeking only undergraduate credit for course work taken, apply for approval to the Division of Continuing Edu\u00ad cation which will act as their college office. Graduate Non-degree Students, those seeking graduate credit, must register through the Graduate College. Selection of courses for those having long range plans of earning a degree should be made on the basis of information given in this catalog. Students in\u00ad terested in making a formal application for admission to the University should contact the Office of Admissions, 344 Waterman Building. All non-degree students who would like assistance in planning educational programs and selecting courses should contact the Division of Continuing Edu\u00ad cation at 357 Waterman Building, (telephone 656-2085) Conferences and Institutes Conference activity is a rapidly increasing part of University life. Both throughout the regular college year and during the summer, many conference groups make use not only of university classroom and auditorium facilities but also of university dormitories and dining service. Groups interested in arranging continuing education 141 for meetings or conferences at the University should contact the Conferences and Institutes Office, Waterman Building. This office also coordinates the Speakers Bureau through which University personnel are made available to or\u00ad ganizations outside the campus. Courses of Instruction The University reserves the right to change these course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course, but is other\u00ad wise qualified to take it, may be permitted to enroll by the department. Courses numbered from 1 through 99 are elementary and intermediate courses. Those numbered from 100 through 199 are advanced undergraduate courses. They usually have at least one year or prior work in that disci\u00ad pline as a prerequisite. They may be taken as minor courses, but in some departments only a limited number may be taken as major courses. They are not ordinarily available for graduate credit. Courses numbered from 200 through 299 are relatively more advanced courses for undergraduates which may also be taken for graduate credit by graduate students. They usually require at least two years of prior work in that and related disciplines. To obtain graduate credit the grad\u00ad uate student generally is expected to meet higher qualitative or quantita\u00ad tive expectations than the undergraduate student. Courses numbered from 300 through 399 are graduate courses and, with rare exceptions, are taken only by persons holding a bachelor's degree. Courses numbered above 400 are limited to candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Two numbers with a comma between (17, 18) indicate that the sepa\u00ad rate semester courses may be taken independently for credit. Two hyphenated numbers (17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course de\u00ad scription. Odd-numbered courses are generally offered the first semester: even- numbered courses are generally offered the second semester; variations 142 agricultural economics 143 from this arrangement may be indicated by the Roman numeral I for the first semester or II for the second semester. The form (2-3) immediately following the course title indicates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and of laboratory.
