While the experience of the two types of treatment can be characterized as quite similar, with both therapies tapping into the body's ability to self-heal, the execution of these treatments are fundamentally very different. Cranial Sacral Massage vs Spiritual Healing Before we dive into the differences, let's make sure we fully understand what cranial sacral massage is and what spiritual healing is. Getting Familiar With Cranial Sacral Massage Cranial sacral massage holds focus on the physical body, however, it does not include the hallmarks that make up traditional massage therapy. Rather than spinal manipulations and firm pressure, cranial sacral massage utilizes a light pressure that encourages the flow of CSF fluid to relieve imbalances and disruptions in the body's movements and rhythms. You can learn more about how cranial sacral therapy works here. That Sounds A Lot Like Chakra Work... It is very easy to misinterpret how cranial sacral massage differs from some of its similar counterparts in the therapy world. Therapies like Reiki, chakra work, or other forms of spiritual healing have unique characteristics that make them different from one another, but they all fall into an entirely separate category that makes them stand apart from cranial sacral massage. Cranial Sacral Massage Does Not Work On The Spiritual Body Chakra work focuses on the spiritual body and restoring the balance of energy that flows in and out of each chakra. When a practitioner performs any sort of spiritual healing for a client, they act as a channel for the fundamental energy to flow through. They operate on the principle that the energy they transfer has its own intelligence and will either flow to where it is needed or be discarded. Cranial Sacral Massage Manipulates The Central Nervous System A spiritual healer recognizes the chakra system and works directly with it to cleanse, balance, and strengthen them while a massage therapist performing cranial sacral massage works directly with the central nervous system to restore the body's natural working order. Cranial Sacral Massage Is Rooted In Science Spiritual healing takes its roots from the fundamental life force of the universe while cranial sacral massage is based on anatomy and physiology. Each of these approaches offers a unique experience when a client needs to access the body's ability to self heal. So Which Therapy Is Right For Me? When deciding on a treatment option for yourself, it is an entirely personal decision. You will reap the most benefits from a therapy you understand and an approach you believe in. While skepticism is common when considering many different therapeutic approaches, ultimately, your mind will lead your body and skepticism can ultimately prevent you from receiving the benefits your treatment has to offer.
