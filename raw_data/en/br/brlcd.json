The aim of these reports is to provide a brief toxicological background to the Committees' decisions. Those seeking further information on a particular subject can obtain relevant references from the Committee's administrative secretary or from the internet sites listed below. In common with other independent advisory committees the members are required to follow a Code of Conduct which also gives guidance on how the commercial interests should be declared. Members are required to declare any commercial interests on appointment and, again, during meetings if a topic arises inwhich they have an interest. If a member declares a specific interest in a topic under discussion, he or shemay, at the Chairman's discretion, be allowed to take part in the discussion, but they are excluded from decision making. The Code of Conduct is at Annex 2 and Annex 3 describes the Committees' policy onopenness. Annex 4 contains a glossary of technical terms used in the text. Annex 5 is an alphabetical index tosubjec ts and subst ances consider ed in pr evious reports. Previous publications of the Committees are listed in Annex 6. These three Committees also provide expert advice to other advisory committees, such as the Advisory Commit tee on No vel Foods and Pr ocesses, and ther eare also links with the Veterinary Products Committee and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The Committees procedures for openness include the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed conclusions and st atements. These are published on the internet at the This report contains summaries of the discussions and includes the Committees' published statements in full in or der t ofulfil the oblig ation t opublish st atements both electronically and in hard copy.Annual Report 2005 4About the Committees5Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentThe Committee on Toxicity (COT) evaluates chemicals for their potential to harm human health at the request of the Food Standards Agency, Department of Health and other Government Departments including the Regulatory Authorities. All detailsconcerning membership, agendas, minutes and statements are published on theInternet. In 2005 the Committee has provided advice on a range of chemicals, including tryptophan, furan, kava kava, brominated organic contaminants, food additives anddevelopmental toxicology and a hydrogel filler used in breast implants. Discussions commenced on fluorinated contaminants, marine biotoxins, uranium levels in waterand on CS and PAVA sprays, for completion in 2006. Together with the Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Committee held an interesting workshop on diet and drug interactions. Othergeneric issues discussed included r oute-to-route extrapolation and toxicology of nanomaterials. The Committee currently has two working groups: on the long-term health effects of the Lowermoor incident and on variability and uncertainty in toxicology. Draft reports from both these working groups were discussed b ythe full Committee during the course of 2005. All of this would not have been possible without the dedication and commitment of the extremely able body of exper ts on the Committee, to whom I am very grateful. Also, I would like to acknowledge the suppor tof my Vic e-Chair, Professor Ian Rowland. Finally I would like to add my sincere thanks and appreciation of the work of the administrative and scientific secretariats without whose excellent work the Committee would not be able to function. Professor I A Hughes (Chairman) MA MD FR CP FR organic contaminants: Preliminary discussion on toxicological evaluation 1.1 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has commissioned a number of surveys on brominated organic contaminants. Farmed and wild fish and shellfish consumed in the UK, the 2003 total diet study samplesand fish oil dietary supplement samples have been analysed to determine the concentrations of a number of (PBDDs) andpolybrominated (PBDFs). The COT has previously evaluated PBDEs, HBCD and TBBPA, and was therefore invited to provide preliminary advice on PBDDs, PBDFs and PBBs. In particular, it was asked to consider whether data onvarious c ongeners should be c ombined and if so wha tmethod is most appr opriate. 1.3 On the basis of the available data, the COT agreed that there was sufficient evidence to conclude a similar mechanism of action for the PBDDs, PBDFs been established for the brominated dioxin-like compounds. In particular, there is a lack of information on the rate of clearance in laboratory animals and in humans. However, assuming additivity and applying the TEFs derived for the chlorinated dioxins, furans and dioxin-lik ePCBs w ould be more protective than presuming independence of action. The Committee also confirmed that the total toxic equivalents (TEQs) for the brominated contaminants should be combined with the TEQs for the chlorinated dioxins to provide a measure of the total concentration ofchemicals with dioxin-like properties for the purpose of evaluating the data on dietary exposure. 1.4 The COT will be presented with survey results combined in this manner for consideration at a futur emeeting. Diet and drug interactions 1.5 As reported in the 2004 Annual Report, the COT and the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) held a joint open meeting in February 2005 to discuss the issue of diet-drug interaction. 1.6 Interaction between different drugs is a well-established phenomenon. There are also several well- characterised int eractions between drugs and foods such as those between grapefruit juice and drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, but the overall extent of diet and drug interaction is uncertain. 1.7 The meeting provided a useful forum for discussion, there were brief presentations on the epidemiology and the mechanisms of interactions, practical aspects of managing interactions, the potential vulnerable groups and how interactions are assessed in a regulatory framework. The particular issues associ ated with herbal medicines and with obesity were also considered. 7COT evaluations1.8 The COT and CSM noted that the clinical significance of diet-drug interactions was variable, and many interactions had only been demonstrated experimentally. Food itself was a complex mixture of macro and micronutrients making interactions hard to assess. Overall, the COT and CSM concluded that theissue of diet-drug interactions was a real one but of limited clinical significance. However, there werefew data and further interactions might be identified in the future. 1.9 The COT statement is included at the end of this report. Food additives and developmental toxicology 1.10 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been asked to review the food additives currently permitted within the EU in order to determine whether full re-evaluation is required. The COT has beeninvited to contribute to the re-evaluation process, with a particular focus on neurotoxicity, becausetherehave been recent developments in the toxicological approaches in this area. 1.11 The COT reviewed the animal toxicology data on twelve additives. These had previously been evaluated by the Joint FAO /WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Ho wever, a number of the evaluations were conducted more than 20 years ago. The COT was asked to consider whether the potential for neurotoxicity and developmental effects was taken into account in setting the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for certain food additives and whether significant ne wdataof relevancetoneurodevelopmental effects had emerged since the ADI was set. 1.12 The additives considered were quinoline yellow and saccharin (E954). 1.13 The COT concluded that there was no evidence of potential developmental neurotoxicity for Acesulfame K, brilliant blue, indigo carmine, saccharin, sodium benzoate or sulphur dioxide. There was some equivocal evidence suggesting the potential to produce developmental neurotoxicity at very high dose l evels for carmoisine, sunset yellow and quinoline yellow. There was actual evidence suggesting the po tential to produce developmental neurotoxicity at very high doses for aspartame, monosodium glutamate and Ponceau 4R. For no agents was there any evidence suggesting the potential for development al neur otoxicity at current acceptable daily intakes. Therefore, although direct evaluations of de velopment al neur otoxicity were mostly absent and would, in principle, be desirable, the available data did not suggest that further investigations of any of these agents would be a priority given current dietary levels. 1.14 The COT statement is included at the end of this report. Furan in food 1.15 In February 2005, the COT was asked to consider a report from the EFSA expert panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM) on furan in food. Furan is carcinogenic in animal models, although themechanism of furan carcinogenicity has not yet been fully elucidated with both genotoxic and non-genotoxic mechanisms proposed.Annual Report 2005 81.16 The COT considered that a systematic mode of action assessment would be appropriate but requested further advice on the existing evidence for genotoxicity from COM and carcinogenicity from COC, and any needs for further research in these areas. The COM and COC discussions on furan are included inparagraphs 2.9 to 2.14 and 3.10 to 3.15 of this report, respectively. 1.17 The COT will consider the conclusions from COM and COC in 2006 and further research requirements in light of a European Union research call in December 2005. Hydrogel filler for breast implants: Further studies 1.18 The COT had previously considered data to assess the safety of hydrogel implants in 1999, 2000 and 2002 and was asked by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to commenton two new studies that had been sponsored by the company producing the Hydrogel implants. 1.19 COT had previously reviewed data from two 90-day rat implantation studies which were considered unsatisfactory in design, execution and reporting, and was not able to exclude the possibility that the reported lesions were indicative of a toxic or immunologically-mediated response. These lesionswarranted further study, including investigation of the reversibility of any changes observed. 1.20 The manuf acturer had now submitted reports of a one-year toxicity and a two-year carcinogenicity study in r ats tha thad been exposed t othe hy drogel subcutaneously. The COT concluded that the results of these two studies provided reassurance that the effects previously noted in the liver, kidney and lymph nodes were not indicative of a toxic effect. Marginal effects seen in the kidney in the newstudies were considered to be treatment related but were not clearly adverse. Taking account of the susceptibilit yof older r ats to kidney effects, especially in longer studies, the COT considered that similar effects would be unlikely to occur in humans. 1.21 The COT statement is included at the end of this report. Kavakava in food products 1.22 Kava-kava, also known as kava, is an herbal ingredient derived from the plant Piper methysticum ,a member of the pepper f amily ,which is na tivetomany P acific islands. The leaves and root of the plant are used in herbal preparations that are available as tablets, capsules, tinctures and drops. These products are largely considered medicinal, however some products are sold as foods such as teas. 1.23 The c onsump tion of kava-kava has been associated with liver toxicity following a number of case reports that came mostly from Germany. In 1992, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) decided thatsteps should be t aken toprohibit the use of kava-kava in unlicensed medicines other than for external use. A number of food products also contained kava-kava, and due to time constraints, urgentadvice was requested of the COT. The risk assessment conducted at that time is in the COT annualreport from 2002. 91.24 In 2002 the kava-kava in Food (England) Regulations were laid before parliament. At the time the FSA stressed its commitment to reviewing any new evidence that came to light in order to reassess the ban on kava-kava. In February 2005, the FSA consulted with stakeholders to assess whether any furtherinformation had emerged on kava-kava. The COT was invited to consider whether the new informationaltered its previous conclusions. 1.25 The COT considered that the new data were not sufficient to demonstrate the safety of food products containing kava-kava particularly considering the severe nature of the hepatotoxicity linked with kava-kava consumption. It was also agreed that, because the hepatotoxicity appeared to be an idiosyncratic reaction, it would be extremely difficult to predict or to propose a suitable animal model. The newstudies on metabolism did not help to identify a mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Reports ofhepatotoxicity were still occurring, including cases related to traditional kava-kava preparations. Concernwas also expr essed about the lack of c ontrols o ver production of food such as the extraction method and the parts of the plant used in the extracts. 1.26 Overall, members concluded that the new data did not warrant a change in their previous advice. More informa tion w ould be needed on the mechanism of hepa totoxicity before it would be possible to propose further research to establish a safe usage of kava-kava in foods. Terephthalic acid: multigeneration reproduction study additional histopathological examinations 1.27 Terephthalic acid (TPA) is used as a starting material in the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which ma ybe used to manufacture food cans and beverage bottles. In 2000 the Committee reviewed the health implications of the results of a survey of TPA migration from can coatings into food and r ecommended that appropriate studies should be carried out to determine whether TPA possesses endocrine disrup ter activity. 1.28 In June 2003, BP Chemicals Ltd submitted the report of a full multigeneration reproduction toxicity study on TPA. The information provided in the report was sufficient to demonstrate that TPA did nothave endocrine disrupting effects at the highest dose tested in this study. However, a number of histopathological changes in the urinary bladder and the kidney were reported at the high dose, but these or gans had not been examined in the other groups. The company was asked to provide further information on the histopathology of these organs in the mid- and low-dose groups. 1.29 A new histopathology evaluation along with an expert report was submitted by BP Chemicals Ltd in 2005. The C OTwas sa tisfied tha tthe additional hist opathological da ta indicated a clear no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for histopathological changes in the urinary bladder and kidney (renal papillary necrosis) of 5000 ppm in the diet in the multigeneration study. It was noted that some effects on the thymus had also been observed in this study however these were considered artefacts associ ated with the necropsy technique used rather than being treatment related. 1.30Astatistical ly significant decrease in renal weights (adjusted for bodyweight) was present in all generations. Because this was also present in the parental generation, it was not viewed as adevelopmental effect. There was no associated histopathology or effect on renal function, and thiseffect was not observed in a chronic toxicity study using a different rat strain. The relevance of theAnnual Report 2005 10reduction in renal weights was considered by applying agreed criteria from the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) for distinguishing between adverse and adaptive effects. The COT concluded that the reduction in kidney weight in these rats was likely to represent acolony specific physiological adaptation to exposure to terephthalic acid TPA. 1.31 Additional mutagenicity data on TPA had previously been requested by the Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and will need to be evaluated by the COM before a statement can be produced. Tryptophan in food: responses to consultation on revision of the Regulations 1.32 In 1990 the COT endorsed a ban on the addition of the isolated amino acid tryptophan to foods (including dietary supplements) in the UK. This followed reports of a new epidemic illness in the USA,known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) which was associated with the consumption of L-tryptophan-containing dietary supplements. EMS was a serious disorder which affected 1500 people in the USA and caused at least 37 deaths. Several cases of EMS also occurred in the UK. 1.33 In 2003-2004 the COT considered the available data on tryptophan and EMS and concluded that the balanc eofthe da ta linked EMS to a contaminated batch of tryptophan made by one manufacturer. However it could not be completely ruled out that the apparent epidemic may have been due to the increased use of tryptophan as a supplement and awareness of EMS as a condition. 1.34 Data from a monitoring scheme, established in 1994 for a prescription tryptophan product provided reassurance that medicinal tryptophan produced to European Pharmacopoeia standards had notresulted in cases of EMS. Due to the remaining uncertainties, the COT applied an uncertainty factor of 10 tothemean ther apeutic dose of 2228 mg try ptophan /day,adose which w as no tassociated with any adverse effects, and concluded that a dose of 220 mg tryptophan per day would not present a risk to health, provided that it met the purity criteria specified in the European Pharmacopoeia. 1.35 The COT advice was reflected in a proposed revision to the Tryptophan in Food (England) Regulations 1990, which w ere consulted upon in early 2005. The responses received were considered by the COT. Inaddition, the C OT considered a number of additional studies of tryptophan in humans (mainly pre-dating the EMS epidemic) as well as updated data on adverse reactions to medicinal tryptophan. 1.36 The COT noted that the additional human studies involved small numbers of participants, took place over short duration's and were conducted to assess the effects of tryptophan on a variety of therapeutic endpoints. The side effects, where reported, were generally self reported rather than specifically assessed. The COT concluded that, overall, there were insufficient new data to reconsidertheir 2004 conclusion. 1.37 The COT agreed that an amendment should be made to the 2004 conclusions to state that the mean therapeutic dose was \"without adverse effects\" so that it was clear that it represented a NOAEL. 11Urgent advice provided by COT Mutagenicity of para red 1.38 The Food Standards Agency was informed on 20 April that some batches of spice used by one manufacturer contained an azo dye, para red, which is not a permitted colour under the Colours in Food Regulations 1995. 1.39 Para red is chemically very similar to Sudan 1. The Agency consulted the Chairs of the COC and COM who advised that, although there were very limited data available it would be prudent to assume thatpara red could be a genotoxic carcinogen. 1.40 A copy of the agreed opinion was provided to COT for information and is included at the end of this report. Committ ee pr ocedures and working groups Horizon scanning 1.41 At the February 2005 meeting, members were provided with information on planned discussion items for the y ear, and invited to comment on emerging issues that might also need to be addressed. 1.42 It was considered appropriate for the COT statement on adverse trends in the development of the male reproductive system to be reviewed in the light of emerging data. A one-day meeting was subsequently planned for February 2006 to allow the COT to discuss new data with experts in the field. 1.43 The Department of Health was interested in seeking the Committee's view on specific aspects of odour perception and health risks due to airborne chemicals, in particular that resulting from bystander exposure to pesticide mixtures. A brief overview of incidents reviewed by the Pesticides Incidents Appr aisal P anel (PIAP) betw een 1990 and 2002 sho wed tha tappr oximately one third of reported incidents considered \"confirmed and likely\" involved skin and /or eye irritancy. Possible mechanisms for reported effects were chemosensory stimulation or inflammation, or a psychogenic response. It was anticipated that the COT would be asked to provide advice based on a literature review, which would assist in fur ther evaluation and identifying possible research in this area. It was suggested that data on organic solvents should be included. Certain organic solvents had been shown to have an additive effectin causing nar cosis, and this might also occur for chemosensory irritation. 1.44 It was noted that advice on reducing intake of sodium chloride might lead to increased use of salt substitutes containing potassium chloride, both in the home and in processed foods. Excessive intakesof potassium lead to hyperkalaemia, which results in adverse effects including altered acid-base balanceand altered respiratory and heart rates and may result in cardiac arrest. However, it was not clear whatintakes of potassium were required to overwhelm homeostatic mechanisms and lead to hyperkalaemia. Peopl ewith decr eased renal function, including the elderly, would be expected to be more vulnerable to hyperkalaemia, as would people taking a number of medications which predispose to hyperkalaemia.Annual Report 2005 12Consideration of high potassium intakes, leading to altered sodium /potassium balance might require additional types of expertise. 1.45 Processes such as chlorination and ozonation are used by the food industry to reduce the risk of microbial contamination in pre-packed foods. Current legislation specifies limits for chlorine residues but there may also be a concern about potential generation of by-products of chlorination or ozonation on or in the food. It was agreed that before any risk assessment could be undertaken there was a need for information on the nature and levels of the by-products that were formed. It was likely that by-products would include trihalomethanes, and it would be important to obtain information on the contribution of treated processed foods to total trihalomethane exposure. 1.46 RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional mechanism of blocking or \"silencing\" of genes in order to test gene function. Since it was first demonstrated in 1998 in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fire et al ., Nature 391: 806-811; 1998) it has been headlined as a technique that will speed up research in many fieldsand has significant potential as a tool in toxicological risk assessment. RNAi technology was rapidlybeing incorporated into experimental protocols and was being used in toxicology as an analytical tool. The C OTagreed tha tan educa tional seminar w ould be useful, and this w as subsequently arranged (see paragraphs 1.67-1.72). 1.47 Some pilots and cabin crews have claimed to be suffering from a disabling illness, from 'fume events' in the aircraft cabin. Organophosphates, which are used as additives in aircraft engine oil and auxiliarypower unit (APU) oils, may transfer into some aircraft cabin air ventilation systems during 'fume events'. The Department of Health had asked the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) to provide theinformation they have available on ill health among pilots and cabin crew. This information would beconsider ed by the Aviation Health Working Group (AHWG), and if the AHWG considers there is sufficient inf orma tion, the Depar tment of Health would commission a COT review. 1.48 Potential thyrotoxicants that do not produce frank hypothyroidism may have subtle effects on thyroid function, which could have irreversible effects on brain development. The Department of Health was toconsider whether COT advice should be sought on this issue. 1.49 In addition a member suggested that consideration of exposure of the central nervous system (CNS) to chemicals vi ainhala tion be c onsider ed. The nasal cavity was noted to increase bioavailability to the CNS.Members also sugg ested tha tthe C OT could re-examine some of the assumptions it makes, such as concepts of threshold and low dose effects. It was noted that a number of initiatives of the International Pr ogramme on Chemical Saf ety(IPCS) and EFSA w ereof relevance to this, and would be provided to members. 1.50 Members w erereminded that they may draw additional issues to the attention of the Secretariat at any time. 13Working group on Variability and Uncertainty in Toxicology 1.51 In 2003, the COT established a working group chaired by Professor Peter Aggett to review the approaches that are currently used, or that might in future be used, for dealing with variability anduncertainty in the biological data utilised in the risk assessment of chemicals in food. 1.52 The COT considered a preliminary draft report of the working group at its October 2005 meeting. The working group subsequently met in December 2005 to discuss revisions, and a draft report will bepublished for consultation early in 2006. Lowermoor subgroup 1.53 The Lowermoor subgroup was established in 2001 under the chairmanship of Professor Frank Woods to consider the human health effects of the chemical exposure resulting from a water pollution incident which occurred in July 1988 in North Cornwall published a draft report on January 26, 2005. Its terms ofreference were: -toadvise on whether the chemicals involved in the incident caused, or were likely to cause, delayed or persistent harm to health. - to advise whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the health effects of the incident should be augment ed and, if so ,to make recommendations. 1.54 The COT discussed the draft report during a public consultation which ended on 20 May 2005. The main conclusion was that the chemicals involved in the incident were unlikely to have led to delayed orpersistent adverse health effects in the population. However, the report recommended further investig ations t oexplor ethe neuropsychological status of those individuals who consumed the contaminated water and investigations into the cognitive, behavioural and intellectual development of individuals who were less than a year old at the time of the incident. Three of the polluting metals (lead, manganese and aluminium) are known neurotoxicants. 1.55 The Subgroup is currently finalising the revised report in the light of the public consultation. Risk assessment strategies Food Standards Agency Draft Science Strategy 2005-2010 1.56 The F ood St andar ds Ag encyDraftScience Strategy 2005-10 was issued for public consultation in June 2005. The document considered the science needed to support the Agency's needs over the next five years and how the Strategy's aims would be achieved. The COT was asked to comment on the draft andin particular on the sections relating to obtaining and interpreting scientific evidence which includework of scientific advisor committees such as COT.Annual Report 2005 141.57 The COT noted that better integration of FSA science strategy with that of other government departments might be beneficial and reduce duplication. It was suggested that the Strategy was too focused on Agency structure, interests and committees rather than considering objective analysis ofareas of uncertainty relating to food safety. 1.58 The COT also emphasised the need for better and more pro-active communication of the scientific rationale for the FSA's actions and decisions and a more pro-active approach to the communication of the results of FSA funded research. Interdepartmental Group on the Health Risk of Chemicals (IGHRC) report: Guidelines on route-to-route extrapolation of toxicity data when assessing health risks of chemicals 1.59 The Interdepartmental Group on Health Risks from Chemicals (IGHRC) is an informal group of representatives of UK government departments, agencies and research councils. Its aims include the production of guidance documents for non-specialist government officials or regulators. The COT hadpreviously commented on IGHRC guidance documents on uncertainty factors (2001) and exposureassessment (2003 ) *. 1.60 The document aims to provide best practice for assessing the toxicity of a chemical when the only available data are for exposure by a different route to that being investigated. The most common scenario is the use of or al exposur edatafor risk assessment of dermal or inhal ed exposur e. It sets out essential criteria for deciding to use route-to-route extrapolation and stresses the need for a case by case assessment f or individual chemicals and the need to apply expert judgement. 1.61 The C OTnoted that route-to-route extrapolation is being encouraged in several areas, especially for providing data for the EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) proposal http: //europa.eu.int /comm /environment /chemicals /pdf /0188_en.pdf. The major disadvantage of this approach is that the rule base for route-to-route extrapolation is very strict. The COT made a number of suggestions for changes and additions to the document, including an outline of when route-to-routeextrapolation should be used, the dependence on level of exposure, information on physiologically- based pharmacokinetic modelling, and exposure via the lung and demal route. The difficulty of route- to-route extrapolation for sensitisation of the immune system was noted. terial t oxicology 1.62The risk assessment identified yCOT /COC /COMas an ar ea of int erest during horizon scanning discussions in February 2004. In September 2004, the COT discussed the report by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering 'Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties'. The UK Government's response to this report, published in February 2005, identified the C OT, COC and COM as relevant scientific committees to provide advice on the development of nanotechnology. 15*Uncertainty factors: their use in human health risk assessment by UK government (IGHRC, 2003) and Guidelines for good exposure assessment practice for human health effects of chemicals (IGHRC, 2004) are available on the IGHRC website at http:// www .silsoe.cranfield.ac.uk/ieh/ighrc/igpublications.html1.63 Nanomaterials were defined as having one dimension less than 100 nanometres (nm) or 0.1 micrometre (/H9262m). Their small size means that a high proportion of total atoms are at the surface of the nanoparticle causing high surface reactivity. It is not known whether this results in nanomaterials having differenttoxicological characteristics to the corresponding bulk material. 1.64 The information presented to the Committees was based on a hazard assessment document published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) with additional papers and abstracts identified by the secretariat. There were considerable limitations in the number of materials tested, and in the toxicologydata available. COT concluded that the current data available did not suggest the need for a new risk assessment paradigm for nanotechnology products. However, it was considered necessary to keep awatching brief of this developing area. 1.65 The Committees suggested a systematic tiered approach to initial toxicological studies, generating basic hazar didentification data on nanomaterials, based on in vitr oscreening of selected materials followed by in vivo testing. 1.66 The joint COT /COC /COM statement is included at the end of this report. RNA Int erference 1.67In response t othe horiz on scanning discussion noted above at paragraph 1.46, Dr Miguel Martins of the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester gave a presentation to the COT on RNA interference (RNAi) technology. 1.68 The presentation included an explanation of the general principles of RNAi, and examples of its utility as a research tool. These included silencing specific genes in order to find out their role in a particularbiological pathway or disease and the use of RNAi libraries to screen for candidate genes that may be involved in a biological process of interest. 1.69The issue of specificit yof gene silencing with RNAi was raised. In studies where a transfected gene is being t argeted, the endogenous gene may also be affected if it contains a homologous target sequence. In addition, where silencing of non-target genes is seen, it is possible that this may have been mediated byendog enous micr oRNAs miRNAs bind mRNA with sequences that are often significantly, though not completely, complementary to the miRNA. 1.70RNAi was reported as achieving up to 90% knockdown of protein expression. It was noted that it is not possible to determine whether 90% knockdown is achieved in 100% of cells, or if 100% knockdown is achie ved in 9 out of 10 c ells. In some situa tions, 100% knockdown may be required in order to see significant effects and in such cases, RNAi would not be as effective as gene knockout by homologousrecombination techniques. 1.71 Questions were raised as to the duration of knockdown that can be achieved by RNAi. Lentiviral and retroviral vectors are integrated into the genome and should enable stable knockdown of genes, butthese v ectors are mutagenic. Transfection of short synthetic double stranded RNA (siRNA)Annual Report 2005 16oligonucleotides is currently the preferred method, although they only produce a transient response in vitro as they are diluted by cell division. 1.72 The difficulty of targeting specific cell populations in vivo and the possibility of long-term adverse effects were also noted. Adverse effects are most likely to occur with viral vectors, due to their mutagenic properties. In contrast, siRNA oligonucleotides are not mutagenic as they target mRNA. While they have been shown to have epigenetic effects in fungi and plants, there is no evidence for such effects in mammalian cells. Ongoing work 2-Chlorobenzylidene malonitrile (CS) and PAVA (Nonivamide) sprays: combined Home Offic eScienc eDevelopment Branch (HOSDB) the COT discussed potential effects of exposure to both 2-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile (CS) and pelargonic acid vanillylamide (PAVA). This item will be completed early in 2006. Marine biot oxins 1.74 In December 2005, COT commenced discussion on the risk assessment and monitoring of marine biotoxins in support of public health. The discussions will continue in 2006. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 1.75 The Food Standards Agency has commissioned research to determine the concentrations of a number of fluorochemicals in food following unexpected bioaccumulation and toxicological findings for these substances. The COT was invited to assess the toxicology of two perfluoroalkyl acids in order to advise on any health implica tions in adv anceof receiving the results of the analysis. 1.76Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has excellent surfactant properties and is widely used in the manufacture of plastics, electronics, textile and consumer material in the apparel, leather, and upholstery industries. A number of other compounds have the potential to degrade subsequently to PFOS either metabolically or through environmental processes. 1.77 A hazard assessment for PFOS has been produced under the Existing Chemicals Programme of the Organisa tion f or Ec onomic C o-operation and Development (OECD). Given the widespread occurrence of PFOS the OECD evaluation recommended that national or regional exposure information gathering and risk assessment may need to be considered. Consequently the Environment Agency for England and Wales concluded that PFOS meets the criteria for classification as a Persistent, Bioaccumulative andToxic (PBT) substance. 1.78COMand COC concluded that PFOS should be regarded as not mutagenic and that a threshold approach could be used for the risk assessment. The COT opinion will be finalised in 2006. 17Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 1.79 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is primarily used as an emulsifier in industrial applications, for example in the production of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). PFOA may also be found atlow levels in some fluorotelomers, as an unintended by-product of the manufacturing process. Fluorotelomer derivatives are ingredients of fire-fighting foams and coatings, and are intermediates inthe manufacture of stain-, oil-, and water-resistant additives for some textiles, coatings and food contact papers. 1.80 PFOA has not been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) or the Joint FAO /WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recentlysubmitted a draft risk assessment of the potential human health effects associated with exposure toPFOAand its salts t othe EP COC concluded that, overall, PFOA was not mutagenic and that a threshold approach to establishing a tolerable intake was appropriate. The COT opinion will be finalised in 2006. Uranium le vels in water used to re-constitute infant formula 1.82 Uranium is a metallic element that is ubiquitous in the environment occurring in rocks, soil, air, food and water.Wher epresent in w ater, this tends to be the major source of uranium intake. Due to dissolution from mineral deposits, notably granite, ground waters contain higher levels of uranium than surface waters, although the level will vary considerably depending on the local geology. 1.83 Uranium is kno wn tobe nephrotoxic in both animals and humans producing characteristic damage to the proximal tubules of the kidney, following high levels of exposure. 1.84 The WHO has established a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) and a guideline value for uranium in drinking water of 15 /H9262g/L. The Committee were asked to comment on the potential health implications for infants consuming formula milk made up with water containing uranium at this guideline level. 1.85 The discussion will be completed in 2006.Annual Report 2005 18Statements of the COT Phosphate and the calcium-parathyroid hormone axis Introduction 1. Phosphorus was one of the nutrients considered in the recent report of the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM, 2003). The review relates to phosphorus compounds, primarily phosphates, expressed as elemental phosphorus to allow comparison of exposures to different compounds. There were insufficient data to establish a Safe Upper Level but a guidance level of 250 mg /daysupplemental phosphorus was established, in addition to the estimated maximum intake of phosphorus from food of 2110 mg /day.The guidance level took into account both the occurrence of osmotic diarrhoea in human volunt eer studies and the possibl eadverse effects of phosphorus on the parathyroid hormone-calcium axis in subjects with hypovitaminosis D who would be vulnerable to the effects of hyperparathyroidism. The guidance level represents a supplemental intake which would not be expected to result in anyadverse effects. The EVM noted that physiological changes in calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH)levels have been associated with intakes of 1500 mg /day and above of supplemental phosphorus. An uncertaintyfactor of 3 was then applied to a NOAEL of 750 mg /day(Brixen et al ., 1992) inter-individual v in a guidanc elevel of 250 mg /dayphosphorus. 2. In the interests of maintaining choice and promoting consumer understanding, the Food Standards Agency is working with manufacturers to develop a labelling initiative, which would allow higher amounts of phosphorus (as phosphate) to be present in food supplements than those recommended bythe EVM provided that appropriate advisory statements were also included. 3. The COT was asked to consider data on phosphate, PTH, calcium balance and bone health in detail, in order to allow the FSA to formulate the appropriate consumer advice. This review included new data which were not available to the EVM. Background 4. Phosphorus is a non-metallic, group V element. It is most commonly found in its pentavalent form in combination with oxygen as phosphate (PO 43-). 5. Phosphorus is present in a wide variety of foods largely as phosphate. Particularly rich sources are red meats, dairy products, fish, poultry, bread and other cereal products. Food additives are also a significant sour ceof phosphate (Calvo and Park, 1996). Phosphorus intakes in the UK in 2000 were estimated to be 1494 (mean) and 2381 (high level) mg /day in men and 1112 (mean) and 1763 (high level) mg /dayin women (Henderson et al ., 2003 ). These int akes had incr eased sinc ethe previous survey in 1986 /6(Gregory et al ., 1990). 196. Food supplements provide doses of up to 1100 mg /day phosphorus (EVM, 2003), though 150 mg or less is more common (OTC, 2003). Tablet forms of supplement products may also contain calciumphosphates as fillers or diluents. It has been suggested that these could represent a dose of up to 250 mg phosphorus per day (personal communication, Proprietary Association of Great Britain). Thephosphate may not be declared on the label as an active ingredient. 7. The solubility of the inorganic phosphate salts used in supplements is variable. Calcium phosphate is soluble at acid pH but much less soluble in neutral conditions (Carr and Shangraw, 1987), suggesting thatit would be soluble in the stomach but less so in the small intestine. Salts such as sodium and potassium phosphate are much more soluble at neutral pH. Phosphate: Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 8. Phosphate is readily absorbed throughout the small intestine (Koo and Tsang, 1997). The majority of phosphate absorption occurs via passive diffusion but active transport, dependent on potassium andcalcium ions, sodium-potassium ATPase and vitamin D, also occurs. Active transport of phosphate is regula ted byPTH which pr omo tes calcium absorption via increased synthesis of calcitriol. However, even at low levels of calcitriol, substantial phosphate absorption occurs, such that dietary phosphate content is the most important determinant of phosphate absorption. To some extent, the degree ofphospha teabsorption varies with need, being 90% in infants fed human milk with low phosphate levels and 60-70% in adults consuming a normal diet, but it is essentially linear over the normal physiological range (Lemann, 1996). 9. Soluble phosphates from meat or milk are almost completely absorbed, whereas the phosphate present as phy tate in certain vegetable fibres may not be (Koo and Tsang, 1997). Phosphate absorption is affected by calcium, with an insoluble calcium phosphate precipitate being formed in the intestine (Calvo and Heath, 1988; Calvo and Park, 1996). However it is likely that excess calcium affects phosphate absorp tion r ather than phospha teaffecting calcium absorption (IOM, 1996). 10. Phosphorus compounds are important constituents of body tissues, with over 85% being contained in the skeleton (Ilich and Kerstetter, 2000). The quantities present in intracellular pools are small, but they are critical to many aspects of cell structure and function, being present in phospholipids, nucleic acidsand the phosphoproteins required for mitochondrial function (Stoff, 1982). Phosphate is involved in the regula tion of the int ermediary metabolism of proteins, fats and particularly carbohydrates and may regulate a number of enzymatic reactions. Phosphate is also the source of the high energy bonds of ATP. 11. Phosphate is largely excreted in the urine. Plasma phosphate levels are maintained via phosphate reabsorption in the kidney by a sodium dependent active transporter. This is achieved both by a PTH dependent mechanism and by a second mechanism mediated by soluble factors or \"phosphatonins\" . The latter pathway has not yet been fully characterised and the significance of it with respect to normal phosphate levels is unclear (Jan de Beur and Levine, 2002). There are few data on the effect of highphospha televels on phosphatonins so the effect of dietary increase on this aspect of phosphate regula tion is uncl ear.Annual Report 2005 20Bone metabolism 12. Bone is an active tissue which undergoes a continual cycle of resorption and renewal via osteoclasts and osteoblasts respectively (COMA, 1998). When resorption exceeds renewal, loss of bone mass occurse.g. osteoporosis. Calcium is extracted from bones by osteoclasts and laid down by osteoblasts in response to changes in serum calcium levels. This process is mediated by PTH and vitamin D. Effects of high phosphate intakes on the calcium-PTH axis and markers of bone health 13. As noted previously, calcium and phosphate are thought to form an insoluble precipitate in the intestine reducing absorption. However, the data suggest that calcium is more likely to reduce phosphateabsorption than vice versa, and that the reduction of calcium absorption by phosphate would besignificant only wher ecalcium l evels w erevery low (IOM, 1997). 14. At high dietary intake, phosphate is also thought to react with calcium to form an insoluble complex in the plasma, thus reducing free (ionised) calcium levels. It has been argued that the resulting decrease inserum calcium causes an incr ease in PTH secr etion and thus in the subsequent r esorp tion in calcium from bone to maintain plasma calcium homeostasis. The increased PTH stimulates the synthesis of calcitriol ( 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D) via the renal enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which then promotes calcium absorp tion fr om the gut. PTH secr etion is then subject to feedback regulation by calcitriol and calcium. Phosphate may also have a direct effect on PTH at a post-transcriptional level, possibly by stabilising the PTH mRNA. The effects of high phosphate are difficult to distinguish from the effects of lowcalcium per s esincethis would also trigger increased levels of PTH. 15. Although increased PTH would be expected to increase bone resorption to release calcium, intermittent PTH tr eatment is used therapeutically to prevent osteoporotic bone loss and to stimulate bone formation. The mechanism for this paradoxical effect is unclear, but may involve the uncoupling of bone resorp tion and bone f orma tion. PTH infusion has been shown to increase the number of collagen cross- links and it has been suggested that it may stimulate the activity and differentiation of osteoblast progenitors. Similarly, phosphate is used therapeutically to lower serum calcium and to \"activate\" bone remodelling; bone resorption is then stopped pharmacologically, so mineralisation without resorption occurs. The relationship between PTH and phosphate is complex and may be different in acutecompared to chronic exposure. 16. It has however been argued that high phosphate levels may not have adverse effects on bone if calcium intakes are adequate, or until the Ca:P ratio becomes very low (IOM, 1996). 17. The data from human volunteer studies are conflicting. In acute human studies, single doses of 1-1.5 g phosphorus (as phosphates) result in changes in PTH, serum and urinary calcium and phosphate levels, but mor especific markers of bone resorption such as deoxypyridilone and carboxy terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen are generally unaffected. Markers indicating bone formation have been reported todecrease. 2118. Repeat dose human studies, generally using phosphate supplements at doses of 1-3g /day or manipulating dietary phosphate content to a similar extent, have resulted in a variety of effects. Thesehave included increased levels of PTH and related markers and decreased urinary calcium levels. However, specific bone resorption markers were generally unchanged; this may indicate that the studiesconcerned were not of a sufficient duration for adverse effects to be apparent (lasting generally 1 week to 1 month in contrast to the calcium resorption /deposition cycle in bone which takes 4-8 months) or that the changes were small changes reflecting calcium homeostasis. In 7 post-menopausal women taking 1g phosphorus /day as phosphate for up to 15 months, calcium balance was \"improved\" (Goldsmith et al ., 1976). Similarly in a 4 month study by Heaney and Recker (1987) urinary calcium was decreased and ther ewas no evidence of bone remodelling in 8 female volunteers given 1.1 g /daysupplemental phosphorus. However neither of these studies looked at specific markers of bone formation or resorption. 19. It has also been noted that some human studies may not detect changes in PTH because of the sampling procedures used (frequently in the morning after an overnight fast) (Calvo and Park, 1996). PTH has a str ong diurnal rhythm, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening. This rhythm can be altered by dietary manipulation. Effects of high phosphorus intakes on bone health in vivo . 20. Epidemiological studies of subjects exposed to high dietary phosphate levels are conflicting. In some studies, high phosphate levels have been associated with increased fracture risk, while this is not apparent in other studies. Calcium intakes are low in the majority of the studies and it has been arguedthat the association of fracture risk may be with low calcium consumption or low calcium:phosphate ratio rather than high phosphorus per se . 21. Where studies have specifically investigated the effects of beverages containing the acidulant phosphoric acid on indica tors of bone health such as bone miner al densit yor fracture risk, the results are also conflicting. Rather than phosphate having a direct effect on bone, it has been suggested that intake of such beverages is a surrogate for physical activity which increases beverage consumption for rehydration purposes (Wyshak et al ., 1989), and increases risk of fracture due to enhanced activity (Petridou et al ., 1997). Phosphate containing beverages may also displace milk in the diet, reducing calcium intake (McGartland et al ., 2003). Other possibilities suggested have been that it is the caffeine, which increases calcium excretion (Heaney and Rafferty, 2001), rather than the phosphate content that maybe ha ving an effect on bone health (Garcia-Contreras et al ., 2000).Annual Report 2005 2222. In animal studies, increased phosphate or decreased Ca:P ratios have resulted in marked bone loss in a number of species; soft tissue calcification, particularly in the kidney, has also been observed. These studies have used doses of up to 3 g /day supplemental phosphate in dogs or up to 1.2% dietary phosphorus in mice. However, studies in primates have much less marked effects at comparablephosphate intakes and it has been argued that they may be a better model for humans than other laboratory species (Anderson et al ., 1977). Minor osteoporotic changes have been observed microscopically in baboons given a diet with Ca:P ratios of 1:4 and 1:2.1, similar to that of the human diet (Pettifor et al ., 1984). Where calcium concentrations have been increased, the effects of phosphate are partially offset and the bone loss induced by high phosphate and /or low calcium can be reversed by reducing phosphate and /or increasing calcium. It has been argued that the Ca: P ratio of animal diets is lower than that of human diets, making animals more susceptible to metastatic calcium and otheradverse effects (IOM, 1996). Discussion 23. The effects of high phosphate levels are difficult to distinguish from those of low calcium. However, the appropriate level of calcium in the diet is also unclear, with conflicting results obtained from bothmetabolic balance studies in human volunteers and epidemiological investigations (Kanis, 1994). 24. Many of the chang es resulting from phosphate treatment appear to represent homeostatic mechanisms to maintain plasma calcium levels. However, as indicated in the animal studies, very high levels of phospha te or low Ca:P ratios can result in significant adverse effects on bone. Conclusions 25. The Exper tGroup on Vitamins and Minerals was asked to advise on a level of phosphate supplementation that would not be expected to result in any type of adverse effect. Since the data wereinadequa teto establish a robust Safe Upper Level, a guidance level was established by applying appropriate uncertainty factors to the limited data available. 26. Numerous studies have shown that phosphate loads result in an increase in PTH levels and changes in plasma calcium l evels. The EVM concluded that phosphorus could result in adverse effects on the parathyroid hormone-calcium axis and that subjects with hypovitaminosis D could be particularly vulner abletohyperparathyroidism. The EVM noted that physiological changes in calcium and PTH levels were associated with intakes of 1500 mg /day and above supplemental phosphorus. An uncertainty factor of 3 was applied to a NAOEL of 750 mg /day to allow for inter-individual variability resulting in a guidance level of 250 mg /day supplemental phosphorus. In addition, this level would not be expected to result in adverse gastrointestinal effects. 2327. We were asked to consider the relationship of phosphate intake and bone health in detail, and to advise on the levels of phosphate intake that might be associated with adverse effects on bone. Our consideration included new data on epidemiology and on the regulation of serum phosphate that werenot available to the EVM. In the light of this we conclude that the elevated PTH levels associated with supplemental phosphorus intakes reflect a short term adjustment to maintain plasma calcium levels and do not necessarily represent an adverse effect of phosphate on bone health. The long term effects onbone health of elevated PTH resulting from high phosphate intakes are unknown. 28. Low calcium and vitamin D intakes are known to have adverse effects on bone health since calcium in bone is resorbed to maintain serum calcium levels. It is possible that high phosphate intakes mayexacerbate such effects but this is uncertain. 29. Inorganic phosphate salts have different physiological properties. It is likely that salts such as di and tri calcium phospha tes, which are less soluble and also provides a source of calcium, would be of less concern with regard to adverse effects on bone.

There are also a small number of well-characterised examples of interactions between food and drugs, but the extent and significanceof diet and drug interaction is unclear. 2 The COT and the Committee on the Safety of Medicines a(CSM) held a joint meeting on the 2nd February 2005 to consider the issue of interactions between drugs and the diet. A range of topics covering many aspects of the subjects was considered. Information from the talks and subsequent discussions is summarised in the following statement. Background 3. Interactions between different drugs may occur as a result of previous exposure or concomitant use. Interactions can be divided into two types, pharmacokineticband pharmacodynamicc.Pharmacokinetic interactions involve alterations to the absorption, metabolism and excretion of a drug in the body, whilepharmac odynamic int eractions inv olvemoredirect alterations in the effect of the drug (e.g. via common receptors), and are less common. Elderly patients in long term care may be taking an average of 7 medica tions 1so tha tthe potential for interactions in some individuals is great. 4. Some f oods or f ood c omponents ma yalso ha veeffects on drugs (referred to in this statement as food- drug interaction). It has been suggested2that there are over 200 drugs whose action or toxicity is affected by food. Many of these interactions occur via a limited number of pathways such as stimulating or inhibiting a particular enzyme system, thus effects occurring in one system may be applicabl eto multiple drugs. The effect that the presence or absence of food may have on a particular drug and the ac tivities of met abolic enzymes are routinely considered in the investigations of new drugs (see paragraph 24). 5. The risk of food-drug interactions is likely to be highest in individuals taking multiple medications, or drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin, lithium, theophylline, phenytoin and levodopa, or, where individuals may be taking high doses of vitamin, mineral or herbal supplements or functional foodsd.Foods which have a high potential for interactions include grapefruit juice, milk and dairy products, fatty foods and potassium rich foods. Not only can some food components affect drug action or t oxicity, drugs may affect the way an individual handles food and thus their nutritional status (referred to here as drug-food interactions). As with drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions can be divided into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Fewer drug-food interactions have been identified and so they are normally considered individually. 27Joint COT/CSM one day meeting on diet and drug interactions aThe Committee on the Safety of Medicines is now known as the Commission on Human Medicines bPharmacokinetics describes the fate of a drug in the body including a mathematical account of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and ex cretion. cPharmacodynamics is the interaction of drugs with target sites such as receptors, leading to therapeutic or adverse effects. dFunctional f oods are foods which are claimed to have health promoting or disease preventing properties, such as margarines containing plant sterols.Types of food-drug interaction Pharmacokinetic interactions 6. Some food components may lead to reduced, increased or delayed absorption of drugs depending on the intestinal contents. Drugs may form inactive complexes with food components, while the fat content of food will affect the absorption of lipid-soluble and non lipid-soluble drugs in opposing ways. Splachnic blood flow (blood flow in the internal organs) can be increased by high protein meals but isunaffected by carbohydrate 3;increased splachnic blood flow will increase drug absorption. Ketoconazole absorption is increased by the acidity of the intestinal environment which is fooddependent. The first peak in the plasma levels of a drug occurs after initial gastric emptying, a secondpeak in plasma levels may occur when drugs are taken with food if the presence of the food delaysfurther g astric emp tying.Non specific f ood-drug effects may also occur due to changes in the normal motility of the intestinal tract. 7. Examples of more specific effects of foods on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs ar esummarised in T able1. It should be no ted tha twhilesome f oods can result in a clinically significant effect on drug pharmacokinetics, many of the interactions demonstrated experimentally may notaffect the overall clinical effect of a drug in most people. For example, consumption of 250 g of cabbag eand Brussels spr outs w as necessary to cause a decrease in plasma area under the curve (AUC) and increased clearance of oxazepam, but this did not result in a change to the mean plasma half life of the drug 4. 8. The effect of food components on the metabolism of particular drugs may be different depending on whether shor tterm inhibition or chronic induction of an enzyme system has occurred. Reported effects on drug met abolising enzymes ha ve mostly involved the cytochrome P450 and conjugating enzyme systems, but other enzymes may also be involved. For example, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) stimulates peripher al dopa-decarbo xylase ac tivitywhich increases metabolism and decreases the efficacy of the drug5.Consequently, decarboxylase inhibitors are used with L-dopa to compensate for this effect. Vitamin B6 has also been reported to reduce plasma phenytoin and phenobarbital levels because of their metabolism by pyridoxine-dependent hydroxylase6.The clinical significance of this latter interaction is uncertain.Annual Report 2005 28Table 1.

Summary of individual food-drug interactions (continued) . Pharmacodynamic interactions 9. Pharmacodynamic interactions, which include pharmacological and receptor interactions are less common. Interactions of food constituents with drug targets are known to occur in vitro but often the concentrations occurring in vivo may be too low to be significant clinically. For example, curcumin a component of turmeric is kno wn or of C OX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase 2)e, 11.However cur cumin is poorly absorbed in vivo12 and so is unlikely to have any effect at realistic dietary intakes. 10. One of the most well documented pharmacodynamic interactions involves monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and the amino acid tyramine which is found in a variety of aged, overripe and pickled foods and to a lesser extent in chocolate and yeast-containing foods2.Tyramine is indirectly sympa thomimetic, tha tis, it mimics the ac tions of hormones of the sympa thetic nerv ous sy stem such as noradrenaline. By suppressing its metabolism, MAOIs elevate noradrenaline levels in the circulation. However, tyramine metabolism is also suppressed, thus intact tyramine can then enter the circulation and release noradrenaline from local stores in the nerve endings. This prolongs the action ofnoradrenaline on the adrenergic receptors, potentially resulting in a marked increase in blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperthermia and cerebral haemorrhage. Similarly Ma huang, an ephedra containing herbal medicine, can r eactwith MAOIs resulting in a hypertensive crisis 2. 11.

Among the best known food-drug interactions are those of grapefruit juice and drugs metabolised by CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4 which is the major form of cytochrome P450 in the human liver and gut. Inhibition of CYP3A in the gut by the furanocoumarins present in grapefruit juice may result in increased drug bioavailability, this in turn may result in enhanced or reduced drug activityand /or increased side effects. Up to half of clinically used drugs are metabolised by CYP3A4, resulting in anumber of potentially significant adverse effects. For example, the effects of calcium channel blockers are enhanced resulting in a risk of hypertension and myocardial ischaemia14.Similarly, the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects of benzodiazepines are increased as a result of increasedabsorp tion. Other drugs aff 13. The multidrug r esistance1(MDR1) gly coprotein is a drug transporter that is inhibited by grapefruit juice. MDR1 transports drug molecules from the cells of the gut wall back into the intestinal lumen, thus inhibition of MDR1 can also r esult in increased bioavailability of the drug 15.Thus the eff ect of grapefruit juiceon the bioa vailability of certain drugs can be further enhanced by its effects on the MDR1 glycoprotein since many substrates for CYP3A4 are also substrates for MDR 1. 14. The plasma concentration of the anti-histamine fexofenadine is decreased by grapefruit juice as result of inhibition of intestinal organic anion transporting polypeptide A16. 15. Alteration to drug metabolism may occur with consumption of both processed and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and grapefruit segments. The maximum interaction occurs between 0 and 4 hours of consuming grapefruit but some interaction may persist for up to 24 hours17. 31Alcohol 16. Ethanol has both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, and can interact both with drugs and with food18.Pharmacokinetic interactions generally occur in the liver and involve many classes of drugs including antibio tics and antihistamines. For example, ethanol induces CYP2E1, which may lead to either increased or decreased efficacy or toxicity, depending on the drug. The ethanol induced increase in CYP2E1 enhances the breakdown of paracetamol increasing the formation of the toxic quinonimide products and the depletion of glutathione, which in turn may result in an increased risk of paracetamolhepatotoxicity 5.Ethanol may potentiate the sedative effect of opiates and by pharmacodynamic interactions with the GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) complex of receptors. 17. Ethanol can also contribute towards vitamin deficiency, hinder the absorption of drugs and result in abnormal vitamin D metabolism, via interference with steroid metabolism. Inhibition of alcoholdehy drogenase by cephalosporins and ketoconazole reduces ethanol breakdown. Warfarin 18. The indoles present in green vegetables are able to induce CYPIA2 increasing warfarin metabolism and thus ma yreduce its effectiveness and increase the risk of clotting10.Warfarin efficacy is also reduced by competition with high l evels of dietary vitamin K which favour synthesis of clotting factors. Cranberry juicehas been r epor ted toreduce warfarin metabolism, possibly via inhibition of CYP2C9 by the flavanoids present in the juice19.Other foods reported to reduce warfarin efficacy include large quantities of ice cream, soya beans and avocados7.The clinical significance and prevalence of these latter reports is unclear. Lithium 19. Dietary sodium restriction may increase tubular reabsorption of therapeutic agents in the kidney as normal homeostatic mechanisms operate to maintain sodium levels. For example, serum lithium is reabsorbed along with sodium and thus can be incr eased t opotentially toxic levels20, 21.Increased sodium int akemayhave the converse effect. Once stabilised on lithium, patients should not alter their sodium intake. Herbals 20. Herbal pr oduc ts ma yhave the legal status of either medicines or of food. A recent literature review22 of theoretically possible interactions involving complementary and alternative medicine reported that inthe last 15 years, there were 56 articles reporting interactions between drugs and herbs, 44 of which concerned St John's Wort (see paragraph 22 below) compared to 44 articles reporting interactions between food and drugs, 24 of which were related to grapefruit juice.Annual Report 2005 3221. There are several aspects of herbal products which increase their potential for interaction with food or drugs. Synthetic drugs tend to have one active ingredient, while herbal medications usually have several active components, thereby increasing the potential for interactions with other drugs or components ofthe diet. The composition of synthetic drugs is constant, the composition of herbal medicines can vary.In addition, the therapeutic window of herbal drugs is usually wide, while that of synthetic drugs tends to be narrow. Identification of interactions may be difficult because many patients do not inform theirdoctors that they are taking herbal or other complementary products. 22. The medicinal herb St John's wort can interact with a variety of drugs. It can induce CYP3A4 activity resulting in a reduction in plasma levels of drugs such as cyclosporin or the anti-HIV drug indinavir. It isthought that the effect on CYP3A4 may occur via interaction with the pregnane X receptor (PXR) whichinduces CYP3A4 activity 23.St John's wort can also induce the MDR1 transporter, reducing, for example, plasma c oncentrations of dig oxin24. Drug-food interactions 23. As noted above, there are a few examples of drugs which affect an individual's handling of food and consequently their nutritional st atus. This may be due to the mode of action of the drug, for example, diuretics may promote urinary mineral loss and anti-cholesterol drugs may deplete fat soluble vitamins. It is therefore important to seek a balance between optimising a patient's nutritional needs and the drug levels nec essary f or efficac y.Morespecifical ly, anti-convulsant drugs such as may act as folate antagonists and precipitate folate deficiency25.Drug-food effects may be less direct; for example antibio tics may alter enteric micro-organisms resulting in reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins26. Drug-induced enzyme activity may increase the metabolism of vitamins. Prediction of potential interactions 24. Pharmaceutical companies are required to consider potential drug-drug interactions as part of the pre- clinical data supporting applications for marketing authorisations for new chemical entities. An interaction is considered to be clinically relevant when the therapeutic activity or toxicity of the drug is affected to such an extent that adjustment of the medication or medical intervention is required, or when concomitant use of drugs could occur when both are used as therapeutically recommended. 25. Guidelines are available27which cover pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues, though these do not take into account factors such as age, gender, ethnic origin, physical activity and time of administration (which may affect drug disposition). Relevant factors that should be studied include: the effect of food on the drug; the physicochemical properties of the drug and formulation;pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic properties such as effects on the gut (motility, pH, bile secretion, blood f low); the potential for toxic damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Potential inhibition of MDR1 should be c onsider ed, as should f actors affecting drug distribution which may influence interactions. For example, the displacement of drugs from plasma proteins would be assessed by protein binding, tissuedistribution and o ther studies. 3326. Metabolic interaction studies are mainly required where metabolic pathways account for 30% or more of drug elimination or where active or toxic metabolites are formed by minor pathways. The primary CYP isozymes responsible for drug metabolism are determined, and it also is established whether thedrug is an inducer or inhibitor of these systems. Phase II metabolism (conjugation of the initialmetabolites produced by Phase I metabolism) should also be assessed. A variety of these enzyme systems could be affected by food or food components, but this is not specifically assessed. 27. Pharmacodynamic effects may be predictable from the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug, if it is likely to be co-administered with drugs which have a mechanism or end organ response that could result in additivity, synergy, or opposing effects. Examples include MAOIs and other antidepressants. Informationis necessary on whether the mechanism is primary or secondary. The product would undergo in vitro receptor profiling with a range of ligand binding studies (on receptors, ion channels and transporters); positiv ebinding r esults might r equir viv ofunctional t ests t olook a tagonist or ant agonist effects. It should then be considered whether any effects would occur at the therapeutic dose. 28. In the EU, specific interactions between drugs and food do not have to be considered and clinical trials arenotconduc ted using a st andar ddiet. Vulnerable groups 29.It is possibl ethatcertain population sub-groups may be more vulnerable to the effects of food-drug and drug-food interactions, although information on this area is limited. 30. The elderly may have differences in body composition which affect drug distribution28,while reduced absorption occurs in the frail elderly who are also prone to malabsorption syndrome, eat inappropriate food and who may suffer from inflammatory bowel disease or other chronic diseases. While the activityof some metabolic enzymes is unchanged in older people, liver blood flow and size are reduced so that overall metabolic clearance of xenobiotics is reduced 29.Renal excretion is also reduced in older people. Many older people may be taking multiple medicines increasing the potential for interactions26. 31. Childr en ma ybe vulner able to potential interactions as they have high inter-individual variability and different, frequently higher, nutrient requirements. Whilst dosages for children can be estimated by allowing f or bodyw eight or body surf acearea this does not account for other age-related pharmacokinetic differences such as organ development28. Obesit y 32. Diet may have an indirect effect on drug action mediated by body weight. Obesity is characterised by a number of changes in body composition30.These include increased adipose and lean tissue mass, increased organ mass with fatty infiltration, increased cardiac outflow and blood volume and changes inplasma protein binding.Annual Report 2005 3433. The absorption of drugs in the clinically obese may occur in an unpredictable fashion31.The volume of distribution for a drug might be difficult to predict, for example, whether lipophilic drugs will beabsorbed into fat tissues and, if so, what the consequences of such absorption might be. Obese patientsmay have an increased volume of distribution into adipose tissue for barbiturates and diazepam,whereas digoxin and cyclosporin may have a lower volume of distribution than expected. 34. Characteristic alterations in lipoproteins may inhibit protein binding of drugs, for example, -1-acid glycoprotein may increase the degree of protein binding of triazolam and propranolol31.However, albumin binding is generally unaffected32. 35. Obese patients are at an increased risk of venous thrombotic embolism (VTE). An even greater risk of VTE is associated with being overweight (BMI >25) and using combined oral contraception, where the risk of VTE is 10-fold higher than in women of lower body weight33. 36. In females, obesity is linked with an increased conversion of oestradiol to oestrone and an increased production of testosterone. There is also an association between increased body weight (>70 kg) and an increased risk of contraceptive failure34. 37. Obesity may also alter hepatic oxidative metabolism of some drugs, for example, CYP 2E1 levels are increased resulting in a predisposition to drug toxicity mediated by this enzyme35.Chang es have also been reported for the phase II conjugation pathways in the liver, such as glucuronidation and sulphation. Drugs such as lorazepam and oxazepam are more rapidly cleared from the blood in obese patients due to increased excretion as a glucuronide conjugate31.However, the pharmacokinetics of other pharmaceuticals, such as salicylates and procainamide, are not significantly altered. 38. Increased adipose tissue results in increased clearance of prednisolone, prednisone and carbamazepine31 changes in oestradiol metabolism, and increased resistance to insulin30.Some of the reported changes arereversed on weight loss. Renal function can also be affected in obesity. Glomerular filtration rates and tubular secretion are increased and as a result, drugs such as ciprofloxacin, cimetidin, procainamide and lithium are more rapidly cleared31. 39. Treatment for obesity may also influence drug action. For example, obese patients may undergo gastric surgical procedures to limit the ability to digest consumed food, or be prescribed pancreatic lipase inhibit ors such as orlist at, which blocks the hydrolysis of dietary fat and thereby inhibits its absorption. This ma yhavean impac tupon, for example, the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Future issues 40. The range of foods available is developing rapidly, resulting in a potential for more interactions in the future. Some of these possibilities are considered below. 41. Some func tional f oods ar edesigned t opromote well being by altering the microbiological content of the intestine. The enterohepatic circulation of many drugs depends on microfloral \u00df-glucuronidasewhich itself depends on the microfloral population. Thus functional foods of this type might result infood-drug int eractions. 3542. The phytoestrogen genistein is an isoflavanoid found in soya. Genestein has multiple effects on receptors, enzymes and a variety of their activities in vivo and in vitro36.These include induction via the steroid and xenobiotic pregnane X inhibition of thyroid peroxidase, topoisomerase II, proteinkinases, in vivo ,cell proliferation. Genestein is also a potent sulphotransferase inhibitor, and inhibits the enzymes glucuronidase and aromatase, 17\u00df-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases. It can modulate sex hormone binding protein and has a high affinity for the estrogen receptor. These multiple activitiescould have the potential for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions affecting hormone control and therapy. 43. Current health advice is to reduce the sodium content of the diet. However, it should not be assumed that replacement of sodium by potassium salts, either domestically or by food manufacturers, wouldnecessarily have health benefits. Increased potassium levels can lead to hyperkalaemia and in turn tocardiac abnormalities. Drugs such as po tassium-sparing diur etics, A CE inhibitors and COX-2 anti- inflammatory agents are known to result in elevated potassium as a result of impaired potassium clearance; in combination with a potassium rich diet, serious interactions could occur 37.Elevated potassium is of particular concern in subjects with impaired renal function who are unable to regulate potassium levels. Conclusions 44. Food and f ood c onstituents ha vethe po tential to affect all aspects of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs. The effects may vary depending on whether there is single, concomitant or prolonged exposure. Certain food constituents alter metabolic parameters such as enzymes which can have opposing or unpredictable effects on different drugs. Often the most appr opriate practical advice is that patients stabilised on a particular drug should not change their diet. 45. Food itself is a complex mixture of both macro and micronutrients, making interactions and potential interactions difficult to assess. The use of food supplements such as micronutrients and herbal products also increase the scope for interactions. 46. Interactions have most frequently been demonstrated under experimental conditions. To assess the clinical significance of individual reactions, it is necessary to consider the likely consumption of the food and drug and the se verityof the potential outcome. For example the well-documented interactions betw een gr apefruit juice and a range of drugs is widely known and clinically important since it could result in severe outcomes in a few individuals. In contrast, milk and dairy products can reduce the up takeof certain antibio tics, and bo th milk and dairy products and antibiotics are widely consumed. In practice, however, interactions between them are likely to be overlooked as they are unlikely to be life threatening. 47.There are few data on vulnerable groups but it seems that the most likely population subgroups vulnerable to food-drug interactions are the elderly, particularly the frail elderly, and children. 48. In some cases practitioners have built up knowledge about interactions in specific groups of patients taking particular drugs such as the interaction between St John's wort and anti-HIV drugs such asindinavir. It is important that this type of information is appropriately disseminated.Annual Report 2005 3649. On the basis of current evidence the issue of food-drug interaction is a real one but not one of great clinical significance for the majority of the population. However, data are limited and further interactions may be identified in the future. Rather than widespread public information, it is mostappropriate that practitioners and prescribers should be aware of the potential for food-druginteractions and should consider them both when prescribing drugs and where lack of efficacy or unexpected adverse reactions have occurred.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been asked to review the food additives currently permitted within the EU in order to determine whether full re-evaluation is required. The COT has been invited to contribute to the re-evaluation process, with a particular focus on neurotoxicity, because there have been recent developments in the toxicological approaches in this area. 2. The additives reviewed by the COT have previously been evaluated by the Joint FAO /WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). However, a number of the e valuations, particularly those for the colours, were conducted more than 20 years ago. It is appr opriatetherefore to consider whether the potential for neurotoxicity and developmental effects was taken into account in setting the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for certain food additives and whether significant new data of relevance to neurodevelopmental effects have emerged since the ADI was set. It should be noted that the original data for many of these assessments were submitteddirectly to the committees concerned and due to the passage of time are unlikely to be available except in a summary form. 3. The additiv es considered were quinoline 4. The data for most of the colouring agents are limited and the original assessments were conducted morethan 20 y ears ago, with few details of the studies reviewed being included in the reports. There aresome ne wdata on some of the colours that may be of relevance when considering whether these substances have neurotoxic potential. 5. Developmental neurotoxicity studies are most useful where there is potential for significant pre- or post-natal exposure of the developing brain. They are particularly likely to be needed if the test agent is known to have neurotoxic potential in adults. The best tests are specially devised developmental neurotoxicity screens for learning and behaviour, and quantitative or semi-quantitative morphologicalexaminations of a range of brain structures 1.In the absence of these, a standard Functional Observ ational Ba ttery in the F1generation as young adults, and general morphological observations on the brain based on at least 3 cross-sectional levels would be a substitute that should detect gross effects, though this would be of low sensitivity. If these measures are absent, the simple ability to feed and mate, and a normal appearance of the brain at 1 or 2 sectional levels in a standard two generation study do provide some reassurance, but may not be very sensitive indices of developmentalneurotoxicity. However, it has been noted that for some pesticides, the NOAELs and LOAELs were not significantly lower in specific developmental tests than in standard toxicology tests (developmentaltoxicity, multi-generation toxicity, acute and short-term toxicity) 2.Annual Report 2005 42Summary of data available Quinoline Yellow (E104) 6. Quinoline yellow is a synthetic, yellow food colouring (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Quinoline yellow (disodium 2-(1,3-dioxo-2-indanyl)-6,8-quinolinesulphate) 7.Quinoline yellow was evaluated by the SCF3and b yJECFA4.The t oxicity data assessed by the committees included acute and short-term studies, long-term studies in the rat and mouse and multigeneration, reproduction and teratology studies 8. Both the SCF and JECFA derived an ADI from a two-generation study in which OFI mice were fed diet containing up to 1% quinoline yellow. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 1% of the diet (equiv alent t o1000 /kg of 0-10 mg /kg bw/dayestablished. Neurotoxicity was not specifically investigated in the study. However, histological examination of a number of tissues including the brain, optic nerve, and spinal column did not reveal any abnormalities. Brain weights were also unaffected by treatment. 9. A subsequent study by Osman et al.5reported that quinoline yellow could inhibit both true (acetyl) and pseudo (but yryl) cholinest erase (ChE) enzymes in human ery throcytes and plasma in vitro. A dose dependent decrease in the activity of pseudo and true ChE activity of up to 53% and 87% respectively was reported. Blood acetylcholinesterase inhibition greater than 20% is generally considered to be adverse, whereas inhibition of pseudo-ChE by itself is not usually considered adverse. The authors did not comment on the in vivo relevance of the concentrations tested. 10. COTview:Abiologically relevant reduction in ChE activity would be clearly visible in animal studies. A 70% decrease in activity would result in cholinergic activity such as increased salivation, urination and defecation. These symptoms have not been reported in any of the available animal studies. Structurally,quinoline yellow would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier but the developing braincould be exposed via lactation. The two-generation study provided limited reassurance that no grosseffects occurred since the parental animals were able to feed and rear a second generation. Adversehistological effects were not observed in the brain or in other nervous tissues, but details of thehistopathology were not available. It is unclear what observations were made of the animals' behaviourN SO OS OOO O Na+O- O-Na+ 43Sunset Yellow (E110) 11. Sunset yellow is a synthetic, yellow azo dye that is used as a food colouring (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Sunset yellow (disodium 6-hydroxy-5-(4-sulfonatophenylazo)-2-naphthalene-sulfonate) 12. Sunset yellow was evaluated by JECFA6and the SCF3.The toxicity data assessed by the committees included acute and short-term studies, multi-generation, reproduction and teratology studies and long- term studies in the r at, mouse and dog . 13. JECFAestablished an ADI of 0-2.5 mg /kg bw/dayon the basis of a NO AEL of 2% in the diet (equivalent to500 mg /kg bw) in a 7-year feeding study in dogs and a NOAEL of 1% in the diet (equivalent to 500 mg /kg bw) in long term rat studies. 14. The SCF also established an ADI of 0-2.5 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL of 250 mg /kg bw in a long term feeding study (the precise duration is not stated) in dogs though this was not the same one as thatused by JECFA). 15. Asummary of the SCF. The actual doses used (1, 10, 30 and 100 times the ADI) were not reported although it was noted that no doses in excess of 1000 mg /kg bw /day were used. No effects on reproductive performance were reported through to the F2bgeneration. Neurotoxicity does not appear to have been specifically investigated in this study. 16. The Registry of T oxic Eff ects of Chemical Subst ances (RTECS) report prepared by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) listed sunset yellow as having behavioural effects in two rodent studies including coma and effect on seizure threshold. However, both were acute (LD50)studies in which very high doses of sunset yellow were administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, convulsions and coma occurring prior to death in some animals. The report is based on studies8which additionally reported that doses of up to 6g /kg bw in mice and 10 /kg bw in rats were without adverse effects other than slight diarrhoea.S OONN SO O-O O-HO Na+Na+Annual Report 2005 4417. Tanaka (1996)9investigated the effect of sunset yellow on selected reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters in rats. Sunset yellow was administered in the diet at dose levels of 0, 243, 493 and 999mg /kg bw /day during gestation, the middle dose being approximately equivalent to the NOAEL identified by JECFA and used to derive the ADI. 18. There were no adverse effects on litter size, weight or sex ratio. Some changes in the body weights and survival of offspring in some groups were reported but these were not dose related. A range ofneurobehavioural parameters was then measured in the F 1generation. Of these, swimming direction on post-natal day (PND) 4 was significantly affected in the mid and top dose group males and in females in all dose groups. Swimming head angle was also affected on PND 4 in the mid and top dose group females. Treatment effects on water T-maze performance were also reported, but with no clear pattern.The authors concluded that sunset yellow had some adverse effects on reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters. It was not possible to determine a NOAEL from this study. 19.Osman et al .(2002)5repor ted that sunset yellow could inhibit both true and pseudo-ChE enzymes in human ery throcytes and plasma in vitr oin a c oncentration dependent manner with inhibition of pseudo-ChE and true ChE of 43% and 70% respectively at the highest concentration used. 20. Osman et al .(200 4)10repor ted tha tin rats fed 4 mg /kg bwsunset y ellowor its met abolit esulphanilic acid, pseudo ChE enzymes in plasma were inhibited by 23 and 14.5% respectively and true-ChE in red blood cells by 14.5 and 30.6%. The authors did not report whether any clinical symptoms were apparent. In studies with human blood in vitr o,sulphanilic acid w as reported to result in dose related inhibition of pseudo and true ChE ac tivity of up to 50%. 21. COTview:Abiologically relevant reduction in brain ChE activity would be clearly visible in animal studies. A 70% decrease in activity would result in cholinergic activity such as increased salivation, urination and defecation. Of these symptoms, only diarrhoea has been reported in the available animalstudies (see paragraph 16). Structurally, sunset yellow would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier but the de veloping brain could be exposed via lactation. Potential adult neurotoxicity was only seen at lethal doses of sunset yellow, given by i.p. injection. The three-generation study provides limited reassur ancethatno gr oss effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear two further generations. 22. Sunset yellow is the only colour of those evaluated here that has undergone specific neurodevelopmental assessment. The Tanaka study had multiple endpoints increasing the possibility ofconfounding, and gave mixed results. Sunset yellow appears to have had an effect on swimming beha viour a t4days of age, though this did not persist at later ages. In contrast treatment appeared to enhanc emaze l earning a t7weeks of age but this may have been due to poor performance in the controls. 45Carmoisine (E122) 23. Carmoisine (azorubine, E122) is a synthetic, red azo dye that is used as a food colouring agent (see Figure 3). Figur e3.Carmoisine ( disodium Carmoisine was evaluated in 1983 by JECFA11and the SCF3.The animal studies assessed included acute and short-term studies, multigeneration, reproduction and teratology studies and long-term studies inthe rat and mouse. Both JECFA and the SCF derived an ADI of 0-4 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL equivalent to 400 mg /kg bw /day in a 1-year study in rats12. 25. In a four-generation rat study using doses up to 2% in the diet, there were no adverse effects on fertility, viability or lactation indices13.Rats from the 3bgeneration were subsequently exposed to dietary concentrations of carmoisine up to 2% for 1-year. There were no adverse effects on bodyweight gains, urinalysis, haematology, gross pathology or histology (the latter did not include brain tissue). 26. Twoadditional multi-generation reproduction studies of carmoisine were also available to the committees, in which no treatment related adverse effects were apparent. However, neurological effects were not specifically investigated in any of the multigeneration reproduction studies. 27. The RTECS report listed carmoisine as having behavioural effects in rodent studies including somnolence, coma and convulsions or effect on seizure threshold. The report is based on an LD50 study14wher ecoma and convulsions often preceded death following i.p. administration of high doses of carmoisine. However it was also reported that oral doses of up to 8g /kg bw in mice and 10 /kg bw O-ONN SO Na+Na+Annual Report 2005 4628. Since the evaluation of carmoisine by JECFA and SCF, two additional studies have been published. In a two-generation reproduction study15rats were fed up to 1200 mg /kg bw /day carmoisine, the F1 generation being exposed for 110-115 weeks. No adverse clinical effects or effects on behaviour or reproductive performance were reported in the F0generation. Mortality in the F1generation was not affected by treatment. The tissues sampled for histopathology included brain, sciatic nerve and spinal cord and no adverse effects or differences in tumour incidence were reported. Neurotoxicity was notspecifically investigated in this study. 29. Osman et al. (2004)10reported that carmoisine inhibited both true and pseudo-ChE enzymes in human erythrocytes and plasma in a dose-dependent manner with up to 50% inhibition of both pseudo andtrue ChE produced at the highest concentrations of carmoisine tested. Inhibition of these enzymes wasreversible. Naphthionic acid, a metabolite of carmoisine, was also able to inhibit both pseudo and trueChE in vitr o. 30. Osman et al. (2004)10also reported that in rats fed 4 mg /kg bw carmoisine or napthionic acid for up to 7 days pseudo-Che was inhibited by 15.1 and 18.5% respectively. True ChE was inhibited by 27.8% in theanimals f ed carmoisine but w as unaff ected in those giv en nap thionic acid. The authors did no tmention whether any adverse clinical effects were apparent. 31. C OTview.Abiologically relevant reduction in brain ChE activity would be clearly visible in animal studies. A 7 0% decr ease in ac tivitywould r esult in choliner gic ac tivitysuch as increased salivation, urination and defecation. Symptoms of this type were not reported in any of the available animal studies. Struc turally, carmoisine would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. Potential adult neurotoxicity was only seen at lethal doses, giv en by i.p. injection. The three-generation study provides some reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear through two further generations. Ponceau 4R (E124) 32. Ponceau 4R is a synthetically produced azo dye that is used as a red colouring for foodstuffs (see Figure 4). Figure 4. 1983 by JECFA11and the SCF3.The animal studies assessed included acute and short-term studies, multigeneration, reproduction and teratology studies and long-term studies inthe rat and mouse. 34. Both Committees identified a NOAEL equivalent to 375 mg /kg bw /day from a long term mouse study, adverse renal effects being reported at higher doses, this was used to derive an ADI of 0-4 mg /kg bw /day. 35. Ponceau 4R had no adverse effects in a 3-generation reproductive study in rats at dietary concentrations of up to 1250 mg /kg bw /day. There was no effect on the incidence of pre- and post-implantation losses or the weight or appearance of foetuses. The postnatal development of offspring as judged by survival,bodyw eight and \"developmental milestones\" was not affected by treatment. There were no treatment related differences in histopathology (tissues not specified) between the control and F 3animals. 36. The RTECS report stated that Ponceau 4R had behavioural effects in rodent studies. The report is based on an LD50study16where coma and sometimes convulsions preceded death following i.p. administration of high doses of Ponceau 4R. However, it was further reported that oral doses of up to 8 g /kg bw in miceand r ats werewithout adverse effect other than slight lethargy. 37. Following evaluation of Ponceau 4R by JECFA and the SCF, two additional studies have been identified. Brantom et al. (1987)17conducted a three-generation reproduction study in rats up to 1250 mg /kg bw /day Ponceau 4R in the diet. There were no treatment related clinical effects or deaths during the study. No differences in bodyweight, food or water intakes were observed. Fertility of treated dams andviability of litters was unaffected by treatment. Some differences in litter development were apparent inthe F 2but no tthe F3generation. For the F3generation, two additional responses, the righting response and the startle response, were assessed but were not affected by treatment. Some changes in organ weights were reported in the F3animals but there were no treatment related histopathological findings. 38. In a subsequent two-generation study18rats were fed Ponceau 4R at doses up mg /kg There were no Ponceau 4R in the F0generation. The F1generation received the same diet ary c oncentrations f or up t o114 or 188 weeks. Higher brain weights were reported in the top dose male rats, these changes became significant when adjusted for bodyweight. Degeneration of the granular layer neurones in the cerebellum was also reported in females at the highest dose (3 /53 examined compared to 0 /96 in the controls). The authors did not comment on this finding, but noted a number of statistically significant lesions were observed which were age related and confined to onesex. A NOAEL of 500 mg /kg bw /day was identified, comparable to that used to establish the ADI. Neur otoxicity was not specifically reported in either of these studies. 39. C OTview.Structurally Ponceau 4R would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. The three-generation study provideslimited reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear twofurther generations. Neurotoxic symptoms have been reported in adults but only at lethal doses, giveni.p. Ho wever, of more concern are the effects on cerebellar granule cells in the two generation study since, although the eff ect was only seen at the highest dose, the qualitative measure used may have been insufficiently sensitive to detect neuronal loss at a lower dose.Annual Report 2005 48Indigo carmine (E132) 40. Indigo carmine (indigotine) is a synthetically produced blue food colouring (see Figure 5). 41. Indigo carmine has been evaluated by JECFA19and by the SCF3.The animal studies assessed included acute and short-term studies and teratology studies. Data on long-term studies in the rat and mousewere available in summary form. 3-3' dio ADI of 0-5 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL equivalent to 500 mg /kg bwin a 2-y ear study in r ats. JECFA reported that no adverse effects were noted on reproduction, gross or microscopic pathology. A similar study in mice did not indicate any adverse effects onhistopatholog y. No neurotoxicity or multi-generation studies were available to JECFA or the SCF. 43. Since the evaluations were conducted an additional study has been published 20,which investigated the chronic t oxicity and carcinogenicity of indigo carmine in rats treated with indigo carmine in utero.The F0 generation received up to 2% indigo carmine in the diet prior to mating with no effects on bodyweight or mortality. Following mating, there were no treatment-related effects on fertility or pup viability. Animals fr om the F1generation r eceived up to 2% indigo carmine in the diet for a maximum of 29-30 months. There were no treatment-related effects on mortality or on physical observations. Some changes in organ weights were measured but brain weights were unaffected. No treatment-related effects were apparent after histopathological examination of tissues including three sections of the brain (frontal cortex and basal ganglia, pons) opticnerve, sciatic nerve and spinal cord. Overall, the authors reported that there was no evidence of toxicity or car cinog enicity. Neurotoxicity was not specifically investigated. 44. C OTview.The two-generation study provides limited reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear a further generations. Histopathological examination of the brain and other nervous tissue did not reveal any adverse effects. There was no suggestion of potential to produce neurotoxicity in the adult at any dose. Structurally, indigo carmine would be unlikely tocross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta but the developing brain could be exposed vialactation.H N N H S OO -OSO OO-O ONa+ Na+ 49Brilliant blue (E133) 45. Brilliant blue is a synthetic, blue food colouring (see Figure 6) 46. Brilliant blue has been evaluated by JECFA21and the SCF3.The animal studies assessed included acute and short-term studies, reproduction and teratology studies and long-term studies in the rat and mouse. 47. In 1969, JECFA established an ADI of 0-12.5 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL equivalent to 2500 mg /kg bw /day in a two-year rat study. In 1983, the SCF established an ADI of 0-10 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL equivalent to 1000 mg /kg bw in rodent studies. In the SCF review, no compound related effects were reported in reproductive and teratology studies in the rat. Neurological effects were not specifically investigated in these studies. There are no additional details of the studiesreviewed by the SCF. Figure epor t lists brilliant blue as having behavioural effects including convulsions and effects on seizure threshold in mice. This is taken from an LD50study in which the effects were reported following i.p. administration of 4600 mg /kg, a lethal dose. 49. Following the JECFA and SCF evaluations, one additional paper has been published, Borzelleca et al. (1990)22investigated the lifetime toxicity and carcinogenicity of brilliant blue in rats and mice exposed to brilliant blue in utero. In the r at study , the F0generation received up to 2% in the diet for 2 months prior to mating. There were no consistent treatment-related effects on fertility, gestation, parturition, lactation, of live or stillborn pups. The F1generation w as also exposed to up to 2% brilliant blue for up to 111-116 weeks. Some effects on food consumption andmean bodyweights were reported in some dose groups and survival was significantly reduced in femalesat 2%. No tr eatment r elated clinical, haema tological or urinaly sis findings were reported. There were no effects on any of the organ weights measured including brain. In addition, there no treatment related gross or histological changes following examination of tissues including three sections of the brainSO OO-N+S OO -O pons) sciatic nerve and cord. of 2% bw /day) for males and females respectively were identified. 50. In the mouse study, brilliant blue was administered in the diet at concentrations of up to 5% for 104 weeks. There were no compound related adverse effects on general physical observations, food consumption, survival or on haematological parameters. Group mean bodyweights were slightly lower in treated mice at various intervals, but this was not consistent throughout the study. The NOAEL in themouse study was 5% (7354 and 8699 mg /kg bw /day for males and females respectively). The same tissues were examined histologically as in the rat study. No adverse effects were apparent. 51. C OT vie w. Structurally brilliant blue would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. Potential adult neurotoxicity was onlyseen a t lethal dose levels given by i.p. injection. The two-generation study provides some reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear a further generation.Histopathological examination of the brain did not reveal any effects. Sodium benz oate (E211) 52.Sodium benzoate is used as a food-preserving agent (see Figure 7). Figure 7 . Sodium benzoate 53. Sodium benzoate has been evaluated by the SCF23and JECFA24. Both Committees established an ADI of 0-5 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of the of 500 mg /kg bw /day from a four-generation study in rats. There were no adverse effects on fertility or lactation, the only parameters investigated. Developmental studies were available in the mouse, rat, rabbit and hamster. Neurotoxicity was not specificallyinvestigated in any studies considered in the JECFA or SCF reviews. 54. The SCF evaluation noted that high, acute doses of sodium benzoate were associated with effects on the c entral nerv ous sy stem in humans due t o the disruption of acid-base balance, but were rapidly reversible. Such effects were not expected to occur at the level of the ADI. Sodium benzoate is detoxified via glycine conjugation and toxicity is reduced by glycine supplementation. 55. No additional relevant studies have been identified since sodium benzoate was evaluated.O-O Na+ 5156. C OT vie w. The structure of benzoate suggests that it could penetrate the blood brain barrier or cross the placenta, possibly via the organic anion transporter, though metabolic studies with radiolabelled benzoate reviewed by the SCF and JECFA indicate that the vast majority is excreted with littleaccumulation in the organs. No evidence of neurotoxicity is apparent in the available data whichincludes a four-generation reproduction study. Effects on the central nervous system have been noted but this is due to the disruption to acid-base balance rather than specific neurotoxicity. Sulphur dioxide (E220) 57. Sulphur dioxide is used as a food-preserving agent. It has been evaluated by JECFA25and the SCF23. Both Committees established an ADI of 0-0.7 mg /kg bw /day based on a NOAEL of 70 mg /kg b.w. in long term studies in rats and pigs. 58. In the r at study , the animals w ere treated for up to two years and over three generations. The brain was weighed and brain, spinal cord and femoral nerve examined histopathologically. No treatment related changes relevant to neurotoxicity were observed. The animals were bred for 2 further generations. There were no treatment-related decreases in mortality; body weight gain was reduced in some of the treatedanimals in the F 1and F2generations, but a dose-response relationship was not apparent. The number of F2ayoung were reduced in the treated animals but this was not dose-related and did not occur in the F2b litter. 59. No additional relevant studies have been identified since sulphur dioxide was evaluated. 60. C OT vie w. Structurally sulphur dioxide would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. The two-generation study provides limited reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear afurther generation. No neurotoxic effects were apparent in other animal studies. Limited histopathology in brain and other nervous tissue did not suggest any adverse effects. Monosodium glut amat e (E6 21) 61. Monosodium glutamate is a flavour-enhancing agent. It is a salt of L-glutamic acid, an amino acid representing approximately 20% of ingested protein. 62. Monosodium glutamate has been evaluated by JECFA26and by the SCF27. Both Committees established a group ADI 'no t specified ' on the basis of the da ta provided and since large intakes of glutamates are consumed in the normal diet.Annual Report 2005 52Figure 9. Monosodium glutamate 63. There is a large body of information regarding the neurological effects of MSG. The SCF stated that some studies demonstrated a strain dependant, variable vulnerability of the developing rat or mouse CNS t o high l evels of glutamate alone or in combination with other amino acids in massive doses but that no brain lesions occurred in mouse, rat and hamster studies in which the animals had ingested large doses of MSG in their diet. In addition, some of the acute effects in humans observed after ingestion of more than 3g glutamate per person were also observed with other foods not containing glutamates. The symptoms are not specified by the SCF but high plasma glutamate levels are associated with nausea andvomiting 26. Acute symptoms of burning, facial pressure and chest pains have also been reported28. 64. Since the evaluations were conducted, four additional neurotoxicity studies have been identified. Bawari et al. (1995)29reported that subcutaneous administration of MSG to rat pups resulted in significantly increased lipid peroxidation and catalase levels in the mid-brain region. A significant reduction in total as well as non-protein SH groups was also reported. There were no effects in the frontal cortex. Similar findings were reported by Babu et al. (1994)30. Hsieh et al. (1997)31reported that subcutaneous administration of MSG resulted in sex-specific and area-specific changes in neuronal density (both number and volume) in rats. 65. Jing et al. (1994)32injected pregnant mice s.c. with monosodium glutamate on alternate days until parturition. Memory and Y-maze spatial discrimination learning were damaged in the offspring of the high dose (2 .5g /kg bw) MSG group compared to the low dose group (1g /kg bw). There was significant destruction of neurones in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus exhibiting cytoplasmic swelling, nuclear pyknosis and a reduction in the number of neurones. MSG treatment aff ected the amount amate binding in the hy pothalamus and hippocampus of the mice. It was also reported that MSG can increase the calcium ion concentration in individual neurones by inducing an inf lux of extr acellular calcium and r eleasing intr acellular calcium stores which could be responsible for the observed cell damage and behavioural changes. 66. COT vie w. Assessment of MSG assumes that the sodium salt behaves in the same way as the glutamate deriv ed fr om dietary protein breakdown. Glutamate is a neuroactive compound and can cross the blood-brain barrier and placenta. Hence there is potential for brain exposure at all developmental stages. Ho wever, glutamate is present in normal blood and brain, and brain levels are well controlled by active physiological regulation, so there is unlikely to be a hazard at realistic dose levels. Neurotoxiceffects have been seen in animal studies but only at very high doses, often administered by s.c.injec tion. Such high doses w ould be expec ted to overcome physiological regulation of brain glutamate concentration. There is a substantial body of work investigating MSG at lower doses with no indication of any adverse effects, as well as extensive human exposure data.OH OO O- Na+ NH2 53Acesulfame a synthetic sweetening agent (see Figure 10). 68. Acesulfame K has been evaluated by JECFA33and the SCF34. JECFA established an ADI of 0-15 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a NOAEL equivalent to 1500 mg /kg bw /day in a chronic study in rats. In the SCF review, the dog was considered to be the most relevant species, due to greater kinetic similarities. The NOAELin the dog study was 900 mg /kg bw /day from which an ADI of 0-9 mg /kg bw /day was established. 69. Neurotoxicity was not specifically investigated in a four-generation rat study at dietary concentrations of up to 3%. No adverse effects on fertility, pups per litter, birth weight and mortality during lactation were reported. Growth rate was slightly affected in the top dose animals of the F0and F1generations. No dose -related effects were found in a second reproduction study in which rats were treated with up to 3% ac esulf ame K in the diet. Tissues such as br ain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve were examined histologically in a variety of studies, with no adverse effects being apparent. Figure 10. Acesulfame K (potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide. 70. No additional relevant studies have been identified since acesulfame K was evaluated. 71. C OT vie w. Structurally acesulfame K would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta to a significant extent but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. However, thefour-generation study provides reassurance that no gross effects occurred since parental animals were able to feed and rear subsequent generations. There was no suggestion of potential to produce neurotoxicity in the adult at any dose. The limited histopathology available from other animal studies did not indicate any adverse neurological effects. Aspartame (E951) 72.Aspar tame (is a synthetic sweetener (see Figure 11 overleaf). 73. Aspar tame has been e valuated by JECFA35and the SCF36. Both Commit tees deriv ADI of 0- 40 mg /kg bw /day on the basis of a 104-week study in rats.K+O S N O-O OAnnual Report 2005 54Figure 11. Aspartame (6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)\u2014one-2,2-dioxide salt of L-phenylalanyl-2-methyl-L- -aspartic acid. 74. The 2002 SCF review considered neurological symptoms in particular detail. They concluded that despite targeted animal studies, no consistent effect of aspartame on neurotransmitters or their precursors had been observed. Human studies indicate that there were no changes in behaviour, cognition, mood or learning associ ated with aspar tame nor was it more likely to be associated with headaches than placebo. No additional r elevant studies ha ve been identified sinc e the most recent SCF evaluation. 75. C OT vie w. Aspartame has been extensively studied in both humans and animals, with no indication of any adv erse eff ects being appar ent fr om either aspar tame or its breakdown products (which include the natural amino acid phenylalanine). Only doses high enough to increase plasma phenylalanine well beyond the normal level would have the potential to be neurotoxic. As well as conventional animalstudies, the data available include behavioural studies in animals and assessment of reported human side effects, including in potentially sensitive individuals none of which indicate neurotoxic potential. Saccharin (E954) 76. Saccharin is a synthetic sweetening agent (see Figure 12). Figur e 12. Sac charin ( 3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzo[d]isothiazol-1,1-dioxide) 77. Saccharin has been evaluated by JECFA37and the SCF38. Both Committees derived an ADI of 0-5 mg /kg bw on the basis of a NO AEL equiv alent to 500 mg /kg bw/day for bladder tumours in a 2-g eneration O OO NHNHO OH3C O H2NOHO 5578. Neurological effects were not specifically investigated in young rats exposed to saccharin from parturition (up to 5% in the diet) or in two multi-generation reproductive studies (up to 7.5% in the diet). However, no adverse effects on reproductive parameters were apparent. 79. No additional relevant studies have been identified. 80. C OT vie w. Structurally saccharin would be unlikely to cross the mature blood-brain barrier or placenta to a significant extent but the developing brain could be exposed via lactation. However, the availabletwo-generation reproduction studies do not indicate any gross effects. No evidence of neurotoxicity is appar ent from other animal studies. The limited histopathology available did not indicate any adverse neurological effects. Summary and Discussion 81. Neurotoxic symptoms have been reported in acute studies for some of the additives but these have been LD50 studies using very high doses administered ip and may not be relevant to assessing the use of these colours as food additives. 82. For most of the substances there were insufficient data to fully assess developmental neurotoxicity. Gross neur otoxic effects would be apparent in conventional animal studies but developmental and beha viour al eff ects can be much mor e sensitive than other end points, for example, as with studies of lead and mercury toxicity. However, certain factors would indicate whether there was need for concern and thus assist in prioritising the additives for review. These could include chemical structure, indicatingwhether the compound could be likely to cross the blood brain barrier or the placenta, and the neurotoxic potential in adults since almost all neurodevelopmental toxins in children are also neurotoxins in adults. It was agreed that a tiered approach should be taken in assessing these additives, considering both the potential for adult toxicity and potential routes of exposure to establish whether significant exposure could occur in utero or via lactation. 83. Quinoline yellow, sunset yellow (and its metabolite sulphanilic acid) and carmoisine (and its metabolite naphthionic acid) ha ve been reported to inhibit pseudo and true cholinesterase activity in vitr o. Sunset yellow and carmoisine have also been reported to reversibly inhibit cholinesterase following administr ation t o rats. The significance of these data is currently unclear and cholinergic symptoms have not been observ ed in c onventional animal studies e ven after high dose and /or chr onic exposur e. 84. Sunset yellow has been assessed for effects on a variety of neurobehavioural endpoints at doses in the region of the NOAEL used to derive the ADI. Some non-persisting effects on behaviour were observed. 85. Indig o carmine and bril liant blue ha ve not been specifically investigated for neurotoxicity. Chronic toxicity and reproductive studies were available for the original evaluations, and some additional studieshave been conducted since. No overt effects on behaviour and no effects on fertility or reproductiveparameters have been reported. This suggests that gross neurotoxic effects would have been detected.Although more subtle behavioural or neurodevelopmental effects have not been investigated, theavailable studies do not provide any indications of neurotoxic potential, or that the ADI is inadequate.Annual Report 2005 5686. Ponceau 4R has not been specifically investigated for neurotoxicity. Chronic toxicity and reproductive studies were available for the original evaluations, and some additional studies have been conducted since. No overt effects on behaviour and no effects on fertility or reproductive parameters have beenreported. A conventional two-generation study however, gave clear evidence of neuronal loss, andhence of developmental neurotoxicity, at a high dose. The possibility that a quantitative evaluation might have shown more subtle effects at lower doses cannot be excluded. 87. Sodium benzoate, sulphur dioxide, acesulfame K and saccharin were evaluated more recently and no new relevant studies have emerged since. Overall the data do not provide indications of concern for neurotoxicity. 88. For MSG and aspartame, where concerns have been expressed, neurotoxicity has been considered in more detail by the SCF and JECFA. There are several additional studies on MSG which indicate damageto nervous tissue but these have required administration of sufficiently high MSG doses to overcome physiological control of brain glutamine and the relevance of this route to its use as a food additive isunclear. Concl usions 89. In summary, the Committee concluded that there was no evidence of properties that would suggest a potential to produc e development al neurotoxicity for acesulfame K, brilliant blue, indigo carmine, saccharin, sodium benzoate or sulphur dioxide. There is some equivocal evidence suggesting the potential to produce developmental neurotoxicity at very high dose levels for carmoisine, sunset yellow and quinoline yellow. There was actual evidence suggesting the potential to produce developmental neurotoxicity at very high doses for aspartame, monosodium glutamate and Ponceau 4R. For no agents was ther e any evidence suggesting the potential for developmental neurotoxicity at current acceptable daily intakes. Therefore, although direct evaluations of developmental neurotoxicity were mostly absent and w ould, in principl e, be desir able, the available data did not suggest that further investigations of any of these agents would be a priority given current dietary intakes.

These included a hydrogel pre-filled breast implant manufactured by Poly Implant Prostheses. In September 2000, at the request of the MDA, the Committee considered asubmission questioning the significance of the findings in a 90-day toxicity study in rats implanted with this hydrogel. The product was voluntarily withdrawn from the UK market in December 2000 and anMDADevice Alert was issued to advise plastic surgeons and implanted women. MDA indicated that further advic eon the saf etyof these implants would be provided as soon as it became available. 2 COT considered additional data in February 2002 and concluded (COT Statement COT /02/1-March 2002) : i. The Committee considered that the conclusion of the new study, namely that there were no pathological findings in the organs examined, was not supported by the limited experimental results provided. There were limitations in the design of the study, the interpretation of its findings and the repor twas consider ed tobe impr eciseand inadequat e. ii. The C ommit tee agr eed that the findings from the original and new studies could not be discounted. The Committee was not able to exclude the possibility that the reported lesions were indicative of atoxic or immunologic ally-mediated response. iii. The Committee considered that the new studies provided no further information to permit clarification of the extent or significance of toxicological risks. iv.The C ommit tee repeated its previous conclusion that further testing should be undertaken including the administration of single doses of the filler gel with longer-term follow-up. The Committee stressed the need for the design and reporting of further studies to be compatible with current guidelines f or chr onic t oxicitytests. The implant 3 The comprised of physiological saline gelled with 8% of a polysaccharide. This filling material has subsequently been modified and the saline replaced by a buffer. It is understood thatthe poly saccharide is based on a c ellulose derivative that forms long, linear chains linked by bridges. This gel is contained within a silicone elastomer shell. 4 Degradation of the filling material5 Limit ed da tawere provided previously on the potential for in viv odegradation of the fil ling ma terials 61Further toxicity studies in the rat of a hydrogel filler for breast implants (both buffered and unbuffered). A substantial proportion of the material dosed to animals was not recovered and the fate of this material had not been ascertained. No additional information has been provided. Therefore we still consider that the potential degradation of the hydrogel had not beenadequately addressed. The new rat toxicity studies 6 The manufacturer had provided results from a 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study and a 1-year implantation study, intended to address the concerns raised by COT in relation to the earlier studies. 7 In the 2-year study, groups of fifty female Wistar Han rats were injected in each flank subcutaneously with 1 /60 of their body weight of the modified gel filler material divided between two sites or with saline as a control. Groups of dosed and control rats were killed after 24 months. Limited observationswere made during life with detailed examinations at necropsy. In addition haematology and biochemistry were evaluated in sub-groups of 20 implanted and control animals at 12, 18 and 24 months,biochemistry was assessed on all animals at 24 months. Urinalysis was performed on sub-groups of 10implant ed and c ontrol animals a t18 and 24 months. A mor eextensiv erange of organs was examined histopathologically than in the earlier studies. 8 In the 1-year study, groups of fifteen male and fifteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in each flank subcut aneously with 1 /60 of their body w eight of the modified g el filler ma terial divided betw een two sites or with saline as a control. Limited observations were made during life with detailed examinations at necropsy. In addition haematology and biochemistry were evaluated in sub-groups of 10 implanted and control animals per sex at 3, 6 and 12 months, biochemistry was assessed on all animals at12months. Urinalysis was performed on sub-groups of 10 implanted and control animals per sex at 3 and 6 months and al lanimals a t12 months. An extensive range of organs was examined macroscopically with a more limited range examined histopathologically. 9 The glomeruli of the kidneys of the animals in the test group of the 2-year study were significantly dilated compared to those of the controls and the test group showed significantly higher incidences of tubular nephropathy, sometimes associated with interstitial nephritis. Changes in creatinine levels in serum w ere observed in the first twelve months of the 2-year study but these these were no longer evident after 24 months. Diuresis, excretion of urinary proteins and creatine clearance were similar to control values at the end of the study. The dilatation of the glomeruli of the kidney was associated with the presence of what was thought to be test material contained in macrophages. Evaluation of the findings 10 The previously observed effects in the liver, kidney and lymph nodes in the earlier inadequately designed and r eported studies of shorter duration were not confirmed in these new studies and hence should no longer be considered as indicative of a toxic effect. The changes in creatinine level indicatedafunctional eff ectin the first twelve months of the study, but by 24 months no difference was appar ent although ther ewas subst antial variability between animals at this time. As a result, anyAnnual Report 2005 62difference was not statistically significant, but there may still have been a biologically significant effect. However due to the limited urinalysis for kidney function in the studies, it was difficult to determine if significant damage to the kidneys was occurring. 11 Any effect in the kidney could have been the result of a combination of factors in individual animals rather than representing a functional toxic effect of the hydrogel. We concluded that the marginal effects seen in the kidney were most likely a treatment related effect but not clearly adverse. We noted that, compared to most other species, older rats are very susceptible to interstitial nephritis, especiallyin studies of longer duration. 12 We noted that exposure to the hydrogel in the new studies was intended to represent a worst case situation. In women generally the amount is likely to be lower and duration of exposure is likely to belimited, however similar exposure on a body weight basis could occur in women following simultaneousrupture of both implants. 13 We were informed that the ongoing rate of rupture for all breast implants is 1-5% per annum. When rupture is detected (usually by change of volume), the implants are usually removed and replaced.Ther efore, we considered that exposure to hydrogel would, in most cases, be for a relatively short period of time. 14 Werecognised tha tso-called 'silent' ruptures, where leakage may take time to become apparent, could result in longer exposure times. Although we recognise that there is additional uncertainty, we considered hydrogel unlikely to have acute toxic effects. 15 We were concerned that there seemed to be minimal follow-up to monitor kidney function in women with these implants, and that continued surgeon-patient contact was limited. We were informed thatthe Independent Review Group on Silicone Gel Breast Implants had previously expressed similar concerns over inadequate follow-up. Women with implants are often reluctant to attend for follow-up consultations and therefore there had been increased provision of information to patients on possible adverse events after surgery. Conclusions 16 We conclude that the results of the two studies provide reassurance that the effects previously noted inthe liver, kidney and lymph nodes were not indicative of a toxic effect. 17 Weconclude that the marginal effects seen in the kidney in the new studies were most likely a treatment related effect but not clearly adverse. Taking account of the susceptibility of older rats to kidne yeffects, especi ally in longer studies, we considered that similar effects would be unlikely to occur in humans. 18 The exposure of rats to the hydrogel in the new studies was generally greater in amount and duration than tha toccurring in women following rupture of their implants. We conclude that the results of these studies when considered together with the existing data, suggest that subcutaneous exposure to thehydrogel would not lead to toxic effects in women with these implants. 6319 We recognise that removal of the implants is a clinical decision which would need to be based on all relevant medical factors, including the risks associated with removal of the implants. COT statement 2006/03 January 2006Annual Report 2005 64Nanomaterial toxicology Background 1. In June 2003 the UK Government commissioned the Royal Society, the UK national academy of science, and the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK national academy of engineering, to carry out anindependent study of likely developments in nanotechnology and of whether nanotechnology raises oris likely to raise new ethical, health and safety or social issues which are not covered by currentregulation. 1Their r eport \"Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties\" was published on 29 July 200 4.2The UK Go vernment's response to the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering r epor twas published on 25 F ebruary 2005.3The on the T oxicity, Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT, COC and COM) were identified in an annex to the Government report along with six other independent exper tscientific committees as relevant scientific committees to provide advice on the development of nanotechnology. The Government stated in its reply to the Royal Society that it would ask for advicefrom C OT /COC /COMon issues as the yarise and seek t oensur ethatnanotechnologies will be explicitly mentioned in their t erms of r eference. 2. The COT, COC and COM carry out regular horizon scanning exercises as part of their annual remit (see appended internet links at the end of this statement). The COT identified nanomaterials as an emergingissue a tits February 2004 meeting. Following the Royal Society's review of nanotechnology in 2004 (which was discussed at the COT's September 2004 meeting), all three committees identified the riskassessment of nanomaterials as an area of interest and asked for appropriate information to be providedfor consideration. Introduction to current review 3. Overview papers on the available toxicological data were prepared for the committees to assist in preparing an initial joint statement.4-6 The information presented to the committees was based on a hazard assessment document published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)7,aliterature review prepared by the secretariat which identified a number of additional published scientific papers (which arecited in the overview papers) and information published in abstracts from the US Society of Toxicology (SOT) meeting held March 6-10, 2005, in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.8The HSE captured published inf orma tion up t oJuly 200 4and the additional review prepared for the committees captured information up to March 2005. 4. The Royal Society defined nanomaterials as having one dimension less than 100 nanometres (nm) or 0.1 micrometre ( /H9262m).2However, the Committees (COT,COC,COM) agreed that this should not be viewed as arigid definition and that a pragmatic case-by-case approach should be adopted with regard to nanoma terials. There are two basic approaches to generating novel nanomaterials. 'Top down' technologies use machining and etching methods to create particulates which are usually found in 65Joint statements of the COT with the COM and COCmicrometre sizes, but can also be produced in nanometre dimensions. Examples include engineered surfaces and surface coatings (e.g. fuel cells and catalysts) and microcrystalline materials (potential uses are in textiles, cosmetics, and paints). 'Bottom-up' nanotechnologies involve the production ofnanomaterials from individual molecules. The nanomaterials thus generated are novel, e.g. carbonnanotubes and nanofoam, nanodots and fullerenes. Some examples of 'bottom up' nanomaterials are shown below. The committees noted that nanoparticles were also produced during combustion, foodcooking and from vehicle exhausts. 5. Nanomaterials have a high surface to volume ratio. This means that a high proportion of the atoms will be atthe particle surface, and consequently surface reactivity will be high. These particles may adopt structures that are different to the bulk form, with different physical and chemical properties. Thekinetic behaviour of nanoparticles follows basic laws of gaseous diffusion, with extensive interactions betw een particles. It is likely these collisions lead to agglomeration, and reactions between nanopar ticles and other airborne molecules (water or pollutants). 7 COT/COC/C OM Re viewoftoxicological information on nanomaterials Proposed approach to initial toxicological studies with nanomaterials 6. The Committees agreed that the objective of the review was to provide a baseline statement on the available information on nanomaterials toxicology. At the present time, there are considerable limitations in the number of ma terials tested, and in the toxicology data available. However, it is expected there will be considerable growth in the number of nanomaterials produced industrially and their po tential commer cial applications. There is also virtually no information on potential human exposure resulting from environmental exposure. To some extent this reflects the limited commercial applications to date (excluding medicinal /cosmetic uses which are considered under regulatory assessment schemes). In addition the r eviewprovided t oCOT/COC /COMdid no tcover the exposur eto nanoparticulate material present in air pollution (e.g. resulting from industrial processes, diesel emissions etc). The Committees noted the importance of particle size, surface area and surface chemistry asdeterminants of nanomaterial toxicity. The main methods of hazard identification used included comparison of hazar ddata for micrometre sized Fullerenes Nanodots Carbon nanofoam Structure Rolled up sheets of graphite, with oneend cappedMolecules of carbon formed into hollowcagelike structuresCrystalline structures of compounds e.g.cadmium, selenium, t ellurium, sulphurClusters of carbon atoms in a web likestruc ture Proper ties Extreme str water.Biologically non- y solid, can act as semiconductor.Magnetic propertyAnnual Report 2005 667. Possible biological effects were discussed, including a contribution of nanoparticles in the genesis of oxidative stress processes. It was suggested that the mechanisms leading to these processes probably depend on particle size and chemical composition. Some of the SOT abstracts reported studiessuggesting that surface area might not be the most appropriate metric for describing the dose ofnanoparticles, which contrasted with the information available in the HSE review document. 7,8The Committees noted the \"Seaton\" hypothesis regarding potential cardiovascular effects of inhaledparticles. 9The Committee considered that there was scope for further research into the potential systemic effects associated with inhalation of nanomaterials. This would include information on uptakeand systemic distribution and potential for systemic effects (such as procoagulation). 8. The Committees suggested a systematic tiered approach to initial toxicological studies with nanomaterials. Given the paucity of toxicological data indicating which are the vulnerable cell types,and the lik elihood tha tthis wil lbe variabledepending on nanoparticle surface properties, in-vitr o assessment should initially be directed towards those cell types shown to receive the highest nanoparticle dose in biodistribution studies (where this information is available). Because of the likely routes of exposure, such an approach would normally involve epithelial cells (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal tract) and macrophages (i.e. professional phagocytic cells) for assessment of cytotoxicity,adsorption /uptake, changes in oxidative status, release of mediators. Such studies would provide basic data that could be used for comparison between nanomaterials. This would be followed by a second tier of in-viv ostudies using appr opriateroutes of exposur e. It w as no ted that evidence of oral uptake of one t ype of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) had been identified.10The C ommittees recognised the need f or identifying ranges of standardised nanomaterials for these initial investigations to produce baseline inf ormation on structural influences on toxicological responses (e.g. the impact of surface chemistry). It was acknowledged that the range of nanomaterials and uses would be very diverse. Thisapproach can be summarised in the following figure. 67Proposed approach to initial toxicological studies with nanomaterials 9. The Committees confirmed that there was no need to develop a new approach to risk assessment of nanoma terials but ther ewas a cl ear need t oprovide hazard identification data on the widest possible range of nanomaterials. It was noted that in the absence of such data it was not possible to derive conclusions about the spectrum of toxicological effects which might be associated with nanomaterials.Thus it was noted that nanoparticles resistant to degradation could accumulate in secondary lysosomes,which in cells with a long survival such as neurones or hepatocytes might lead to chronic characteristics of na nom aterials STEP 4 .Undert ake a series of in-vi usin stobedete .Confi ro e ntry/ siteof contact. Carry out bi odistribution stud ies. (Ca nmaterial can be radio labelled?).Annual Report 2005 68Additional comments from COM on mutagenicity evaluation. 10. The COM reviewed a number of publications where mutagenic effects in vitro had been specifically attributed to nanoparticulate titanium dioxide11and zinc oxide12.However the COM noted inconsistency in the a vailable mutagenicity data and in the information on the specification of the test materials used. It was therefore not able to conclude that any specific mutagenic activity had been documented which would not also be reported for studies using micrometre sized equivalents. 11. The COM considered that specific information on particle size was required to assess mutagenicity studies under taken with nanomaterials. Thus, there was insufficient information on titanium dioxide to allow an assessment of the agglomeration /disagglomeration of particles in the vehicles used and it was not possible to conclude which particles had been tested. The COM agreed that it might be appropriateto support in-vitro mutagenicity tests with imaging data on particle sizes. 12. The Committees agreed that particle size was a generic factor which should be considered with all in-vitro testing of nanomaterials. Additional comment from COC on carcinogenicity evaluation 13. The Committees discussed whether SWCNTs and other carbon nanotubes might have carcinogenic potential analogous to fibres such as asbestos. Some recent information from the SOT abstracts using gold labelled SWCNT had demonstrated that some of these fibres may evade macrophage engulfment, although granuloma formation was still reported. It was considered they would not reach themesothelium. The COC considered that more information (including detailed structural data, and absorption and cellular response in macrophages) was required on a range of single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes before any definite conclusions could be reached. Epidemiologic al aspects of exposure to nanomaterials 14. The C ommit tees no ted that there were no published epidemiological studies of nanomaterials available. They also noted that the Royal Society report had highlighted problems in the detection of nanoparticles. It was agreed that estimating human exposure to nanoparticles would be exceptionally difficult particularly where there was exposure to a range of both nanometre-sized and micrometre-sized particles. Similarly, assessment of the toxicity would need to distinguish effects arising from thenanoparticle form and those due to chemical composition. HSE have confirmed that the Health and SafetyLaboratory (HSL) in Buxton is working with the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) t odevelop techniques to carry out such monitoring in the future. Concluding remarks 15. The Committees noted that the current review did not include information on mixtures of nanoparticles such as in environmental air pollution. Members considered that information fromenvir onmental epidemiology and volunteer studies of nanomaterials, predominantly from the field of air pollution research, might be informative in identifying end points for initial screening and possiblehazar ds. It w as sugg ested that liaison with other relevant expert groups such as the Committee on the 69Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) would be valuable. In addition information on medical applications of nanoparticles might be important to the COT discussions. Such information might be potentially relevant with regard to information on structure activity. The secretariat was asked to liaisewith the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 16. The Committees reached the following overall conclusions: i) We note that there is the potential for a wide range of nanomaterials to be produced by many different methods and that there is also the potential that they may be used for many different purposes. T wo safety concerns arise: firstly, the intrinsic toxicity of the nanomaterial itself and secondly, the fact that products with potential for widespread human exposure (e.g. paints) may be delivered in future using nanotechnology. ii)Wehaveproposed a systematic tiered approach for initial toxicological studies on novel nanomaterials based on in-vitro screening of selected materials supported by biodistribution studies to aid in the identification of cell types for study, followed by appropriate in-vivo testing. iii) We believe from the available toxicological data that current approaches to risk assessment should be appr opriate for nanomaterials. However there are limited toxicological data on nanomaterials at present and w econsider it is necessary to keep a watching brief of the developing area of nanoma terial toxicology. iv) We note the difficulties in determining exposures to nanomaterials but consider this to be a high priority for further research so that appropriate risk assessments can be undertaken. v) We suggest close collaboration and exchange of information between COT /COC /COM and COMEAP and the MHRA so that information on environmental air pollution and human medicines can be included in fur ther reviews of nanomaterials. Such information may help to identify potential areas of hazard and risk assessment for nanomaterials used in manufactured products. vi) We consider this subject should be subject to regular reviews by COT /COC /COM.

There is only one study on the genotoxicity of para red available from the literature, an in vitro genotoxicity study in S. typhimurium (Milvy and Kay 1978). Para red was positive with metabolic activation in two strains (TA 1538 and TA 98), but was negative in these strains without metabolic activation. It has not been tested for carcinogenicity. 2. The structure of para red is given below. 1-((4-nitrophenyl)azo)-2-naphthalenol. 3. Although a diff erent struc ture was illustrated in the Milvy and Kay paper the CI number they quoted corresponded with the above structure. The metabolites of para red described by Milvy and Kay (p-nitroaniline and 1-amino-2-naphthol) would be derived from the structure illustrated above. The structure illustrated in the Milvy and Kay paper would not have the dye colour properties of para red and this w ould ha vebeen ob vious to the authors. It was concluded based on the CI number, dye properties and description of metabolites that although incorrectly illustrated the material tested by Milvy and Kay was para red. 4. A report in Dutch by the RIVM, attached to the RASFF, notes these mutagenicity data and points out thatazo dyes can be metabolised to aromatic amines, a number of which are known genotoxic carcinog ens. The RIVM report states that based on the structure of para red it could plausibly be metabolised to the aromatic amine p-nitroaniline. 5. The data on p-nitroaniline are also limited. It has produced positive results in a number of in vitro genotoxicity studies ( S. typhimurium strain TA98, with and without activation, aberrations CHO with S9, L5178Y mouse (NTP, 1993). In an NTP carcinogenicity study there were equivocal results in male mice,based on marginal increases in haemangiosarcoma of the liver and haemangioma or haemangiosarcoma (combined) a tall sites, and negative results in female mice (NTP, 1993). Conclusions 6. Despite the very limited data available, the Chairs of COC and COM considered that it is prudent to assume that para red could be a genotoxic carcinogen based on the azo structure and the positive in vitro genotoxicity finding. Dietary exposure should therefore be as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). Annual Report 2005 72References 1. Milvy P & Kay K (1978); Mutagenicity of 19 major graphic arts and printing dyes.

Such requests generally relate to chemicals for which there are incomplete, non-standard or controversial data sets for which independentauthoritative advice on potential mutagenic hazards and risks is required. Frequently recommendations for further studies are made. During 2005, the Committee provided advice on a wide range of chemicals which included furan, halonitromethanes, meglumine, proquinazid perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) of fur an, PFOS and PFOA were undertaken in conjunction with its sister Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC). A successful joint meeting between COM and COC was held on the subject of theuse of target organ mutagenicity data in carcinogen risk assessment and a publication for a peer reviewedjournal is t obe submit ted soon. The C OMalso has an ong oing r esponsibilit yto provide Government Departments and Regulatory Authorities with advice on developments in procedures for the evaluation and risk assessment of mut agens. In this regard the Committee provided advice on the cIItransgenic mutation assayand a c omparison with da ta provided by the transgenic lacland lacZassays. A det ailed consideration of potential areas of future consideration of mutagen risk assessment was undertaken including developments in the str ategy for testing of mutagenicity, the role of methylation in transgenerational effects and evaluation of mixtur esof mutagens. The C OM completed a major piece of work on the evaluation of biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity in pesticide applica tors. The statement was forwarded to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and was well received. A peer review publication is in preparation. Professor P B Farmer Chair MA DPhil CChem FRSC 81 Biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity in pesticide applicators 2.1 The Medical and Toxicology Panel (MTP) of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) has asked the COM for advice on the biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity in pesticide applicators. The MTP hadconsidered in April 2004 that there were sufficient numbers of reports of biomonitoring studies in the published literature which had been retrieved and evaluated by MTP to request an independent viewfrom COM on the available studies. It was noted that pesticide active ingredients that are DNA reactive in-vivo mutagens are not approved for use in formulated pesticide products in the U.K. 2.2 The DH Toxicology Unit at Imperial College in collaboration with the COM secretariat drafted a series of review papers for the COM. The review considered published biomonitoring studies in the scientificliterature up to December 2004. A comparison was undertaken with the literature search strategy usedbythe MTP in or der t oascertain whether any published studies had been missed. A very good agreement between the MTP and COM literature searches was attained with only one study identified in the COM literature search which had not already been identified by MTP. The discussion papers can be ac cessed via the COM internet site under the \"papers\" section. http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /com / 2.3 The COM took its remit from the referral from MTP and agreed to consider data originating from applica tions of f ormula ted pesticides and pesticide mixtures. COM did not consider studies where a single pesticide active ingredient with known mutagenic potential was used (e.g. methyl bromide fumig ation). A total of 70 studies were subject to initial assessment and a review for the adequacy of the g enotoxicity assessment. The COM discussed the exclusion /inclusion crit eria at the October 2004 and February 2005 meeting and following a postal consultation after the February 2005 meeting. Following this procedure 24 studies selected by COM using the exclusion /inclusion criteria were subjected to an epidemiology overview. The full report of the epidemiology review can be accessedfrom the COM internet site (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /mut0511.pdf). One objective of the epidemiolog yoverview was to attempt a quality ranking of studies (for example study design, consider ation of confounding, modelling of results and interpretation). The COM considered the epidemiology overview at its 26 May 2005 meeting. Members agreed that the review had highlighted and c onfirmed their vie wson the limit ations of the data set. However members agreed to review the data in order to reach the most appropriate conclusions possible. 2.4 The COM considered the full published reports and a narrative summary of the selected COM established criteria for assessment. In this regard the publication by Albertini et al ( Mutat Res 463,111-72, 2000) were valuable. The COM also undertook a consideration of the variation in background frequency of genotoxicity indices used in the biomonitoring studies, the magnitude ofresponse seen in studies of patients and nurses exposed to known in-vivo mutagenic cytostatic medicines, the po tential influence of use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and available exposure informa tion from studies in pesticide applicators. Members agreed that consideration of statistical significance and magnitude of effects from adequately conducted studies was the most appropriateappr oach t oevaluating the available data. Members confirmed that the available information wasAnnual Report 2005 82severely limited and hence no definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to any U.K. agricultural applications of pesticides or to individual pesticide active ingredients. However the COM agreed that it would be appropriate to consider what conclusions could be derived from the selected studies. 2.6 Members considered that the factors which accounted for the variance in the indices of genotoxicity in these biomonitoring studies (chromosome aberrations and micronuclei predominantly in circulating blood lymphocytes) in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines had not been fully evaluated. The biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity were observed to differ considerably in the controlpopulations of different studies. Members concluded, therefore, that it was not possible to establish a minimum fold increase for biological importance that could be applied to studies of pesticideapplicators based on the studies in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines. Further,it was concluded that factors affecting variance in genotoxicity indices used in the biomonitoringstudies of pesticide applica tors which had been r eviewed were not understood adequately. In this respect members considered it would be very difficult to infer causality for the small magnitude responses seen in the biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators. There was a need for more data on the backgr ound variability in the general population of biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity, and on factors affecting variance, which was required before a proper assessment of studies could be made. 2.7 The COM noted that with regard to pesticide active ingredients that were currently approved for use in the U.K .and which w erealso classified with regard to mutagenicity under EC /67/548, carbendazim w as used in 4 /11 positive and 1 /4negative studies respectively. This represented a very small and incomplete amount of inf ormation. It was noted that benzimidazoles were used in a number of approved pesticide products since a risk assessment could be undertaken for the threshold related effects of these active ingredient on microtubule inhibition. The COM confirmed that the available information was severely limited and hence no definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to any U.K. agricultural applications of pesticides or to individual pesticide active ingredients. The COM concluded; i)The C OMreview was based on 70 retrieved published studies of biomonitoring of genotoxicity in pesticide applicators. The evidence covered a large number of types of applications and a wide diversity of pesticide mixtures. The COM selected 24 studies from which conclusions could be drawn through the application of a quality screen of retrieved studies. An independent epidemiological overview of these 24 studies reported that all had significant design and evaluationfaults. The COM agreed that any conclusions reached on this evidence would be limited by the poor quality of the available studies. ii) The COM agreed that following a review of the 24 selected studies there was limited evidence supporting increased biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity in biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators. The COM agreed that it was not possible to make any conclusions regarding exposure-response from the selected biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity because of the inadequacy and unreliability of exposure measurements and the generally small increases in response. The COMnoted that there was no published study of pesticide applicators using pesticide mixtures in the U.K. 83iii) The COM agreed that the factors which accounted for the variance in biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity (chromosome aberrations and micronuclei predominantly in circulating blood lymphocytes) in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines and in pesticideapplicators had not been fully evaluated. It was not possible to define a minimum increase inbiomonitors of genotoxicity associated with cytostatic medicines from the available studies on nurses and cancer patients. Based on these observations and the large inter-study variation for thebiomonitoring indices of genotoxicity in unexposed populations, the COM concluded that it would be very difficult to infer causality for the small magnitude responses seen in the biomonitoringstudies of pesticide applicators. There was a need for more data on the background variability in the general population of biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity, and on factors affecting variance, which was required before a proper assessment of studies could be made. iv)The C OMagreed tha tit is very difficult to draw conclusions on what might be the most appropriate biomonitoring study for U.K. pesticide applicators. There was some very limited evidence to suggest that an appropriate study of floriculturalists using benzimidazoles (e.g. carbendazim) might represent areasonable proposal. The COM concluded that in view of the large numbers of individuals which would be required in order to detect an effect in such a study it was most unlikely that asufficiently large and appropriate exposure group could be identified. 2.8Astatement is appended at the end of this report. Furan 2.9 Furan is used industrially primarily as a solvent or in the synthesis of commercial compounds. It is also found in air pollution, tobacco smoke and many foods and beverages. The COM had been asked for advic eon the mut agenicity of furan by the COT who were considering research that would be helpful regarding the risk assessment of this contaminant. Members agreed there were no clear structural alerts for mut agenicit ybut metabolism mediated by CYP2E1 could lead to epoxide formation which was consistent with the finding of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial. It was noted that carbon dioxide was a major metabolite which was indicative that furan ring opening occurred. However there were no quantitative data on metabolism available. COM evaluation 2.10 The COM considered that the available in-vitro mutagenicity tests of furan in bacteria had been onduc was mutagenic in Salmonel la typhimur ium strains except for a weak positive response in one study in TA100 in the presence of exogenous metabolising fraction. The positive results in tests using Salmonella typhimurium TA 104 with cis-2- butene-1,4-dial were consistent with this compound being a reactive aldehyde. Members noted the positiv eresults reported in chromosomal aberrations tests in CHO cells in both the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation but commented that the concentrations where positiveresults had been identified ( ca 125 mM and 250 mM) w ere considerably greater than the OECD upper limit of 10 mM f or non c ytotoxic test materials. There was no information on cytotoxicity in the NTP CHO test report.Annual Report 2005 842.11 Members considered that the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay reported by the NTP had been conducted to standards acceptable at the time using plating in soft agar but that a trial had not been conducted in the presence of an exogenous metabolising fraction. Members agreed that in view of the positiveresults at non-cytotoxic doses this study should be considered as positive and that furan should beregarded as having in-vitro mutagenic activity. 2.12 The COM considered the available in-vivo mutagenicity studies. The key in-vivo bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay was undertaken as part of the NTP programme on furan. Membersagreed that the data from this study could not be interpreted with certainty because of the confounding effects of toxicity at the dose level used. The COM agreed that negative results had beenobtained in in-vivo liver UDS studies in rats and mice. Covalent binding studies using oral or intraperitoneal doses of radiolabelled 2,5-14C-furan in rats were available but members agreed the data could no tbe int erpreted due t othe low specific activity radiolabelled furan used. The results of in-vitr o studies of the reaction of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial with deoxynucleosides indicated reactions with 2'- deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxycytidine but not thymidine. Thus it had been proposed thatcis-2-butene-1,4-dial might form DNA cross links. No definite conclusions could be drawn from the available studies of proto-oncogene mutation spectra in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas fromcontrol and furan treated mice. 2.13The COM concluded that furan should be regarded as an in-vitr omutagen but ther ewas insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion on the available in-vivo mutagenicity data. Members felt that adequate in-viv omutagenicity testing would be useful. It was suggested this might include a bone marrow micronucleus test or DNA binding studies in cancer target organ tissues. It was noted that the critical carcinogenic effect was cholangiocarcinoma and there would be difficulties in isolating bile duct cells during DNA binding studies. 2.14 The COM advice was forwarded to COC and subsequently to COT. Halonitromethanes 2.15 Halonitromethanes (HNM's) are a class of compound characterised by the presence of one or more halog en atoms together with a nitro moiety on a single central carbon. They differ from the halomethanes (HM's) by the presence of the nitro moiety. The HNM's had been identified as disinfection by-produc ts (DBP) in drinking water in the US and had received a high priority ranking for investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency http: //www.epa.gov /athens /publications /EPA_600_R02_068.pdf. The only available published data related to the in-vitro studies in Salmonella typhimurium strains and in in-vitro Comet studies, conducted using CHO cells. Some preliminary findings had been reported by the EPA to the DH Toxicology Unit regarding in-vivo testing of the HNM's in transgenic medaka fish. The COM was also aware of an NTP negative in-vivo bone marrow mouse micronuclei test with trichloronitromethane (TCNM; chloropicrin), but that there were no appropriate in-vivo mutagenicity data available for other HNMs. 85COM evaluation 2.16 The strains tested included TA 98, TA 100, TA 104 and a strain RSJ100 which expresses rat glutathione transferase theta (GSTT1-1) known to activate halomethanes. Members agreed that the standard plateincorporation approach had been undertaken in this study used two plates per dose point (instead of the normal three) but that reproducible small increases in the number of revertant colonies had been reported. It was noted that HNMs might volatilise and therefore procedures to prevent evaporation in the bacterial mutagenicity tests might have been more appropriate. With regard to the Comet studiesMembers noted that HNMs tested were cytotoxic in CHO cells and that apoptosis induction had not been recorded in these studies. In addition none of the trials had included the addition of an exogenousmetabolising fraction. However members agreed that HNMs were genotoxic in this test system. 2.17 Overall, in accordance with the COM strategy, HNM's should be regarded as in-vitro mutagens and potential in-viv omutagens. It was considered that there was a need for appropriate in-viv otesting. The COM suggested:- a) in-vivo rat liver UDS assay, followed by b) sit eof contactCOMET assa y If either of these studies yielded positive results, then the chemical under test should be considered to be an in-viv omutagen. 2.18Astatement w as published and is appended a tthe end of this r eport. 2.19 The COM was subsequently informed of a personal communication from Dr S Richardson (US EPA) at the October 2005 meeting. It was noted that the preliminary finding of DNA adducts in rat liver following in-viv oexposur etodibromonitr omethane supported the view that this compound should be considered as having mutagenic potential in-vivo . Joint COT /COC /COM review of nanomaterials 2.20 The risk assessment of nanomaterials was identified by COT /COC /COM as an area of interest during horiz on scanning discussions in 200 4. The Committee was aware of the publication of a report by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering 'Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and unc ertainties 'previously discussed by COT in September 2004. The UK Government's response to this r epor twas published in F ebruary 2005. The C OT, COC and COM were identified as relevant scientific committees to provide advice on the development of nanotechnology. The information present ed tothe c ommit tees w as based on a hazar dassessment document published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) with additional papers and abstracts identified by the secretariat. There were considerable limitations in the number of materials tested, and in the toxicology data available. 2.21The C OM considered some specific in-vitr omutagenicit ydata for particulate titanium dioxide and zinc oxide of various sizes including test materials described as being nanomaterials. The COM alsoconsider ed some specific mut agenicit ydata on fullerenes. It was agreed that no definite conclusions on the influence of particle size on mutagenicity in-vitro could be drawn from the available information.Annual Report 2005 862.22 The COM considered that specific information on particle size was required to assess mutagenicity studies undertaken with nanomaterials. Thus the available information on titanium dioxide did not allow an assessment of the agglomeration /disagglomeration of particles in the vehicles used and it was not possible to conclude what particles had been tested. The COM agreed that it might be appropriate toprovide imaging data on particle sizes in order to evaluate in-vitro mutagenicity tests nanomaterials. 2.23 A statement is appended at the end of the COT section of this report. Meglumine 2.24 The COM provided advice on the from EU regulations)in a statement COM /03/S2 in response to a request for advice from the FSA. The available data on these compounds in 2003 were relatively poor and the COM agreed the best approach was to consider the data on each entity separately. The evaluation of meglumine posed the greatest difficulty in that therewere inadequate in-vitro data on this compound but some clear positive results had been documented in relatively of meglumine followed by harvest 6 hours after the last dose. A number of confirmatory in-vivo studies under taken for the COM had yielded negative /inconclusive findings. The COM had concluded that therewas a need f or two adequately undertaken in-vitr ostudies (namely a mouse lymphoma assa yand an in-vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes) before conclusions could be reached. 2.25 The COM agreed that the two in-vitro studies submitted did not provide any evidence for a mutagenic effect and the assays had been adequately conducted. 2.26 A revised statement on Flunixin, meglumine and Flunixin meglumine is appended at the end of this report. Proquinazid 2.27 Proquinazid is a novel fungicide being considered by the ACP under the plant protection Directive (91/414 /EC). The da taholder is DuP ont Chemicals. Pr oquinazid (6-iodo-2-propoxy-3-propyl-3H-quinazoli- 4-one )is int ended f or use in agricultur eand viticultur eproviding control of powdery mildew in cereals and grapes (Blumeria graminis. Class Ascomycetes). It is a novel class of fungicide acting by inhibiting the development of the appr essori al germ tube ( which is r esponsibl efor penetration of the host) but the mechanism of action was unknown. The ACP deferred making a decision pending advice from the COC and COM with regard to the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma in the rat carcinogenicity bioassay. The COC /COM have not been asked to any other in structural alerts for mutagenicity with regard to proquinazid but noted that a possibility for generation of metabolites with a quinone type structure which mightpotentially alert for free radical generation. 872.29 Members heard a presentation from the data holder (Du Pont Chemicals) and discussed a number of aspects of the conduct of the mutagenicity tests which had been submitted. The purpose of the presentation was to provide DuPont's rationale on the adequacy of the genetic toxicology data base forproquinazid and to specifically discuss the results of the mammalian cell in-vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes and the in-vitro mammalian cell gene hprt mutation assay in CHO cells. DuPont sought the Committee's agreement that proquinazid is not genotoxic and further testing is unnecessary. 2.30 Members considered that the company had provided some relevant information and comments but had not been convinced that the in-vitro mutagenicity test package was adequate. Members agreed that a key element of any proposal regarding mechanism of proquinazid induced cholangiocarcinoma in therat would require an evaluation of mutagenicity and hence it was important to complete themutagenicit ytest packag e. The C OM considered that a mouse lymphoma assay should be conducted and that it was advisable to also conduct a continuous 20 h exposure in a mammalian cell chromosomal aberration assay (in human lymphocytes) in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Both studies should be conducted to internationally accepted standards. These studies were required to provide full information on the mutagenicity evaluation of proquinazid. COM post meeting consideration of additional mouse lymphoma assay 2.31The da taholder submit ted on 12 July 2005 the r esults of a ne wmouse lymphoma assay undertaken with proquinazid. The assay included an exposure of 3 hour (in presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation) and a continuous 24 h exposure in the absence of metabolic activation. The results suggested that proquinazid was not mutagenic in this assay. A full report was not available during the post al consultation with COM members. The COM considered the available data from the new mouse lymphoma assa ybypostal consultation and agreed there was no evidence for a mutagenic effect. It was also agreed that the full report should be considered by COM when available. The final repor twas submit ted to COM members by postal consultation on the 22 August 2005. Members agreed that the submitted mouse lymphoma assay was acceptable and gave negative results. 2.32 The COM conclusions were forwarded to the COC. A statement is appended at the end of the COC section of this report. Perfluorooctane emultif luorina ted chemicals based on an eight carbon linear molecule (some branched chain and lower alkane fluorinated carbon impurities may be present at low levels). PFOS and PFOA had unusual physico-chemical properties forming microdispersion micelles in aqueous systems. Members heard that the Environment Agency had recently concluded that PFOS meets the criteria for classifica tion as a Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) substance. PFOS and PFOA have the potential to enter the food chain and could have a negative health impact on humans. The COT hadconcluded tha tthe a vailable toxicology data indicate that PFOS and PFOA do not demonstrate sufficient similarities t obe assessed jointly .The C OThad asked for advice on mutagenicity and carcinogenicity from the COM.Annual Report 2005 882.34 There were no apparent structural alerts for mutagenicity and the evidence from animal studies is that absorbed material is not metabolised. However there is evidence for target organ toxicity in repeat dose studies with both PFOS and PFOA in rats and monkeys and evidence for adverse effects onreproduction and the induction of endocrine target organ tumours with PFOS and PFOA and livertumours in rats with PFOS. The mechanisms for these toxicological effects had yet to be evaluated by COC and COT. PFOS 2.35 Members discussed the mutagenicity data on PFOS and agreed that the physico-chemical properties of PFOS considerably complicated the formulation of appropriate test solutions for mutagenicity studies. The use of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as a solvent using dose levels up to those which inducedcytotoxicity or precipitation was agreed as acceptable. Members agreed that the in-vitro plate incorporation test using five strains of Salmonella typhimurium and the D4 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave negative results. Members agreed that the reverse mutation assay using Escherichia coligave negative results. The difficulty in formulating an adequate suspension of the test material wasnoted for the in-vitr ytes. Members agr eed that this study had yielded negative results. Members agreed that the in-vitro UDS assay in rat liver primary hepa tocytes gave negative results. Members commented on the difficulty in adequately formulating PFOS f or or al dosing of mic ein the bone-marrow micronucleus test. Members noted that only 1000 micronuclei had been evaluated at each dose level. However overall the study was considered to be acceptable and provided negative results. 2.36 The COM agreed that the studies undertaken with PFOS were acceptable and that PFOS should be regarded as not mutagenic. PFOA 2.37 The COM discussed the data on PFOA. It was noted that mutagenicity assays had been conducted using aqueous solutions of sodium or ammonium perf luorooctanoate. 2.38 Members agreed that the plate incorporation bacterial mutagenicity tests using strains of Salmonella typhimur iumand oliusing sodium or ammonium perf luorooctanoa tewere adequately undertaken and gave negative results. The COM noted that the in-vitro hprt assay in CHO cells using ammonium perfluorooctanoate had reported negative results. 2.39 Members considered that a mutagenic response had been documented in the in-vitr ochromosomal aberration assay of sodium perfluorooctanoate in CHO cells in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation a tthe tw ohighest concentrations. This finding had been reproduced in a confirmatory assay in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation at the highest concentration tested. No evidence forincreased chromosome aberrations had been documented in the absence of exogenous metabolicactivation. However it was unclear as to what extent the results reported from this in vitro study were due to cytotoxicity. An increase in chromosome aberrations was also documented in an assay usingammonium perfluorooctanoate at the highest dose tested in the presence of exogenous metabolicactivation. There was clear evidence of cytotoxicity at this dose level in this particular assay. It was 89agreed that sodium perfluorooctanoate, in the absence and presence of metabolic activation, had not induced chromosomal aberrations in cultured human whole blood lymphocytes when tested up to doses that were cytotoxic. Members commented that the available information indicated that absorbedPFOA was not metabolised by mammals. 2.40 No evidence for a mutagenic effect was found in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay where mice had been given a single oral gavage dose of up to 5000 mg /kg bw sodium perfluorooctanoate or 1990 mg /kg bw ammonium perfluorooctanoate. The test materials had been solubilised in deionised water. There was clear evidence of toxicity (mortality of both males and females) and reduced PCE /NCE ratios in animals dosed with 5000 mg /kg bw sodium perfluorooctanoate. A dose level of 1990 mg /kg bw ammonium perfluorooctanoate did result in one male death but did not have an effect on the PCE /NCE ratio. Members commented that the in-vivo bone marrow mouse micronucleus studies had beenadequa tely c onduc ted although ther ewas no direct measure of exposure of the bone marrow to the test materials and also noted that absorbed PFOA was highly bound to proteins. 2.41 The COM discussed what further testing might be appropriate for PFOA salts and considered whether an inv estig ation of in-viv oDNA binding or fur ther e valuation of the mechanism of in-vitr o chromosomal aberration assays were appropriate. Overall, the COM concluded that the results from the in-vitr ochromosomal aberration assays with PFOA salts were likely to represent a cytotoxic response. It w as agr eed that a plausible in-vitr omechanism f or the positiv eresponse in CHO cells was required to reassure the COM of this conclusion. Horiz on Scanning 2.42 The COM undertakes an annual exercise to identify areas of mutagenicity risk assessment, testing and evaluation which might be the subject of future consideration. The following areas of work were agreed which have been grouped into three areas of priority. 2.43 Areas with high priority were; i)COM agreed evaluation of UDS v COMET was useful but noted the amount of data available in contract test houses and in the public domain would be limited. In the first instance the secretariat was ask ed toidentify UD Spositives and look for concordance with COMET (liver). It was agreed theremight be v ery f ewdata available. Some wider considerations of usefulness of the comet assay could be considered subsequent to this review. ii) Members were very interested in methylation status changes in transgenerational effects and suggested that broadening to effects on histones as potential mechanisms for permanent changes to pheno type needed to be considered. COM agreed this was a major undertaking. (The original request c omes fr omACP /MTP) C OMfelt the current mutagenicity tests strategies would not address such compounds, there might be examples from the Medicines and Healthcare productsRegula tory Ag ency(MHRA) ( e.g. antisense DNA products). iii) COM requested some joint working with COC to improve presentation of advice to general public, to try to get over misconceptions, e.g. all pesticides are genotoxic.Annual Report 2005 90iv) COM agreed some additional work on the background information on variance of biomarkers of genotoxicity in populations. 2.44 Areas with medium priority were; i) COM agreed that consideration of mitochondrial DNA as a cellular target for mutagens was a priority for future work. ii) COM agreed that consideration of nitropyrenes and nitro PAHs was a priority for future work.iii) COM agreed that a review of aspects of mutagenicity of mixtures would be valuable. After some long consideration of potential mechanisms of interaction, COM agreed to look at modulation of alkylating agent mutagenicity as a first start, to see if dose /effect addition rules were adequate. iv)COMasked for a pr esentation on wider aspects of international validation of mutagenicity testing. 2.45 Areas of low priority were the potency indicator approach suggested by Sanner T and Dybing E (Basics in Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, 96, 131-139, 2005) and the proposed evaluation of hprt CHO assaysheld b yPSD.It was agr eed the r eviewwould be of value to PSD in assessing overall performance of this mutagenicity assay. Test Strategies and Evaluation cIItransgenic mutation assay (comparison with transgenic lacland lacZ assays) 2.46 The COM and COC had considered the available mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data on malachite green studies using the lacItransgene in both rats and mice were reported. However one key piece of evidence came from the finding of an increased mutagen frequency in the liver in an in-vivo mutagenicity assay using the cIItransgene in Big Blue mice fed a diet containing leucomalachite green. An overview of the development and use of in-vivo mutagenicity assays using the cIItransgene was drafted for the February 2005 COM meeting. A general conclusion was reached on the basis of the information reviewed. 2.47The C OM concluded that the cIItransgene w as a useful in-viv omutation assa ytoinvestigate potential mutagenic effects in cancer target organs in rodents. It was necessary to routinely sequence mutant colonies in order to evaluate the significance of results obtained with the cIItransgene in rodents. The COMfelt tha tthe curr ently a vailabl edata in the published literature did not support the routine use of the cIItransgene for screening chemicals but suggested it was of value in targeted studies of mutagenicity in specific organs in rodents. The COM agreed to keep the use of the cIItransgene under review along with other developments of in-viv omutagenicity testing. 2.48 A statement is appended at the end of this report. 91Joint meeting of COM /COC on use of target organ mutagenicity assays in carcinogen risk assessment 2.49 The COM and COC undertake routine horizon scanning exercises as part of their annual remit (see appended internet links at the end of this statement). The COM identified the use of in-vivo target organ mutagenicity studies as a subject for further consideration. The COM and COC agreed to hold ajoint meeting on the use of data derived from in-vivo target organ mutagenicity studies in carcinogen risk assessment. An open meeting of the c ommittees was held on the 9 June 2005. Attendees included anumber of external experts who gave presentations and comments to the committees discussions. 2.50 The COM and COC agreed that data from adequately conducted in-vivo carcinogen target organ mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies (which included information from investigations using transgenicanimals, the comet assay, and approaches to measuring DNA binding (e.g. postlabelling and radiolabel methods) can provide valuable information of use in the mode-of action of carcinogenic responses seen in rodents. Such studies can provide supporting information for use by regulatory authorities in carcinog en risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. 2.51 A brief statement is appended at the end of this report. A full write up is being prepared for publication in a peer review journal. Ongoing r eviews 2.52Anumber of r eview papers are in preparation for 2006. These currently include; Areview of biomonitoring for genotoxicity in patients who have undergone revision arthroplasty for hip replacement. A review of the utility of the rat liver UDS assay and comparison with data from the COMET assay. A review of the factors affecting the background frequency of micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes in biomonitoring studies.Annual Report 2005 92Review of Biomonitoring Studies of Genotoxicity in Pesticide Applicators Background 1. The Medical and Toxicology panel of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides has asked the COM for advice on the genotoxicity in pesticide applicators. The referral statement is given below. \"To review investigations of mutagenicity and DNA adducts in pesticide applicators and workers exposed to pesticides (e.g. handling cut flowers) and factory (manufacturing) staff engaged in pesticidemanufacture/formulation and produce a statement for the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and its Medical and T oxicology Panel (MTP). The review should include all studies identified by the MTP and any other relevant studies published, particularly those originating from the UK. The r eview should consult COC epidemiologists with regard to the rigour of studies evaluated. this should include design, s election of controls, bias, confounding and use of multiple statistical comparisons. The r eview should be initiated at the October 2004 COM meeting.\" 2. The referral from ACP and the MTP came about through the ongoing routine review of epidemiology literature undertaken by the MTP. The MTP had considered in April 2004 that there were sufficientnumbers of reports of biomonitoring studies in the published literature which had been retrieved and evaluated by MTP to request an independent view from COM on the available studies. It is noted that pesticide active ingredients that are DNA reactive in-vivo mutagens are not approved for use in formula ted pesticide products in the U.K. Evidence reviewed 3. The DH Toxicology Unit at Imperial college in collaboration with the COM secretariat drafted a series of review papers for the COM. The review considered published biomonitoring studies in the scientific literature up to December 2004. A comparison was undertaken with the literature search strategy used by the MTP in order to ascertain whether any published studies had been missed. A very goodagreement between the MTP and COM literature searches was attained with only one study identified in the C OM literature search which had not already been identified by MTP. ( A total of 70 biomonit oring studies of g enotoxicity markers in pesticide applicators was identified. 1-70). A listing of the discussion papers considered by COM during the review period (from the October 2004 to the October 2005 meetings) is giv en belo w.Allof these review papers are draft discussion papers and do not necessarily represent the views of the COM.

Pesticide applications considered in the review. 4. The papers retrieved identified a wide diversity of occupational pesticide exposures. The authors described inv estig ations in occupational groups such as floriculturalists, green house workers, agricultural workers and farmers, pesticide sprayers and applicators (which included agricultur al/horticultural, amenity, fumigators), production workers (e.g. manufacture of pesticides) and forestry workers. The extent of information provided on occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g. during handling ,diluting ,applying), the dur ation of exposure and use and adequacy of personal protective clothing varies considerably between the different accounts. The Committee considered it was difficult toevaluatesuch a diverse data set. It was agreed that the most appropriate approach would be to assess the adequacy of the studies with regard to investigation and evaluation of genotoxicity indices and with regard to overall adequacy of design, analysis and interpretation of results. With respect to overalladequac y,the C OMsought an opinion fr om an independent epidemiologist. Indices of genotoxicity used in the reviewed biomonitoring studies 5. A short overview of the indices of genotoxicity used in biomonitoring studies is provided to assist in evaluating the significance of findings. Almost all the studies considered in this review provided data forinvestigations using in-vitro culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from blood samples. AAnnual Report 2005 94small number of studies used epithelial cells from the buccal cavity. The committee had access to the general guidance published by a WHO IPCS working group on use of genotoxicity indicators in biomonitoring studies.71The Committee agreed that in general the genotoxicity indices measured in samples (predominantly peripheral blood lymphocytes) including micronucleus formation,chromosomal aberrations, comet and, 32 P-postlabelled DNA adducts results indicate uptake and exposure to DNA damaging chemicals. The evidence suggested that there may be an increased risk ofmutagenicity and also possibly carcinogenicity but it is not possible to be certain that there is a risk or to quantify this risk because of the poor quality of many of the studies and frequent contradictoryfindings. Micronucleus frequency Micronuclei are small, extranuclear bodies that arise from acentric chromosome fragments or from whole chromosomes that are excluded from the nucleus during mitotic cellular division. They can be a consequence of DNA breakage, replication on a damaged DNA template or inhibition of DNA synthesis,failure of any of the mitotic apparatus or alterations in cellular physiology and mechanical disruption 71,.In most cases, the c ytokinesis-block MN method is used, in which sc oring only t akes plac ein cells that have only divided once in culture.16Micronucleus analysis can be used for a number of cells, both in vitro and in vivo, including lymphocytes5,9,72and buc cal epithelial cells.49-50Micronucleus induction is an indirect indicator of mut agenicit y. It is unclear however, whether MN formation has a specific role in carcinogenesis.71 Chromosome aberrations Structural chromosome aberrations arise from direct DNA breakage, replication on a damaged DNA template or inhibition of DNA synthesis and ma yinvolveboth chromatids of the chromosome (chromosome-type CA), or only one chromatid of the chromosome (chromatid-type CA).71,73Chromosome aberration analysis has been commonly performed on human peripheral blood lymphocytes to assess DNA damage.11,14,16,29,42,44To ensure that only first-generation metaphase cells are scored for CA, bromodeoxyuridine is commonly added to the culture medium prior to DNA replication in vitro 29.Both structural and numerical chromosome aberrations may cause alterations to the structure or arrangement of oncogene and tumour suppressor genes of somatic cells, and hence are involved in the induction of cancer in humans.74 Sister chr omatid ex chang e Sister chromatid exchanges arise from equal exchange of DNA replication products between two identical sister chromatids of a duplicated chromosome75 They are thought to arise as a consequence of \"error free\" homologous recombinational repair or bypass of DNA lesions during replication on a damaged DNAtemplate, possibly at the replication fork. 75 In the most commonly used method of SCE analysis, DNA replica tion is required for two consecutive cell cycles, hence bromodeoxyuridine is added to the culture medium and c ells arescored in the second division metaphase.14,61Although the induc tion of SCE has been widely used as an indicator of DNA damage following exposure to pesticides,12,26,32,36,45,61the mechanism of forma tion and biological significanc eof SCEs ar estillunknown.75.The C OMagreed tha tbiomonit oring studies using SCE analysis were not informative with regard to evidence for genotoxicity. 95Comet assay The comet assay, or single cell gel electrophoresis technique is a more recent technique established as a sensitive method for detecting DNA single strand and double strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, DNA crosslinking and inc omplete excision repair events. 34,64,76,77The c omet assay can be carried out with a number of cells, both in vitro and in vivo ,including peripheral blood leukocytes, bladder, liver, buccal, gastric and sperm cells. To date, peripheral blood lymphocytes are mainly used for human biomonitoring studies following occupational exposure to an array of chemicals.34,53,64,77.However, the relevance of the endpoint measured in the comet assay has yet to be established, as it is usually the result of a temporary strand breakage, which is repaired within a few hours under normal circumstances and may or may not become fixed as a mutation.77 DNA adducts ADNA adduc tis a chemical entit ycovalently bound to DNA71,and is usual ly formed f ollowing the interaction of an electrophilic molecule with a nucleophilic site of DNA78.They are often the initial DNA lesion following exposure to a genotoxic chemical and may lead to mutation and altered gene function if not repaired. In epidemiological studies DNA adducts are particularly useful as they provide information on theexactchemical exposure of the individual. 78, 32P-DNA postlabel ling t echnique has been widely used to measure non-radioactive carcinogenic large DNA adducts in humans, due to it being a highly sensitive technique.78 The C OMguidanc eon a str ategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity recognised that artifactual positives may be obtained in the cell assays that do not reflect intrinsic mutagenic activity. Factors such as hyperthermia, hypothermia or induction of erythropoiesis may produce MN or CA79or exercise immediately prior to sampling may lead to increased DNA damage measured by the comet assay.80,81 Overview of approach used by COM 6. A flow diagram outlining the approach used by COM is shown in Figure 1. 7.The C OM took its remit from the referral from MTP and agreed to consider data originating from applica tions of f ormula ted pesticides and pesticide mixtures. COM did not consider studies where a single pesticide active ingredient with known mutagenic potential was used (e.g. methyl bromide fumig ation). The C OMagreed t oeliminate a number of publications arising from studies undertaken in Croatia because of irregularities in the reported data. A number of papers from Zeljezic and Garaj-Vrhovac from the laboratory of Mutagenesis, Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health, Zagreb, Croatia were published during 2000-2 and were identified during literature searches.65-70It was noted that there were apparent discrepancies between the different publications in the reporting of thedemographic data on exposed and controls and reporting of results of mutagenicity studies and no confidenc ecould be attached to the results. 8. The remaining 65 studies were undertaken from all parts of the world but the literature search did not find any published study which had evaluated UK pesticide applicators. The 65 studies were subject to areview procedure for the adequacy of the genotoxicity assessment. The COM discussed theexclusion /inclusion criteria at the October 2004 and February 2005 meeting and following a postal consultation after the February 2005 meeting. The criteria and selected studies are outlined in Annex 1tothis st atement.Annual Report 2005 96Figure 1: Flow Diagram of approach used by COM. Epidemiolog yoverview of biomonitoring studies 9. The 24 studies selected by COM using the exclusion /inclusion criteria were subjected to an epidemiology overview (see para 3 vii above). The full report can be accessed from the COM internet site (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /mut0511.pdf). One objective of the epidemiology overview was to attempt a quality ranking of studies.Exclusion/i nclusioncriteria Epidemiolo gy overview o fselec ted to MTP cited inrepo rtsIdentification o fpesticide applica tor gro ups Identification of ingredie nts for p otentialstudiesCorrelationwith U Kequivalent applica tiongroups (PUS )* *=Pesticide Usa ge Surveydata 9710. The Committee noted the conclusion reached in the epidemiology overview that all of the studies were limited in design, particularly with regard to measurement of exposure, study size, the assessment of selection and recruitment biases. Many of the studies provided information on demographics,medical history, lifestyle factors, potential occupational exposures to materials other than pesticides(e.g. solvents, radiation), and also information on type of pesticides used, duration and frequency of exposure and use of protective measures. However these data had generally not been used in theanalyses reported and the majority of papers did not provide a specific analysis of individual pesticides. It was noted that the majority of studies were not sufficiently large to allow an evaluation of all thevariables for which data might be available. Study designs were generally cross sectional, although a few had taken multiple samples (e.g. at different time points in a growing season). The time interval between exposure and sampling thus varied considerably between studies and this might affect the conclusionswhich could be drawn. There were limitations in the statistical approaches used in many of the studies.Thus for example many did not consider the form of the population distribution and made unsubstantiated assumptions that it was normal. The reporting of modelling was variable and in mostcases w as no tadequate. It was noted that the papers tended to focus on statistical significance even when the absolut edifferencebetw een groups was tiny. Overall it was not possible to identify any particular study that was clearly better in design and reporting than the other papers in the 24 studies identified by COM. 11. The C OMconsider ed the epidemiolog yovervie watits 26 May 2005 meeting. Members agreed that the review had highlighted and confirmed their views on the limitations of the data set. However members agreed to review the data in order to reach the most appropriate conclusions possible. COM Review of selected studies. 12.The COM considered the full published reports and a narrative summary of the selected evaluation 13. The COM undertook an evaluation of the control data from the 24 studies for micronuclei and chromosomal aberr ations in peripher al blood lymphocytes. Such an evaluation might aid in the assessment of the da tafrom studies and help t odecide wha tmagnitude of response was suggestive of apositive result. Modelling of the data from the 24 selected studies suggested that MN data were normal ly distribut ed whilst ther ewas evidenc efor a sk ewed distribution of CA as would be expected. Members felt the available data suggested that the distribution of chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes was consistent with an approximately binomial distribution, whilst distribution of micronuclei was much more dispersed than would be expected for binomial /Poisson distributions. It w as considered that there might be bimodal or trimodal distributions indicating possible subpopulation effects and that more data would help to resolve the actual distribution of these indicesin peripher al blood lymphoc ytes. The large overall variation in the negative control (reference) data (appr oxima tely 16 fold for micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations) suggested that it was not possible to define a single historical control range. Members agreed that statistical significance from adequatelyAnnual Report 2005 98conducted studies in combination with magnitude of response represented the most appropriate approach to evaluating the results of studies. Members agreed that the distribution of data should be assessed prior to consideration of the most appropriate statistical approach to analysis and that theeffect of confounding factors should be clearly evaluated. 14. The COM compared the magnitude of response seen in the 24 studies of pesticide applicators with that reported for patients undergoing treatment with cytostatic medicines and nurses occupationally exposed to these medicines. Members were surprised at the small magnitude of response in thebiomonitoring studies of nurses or patients exposed to cytostatic medicines. The mean fold increase in nurses (1.8, range 1.5-2.2) and in patients (mean 2.1, range 1.5-2.7) derived from studies for eithermicronuclei or chromosomal aberrations was similar to that reported for pesticide applicators in thestudies reviewed by COM (1.7, range 0.8-5). Members noted that the higher maximum fold increase inpesticide applica tors c ompar ed tonurses or pa tients exposed to cytostatic medicines might reflect differences in the extent of control for confounding factors between studies. 15. Members considered that the factors which accounted for the variance in the indices of genotoxicity in these biomonit ( chromosome aberr micr onucl ei predominantly in circulating blood lymphocytes) in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines had not been fully evaluated. The biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity were observed to differ considerably in the control popula tions of diff erent studies. Members concluded, therefore, that it was not possible to establish a minimum fold increase for biological importance that could be applied to studies of pesticide applica tors based on the studies in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines. Further, it was concluded that factors affecting variance in genotoxicity indices used in the biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators which had been reviewed were not understood adequately. In this respect members considered it would be very difficult to infer causality for the small magnitude responses seen in the biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators. There was a need for more data onthe background variability in the general population of biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity, and on factors affecting variance, which was required before a proper assessment of studies could be made. 16. Members agreed that consideration of statistical significance and magnitude of effects from adequately conducted studies was the most appropriate approach to evaluating the available data. Members confirmed that the available information was severely limited and hence no definite conclusions couldbe drawn with regard to any U.K. agricultural applications of pesticides or to individual pesticide active ingredients. However the COM agreed that it would be appropriate to consider what conclusions could be deriv ed from the selected studies. Consideration of available data on exposure from selected studies 17. The Committee noted the limited information on exposure. The only direct exposure measurements were reported in the study by Garry et al 18 for exposure to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Information had been provided on the identity of pesticides which applicators had used in 15 (11 reporting positiveresults and 4 r epor ting negative results) out of the 24 studies reviewed. 5,7,11,14-16,18,20,22,31,33,35,45,48,52This informa tion had been r eviewed in the context of information from the Pesticide Usage Survey regarding information on use over the period from 1993 up to 2002 and also with regard to the availableinforma tion on classifica tion egardtomutagenicity which had 99been provided by HSE. Members noted that apart from the study published by Garry et al18the magnitude of pesticide exposure in these studies had not been recorded and information on use ofpersonal protective clothing had not been documented in many reports. 18. A number of the published papers selected by the COM had reported information which supported the view that the lack of protective clothing used by pesticide applicators /workers was associated with evidence of increased genotoxicity indices in biomonitoring studies.11,15,22,32,45It was noted that there was some limited evidence to suggest that work practices in green house (such as avoiding use of protectiveclothing in humid conditions and on re-entry after pesticide applications) might be potential sources of pesticide exposure. 32,61,82It was also uncertain to what extent the application practices cited in the published reports were relevant to UK agricultural practice. In addition data from 2003 onwards onpesticide use was not available at the time of the COM consideration. 19. Using information from the Pesticide Usage Survey, the amount of metam sodium and carbendazim increased o ver part of the period 1993-2001 in floricultural and green house applications. The area of outdoor bulbs and f lowers sprayed with carbendazim was reported to increase. Increases in the use of bifenthrin, metam sodium and thiram were reported in agricultural practices. The Committee noted that with regard to pesticide active ingredients that were currently approved for use in the U.K. and which were also classified with regard to mutagenicity under EC /67/548, carbendazim was used in 4 /11 positive and 1 /4negative studies respectively.5,22,31,35,52This r epresented a very small and incomplete amount of informa tion. It w as no ted that one of these studies had used micronucleus or chromosomal aberration analy ses which could potentially be affected by spindle inhibitors such as benzimidazoles.,31However it is uncl ear whether the results derived from the comet assay22,35could be related to benzimidazoles and thereis no e videnc efor dir ectbinding of benzimidazoles to DNA and hence the results of the remaining DNA-adduct study52were unlikely to be related to benzimidazole exposure. It was noted that there wereanumber of o ther classified mut agens listed in the positive studies which were not approved for use in the U.K. 20. Members considered the Bolognesi et al 2004 study in detail as this was the only available study with provided data on the specific aneuploidy inducing effects of benzimidazoles.5Members c onfirmed tha t this study should be considered as negative using the criteria agreed by the COM during the review of studies of pesticide applica tors. Members agr eed this w as one of the bet ter studies which had been considered as the investigators had attempted to use a specific index of exposures to tubulin inhibitors such as carbendazim and benomyl, although there were limitations in the dosimetric accuracy of the index of exposure, in the small number of individuals studied and in the lack of correction for multiple comparisons used in the statistical analysis. Members considered that the results of the centromerespecific inv estigations were based on a very small number of individuals and no interpretation of biological significance could be placed on the data. The data provided in this study were consistent with the g eneral conclusions on interpretation given below in paragraphs 22 and 23. Consider ation of dat apresented on duration of exposure 21. There were limited data on estimated duration of exposure to pesticides in 6 out of the 24 selected studies.5,7,22,30,44,45Four of these studies reported a positive correlation between duration of exposure and increased indices of genotoxicity7,22,44,45whereas the remaining two studies reported a negativeAnnual Report 2005 100correlation.5,30The stratification into groups according to exposure was generally based on periods of 10 years or more. No rationale was given in the studies for the stratification of exposure groups accordingto duration of exposure. The magnitude of increased indices of genotoxicity with duration of exposurewas small in all of the studies. The Committee was aware that biomarkers of genotoxicity (such aschromosome aberrations and micronuclei) increase in frequency with age and that this potentialconfounding factor had not been considered adequately in the analyses reported. The Committee agreed it was not possible to draw any definite conclusions based on these data, although it is notedthat three out of four of the studies which reported on duration of exposure and which also reported a positive response had documented evidence for exposure to benzimidazole pesticides. Consideration of use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 22. None of the selected studies specifically investigated the effect of use of PPE on biomonitoring indices ofgenotoxic effects in pesticide applicators. The extent of PPE usage, where reported, varied consider ably. Thus in some reports, no PPE was used,29,30whilst o ther r eports describe conditions in which most pesticide applica tors use PPE .5,47Several studies r eported significant increases in chromosome aberrations and micronuclei correlated with a lack of PPE use during pesticide application.11,15,31,33It is noted that floriculturalists might report using PPE, but some investigators note that due to humid conditions within greenhouses appropriate PPE is not always worn. The Committeenoted that a correlation between the lack of use of PPE and increased biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity but concluded that no definite conclusions could be reached with regard to exposure to pesticides based on the a vailable data. COM Interpretation of available data 23. The Committee was aware of the guidance available for the conduct on biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity from Albertini et al 71but agreed that having considered a large data set of studies on pesticide applicators that more research and guidance on the factors affecting the background variance of biomonit oring indic es of genotoxicity was required before such studies could be fully interpreted particularly with regard to the significance of the small magnitude of response seen in the available studies. 24. The COM discussed whether any proposed study should focus on an occupational group (such as floriculture) or on specific pesticides. Members acknowledged that the evidence was limited particularly with regard to the design, conduct, reporting and analysis of the available studies both withrespect to identifying either an occupational category or specific pesticides. It was noted that a limitation in the a vailable published literature concerned relevant information on the mutagenicity of mixtur es of pesticides. Members w ereaware of the COT report on mixtures of pesticides benzimidaz oles as a possibl ecommon mechanism group of compounds for further evaluation. The Committee considered that although a UK study based on use of carbendazim in floriculture represented a reasonable proposal, there were considerable difficulties inundertaking and interpreting such a study. In particular it was agreed that more background informationon the factors affecting the variance of biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity in unexposed populationswould be required before a study of specific pesticide exposures was undertaken. If appropriate 101background information were available, then it was agreed that a longitudinal study where individuals acted as their own controls would be most appropriate. It was agreed that there was supporting evidence that biomonitoring for urinary excretion of 5-hydroxy-2-benzimidazole (5HBC) could be usedto assess exposure and uptake of carbendazim. 84Members commented that the application of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) specified for use of carbendazim products (such as in floriculture) in the U.K. meant that it was unlikely that any increase in genotoxicity could be detected with any reliability. Anysuch study would have to be very large and there were doubts as to whether an appropriate exposure group could be identified. COM conclusions 25. The Committee was aware that no DNA reactive in-vivo mutagens were used as active ingredients in appr oved formula ted pesticide products in the U.K. It was noted that benzimidazoles were used in a number of approved pesticide products since a risk assessment could be undertaken for the threshold related effects of these active ingredient on microtubule inhibition. The Committee confirmed that the available information was severely limited and hence no definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to any U.K. agricultural applications of pesticides or to individual pesticide active ingredients. TheCOM concluded; i)The C OMreview was based on 70 retrieved published studies of biomonitoring of genotoxicity in pesticide applicators. The evidence covered a large number of types of applications and a wide diversity of pesticide mixtures. The COM selected 24 studies from which conclusions could be drawn through the application of a quality screen of retrieved studies. An independent epidemiological overview of these 24 studies reported that all had significant design and evaluation faults. The COM agreed that any conclusions reached on this evidence would be limited by the poor quality of the available studies. ii)The C OMagreed that following a review of the 24 selected studies there was limited evidence supporting increased biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity in biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators. The Committee agreed that it was not possible to make any conclusions regarding exposure-response from the selected biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity because of the inadequacy and unreliability of exposure measurements and the generally small increases inresponse. The Committee noted that there was no published study of pesticide applicators using pesticide mixtures in the U.K. iii) The Committee agreed that the factors which accounted for the variance in biomonitoring indices ofgenotoxicity (chromosome aberrations and micronuclei predominantly in circulating blood lymphocytes) in nurses and cancer patients exposed to cytostatic medicines and in pesticideapplicators had not been fully evaluated. It was not possible to define a minimum increase in biomonitors of genotoxicity associated with cytostatic medicines from the available studies onnurses and cancer patients. Based on these observations and the large inter-study variation for thebiomonit oring indices of genotoxicity in unexposed populations, the Committee concluded that it would be v ery difficult to infer causality for the small magnitude responses seen in the biomonitoring studies of pesticide applicators. There was a need for more data on the backgroundvariabilit yin the g eneral population of biomonitoring indices of genotoxicity, and on factors affecting v ariance, which was required before a proper assessment of studies could be made.Annual Report 2005 102iv) The COM agreed that it is very difficult to draw conclusions on what might be the most appropriate biomonitoring study for U.K. pesticide applicators. There was some very limited evidence to suggest that an appropriate study of floriculturalists using benzimidazoles (e.g. carbendazim) might representareasonable proposal. The Committee concluded that in view of the large numbers of individuals which would be required in order to detect an effect in such a study it was most unlikely that a sufficiently large and appropriate exposure group could be identified.

Halonitromethanes (HNM's) are a class of compound characterised by the presence of one or more halogen atoms together with a nitro moiety on a single central carbon. They differ from theHalomethanes (HM's) by the presence of the nitro moiety. The HNM's have recently been identified asdisinfection by-products (DBP) in drinking water in the US (Richardson et al 1999) and had received a high priority ranking for investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency (Weinberg et al 2002 tareview was initiated following the submission of one of papers published on the HNM's by a member of the COM. 2. Members were told that the only available published data related to the in-vitro studies in the three publica tions (Pl ewaet al 2004, Kundu et al 2004a, b). Some pr eliminary findings had been r epor ted by the EPA to the DH Toxicology Unit regarding in-vivo testing of the HNM's in transgenic medaka fish. Members no ted the availability of an NTP that there were no appropriate in-viv omutagenicit y data available for other HNMs. Data considered by the COM 3. The C OMdiscussed the in-vitr oCOMET studies, c onducted using CHO cells (Plewa et al 2004). Members no ted tha tHNMs t ested were cytotoxic in CHO cells and that apoptosis induction had not been recorded in these studies. In addition none of the trials had included the addition of an exogenous metabolising fr action. Ho wever members agreed that HNMs were genotoxic in this test system and that the rank order reported by the study authors was a reasonable guide to relative potency for in-vitro DNA damage. It was noted that the data precluded a determination of absolute potency of HNMs compared to the positive controls used in the study but the data were consistent with HNMs being more potent in the test system than ethyl methanesulphonate. 4. The C OMreviewed the available bacterial mutagenicity data obtained from plate incorporation trials using Salmonella typhimurium strains both in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolising fraction (Kundu et al 2004a). The strains tested included TA 98, TA 100, TA 104 and a strain RSJ100 which expresses rat glutathione transferase theta (GSTT1-1) known to activate halomethanes. Members agreed that the standard plate incorporation approach had been undertaken in this study used two plates perdose point (instead of the normal three) but that reproducible small increases in the number of revertant colonies had been reported. It was noted that HNMs might volatilise and thereforeprocedures to prevent evaporation might have been more appropriate. In a further study (Kundu et al 2004b) trials had been undertaken using pre-incubation in screw-capped glass vials using Salmonella typhimur iumstrain T A100 a t370Cfor 30 minut es followed by plate incorporation assessment of revertant colonies. Members felt that some residual loss of HNMs could still have occurred and that itAnnual Report 2005 116Halonitromethanes (HNMs)would have been appropriate to undertake pre-incubation at a lower temperature of 300C. Overall members considered that the estimates of relative potency for in-vitro mutagenesis in Salmonella should be interpreted with caution. COM evaluation of the data 5. Members considered the potential mechanisms of HNM induced mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains and agreed this included the potential for both direct acting and metabolically activated mutagenic responses. This might include an oxidative pathway but it was evident that there were possible differences between the nine chemicals in the HNM group. Whether direct activity was due to HNM carbocation formation (loss of the halogen resulting in a reactive, positively chargedcarbon) and DNA alkylation in an SN1 reaction or alternatively SN2 substitution (in which nucleophilic attack precedes halogen loss), was not clear. Members felt that, unlike the halomethane group ofcompounds, there was no convincing evidence for a glutathione mediated pathway with HNMs.Members observed that it was difficult to derive clear conclusions regarding mechanism and potency inthe bacterial mutagenicity tests, but overall brominated HNMs appeared from the limited data to be morepotent in-vitr omutagens than chlorinated HNMs. 6. The COM discussed the potential testing strategy that might be applied to HNMs and agreed that each individual HNM needed t obe tested. It was agreed that the standard COM strategy was appropriate in this inst ancebut should be modified so tha Sassay was the first in-viv otest. Members f elt that a liver UDS assay would be more appropriate than the more usual in-viv o micronucleus test because of the likelihood that potential direct acting chemicals or reactive intermedi ates w ould no treach the bone marrow intact. Also, due to the presence of potentially direct acting mutagens a site of contact assay was considered appropriate (for example the COMET assay in the st omach). Members f elt tha tan in-vitr oliver UD Sassaywould be a useful pr e-screen. COM overall conclusions 7.Overall, in accordance with the COM strategy, HNM's should be regarded as in-vitr omutagens and potential in-vivo mutagens. It was considered that there was a need for appropriate in-vivo testing. The COMsuggested:- a) in-vivo rat liver UDS assay, followed by b) site of contact COMET assay 8. If either of these studies yielded positive results, then the chemical under test should be considered to be an in-vivo mutagen. This resulting statement could be shared with the EPA.

Flunixin in the form of the meglumine salt is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a non- narcotic analgesic drug with antipyretic activities. It is used in veterinary medicine (including food-producing animals) but is not used in human medicine. Flunixin meglumine dissociates in vivo to Flunixin and meglumine. In the European Medicine Evaluation Agency's (EMEA) Committee on VeterinaryMedicinal Products (CVMP) considered the safety of Flunixin meglumine as part of its review of old veterinary medicinal pr oduc ts, oper ating under mark eting authorisation of pharmacologically active substances used in veterinary medicines. 2. With regard to meglumine, the CVMP considered that it could be regarded as an excipient that had the purpose of incr easing the solubilit yof Flunixin. The CVMP c oncluded tha t\"meglumine used an excipient at up to 1.5 mg /kg bw does not fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) number 2377/90\". 3. The Food Standards Agency is concerned about the possible mutagenicity of Flunixin meglumine, meglumine and Flunixin. The Food Standards Agency considered that it would be useful to seek theopinion of the COM. 4. The C OMunder took an initial review of the mutagenicity data on Flunixin meglumine, Flunixin and meglumine during 2002 /2003. A statement was published in March 2003 (www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /com /flunmeg). The COM requested additional in-vitro mutagenicity data on meglumine, which is considered in this statement. Assessment of Mutagenicity data - Flunixin 5. In the statement COM /03/S2, the COM agreed that there was limited evidence that Flunixin was mutaganic in-vitro ,as data were inadequate, but there was no evidence to suggest that Flunixin had mutagenic potential in vivo ,asabone-marrow assay was carried out in mice that was considered adequate by the COM. Members, however, considered that the issue of the inadequate in-vitro data should be r aised with the CVMP . Assessment of Mutagenicity data - Meglumine 6. In the st atement C OM /03/S2,negativeresults were reported in an old plate incorporation assay in a limited number of Salmonella typhimurium strains. A positive result had been reported in a bone- marr owmicronucl eus assa yin BSI mic 1000 mg /kg bw suspended in 0.25% methylcellulose (two doses given 24 hours apart and harvest 6 hours after lastdose). A repeat test using 1000 mg /kg bw was also positive. Members queried how the repeat test could 119Flunixin, Meglumine and Flunixin Megluminehave been undertaken on the same day as the initial test. It was noted that negative results were obtained in a separate in-vivo micronucleus assay using intraperitoneal administration of two doses given 24 hours apart at up to 600 mg /kg bw of meglumine to CD1 mice. Members noted that a clear positive control had only been seen in males and not females in this latter assay and that the samplingregimen (24 and 48 hours after last dose) differed from the study in BS1 mice. A number of in-vivo bone marrow micronucleus assays were undertaken for the Committee using a variety of single /double intraperitoneal dosing regimens at dose levels of 500 mg /kg bw and 1000 mg /kg bw and sampling for micronuclei at 6 or 24 h after the last dose. There was some evidence for an effect 6 h after the seconddose in one study using Alpk:ApfCD-1 mice, but no definite conclusions could be reached as the result was not repeatable, there was considerable individual animal variation and the observed effect could have been complicated by toxicity. Assessment of Mutag enicity da ta - Fl unixin megl umine 7. In the statement COM /03/2the Committee agreed that there was limited evidence that Flunixin meglumine w asanin-vitr omutagen. However, although negative results had been documented in an in- vivo micronucleus assay in BS1 mice, members were concerned about adequacy of the selection of dose levels. Therefore the inconclusive in-vivo data on meglumine suggested that a definite conclusion regarding Flunixin meglumine could not be reached. COM Evaluation 8. The Committee noted the poor quality of mutagenicity data on flunixin, meglumine and Flunixin meglumine. Members noted that while negative results obtained in carcinogenicity bioassays with Flunixin meglumine in the rat and the mouse provided some reassurance with regard to flunixin, they were not informative with regard to meglumine. 9.The C ommit tee was -marr owmicronucleus assays using meglumine but noted that the results were inconsistent. Two studies using BS1 and Alpk:ApfCD-1 mice reported a mutagenic effect following a treatment regime of two doses of meglumine (24 hour apart) with a sampling time of 6 hours after the second dose (i.e. 30 hours after the first dose). However this positive result was not repeated in two bone marrow micronucleus assays in mice using an equivalent treatmentregime. 10. The Committee requested additional in-vitro assays with meglumine to properly assess whether meglumine had mutagenic potential in vitro before considering the need for any further in-vivo mutagenicity studies. Thus data were required from an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay and a mouse lymphoma assay, which together with the data currently available for a test in bacteria usingSalmonella, would complete the in-vitro package to modern standards given in the COM guidance. If these were negative, there would be no concerns regarding meglumine.Annual Report 2005 120Data submitted in February 2005 Mouse Lymphoma Assay 11. A Mouse Lymphoma Assay was undertaken that conformed to the OECD Guideline 4761and ICH S2B Guideline.2,3 12. Meglumine was not mutagenic, at the concentrations tested in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, either with or without exogenous metabolic activation. Chromosome Aberration Assay 13. A cytogenetics test was undertaken which conformed to OECD Guideline 473.4,5 14. Meglumine, at the concentrations tested, did not significantly increase chromosome aberrations or decrease the mitotic index in human blood lymphocytes in vitro ,either with or without exogenous metabolic ac tivation. COM conclusion and recommendations 15. The C OMconfirmed the following general conclusions on the mutagenicity of flunixin, Flunixin meglumine and meglumine i) The mutagenicity previously to the Committee on flunixin, Flunixin meglumine and meglumine are relatively old and the studies have not been conducted to contemporary standards. 16. The COM reaffirmed that it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions on the mutagenicity of these chemicals. The prudent c onclusions r eached for flunixin and eroidal lammatory veterinary evidence that Flunixin was mutagenic in-vitro but there was no evidence to suggest that flunixin had mutagenic potential in-vivo . iii) For Flunixin meglumine, (Flunixin in the form of the meglumine salt) there is limited evidence for a mutagenic effect in-vitro .In addition the inconclusive in-vivo data on indicate that a definit econclusion r egarding Flunixin meglumine cannot be reached. 17. The COM agreed a revised conclusion for meglumine using the new information from the in-vitro mutagenicity studies considered in this statement. 121iv) For meglumine, the available in-vivo mutagenicity data are inconsistent with some positive and negative results. The new in-vitro mutagenicity tests (namely a mouse lymphoma assay and a chromosome aberration assay using human blood lymphocytes) were conducted to internationallyaccepted standards. There was no evidence for a mutagenic effect in either of these two assayseither in presence of absence of exogenous metabolic activation. The COM concluded that there was no further requirement for testing of meglumine. March 2005 COM /05/S1Annual Report 2005 122References 1. OECD. 1997. Test guideline 476.

The COM and COC undertake routine horizon scanning exercises as part of their annual remit (see appended internet links at the end of this statement). The COM identified the use of in-vivo target organ mutagenicity studies as a subject for further consideration. The COM and COC agreed to hold a joint meeting on the use of data derived from in-vivo target organ mutagenicity studies in carcinogenrisk assessment. An open meeting of the committees was held on the 9 June 2005. Attendees includedanumber of ext ernal exper ts who g ave presentations and comments to the committees discussions. This brief st atement has been dr afted to record the main outcomes of the meeting. A full write up is being prepared for publication in a peer review journal. Introduction to current review 2. The interpretation and consequent risk assessment of rodent carcinogenicity data is currently aided by the evaluation of a battery of mutagenicity data.1However there are examples of compounds for which equiv ocal data, or lack of concordance between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data make it difficult to complete the risk assessment. This is of particular importance when the organ in which tumours are found is no tone of those assessed during in viv ogenotoxicity tests. Recent developments have facilitated the identification of target organ mutagenicity thus offering the potential to more closely define whether tumours seen are attributable to specific mutagenic of r odent car cinog ens ar ebeing investigated using the Big Blue or MutaMouse transgenic systems. (For example the COM and COC have recently evaluated transgenic mutation assays as part of the evaluation of malachite green and leucomalachite green.2An important contribution of these assays is that any tissue can be evaluated for the presence of mutations following the administration of a chemical by any exposure route. By demonstrating carcinogen target organmutagenesis, it can then be inferred that conditions are favourable for DNA reactivity therein (e.g. the occurrence of site-specific metabolism). Site of contact mutagenesis can also be readily studied. 4 Additional ly,sequencing of both the lac genes and cII is now commonplace and this provides information on the more precise nature of the induced mutations. It is considered that these analyseswillcontribut etothe understanding of target organ tumourigenesis and subsequent risk assessment. 5 There are several examples in the published literature of how data from Big Blue or MutaMouse have aided carcinogen risk assessment.6-8Annual Report 2005 124STATEMENT ON JOINT COC AND COM MEETING 9 June 2005The Comet assay 4. The comet assay is now well established as a supplementary assay to the standard battery of genotoxicity tests and can be used to assist in evaluating chemical which have given equivocal results inother in-vivo mutagenicity tests or to investigate the potential mechanisms of tumourigenic responses.9,10Guidelines and recommendations for performing the assay have recently been developed.11 The principle concerns that may arise in respect of the use of the comet assay are the relevance of the measured endpoint to the carcinogenic process, and the robustness and sensitivity of the method. DNA binding approaches 5. The COM considered the measurement of DNA binding by a number of methods (e.g. postlabelling, radioimmunochemical and )in 1996.12The C OMagreed tha tthese methods could provide useful data on exposure to and uptake of DNA reactive chemicals and metabolites. More recently the COC has considered the application of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) in the detection of DNA binding in biological samples.13AMS is the most sensitiv etechnique for measuring the formation of adducts with DNA. AMS technology allows the accurate measurement of very low levelsof radiolabelled chemicals (particularly 14C) in biological samples at around 10-21to 10-18mole. The COC considered that one potential application of AMS was in hazard identification. AMS has provided evidenc efor a lack of DNA binding of 2-phenylphenol and its met abolit es in r atbladder which has been impor tant information in concluding a non-genotoxic mechanism for the carcinogenic effect of 2- phenylphenol and its sodium salt in r at bladder.14. Overview of joint COM /COC meeting on target organ mutagenicity studies 6. The symposium was attended by Committee members, relevant officials from government agencies and delegates from industry and academia, took the form of introductory presentations followed by round- tablediscussion groups. A programme was published.15 Overview of presentations 7. Professor John Heddle (Y ork University, Toronto, Canada) gave the first presentation and provided a comprehensive overview of the usefulness of the transgenic mouse and rat mutation assays in carcinogenicity risk assessment. His principal observations were that the transgenes lac I and lac Z, are neutr al genes which persist and accumulate mutations linearly over time, ensuring consistency in response which has allowed for the development of optimum protocols, notably the establishment of expression periods. The C ommit tee noted the relevance of persistent mutations in transgenes to the initiation-promotion model of carcinogenesis. 8. Professor David Phillips (Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton) gave a brief synopsis on the use of DNA adduct detection methodologies in providing evidence of genotoxic mechanisms of action. Thesetechniques are constantly being improved. DNA adduct formation represents mutagenic and carcinog enic potential, but it is recognised that the presence of DNA adducts in a particular tissue does not necessarily correlate with tumour induction. 1259. Dr Brian Burlinson (HLS) summarised recent developments in the use of the COMET assay, which was gaining in popularity as a second tissue in vivo mutagenicity assay, to supplement the in-vivo bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei. One advantage was that a number of tissuesincluding any tumour target organ could be included in any study. It was noted that a draft OECDguideline was currently under consideration. 10. Dr Phil Carthew (Unilever) presented the pathologists view of the usefulness of target organ mutagenicity data. He pointed out that lack of concordance between mutation frequency, DNA adductsand tumour burden indicate a need to understand more definitively the importance of other steps in the carcinogenic process. However, it is anticipated that data from transgenic mutation assays will beable to provide answers to critical questions, principally with view to hypothesis testing and mode ofaction evaluation. Group discussions 11. Delegates then split into two groups for the ensuing discussions. Group 1 considered methodological developments, r obustness, sensitivit yand t arget or gan specificity of the assays under scrutiny, whilst Group 2 addressed specifically the use of target organ mutagenicity data in carcinogenicity risk assessment thr ough questions such as 'how can these data be used to understand the aetiology / pathog enesis of r odent tumours?' and 'are these data likely to be more useful for the evaluation of some tumours types and /or target organs?'. Conclusions from Group discussions 12. Group 1 (methods) derived conclusions on the use of the assays considered during the symposium with regard to the screening of chemicals for potential in-vivo mutagenesis. It was concluded that the transgenic mutation assays were sufficiently robust for general use and that moves should be made to optimise assa yconditions and de velop protocol guidelines. There were some concerns regards overall sensitivity and this may be particularly relevant when using unusual tissues or chemicals about which little is known (e.g. nature of DNA damage, ADME profile). Nevertheless, it was felt that the limitations of transgenic mutation assays were fairly well understood and this added to a general feeling of confidence in their use. However, it was recognised that the expense of conducting the transgenicassays meant that it was likely that the COMET assay would be used more frequently, even though this was more suited to detecting clastogens and potentially less sensitive at identifying point mutagens. The COMET assay was considered to be satisfactorily validated in most tissues. DNA adducts were not considered useful in a risk assessment scenario, and more likely to be of value for weight of evidence appr oaches t ounderst anding carcinogenic mechanisms. 13. Group 2 (risk assessment) derived conclusions on the use of target organ mutation assays in carcinogen risk assessment, i.e. as part of mode-of-action assessments. It was concluded that the in-vivo targetorgan mutagenesis /genotoxicity assays provided important information for the mode-of-action evaluations for rodent cancer target organs and thus contribute to carcinogen risk assessment. It was consider ed important to ensure adequate conduct of studies particularly with regard to information on target cell exposure and potential modes of action. In general, positive results which are not due to highdose c ytotoxicity, inflammation or reactive oxygen DNA damage support a non-threshold genotoxicAnnual Report 2005 126mode of action and that negative results need to be interpreted with regard to the sensitivity of the study used. Clearly, concordant results for several in-vivo approaches increase the confidence of conclusions reached. Overall conclusion 14. The COM and COC agreed that data from adequately conducted in-vivo carcinogen target organ mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies (which included information from investigations using transgenicanimals, the comet assay, and approaches to measuring DNA binding (e.g. postlabelling and radiolabel methods) can provide valuable information of use in the mode-of action of carcinogenic responsesseen in rodents.

The membership of the committee, agendas and minutes of meetings, and statements are all publishedon the internet (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /coc /index.htm). During 2005, the Committee provided advice on a wide range of topics, including the chemicals furan, proquinazid, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) potential carcinogenicity of nanomaterials. It also completed its review of the potential chemical aetiology of childhoodcanc er,in par ticular ,the possible association between childhood leukaemia and living near sour ces of tr affic exhaust and petr ol fumes. The assessments of furan, proquinazid, PFOS and PFOA were undertaken in conjunction with its sister committee, the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM). The assessment of nanoma terial toxicolog ywas under taken jointly with the COM and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT). The COC gives advice on generic issues and on new developments in chemical carcinogenicity. The COC held a suc cessful joint meeting with the C OMin June on the use of target organ mutagenicity data in carcinogen risk assessment. During the course of the year, the COC also considered the development by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) of the mode of action approach for chemical carcinogens to generate guidance on how to assess the relevance of an animal carcinogens to humans. This was my last full year as chairman of the committee, as I stand down in March 2006. It has been a valuabl eand rewarding experience. I would like to record my thanks and appreciation of the work carried out by members of the committee during my 10 year tenure as chairman and of the support of the scientific and administr ativesecretariat. My successor as chairman is David Phillips, who is Professor of Environmental Carcinog enesis a tthe Institut eofCanc er Research. Iwish him well and am sure he will lead the committee successfully through new challenges in the future. Professor PG Blain CBE (Chairman) BMedSci CHEMICALS IN FOOD, CONSUMERPRODUCTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Carcinogenesis mode of action and human relevance framework 3.1 The International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) has developed a framework for evaluating modes of action (MOA) of chemical carcinogens. The COC reviewed the IPCS MOA framework in 1999and endorsed the proposed approach. Since then, the initial framework has been used by a working group under the sponsorship of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and ILSI Risk Science Institute (RSI) to develop guidance on how to assess the relevance of an animal carcinogen to humans, based on MOA data. This 'Human Relevance Framework' (HRF) is based on the premise that, once anMOA has been established for the tumourigenic effects of a chemical in experimental animals, a systematic analysis of the individual key events comprising that MOA should enable its relevance to humans to be determined. 3.2 At its April 2005 meeting ,the C OC c onsider ed a paper published in 2003 which describes the HRF and includes seven case studies. A further three evaluations of anonymised pesticides carried out by Defra's Pesticides Safety Directorate were also considered. 3.3Members no ted tha tthe HRF appr oach ext ended the MOA approach by considering whether the key events in the MOA are plausible in humans, taking into account kinetic and dynamic factors. They also noted the advantages of collaborative working to enable a consensus view to be reached where therewas bo th conflicting evidence and conflicting views in the published literature about the mechanism of carcinogenesis of a chemical. One particular value of the HRF approach was considered to be that data were presented in a structured format which allowed gaps in the data to be readily identified. It was hoped that completion of the case studies would provide generic evaluations, limiting the need forduplication of effort. The COC concluded that both the MOA and HRF approaches provided a logical framework in which to set the information needed when assessing the relevance of chemical induced animal tumours to humans. Childhood canc er Overview 3.4 The COC began a review of childhood cancer in 2004. It was asked to evaluate the published literature on whether there was an increased incidence of childhood cancer in the UK and to address whether evidenc efrom epidemiological studies suggests a possible chemical aetiology. Based on the available epidemiological data, four childhood tumours were identified as being relevant for further consideration: (NBT). 3.5 The COC obtained expert advice from the UK Childhood Cancer Group (UKCCRG) and the Newcastle Childhood Canc er Group on whether the reported increased incidences in these tumours was accounted for by better ascertainment. UKCCRG data confirmed an upward trend in the incidence of allfourtumours. The incr ease in ALL w as considered to be to some extent a true increase in incidence. However, chemical pollution was unlikely to be a significant risk factor. It was not clear if the upward trends in the incidence of childhood CNS tumours and germ cell tumours were real or due to betterdiagnosis. Advic ewas received that there is an increase in neuroblastomas but probably largely in benign tumours, under 1 year of age, and due to better diagnosis.Annual Report 2005 1343.6 Overall, Members considered the evidence for a chemical aetiology for these tumours to be weak. The COC discussed the possible role of transplacental carcinogens and paternal exposure, and the significance of animal models in the risk assessment of childhood cancer. It was pointed out that anyrisk assessment modelling of transplacental carcinogenesis needed to separate genotoxic compoundsand non-genotoxic compounds. The possible association between childhood leukaemia and residence near sources of traffic exhaust and petrol fumes 3.7 The COC was asked by the Department of Health Air Pollution Unit to advise on three epidemiology studies which had investigated whether there was an association between residence near to petrol stations, garages, and road traffic exhaust fumes and the occurrence of childhood leukaemia. The COCsubsequently conducted a full review of the epidemiological literature on this topic. It concluded thatthe a vailable evidence provided insufficient evidence from which to conclude that there was an association between risk of childhood leukaemia and proximity to petrol stations, garages and roadtraffic. A full statement can be found at the end of this report. Consider ation of paper by Knox et al on \"Childhood cancers and atmospheric carcinogens (Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2005), volume 59, pp 101-105) 3.8 The C OCwas ask ed toconsider this paper by the Department of Health. The paper reports an investigation of the relation between major sources (\"hotspots\") of emissions of a range of pollutants, taken from Internet maps for 2001 complied from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, andbirth and death addresses of children dying from cancer between 1966 and 1980. It reports a positive associ ation betw een dea ths from cancer and hotspots for a number of air pollutants. 3.9 The COC noted a number of problems with the paper and concluded that they were unable to draw any conclusions from the study, because of flawed methodology and the inadequate information provided. Furan 3.10Furan is used as an industri al chemical or in the synthesis of c ommercial compounds. It is also present as a contaminant in air, tobacco smoke and many foods and beverages. The FSA sought the advice of the COT on the toxicity of furan during 2005 and the COT referred it to the COC for advice on carcinogenicity. 3.11 The COC noted that furan is rapidly and extensively absorbed and distributed following administration torats. A k eyreactive metabolite is cis-2-butene-1,4-dial. Two NTP studies have indicated that furan increases the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in rats, hepatocellular tumours in rats and mice,phaeochromocytoma of the adrenal gland in mice, and mononuclear cell leukaemia in rats. At least twopossible modes of action for furan-induced liver changes have been described: altered cell proliferationand oxidative stress mechanisms. 1353.12 The COC heard that the COM had concluded that furan should be regarded as an in vitro mutagen, but that there was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion on the available in vivo mutagenicity data. 3.13 Recent work conducted by a group from the University of Birmingham in collaboration with AstraZeneca had examined the role of oxidative stress in the induction of cholangiocarcinoma in the rat. A representative from AstraZeneca gave a presentation of the findings to the COC. He outlined what is known about cholangiocarcinomas in humans, specifically, that many oncogenes, including p53, are up regulated. In rats, these tumours are induced by potent genotoxins and also by proposed non-genotoxic mechanisms (coumarin), when the same oncogenic changes are apparent. The 'furan' model of tumour formation is the best characterised. In this model, administration of furan results incharacteristic morphological changes in the liver: intestinal metaplasia, diffuse centrilobular toxicity andadistinct focal response in the portal tracts. Notably, only particular lobes are affected. Administration of fur an for one month is sufficient t ocause tumours b yone y ear.Areas expressing the enzyme CYP2E1 correlate with areas of necrosis and p53 activation, although it is noted that CYP2E1 is down regulated on continued administration. In areas where the periportal damage occurs, ductal cells develop as early as da y3, although only in the target lobes. This lesion spreads, becomes surrounded by basement membrane, and is infiltrated by intestinal metaplasia and capilliarisation of the damaged area. If furanadministration is discontinued, the properties of intestinal metaplasia are maintained. High, cytotoxicdoses are required to elicit this response. 3.14 Members proposed the following mode of action: the cytotoxic intermediate generated by CYP2E1 was stimula ting the regenerative response via oval cell proliferation and /or bili ary progenitor cells. The intestinal infiltration seen may be a secondary response. Phenotypic changes were evidently being induced by the chronic inflammatory response, although it was not clear how furan was activating the mechanism leading to the response. It was unfortunate that no data were available on the response at low doses i.e. below those used in the NTP study, where cholangiocarcinoma occurred at all doselevels. 3.15 In conclusion, the COC considered that it was reasonable to hypothesise that there was a threshold for the mechanism for induction of cholangiocarcinoma but this needed further investigation before a decision could be made. It was suggested that the following were required: carcinogenicity studies with lower doses of furan, in vivo mutagenicity data, and information on metabolite production and the contribution of metabolites to an oxidative stress mechanism. The COC noted that the mode of action for cholangiocarcinoma may not be applicable to the other tumours induced by furan but commented thatthe strain of rat used in the NTP study was known to have a high incidence of mononuclear cell leukaemia and that the phaeochromocytomas in the mouse may arise from a neuroendocrinological mechanism. acid (PFOA) are chemicals based on an eight carbon linear mol ecule (some branched chain and lower alkane fluorinated carbon impurities ma ybe pr esent at low levels). PFOS and PFOA have unusual physico-chemical properties, forming microdispersion micelles in aqueous systems. PFOS and related compounds are used as inindustri al and household applica tions. PFO Ais used in industri al applications and is also produced byAnnual Report 2005 136environmental degradation of some PFOS precursors and fluorotelomer alcohols. The PFOS salt in most widespread use is ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO). PFOS and PFOA are persistent and bioaccumulative and could potentially enter the food chain. The FSA sought the advice of the COT onthe toxicity of furan during 2005 and the COT sought the advice of the COC on the carcinogenicity ofthese chemicals. PFOS 3.17 The COC the PFOS, in Sprague-Dawley rats. Non- neoplastic eff ects reported in the liver included increased absolute and relative liver weight, hepatocellular cystic degeneration and hepatocellular hypertrophy (often associated with vacuolation), with a NOAEL of 2 parts PFOS per million parts diet (2 ppm). No signs of hepatotoxicity were evident 52weeks after cessation of administration of the highest dose for 52 weeks. The incidence ofhepa tocellular adenomas was significantly increased at the 20 ppm level in both male and female rats. There was a single hepatocellular carcinoma in the female high dose group. The incidence of thyroidfollicular cell adenoma was significantly increased in the male high dose recovery group, but not in themaleand f emal ehigh dose gr oups f ed PFOS f or 10 4weeks. The study had investigated treatment- related effects on hepatic palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activity, but the COC considered that the time points atwhich activity was measured were not optimal for this endpoint. 3.18The C OC also r eviewed the r esults of a diet ary carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats in which N- ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido ethanol ( N-EtFOSE) was administered at dose levels of 3, 30 and 100 ppm in the diet f or 104 weeks. This compound has been shown to degrade to PFOS. No significant treatment-related effects were observed at 2 years. However, survival in all groups, including the controls, was relatively poor. There was evidence of hepatocellular hypertrophy in high dose males and femal es. The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was slightly higher in high dose male and female groups than in controls. A single hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in a high dose female. 3.19 Two limited epidemiological studies (a retrospective mortality study and an 'episodes of care' analysis) had been conducted in occupationally exposed populations. Cohorts were relatively small and also relatively young. The COC noted that, in the retrospective cohort mortality study, standardised mortality ratios were below one for all causes of death and all malignant neoplasms when analyses were restricted to workers with at least one year of employment and high exposure to PFOS. There was astatistical ly significant increase in deaths from malignant neoplasms of the bladder in males with over 5years in high exposure jobs. Members questioned the adequacy of exposure assessment by using job categories and noted that there had been potential exposure of the workers to benzidine, a known bladder carcinogen. The COC advised that, overall, it was not possible to draw definite conclusions from this study. The episode of care analysis was considered unusual in design and uninformative. 3.20 In conclusion, the COC concluded that there was equivocal evidence for carcinogenicity in the animal studies, limited to hepatocellular adenoma, and that the NOAEL was 5 ppm. It further concluded that athreshold appr oach c ould be used for the risk assessment of PFOS. The COC noted that a mode of action inv olving per oxisome proliferation had been proposed but was not convinced that adequate evidence had been provided to support this. 137PFOA 3.21 The carcinogenicity of PFOA has been investigated in two dietary exposure studies in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) was administered at levels of 0, 30, or 300 ppmin the diet f or 104 weeks. Dose-related non-neoplastic liver effects included megalocytosis, cystoid degeneration and portal mononuclear infiltration. A significant increase in the incidence of mammary fibroadenoma in female rats was considered by the study authors not to be related to treatment on the basis of comparisons with the incidence in historical control data. Similarly, a dose-related increase inthe incidence of Leydig cell adenomas was not significant compared to the historical control incidence. The COC noted that there were at least two viral infections in the rats used in this study andconsidered that this limited its value. In the second study, a single high dietary dose of PFOA (300 ppm)was administered for 24 months. significantly increased in treated animals. 3.22 The COC noted that a hypothesis had been put forward which proposed that PFOA induces liver, Leydig celland pancr eatic acinar aPPAR-alpha activation and that, therefore, these tumours are unlikely to be induced in humans. However, Members noted that PFOA showed indications of oestr ogenicity, possibly via aromatase induction, and thus it was not possible to be certain that all toxic effects were mediated via peroxisome proliferation. They were informed of some recently retrieved research which indicated that PFOA had effects on liver weight in PPAR-alpha null mice. The committee agreed with a proposal that the observed increases in serum estradiol levels suggested a mode of action for the Leydig cell tumours. However, it considered that it was not possible to propose modes of action for the liver and pancreatic tumours observed in the second study. However, the committee concluded that it would be acceptable to use a threshold approach for the risk assessment of PFOA i.e. to select an appropriate NOAEL for a precursor event for the most sensitive tumour and to apply an uncertaintyfactor of 100. 3.23 In two linked, retrospective cohort studies of mortality in an occupationally exposed population, small increases were reported in death from cancer of the large intestine and from cancer of the prostate in employees with over 1 year definite exposure to PFOA. The COC considered that none of the effects reported were significant for the risk assessment of PFOA. Proquinazid 3.24 Proquinazid (6-iodo-2-propoxy-3-propyl-3H-quinazoli-4-one) is a novel fungicide under consideration by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP). It is intended for use in agriculture and viticulture, providing control of powdery mildew in cereals and grapes. The ACP sought advice from the COC andCOM on an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in female rats in a carcinogenicity study with proquinazid. 3.25 At its meeting on 14 July 2005, the C OC hear dapresentation from representatives of the data holders, Du P ont, on the int erpretation of the cholangiocarcinomas. Du Pont representatives noted that proquinazid was not genotoxic, that cholangiocarcinomas of the \"intestinal\" type occurred only infemal erats fed 600 ppm or mor eat the end of the two-year study, the tumour type was linked toAnnual Report 2005 138chronic hepatocellular injury with \"cholangiofibrosis\" and there was no risk of the lesion occurring in the absence of severe hepatic toxicity. A number of representative sections were shown to COC members. It was noted that the lesions termed \"cholangiocarcinoma\" were quite unlike the usual pattern seen inhuman cholangiocarcinoma. COC members supported the view that the lesions were not neoplastic butwere a florid inflammatory response to severe acute and chronic hepatocellular damage. 3.26 The COC concluded that it was uncertain that the lesions termed \"cholangiocarcinomas\" were truly neoplastic but accepted the conventionality, used by the study pathologist in the report of thecarcinogenicity study, of classifying them as neoplastic. Members considered that a satisfactory non- genotoxic Mode of Action explanation had been submitted. The COC agreed that a threshold approachto risk assessment could be used and agreed that there was a satisfactory margin of safety between theNOAEL for putative cholangiocarcinoma and the Acceptable Daily Intake proposed by the PesticideSafetyDirectorate. A full statement of the committees' assessment of proquinazid is attached at the end of this report. Review of the quantitative relationship between alcohol consumption and squamous cell carcinoma 3.27 The COC reviewed the relationship between alcohol and oesophageal cancer in 1995 as part of the review of alcohol and cancer. Several studies indicated that there was a quantitative relationship betw een alc ohol int ake and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus but a threshold level could not be defined. Therefore, the COC had estimated levels of alcohol intake for which there was convincing evidence of an increased risk of SCC. In 2004, a paper on oesophageal cancer had suggested thatfurther consideration of alcohol-induced SCC was necessary. Following consultation, it was decided that a review should be conducted to review the post 1995 data on the quantitative relationship between alcohol and SCC. The COC also reviewed data on the risk in smokers who drink heavily and the possible existence of any susceptible groups. 3.28 Twenty-four new epidemiological studies were retrieved for review by the COC. It was noted that the data suffer from the same limitations as were noted in 1995 including a lack of data in women, poor study design, and imprecise estimates of alcohol intake. The studies rarely considered confounding by other risk factors, such as dietary intake, lack of vitamins and, possibly, Barrett's oesophagus. Also, members did not consider that the studies were easily comparable and suggested that it may only benecessary to consider the meta-analysis data, as these give the best estimates. Nevertheless, it was considered that they strengthened the overall picture. An increased risk was apparent at intakes above 30 g alc ohol per day. However, the COC could not identify a level of consumption below which there is no increase in risk, due to both lack of data and the intrinsic weakness of the data (in particular, the fact thatthe 'non-drink ers'group may include light drinkers). 3.29 The COC considered that the data provided evidence of potentially susceptible groups. It noted the multiplicative effects of alcohol and smoking on the incidence of SCC and that smoking increased therisk of SCC at even moderate doses of alcohol. However, gender and ethnic differences wereconsidered possibly to reflect temporal differences in drinking habits rather than a real difference in susceptibility. 139Single or short term exposure to carcinogens 3.30 Carcinogenicity is usually evaluated in the context of long term exposure to a chemical. In carcinogenicity studies, animals are subject to medium to long-term exposure to a test substance withthe aim of establishing whether it has any carcinogenic potential. This information, together with any available epidemiological or other data, is used to characterise the risk to humans from prolongedexposure to the chemical. In the case of genotoxic carcinogens it is assumed that there is no threshold and that any level of exposure carries a theoretical risk. The risk from non-genotoxic carcinogens ischaracterised using a NOAEL and uncertainty factor to estimate a level of exposure at which no risk is anticipated. 3.31 It may be necessary to provide advice on whether there is a risk associated with acute exposure to a carcinog en, e.g .in the case of a chemical ac cident or a f ood c ontamination incident. This would entail the characterisation of cancer risk in later life following a single or short-term exposure some time earlier. At its horizon scanning exercise in 2004, the COC agreed to review this issue and it did so at its April 2005 meeting . 3.32 In 1999, Calabrese and Blain published information about a database of data from approximately 5500 studies which assess whether a singl edose of a chemical (or physical) agent can cause tumour development in animals, without ex ogenous promotional stimuli. The database contained information on approximately 800 chemicals, of which 426 caused a positive response. The authors claim that it reveals that a single dose of an agent can cause tumours to develop in males and females of numerous animal models in al lprincipal age groups. The COC reviewed this paper and an overview of studies relating to limited exposure (less than one year) to occupational carcinogens, also cited in the paper. 3.33Calabrese and Blain had described the period of less than one year as relevant to the identification of potential single /short-term exposure to carcinogens but the COC considered that there was no rational efor this criterion. Members considered that exposure to single doses of certain cytotoxic medicines or genotoxic carcinogens, or possibly asbestos, might be associated with an increased risk of cancer. It was possible that the persistence of a carcinogen after exposure was a potentially important factor in the assessment of risk associated with a single exposure: beryllium was cited as an example of apersistent carcinogen. The COC cautioned that care was needed when interpreting the data cited in the Calabrese and Blain paper; for example, single parenteral exposure of experimental animals to chemicals in pellets might be associated with carcinogenicity in animals but such data were unlikely to be relevant to single exposures of humans to carcinogens. It considered that there was no evidence to support the view proposed by Calabrese and Blain that risks associated with single exposures to carcinog ens v aried with life stages. It was suggested that a more detailed review may be required of the information cited in the Calabrese and Blain database.Annual Report 2005 140Advice to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 3.34 The committee submitted a response as part of the consultation on the 'Draft Opinion of the EFSA Scientific Committee on a Harmonised Approach for Risk Assessment of Compounds which are bothGenotoxic and Carcinogenic'. Horizon scanning 3.35 The COC undertakes \"horizon scanning\" exercises at regular intervals to identify new and emerging issues which have the potential to impact on public health. At the 2005 exercise, Members considered thatthe following topics should be considered further. Age-related differences in risk of carcinogenesis 3.36Conventional animal cancer studies start treatment with the test chemical in early adulthood - usually 6-8 weeks of age in rats and mice. However, after reviewing an extensive set of nonconventional animal carcinogenicity study results, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded in 2003 thatthere was appreciable evidence that juvenile exposures to genotoxic carcinogens conferred greater risksper day of dosing than do exposures during adulthood. The EPA proposed additional uncertainty factors for individuals ag ed under 2 y ears and ag ed 2-15 years. Recently, an improved analysis of the data for 9 chemicals sugg ested tha tthe pr oposed additional f actors may not be appropriate in all cases. This impr oved analysis proposed that the estimated population mean risk from lifetime exposures to a generic genotoxic carcinogen is about 2.8 forld larger than expected from adult-only exposure. The COC decided that it should review this work, and the topic should have high priority. The project should revisit the information which was examined when the committee reviewed the EPA guidelinesfor cancer risk assessment but should also look independently at the original data. It was noted thatthere is considerable discussion at present as to whether animal carcinogenicity data applied to childr en. 3.37 The COC also agreed to review data on in-utero exposures to carcinogens. This topic should have high priority. Trends in cancer incidence 3.38 Members noted that the incidence of both testicular cancer and of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were increasing and considered that the possible chemical aetiology of both should be reviewed. It was considered that these topics should both be given high priority. The committee also noted that theincidence of upper outer quadrant breast cancer was increasing and that there is interest in the media in the proposal that this cancer may be caused by carcinogens, e.g. parabens, absorbed through the armpit. The secr etariat was asked to come forward with a proposal for work on breast cancer. This topic was also deemed to be high priority. 141Comparative risk assessment 3.39 The committee supported a proposal to explore whether it was possible to compare risks from environmental carcinogens with risks from other activities. It also agreed with the view of the COM thatmoreshould be done on how to get the work of the committees across to the public. Both topics were deemed to be high priority. Hormesis 3.40 Members agreed that the topic of hormesis should be discussed further, including a review of recent publications. This topic was considered to be of medium priority. Paper by Jacobs (2005) on prediction of carcinogenicity results from the results of short-term studies 3.41It has been pr oposed tha tthe r esults of 2-y ear car cinogenicity studies could be predicted from certain short-term data, structural analyses or omics information. The committee considered a paper which concluded that such data are not currently sufficient to accurately and reliably predict the outcome of long-t erm car cinogenicity studies. It suggested that the committee should keep a watching brief on this issue. Comput ational systems biology 3.42 It was also agreed that the committee should consider whether computational systems biology could be applied to its work. This topic was deemed medium priority. Ongoing reviews Aspar tame 3.43The C OC pr ovided ad hoc advic FSA on the r esults of a r atcarcinogenicity study with aspartame published by the European Ramazzini Foundation. The committee expressed a number of reservations about the study and noted that it was due to be formally evaluated by EFSA.Annual Report 2005 142Review of the possible associations between childhood leukaemia and residence near sources of traffic exhaust and petrol fumes Background to review 1. Vehicle-related air pollution has increased considerably over the last 45 years, due to the increased numbers of v ehicles on the roads (IEH, 1999). Traffic exhaust contains a complex mixture of many chemicals, of which several are known or suspected to be carcinogens. These include benzene, 1,3- butadiene and diesel-particulate matter. Diesel engine exhaust has been classified by IARC as Group 2A (i.e. probable human carcinogen) and gasolineengine exhaust as Group 2B (i.e. possible human carcinog en) (IARC, 1989). The nature of traffic exhaust has, however, changed over the years following legislation about the composition of fuel. 2.Evapor ative fuel emissions also contribute to vehicle-related air pollution. High airborne concentrations of fuel vapour are present in petrol stations and garages. Given that benzene is a component of both petrol /diesel exhaust and petrol vapour and is well documented as a cause of leukaemia in adults, there has been some concern as to whether residence near petrol stations /garages could be associated with an incr eased incidence of childhood leukaemia (petrol stations /garages are unlikely to generate sufficient tr affic on their own to cause a substantial increase in pollutants from vehicle exhaust). 3. The Committee was asked by the Department of Health Air Pollution Unit to review three recent epidemiological studies which r epor tan associ ation betw een residence near to petrol stations and garages and /or road traffic exhaust fumes and the occurrence of childhood leukaemia. The Committee considered these studies (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc0437.pdf) at the November 2004 meeting, but were unable to reach definitive conclusions on whether the studies indicated a causative link. The Committee therefore conducted a full review of the epidemiology literature on this issue,including studies reporting on benzene exposure and leukaemia in children. Information reviewed Childhood l eukaemia: curr ent perspec tives on incidenc etrends and aetiology 1. The Committee first reviewed the incidence trends and potential chemical causes of childhood leukaemi ain 2004, as part of a horizon scanning exercise to examine evidence for a possible role for chemicals in childhood cancer (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc0431.pdf). 143Statements of the COC Gasoline is the US term f or petr ol Benzene has been reported to cause Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia in ocupationally-exposed adults2. Of the two main types of leukaemia that occur in children\u00a7,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is the most common. There is evidence suggesting that the incidence of childhood ALL in the UK is increasing but members questioned whether this increase was real or an artefact resulting from betterascertainment of cases. An expert opinion was sought from the UK Childhood Cancer Research Group(UKCCRG) and the Newcastle Childhood Cancer Group who advised that the increase in ALL was, at least in part, real. 3. Only two non-hereditary risk factors are clearly associated with the development of leukaemia in children: intrauterine exposure to diagnostic X-rays and postnatal exposure to therapeutic doses of ionising radiation. In recent years, the use of these medical procedures in pregnant women and childrenhas been extremely rare, and so it is likely that these aetiological factors now account for only a smallpercentage of leukaemia cases. The Committee noted that there is strong evidence for the involvementof non-chemical f actors in the aetiolog yofchildhood l eukaemi a(IARC, 1999). However, this does not preclude the possibility that there may be chemical risk factors, as childhood leukaemia is a biologically and clinically diverse disease and is likely to arise via a number of aetiological pathways (Greaves & Alexander, 1993). Exposure to vehicular emissions as a possible cause of childhood leukaemia 4. The Committee considered that, because benzene is a well established leukaemogen in adults, benzene in vehicl eexhaust and /or fuel v apour c ould r epresent a po tential risk f actor in the development of childhood leukaemia. Both vehicle exhaust and fuel vapour also contain several other carcinogenic compounds **,although ther eare differences in the profile of these carcinogenic constituents (and thus the carcinogenic potential). The Committee decided that there are differences in the hazards presented bythese two types of emissions and, therefore, considered that information on exposure to fuel vapour should be discussed separ ately from information on exposure to vehicle exhaust. (a) Exposure to fuel vapour Exposur eto fuel vapour arises largely from the evaporation of fuel from the tanks and engines of parked vehicl es. Petrol evaporates more readily than diesel because diesel has a lower vapour pressure. Therefore, there are only a limited number of studies examining the risk of inhalation exposure to diesel vapour. The Committee reviewed a draft report by the Oil Companies' European Organisation for Environment, Health and Safety (CONCAWE) on the risk assessment of inhalation exposure to 'gasoline'(petrol) and benzene vapour by the general public (CONCAWE, 2004). Members commented on CONCAWE's main findings in relation to childhood exposure as described below.Annual Report 2005 144\u00a7Acut eleukaemi atends t oaffectyounger people with symptoms developing rapidly. The most common types are Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Non-Lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL)). Chronic leukaemia tends to occur in older people and has a slow progression rate. ** Most tailpipe emissions consist of many hydrocarbons, including benzene, which itself is likely to derive from a mixture of unburnt benzene and benzene formed from the combustion of other aromatic petrol components. CONCAWE referred to petrol as gasoline in their C ONCA WE assessment of exposur etopetrol vapour CONCAWE prepared separate risk assessments for three child-relevant scenarios: visiting service stations travelling in cars residing indoors at locations near petrol vapour sources The report calculated typical and reasonable worst case (RWC) airborne concentrations (mg /m3)and average daily doses (ADD) (mg /kg/day) for inhalation exposure to petrol for each of the above scenarios as shown in Table 1 below. (See http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc058.pdf for rationale) *Body weight used for adults = 70 kg **Body w eight us ed for childr en = 9 kg Table 1. Summary of the exposure results for petrol vapour inhalation for several consumer scenarios (CONCAWE, 2004) The Committee noted that children had considerably higher estimated inhalation intakes than adults. It was further no ted tha tchildren staying in their homes received the highest estimated airborne exposures to petrol vapour (largely due to the amount of time spent indoors) with an ADD (RWC) value approximately ten-fold gr eater than tha testimated for a service station attendant working a full shift (data not shown). However, it was further noted that much of the difference was due to variations in the duration of exposure represented by the three scenarios. The Committee accepted that these estimates were very conservative and so w erelikely tohaveoverestima ted true exposures.Scenario Airborne C oncentration (mg Inhalation Intake (mg Adults* etobenzene v apour The Committee also considered data from the CONCAWE report, as presented in Table 2, on airborne concentrations and estimated ADD for inhalation exposure to benzene vapour. Similar trends to those seen inthe petr ol vapour exposure assessment were apparent, i.e. indoor rather than outdoor exposures to benzene from petrol fumes appear to be of more significance. Again, the duration of exposure represented by the three scenarios accounted for much of the difference in intake between them. *Body weight used for adults = 70 kg **Body w eight us ed for childr en = 9 kg NB. The current levels of exposure to benzene from gasoline are likely to be lower than those estimated above. This is because the data was obtained from studies conducted prior to the 2000 European EU dir ective 98/70/EC, (in which levels of benzene in gasoline was reduced from 5% to 1%) Table 2 .Summary of the exposur eresults f or benzene v apour inhalation for several consumer scenarios (CONCAWE, 2004) (Figures have been converted into /H9262g/m3and /H9262g/kg/ day for ease of reference)Scenario Airborne Concentration (/H9262g/m3)Estimated Inhalation Intake (/H9262g/kg/day) Staying indoors (residence) Adults Children10.7 10.726 261 93 20Annual Report 2005 146 Many of the underlying assumptions used to derive these estimates were based on the regulatory requirements of the risk assessment process. For example, CONCAWE used guidance provided in the EU Existing Substances Risk Assessment TechnicalGuidanc eDocument to convert air concentrations of chemicals into daily doses. CONCAWE states that these estimates represent industry obligations in the process rather than the organisation's view of the current situation.Asubstantial amount of information was available to the Committee from the published literature on levels of benzene inside and outside the home. This enabled the Committee to obtain a greater understanding of the issues relating to inhalation exposure to benzene vapour, and to generate a more considered view on theabove exposure assessment. i) Work by the Building Research Establishment showed that the mean indoor benzene concentrations in 174 homes within the Avon area (UK) were higher than outdoor levels, especially in those households with an attached garage (Duarte-Davidson et al., 2001). Furthermore, benzeneconcentrations in rooms directly above an integral garage have been reported to be 2.5 times the ambient air standard (Mann et al., 2001). See http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc058.pdf for further details. ii) Studies providing data on mean air concentrations of benzene outdoors showed that UK levels were consistent with levels in the US and Canada. These levels varied depending on the proximity of parked or moving traffic - the highest levels of benzene were documented to be within the cars[up to 2527.2 /H9262g/m3(780 ppb)\u00a7\u00a7]and may even reach the US Occupational Exposure Limit of 3240 /H9262g/m3(1000 ppb), although W tha tthe t ypical is in the order 32.4 - 64.8 /H9262g/m3(10-20 ppb). Table 3 provides a summary of the range of benzene levels detected inside and outside the home. iii) Members no ted tha ttherewereanumber of na tional and int ernational initiatives intended to reduce population exposure to benzene. In a personal communication to the Committee, CONCAWE identified four important technological developments designed to reduce current levels of benzene emissions from automobiles (see http: //www .advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs/cc058.pdf). Air Quality Objectives in the UK are for an annual running mean st andar d***for benzene of 5 /H9262g/m3(1.54 ppb) in England and W ales, and 3.25 /H9262g/m3(1 ppb) for Scotland and Northern Ireland ambient air limit valuefor benzene is 5 /H9262g/m3(to be met by 1 January 2010, as set by the European Community Directive 2000 1 part by volume, in one thousand million i.e. 1 in 109;1ppb of benzene the annual running mean standard refers to a value calculated from data collated for the 12 months prior to the quoted date 3.246 \u00b5g/m3 rounded to nearest 2 decimal places the air limit value is a legislative standard, which takes cost and benefit into account and provides a date for when the legislation must be eff ected. The long term policy aim for England and Wales is to achieve an Air Quality Objective of 1 ppb annual mean concentration. *It would be difficult to determine the contribution of evaporative emissions or vehicle exhaust to the benzene levels detected. Levels of benz ene in out door air dur ing wint er can be three times the level detected in summer. Table 3. Ambient air concentrations of benzene (taken from Duar te-Da vidson et al ., 2001; Mann et al., 2001 and Wolff, 1992) iv) The Committee was also reminded of the findings of the Working Group on Benzene (1998), which conducted a similar assessment of the potential risks from benzene exposure to the general populationas part of a process to deal with \"Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management\" . These also suggested that children received much higher intakes of benzene than adults. On the basis of the available information on levels of evaporative emissions inside and outside the home, the Commit tee concluded that exposures of children to benzene and petrol vapour inside the home could be greater than outside the home and that the significance of indoor exposures to petrol vapour and benzene should be considered further. (a) Exposur etovehicl eexhaust One of the major challenges in epidemiological studies investigating the effects of exposure to vehicle exhaust is quantifying the exposure. This is because vehicle exhaust is a chemically complex mixture and its components deriv efrom multipl esources (see T able4for a list of compounds present in vehicle exhaust). It was noted by the Committee that most epidemiological studies examining the effects of vehicular emissions have focussed on the combustion of fuel rather than on fuel evaporation. Therefore, the subject of exposure to vehicle exhaust is discussed further in the following section.[Benzene] /(/H9262g/m3) Air Quality Objective 5 Outdoor* 1-8 Indoor 4-40 Outdoor (20m busy road)* 10 - 45 Outdoor (kerbside)* 118 Cars (inside)* 32 - 2527 US Occupational Limit 3240Annual Report 2005 148Table 4. Some compounds and classes of compounds in vehicle engine exhaust (IARC, 1989 ) Epidemiologic al studies of exposur etotraffic-derived pollutants and childhood leukaemia The Committee was provided with information from 17 studies (sixteen\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7published as peer-reviewed papers), which have investigated the possible association between proximity of residence to road traffic exhaust fumes, and /or petrol stations and garages, and either childhood cancer or childhood leukaemia. Table 5 provides a summary ofthe 17 studies reviewed by the Committee. Three of the studies were from the UK and only nine specifically investigated childhood leukaemia http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc058.pdf. Two studies examined exposur es to vehicle evaporative emissions; vehicle exhaust was the predominant chemical exposure evaluated. Ten of the 17 studies reported some positive significant associations, although three authors concluded that their positive findings were only suggestive of an association due to the qualitativelimitations of the study. 149Gas phase Particulate phase*** (Source: IARC, 1989) * compounds in italics have been classified by IARC as either carcinogenic to humans, probably carcinogenic to humans or possibly car cinogenic to humans (Groups I, IIA or IIB, respectively) compounds and multifunctional derivatives *** diesel exhaust particulates are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens according to the National Toxicology Program 10th Report on Carcinogens NB. Nitr oarenes ar ealso pr esent in engine exhaust and ar eproduced in large amounts from diesel engines. They are formed when nitric acid reacts with PAHs to and sulphates (e.g., lead platinum) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and derivativesAcrolein Ammonia * Sulphur dioxide Toluene \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 The unpublished results of a study by Urayama et al. (2004) were presented as a poster at an international conference on 'Childr en with Leukaemi a'inLondon (200 4).Evaluation of epidemiological evidence The Committee reviewed the methodology used in the studies to help formulate its conclusions and proposed that, based on the quality of the study designs, the actual number from which conclusions couldbe dr awn was much lower than 17. Only two studies were considered to have adopted an adequate method for the assessment of exposure to petrol fumes and exhaust (i.e. Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2001, and Reynolds et al., 2002). Both of these studies reported null results. However, Members considered it would be inappropriate to dismiss completely the 10 studies reporting positive findings. Most of the studies w ere population-based, case-control studies where cases were identified from cancer registries. One study identified cases and controls from hospitals (Steffen et al., 2004) and five were geographical studies. Controls for population based studies were mostly selected from registers of thegeneral population or via random digit dialling (RDD) - the latter method was considered to be a source ofselection bias. In Steffen et al. (2004), controls were selected from children in the same hospital receiving treatment for acute pathologies such as trauma or orthopaedic diseases. The majority of studies matchedcontrols for age, sex and area (for more information on control selection seehttp: //www .advisorybodies.doh.g ov.uk /pdfs/cc058.pdf ). In general, researchers based exposure assessments on objective measurements such as residence, traffic counts and /or measurements of concentrations of air pollutants, which are not affected by recall bias. However,Steffen et al .(200 4) cited possible recall bias in that the mother of cases may have over-declared previous exposures to sources of hydrocarbons; Crosignani et al. (2004) suggested that the method used by his gr oup to sample controls could be a source of selection bias. Fewof the 17 studies obt ained c omprehensive information on the child's or parent's past exposures to chemicals and other potential confounders. Members considered a suggestion that a meta-analysis be carried out on the studies but concluded that the methodologies used in the studies were too divergent for this to be feasible. Members made the f ollowing observ ations and suggestions: (a) Sample size With the exception of Reynolds et al. (2003), most of the papers reporting a positive association were based on much smal ler sampl esizes (the a verage number of leukaemia cases = 394) than those reporting a null association (average no.= 861). The two negative studies with adequate exposure assessment referred to above Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2001) and Reynolds et al. (2002) were noted to be among the largest.Annual Report 2005 150(b) Exposure Assessment Most of the studies used area-based measures as proxies for traffic-exhaust exposures (See http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc058.pdf for further details). The Committee suggested that, although the methods curr ently used to assess exposure to petrol fumes /exhaust ha ve generally improved with time, there is still potential for further development /refinement. However, useful information can be obtained from existing studies provided it is clear what the exposure metric represents. It was suggested that the distance-weighted traffic density metric was a useful approach although it should be made more specificfor each pollutant to give greater utility in the ensuing risk estimation (http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs /cc058.pdf). (c) Case-control distance comparison The C ommit tee also c onsider ed the distance between the source of traffic exhaust /petrol fumes and the index****child's house. The impact of main roads on air quality is not considered to be detectable above local background air pollution more than 100-200m away. Therefore, those studies in which concentrations of pollutants were measured or estimated in homes that were located more than 200m away from traffic roadsor petr ol stations and garages were considered to provide little useful relevant information. (d) Age-related factors and residential history The C ommittee noted that most studies of traffic and childhood leukaemia examined exposure potential based on a child's residence at either diagnosis or birth. Only two investigations obtained information onresidence of the parent prior to birth, usually due to limitations in the recorded information available at the time, although the Committee noted that the study by Raaschou-Nielsen et al (2001) collated data spanning achild's complete residential history and encompassed an exposure window from 9 months before birth through to the child's date of diagnosis. The Committee suggested that, ideally, future studies should take into account a child's complete residential history and not just residence at diagnosis, although it was recognised that this would be difficult. (e)Genetic susc eptibility Finally, the Committee considered the question of genetic susceptibility to possible traffic fumes /fuel vapour related childhood leukaemia, in the context of the study by Urayama, 2004. This investigated the combinedeffects of genetic polymorphisms and traffic exposure on risk of childhood leukaemia and found an associ ation between leukaemia and traffic only in those with the CYP1A1 m2 allele. Interestingly, without accounting f or individual genetic susceptibility, the authors found no association between risk of childhood leukaemia and traffic density. The Committee noted that the study was not in line with the COC criteria for the design of g ene-envir onment studies because it lack ed a prior hy pothesis and hence the power of the study was lower than that assumed in the analysis. 151**** child diagnosed with cancer of interestConclusion The Committee concluded that the available evidence provided insufficient evidence from which to conclude that there was an association between risk of childhood leukaemia and proximity to petrol stations,garages and road traffic. The Committee considered that further studies to examine the possibility of an association between residence near traffic exhaust /petrol fumes and leukaemia would be valuable. The Committee concluded that there are differences in hazard between vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions. Therefore, it considered that information on exposure to fuel vapour should always be discussed separately fromexposure to vehicle exhaust. It requested that indoor exposures of children to petrol vapour and to benzeneshould be considered in a separate review. It was recommended that future studies should also investigate leukaemia on a subtype basis (ALL, ANLL) rather than leukaemia as a whole, and any evaluation of genetic susceptibility should include the examinationof a comprehensive range of Phase I and II enzymes involved in the metabolism of compounds deriving fromtraffic.

Exper (6-iodo-2-propoxy-3-propyl-3 H-quinazolin-4-one) is a new fungicide intended for use in agriculture and viticulture providing control of powdery mildew in cereals and grapes. It is a novel classof fungicide acting by inhibiting the development of the appressorial germ tube. An application for first inclusion of proquinazid in Annex 1 of 91 /414 /EEC and for UK provisional approval (PPPR), in the product 'Proquinazid 200g /LEC', formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate containing 200g /Lproquinazid was discussed at the 311thmeeting of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides on 13 January 2005. The ACP deferred making a decision pending advice from the COC and COM with regard to the occurrence of cholangiocar cinoma in the r atcarcinogenicity bioassay. The COC and COM have not been asked to review any other tumour reported in rodent carcinogenicity bioassays with proquinazid. 2.Proquinazid has slight solubilit yin water but is soluble in a range of organic solvents (Log Kowis 5.5 a t 250C). It is slightly v olatile.Anumber of ba tches w ereproduced and used in the toxicology tests between 1997 and 2001 ranging from 96.4% w /wup to 97.9% w /w. Proquinazid is extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rats and widely distributed in both single and repeated dose oral studies. It is no ted that levels of radiolabel in bone marrow were reported to be equivalent to plasma and blood. Absorbed proquinazid was extensively metabolised and excreted via the bile and urine.Metabolism comprised predominantly of phenyl ring hydroxylation and hydroxylation at the propyl and propoxy side chains, as well as hydrolysis of some side chains. Major excretory metabolites included conjugates of these metabolites. One minor de-iodinated metabolite was identified. Introduction t oCOM/COC review 3. The C OMconsider ed proquinazid at its meeting of the 26 May 2005. The COM had access to the individual study reports1-7,the evaluation prepared by PSD for the ACP8and some additional information from the data holder provided in a power point presentation document. The data holder made a presentation to COM.9-10 4. The COC considered proquinazid at its meeting of the 14 July 2005. The COC had access to the summary e valuation prepared by PSD for the ACP8,the dr aftCOM conclusions on proquinazid, detailed information on survival and pathology from the rat and mouse carcinogenicity bioassays11,12information from a one year study in dogs13,the report of the Scientific Advisory Panel review of liver pathology from the r atand mouse car cinog enicit ybioassays commissioned by the data holder14,amode of ac tion assessment document for intestinal-type cholangiocarcinomas in the two year feeding study with ted bythe da on the hepatic pathology in the 2 year feeding study with proquinazid in rats16.The data holder made a presentation to COC, which included photomicrographs of a number of histological sections of livertissue from control and proquinazid treated rats. 17(An information paper on the pathogenesis of cholangiocar cinoma in humans and r ats was drafted by the secretariat http: //www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk /pdfs rat)COM review of Mutagenicity (26 May 2005) Presentation by data holder 5. The COM heard a presentation from DuPont on the mutagenicity of proquinazid. The purpose of the presentation was to provide DuPont's rationale on the adequacy of the genetic toxicology data base for proquinazid and to specifically discuss the results of the mammalian cell in-vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes and the in-vitro mammalian cell gene hprt mutation assay in CHO cells. DuPont sought the committee's agreement that proquinazid is not genotoxic and further testing is unnecessary. 6. DuPont was aware of minor limitations in the in-vitro chromosomal assay and in-vitro gene mutation assay in mammalian cells. A battery of seven genotoxicity studies had been conducted with technicalgrade material during the period 1996-1998 (in-life dates of studies). The studies complied with the EU directive 91 /414 /EEC, the COM guidance of 1989, and OECD test guidelines (current at the time of testing). Two batches of technical material were evaluated (which had been produced by differentmanuf acturing methods, the earlier ba tch DPX -KQ926- 45 w as 97% pure and the latter batch DPX- KQ926-75 was 97.9% pure). Tests undertaken with the 45 batch included the Ames test, the in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay, the (MN) assay. Tests undertaken with the 75 batch included an Ames test and an in-vivo bone marrow MN assay. 7. The presentation then focused on the two in-vitr omutagenicity studies where limitations had been identified. The design of and results obtained in the in-vitro chromosomal mutation assay in human lymphoc ytes were reviewed. The negative results and adequate performance of the positive control trials w ere noted. Some additional historical positive control data were presented (additional slide not in information tabled for members). COM members asked for further information on these additional positiv econtrol da ta. The information was intended to show the lower limit of positive control responses in the test facility both before and after the in-life phase of the in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay. The data were consistent with those already provided to members and were generated from a number of tests with cyclophosphamide and MMC. DuPont noted that the study complied with an early proposed revision of the OECD guideline (ca 1996) and included a delayed harvest and thatmarked cytotoxicity was seen at the 24 h and 48 h harvests. In addition the consistent negative findings in this assay were supported by negative findings in two in-vivo bone marrow MN assays in mice in which or al dose levels up to 2g /kg bwhad been tested with the occurrence of clinical signs of toxicity and /or mortality in mice and evidence of bone marrow exposure in the rat metabolism study. 8. The design of and results obtained in the in-vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay (CHO /hprt)were reviewed. Two independent assays had been conducted for each treatment and a third trial had been performed with activation due to a lack of toxicity in the second trial. The study was a qualitativeassessment of mutagenic potential. A positive response was obtained if the mutation frequency was >40 x 10 6cells at two or more consecutive concentrations. Plating of 106cells was sufficient to detect a positiv eresponse. There was no evidence for a positive response in the assay. Mutation frequencies obtained with the test material were within the negative historical control range and there was a lack ofreproducibl edose -dependent increases. Positive controls produced marked increases in mutationAnnual Report 2005 156frequency in all trials and it was noted that there was comparatively little variance in the positive control data between trials using the same treatment condition. DuPont had commented that all negative control mutation frequencies were within the range of historical controls for the testlaboratory, the positive controls exhibited consistent responses despite the fluctuation in negativecontrol frequencies and the negative findings were supported by a lack of genotoxicity in the battery of other in-vitro and in-vivo genotoxicity studies. 9. DuPont concluded that proquinazid does not pose a mutagenic concern. There were negative findings in abattery of seven in-vitro and in-vivo studies. There was no result to suggest a positive or weak positive response. Neither proquinazid, nor metabolites formed in rats, contain structural alerts for DNAreactivity. The studies were conducted to the prevailing guidelines at the time. The limitations noted byPSD with regard to the in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay and the mammalian cell gene mutation assay(CHO /hprt) did no timpac ton the o verall genotoxic assessment of proquinazid. Thus further testing was unnecessary to conclude that proquinazid is not genotoxic. COM consideration of presentation and mutagenicity data 10. The COM held a detailed discussion with the representatives of DuPont regarding the mutagenicity data and in par ticular the adequacy and conduct of the in-vitr ochromosomal aberration assay in human an hprtgene mut ation assay in CHO cells. The Committee agreed that as the COM and COC had been asked to evaluate the potential mechanism of cholangiocar cinomas seen in the rat long-term carcinogenicity bioassay with proquinazid, there was a need t ohave a high level of confidence in the mutagenicity data on proquinazid. Whilst members agreed that there was no convincing evidence for positive results in any of the tests, it was not possible to conclude that the in-vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes and the in-vitro hprt mammalian gene mutation assay in CHO cells were negative in view of the limitations. Members accepted thatsome reassurance was gained from the in-vivo bone marrow micronuclei assays in mice. 11. The COM discussed and reached the following conclusions with regard to the mutagenicity data on proquinazid. Bacterial reverse mutation assay with batch (97.9% pure). Date 18/11/981 tha tthis study had been adequa tely conducted and no further information was required. Bacterial reverse mutation assay with batch DPX-KQ926-45 (97% pure). Date 28/2/972 13. Members agr eed tha tthis study had been adequa tely conducted and no further information was required. 157In-vitro mammalian cytogenicity test with batch DPX-KQ926-45 (97% pure). Date 26/2/973 14. Members agreed that some aspects of the in-vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes had been conducted in excess of requirements but considered that a prolonged exposure assay wasrequired so that cells were exposed over the whole cell cycle. Members did not consider that the testhad adequately covered this aspect or that the potential for aneugenicity had been examined. Membersobserved that the dose selection had resulted in high levels of cytotoxicity and that the positive controlresponse reported (towards the lower limit of a very wide range, ca 6-80% cells with aberrations)limited the value of this assay. The Committee agreed that it would be advisable to request a continuous 20 h exposure in a mammalian cell chromosomal aberration assay (in human lymphocytes) in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. This would ensure that all stages of the cell cyclewere exposed. It would be appropriate to include estimation of polyploidy as an indicator of potential for aneugenicity. The study should be conducted to internationally accepted standards. The Committeewas aware of the need to adequately explain the mode of action of the cholangiocarcinomas reportedin the long-term bioassay of proquinazid in rats and agreed that this information would help tocomplete the in-vitro mutagenicity evaluation of proquinazid which was an important part of the carcinog enicity risk assessment. In-vitro gene mutation in mammalian cells with batch DPX-KQ926-45. (97% pure). Date 22/5/974 15. Members commented that the data from the in-vitro mammalian cell hprt gene mutation assay in CHO cells were consistent with the conclusions COM had previously published on practical difficulties in under taking mutation frequency in the proquinazid assay and the finding of very low mutation frequencies in some trials (<0.6 x 106cells) limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Thus it was noted that the mutation frequency in the third trial in the acetone control and test material experiments was low at all dose levels. Members concluded that the data were not interpretable. TheCommittee agreed that a mouse lymphoma assay conducted to internationally accepted standards should be r equested. The Committee was aware of the need to adequately explain the mode of action of the cholangiocar cinomas r eported in the long-term bioassay of proquinazid in rats and agreed that this information was essential to complete the in-vitro mutagenicity evaluation of proquinazid which was an impor tof the car cinogenicity risk assessment. ch DPX -KQ926-45 (97% pure). Date 21/5/97. Minor editorial revision to report 22/2/995 16. Members agr eed tha tthis study had been adequately conducted and no further information was requir ed. In-vivo bone marrow micronucleus in mice with batch DPX-KQ926-75 (97.9% pure) Date 14/1/996 In-vivo bone marrow micronucleus in mice with batch DPX-KQ926-45 (97% pure) Date 22/2/997Annual Report 2005 15817. Members agreed that the data provided were indicative of negative findings in these assays. Members agreed the evidence for small increases in percentage micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes seen at some doses most probably represented fluctuation in the background incidence of micronuclei.Members accepted the evidence of toxicity in these studies and information from the toxicological andtoxicokinetic studies with proquinazid suggested that the bone-marrow would have been exposed to proquinazid and metabolites in these two studies. COM conclusions from May 2005 meeting 18. Members considered that the company had provided some relevant information and comments but had not been convinced that the in-vitro mutagenicity test package was adequate. Members agreed that a key element of any proposal regarding mechanism of proquinazid induced cholangiocarcinoma in theratwould r equir eanevaluation of mutagenicity and hence it was important to complete the mutagenicity test package. 19. The Committee considered that a mouse lymphoma assay should be conducted and that it was advisabl etoalso c onduc tacontinuous 20 h exposur ein an cell chromosomal aberration assay (in human lymphocytes) in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Both studies should be conducted to internationally accepted standards. These studies were required to provide full informa tion on the mut agenicity evaluation of proquinazid. COM post meeting consideration of additional mouse lymphoma assay 20. The data holder submitted on 12 July 2005 the results of a new mouse lymphoma assay undertaken with pr oquinazid.18The assa yincluded an exposure of 3 hour (in presence and absence of exogenous metabolic ac tivation) and a continuous 24 h exposure in the absence of metabolic activation. The results suggested that proquinazid was not mutagenic in this assay. A full report was not available during the post al consult ation with COM members. The Committee considered the available data from the new mouse lymphoma assay by postal consultation and agreed there was no evidence for a mutagenic effect. It was also agreed that the full report should be considered by COM when available. The final report was submitted to COM members by postal consultation on the 22 August 2005. Members agreed that the submitted mouse lymphoma assay was acceptable and gave negative results.19 COC e valuation of cholangiocarcinoma in the rat (14 July 2005) 21. The COM heard a presentation from DuPont on the interpretation of cholangiocarcinoma reported in female rats fed a diet containing proquinazid as part of a long term carcinogenicity bioassay.15,16In brief, groups of 80 male and 80 female Cr1:CD\u00ae(SD) BR rats were fed diets containing 0, 10, 30, 300, 600 (females), 1000 (males), 1200 (females) or 2000 ppm (males) for 104 weeks. Groups of five animals /sex were subject to interim haematology, clinical chemistry necropsy and histopathological evaluation at 1week and 1 year of feeding. Survival at termination was increased at dose levels of 600 ppm and above.Astatistically significant increase in intestinal-type cholangiocarcinoma was reported in female rats (8 /60 at600 12 /61 at1200ppm, c fnone in concurrent control).11 15922. The representatives from DuPont were accompanied by Dr P Greaves (University of Leicester) who had been a member of a Scientific Advisory Panel (sponsored by DuPont). The Scientific Advisory Panel had reviewed the liver slides from the rat and mouse carcinogenicity bioassays. COC members questionedthe representatives from DuPont and Dr Greaves during the presentation. 23. The Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), had reviewed aspects of the liver pathology and a report had been finalised in November 2003. Dr Greaves had reviewed the slides again recently before the submission for the COC consideration was compiled. 16The SAP considered that the lesions seen in the female rats were not indicative of a carcinogenic risk for humans. The Panel's rationale had been that proquinazid was not genotoxic, that cholangiocarcinomas of the \"intestinal\" type occurred only in female rats fed600 ppm or more at the end of the two-year study, the tumour type was linked to chronichepatocellular injury with \"cholangiofibrosis\" and there was no risk of the lesion occurring in theabsenc eof se verehepa tic toxicity. A number of representative sections were shown to COC members. Features of the histopathology of the lesions seen at 1200 ppm included: cellular degeneration, inflammatory infiltrate, extensive necrosis, giant nuclei and fibrotic changes termed \"cholangiofibrosis\" bytheoriginal reporting pathologists. The cells within the lesions showed goblet cell differentiation and were therefore termed \"intestinal-type\" . The cholangiofibrosis was not necessarily related to the portaltract and the lesions termed \"cholangiocarcinoma\" were quite unlike the usual pattern seen in humancholangiocarcinoma. COC members supported the view that the lesions were not neoplastic but were a florid inf lamma tory r osevereacuteand chronic with marked reactive epitheli al changes cytoplasmic alterations, nuclear pleomorphism, and intestinal metaplasia. COC pathologists noted that there was little evidence of increased mitotic activity in the slides shown and aberr ant mitoses were not a feature. 24. Dr Greaves confirmed that the SAP had reviewed virtually all the lesions diagnosed as cholangiocarcinomas and he had reviewed a proportion of them again recently. In answer to specificquestioning, he agreed that, if chronic exposure to proquinazid was sufficiently high to induce similar severe liver toxicity in humans, there was a risk that similar lesions to that identified in rats could occur. He no ted tha tliver toxicity was seen in female rats receiving 300 ppm proquinazid but was less severe than at 600 ppm. There had been individual variation in severity at 600 ppm. In answer to another question, DuP ont r epresent atives noted that the pigment seen in the liver sections had been shown to be PAS positive and was therefore likely to be lipofuschin as expected in the setting of cell degeneration and increased turnover. There was minimal deposition of stainable iron. 25. The Committee raised a question as to whether the role of oval cells in liver regeneration, as proposed in the MOA 15,is hypothetical or is more generally accepted.\" It was agreed that oval cell proliferation was seen in r odents when a r egenerative stimulus was supplied but hepatocyte proliferation inhibited, for example by 2AAF. COC consideration and conclusions 26. The committee concluded that it was uncertain that the lesions termed \"cholangiocarcinomas\" were truly neoplastic but ac cepted the conventionality of the term used by the study pathologist. However, it was noted that the pathology seen with proquinazid lacked the expected characteristics of thatcaused b yagenotoxic carcinogen.Annual Report 2005 16027. Members agreed that the MOA proposed by DuPont for the putative cholangiocarcinomas was plausible. They noted that the lesions were only seen at dose levels which caused severe liver toxicity and which exceeded the MTD. They further agreed that the lesions were relevant to humans in thatthey were a potential hazard. However, whether they were a risk in humans depended on the level ofexposure. 28. Members agreed that the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for putative cholangiocarcinoma was 16 mg /kg bw /day (300 ppm in female rats). They were informed that PSD had proposed an acceptable daily intake for proquinazid of 0.01 mg /kg bw, based on the overall No Observed Adverse Effect Level of 1.2 mg /kg bw /day derived from all the toxicology data on proquinazid and a safety factor of 100. Members confirmed that this would give an adequate margin of safety (1600) forcholangiocarcinoma. Overall discussion of COM /COC on proquinazid 29. The COM has reviewed the available mutagenicity data on proquinazid (26 /5/05). All of the studies were consider ed ac ceptablewith the ex ception of the in-vitr yassayin CHO c ells (hprt locus) and it was also noted that an extended exposure of human lymphocytes in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation had not been undertaken as part of the assay for chromosomal aberr ations. The C OM was submitted in-vitr omouse lymphoma assa yand agr eed b y postal consultation that the data were suggestive of a negative response (results submitted 12 /7/05).18 The final r eport was submitted to COM members by postal consultation on the 22 August 2005. Members agr eed that the submitted mouse lymphoma assay was acceptable and gave negative results. The COM agreed that it would not be necessary to complete the in-vitro mutagenicity test package by undertaking an extended exposure treatment of human lymphocytes for chromosomal aberrations in view of the totality of negative in-vitro and in-vivo mutagenicity data available on proquinazid if the MOA assessment for the cholangiocarcinoma which had been submitted to COC was deemed acceptable. 30. The COC considered the available carcinogenicity data and additional information on histopathology of the liver from the carcinogenicity bioassay in rats on 14 /7/05. Members were unconvinced that the lesions reported as cholangiocarcinomas were truly neoplastic, but accepted that the studypathologists' diagnosis could be used for risk assessment. The COC agreed that a threshold approach to risk assessment could be used and agreed that there was a satisfactory margin of safety between the NOAEL for putative cholangiocarcinoma and the ADI proposed by PSD. Overall conclusions of COM /COC on proquinazid 31. The COM concluded that the mutagenicity data submitted provided evidence that proquinazid is not an in-vitro or in-vivo mutagen. There were limitations in the adequacy of the submitted in-vitro gene mutation assay in mammalian cells (CHO, hprt)and the submitted in-vitro assay in human lymphocytes for chromosomal aberrations. The data holder submitted negative results from a mouse lymphoma assaywhich included bo th short-term (3h) and extended exposure (24 h) treatments after the COM meeting (26 /5/05). The full report of this study would need to be considered by COM when available. The final r epor twas submit ted to COM members by postal consultation on the 22 August 2005. 161Members agreed that the submitted mouse lymphoma assay was acceptable and gave negative results. The COM agreed that the advice for a further in-vitro study to examine chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes study would not be a requirement in view of the totality of negative mutagenicitydata on proquinazid and if the MOA assessment for the cholangiocarcinoma which had been submittedto COC was deemed acceptable (see para 32). 32. The COC concluded that it was uncertain that the lesions termed \"cholangiocarcinomas\" were truly neoplastic but accepted the conventionality, used by the study pathologist in the report of thecarcinogenicity bioassay of proquinazid in rats, of classifying them as neoplastic. A satisfactory non- genotoxic Mode of Action explanation for the cholangiocarcinomas in rats had been submitted. TheCOC agreed that a threshold approach could be used for the risk assessment of cholangiocarcinomareported in the rat. COM/05/S4, COC/05/S1 September 2005Annual Report 2005 162References 1.

The Minist ers of the sponsoring depar tments ar eansw erabletoParliament for the policies and performance of this Committee, including the policy framework within which it operates. Standards in Public Life All Committee members must: follow the Seven Principles of Public Life set out by the Committee on Standards in Public Life (see page 173); comply with this Code, and ensure they understand their duties, rights and responsibilities, and that they are familiar with the function and role of this Committee and any relevant statements ofGovernment policy. If necessary members should consider undertaking relevant training to assist themin carrying out their role; not misuse information gained in the course of their public service for personal gain or for political purpose, nor seek to use the opportunity of public service to promote their private interests or those of connec ted persons, firms, businesses or other organisations; and nothold any paid or high pr ofileunpaid posts in a political party, and not engage in specific political activities on ma tters dir ectly affecting the work of this Committee. When engaging in other political activities, Committee members should be conscious of their public role and exercise proper discretion. These r estric tions do no tapply t oMPs(in those cases wher eMPsareeligible to be appointed), to local councillors, or to Peers in relation to their conduct in the House of Lords.Annual Report 2005 170ANNEX 2 - Code of conduct for members of advisory committeesRole of Committee members Members have collective responsibility for the operation of this Committee. They must: engage fully in collective consideration of the issues, taking account of the full range of relevant factors, including any guidance issued by the Food Standards Agency; the Department of Health and sponsor departments or the responsible Minister; in accordance with Government policy on openness, ensure that they adhere to the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (including prompt responses to public requests for information);agree an Annual Report; and, where practicable and appropriate, provide suitable opportunities to openup the work of the Committee to public scrutiny; not divulge any information which is provided to the Committee in confidence; ensure that an appropriate response is provided to complaints and other correspondence, if necessary with reference to the sponsor department; and; ensure that the Committee does not exceed its powers or functions.Individual members should inf orm the Chairman (or the Secretariat on his or her behalf) if they are invited to speak in public in their capacit yas a Committee member. Communications between the Committee and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board and /or Ministers will generally be through the Chairman except where the Committee has agreed that an individual member should act on its behalf. Nevertheless, any member has the right of access to the FSA Board and /or Ministers on any matter that he or she believes raises important issues relating to his or her duties as a Committee member .In such cases the agr eement of the rest of the Committee should normally be sought. Individual members can be removed from office by the FSA Board if they fail to perform the duties required of them in line with the standards expected in public office. The role of the Chairman The Chairman has particular responsibility for providing effective leadership on the issues above. In addition, the Chairman is responsible for: ensuring that the Committee meets at appropriate intervals, and that the minutes of meetings and any reports to the FSA Board accurately record the decisions taken and, where appropriate, the views of individual members; representing the views of the Committee to the general public; and ensuring that new members are briefed on appointment (and their training needs considered), and providing an assessment of their perf ormanc e, on r equest, when members ar econsidered for re- appointment to the Committee or for appointment to the board of some other public body. 171Handling conflicts of interests The purpose of these provisions is to avoid any danger of Committee members being influenced, or appearing to be influenced, by their private interests in the exercise of their public duties. All membersshould declare any personal or business interest which may, or may be perceived (by a reasonable member of the public) to, influence their judgement. A guide to the types of interest that should be declared is includedbelow. (i) Declaration of Interests to the Secretariat Members of the Committee should inform the Secretariat in writing of their current personal and non- personal interests, when they are appointed, including the principal position(s) held. Only the name of thecompany and the nature of the interest are required; the amount of any salary etc. need not be disclosed. Aninterest is current if the member has an on-going financial involvement with industry, e.g. if he or she holds shares in industry, has a consultancy contract, or if the member or the department for which he or she isresponsible is in the process of carrying out work for industry. Members are asked to inform the Secretariatatany time of any chang eof their personal int erests and wil lbe invit ed tocomplete a declaration form once ayear. It is sufficient if changes in non-personal interests are reported in the annual declaration form following the change. (Non-personal interests involving less than \u00a31,000 from a particular company in the previous y ear need not be declared to the Secretariat). The register of interests should be kept up-to-date and be open to the public.(ii) Declaration of Interest and Participation at Meetings Members of the Committee are required to declare any direct interests relating to salaried employment or consultancies, or those of close family members 1,in matters under discussion at each meeting. Having fully explained the nature of their interest the Chairman will, having consulted the other members present, decide whether and to what extent the member should participate in the discussion and determination of the issue. If it is decided tha tthe member should leave the meeting, the Chairman may first allow them to make a statement on the item under discussion. Personal liability of C ommitt ee members ACommittee member may be personally liable if he or she makes a fraudulent or negligent statement which results in a loss to a third party; or may commit a breach of confidence under common law or a criminal offence under insider dealing legislation, if he or she misuses information gained through their position.However, the Government has indicated that individual members who have acted honestly, reasonably, in good f aith and without negligence will not have to meet out of their own personal resources any personal civil li abilit ywhich is incurr ed in execution or purported execution of their Committee functions save where the person has acted recklessly. To this effect a formal statement of indemnity has been drawn up. 1Close family members include personal partners, parents, children, brothers, sisters and the personal partners of any of these.Annual Report 2005 172THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC LIFE Selflessness Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. Integrity Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties. Objectivity In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals f or rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit. Accountability Holders of public offic eareaccountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselv es to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office. Openness Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands. Honesty Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to takesteps t oresolv eany conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interests. Leadership Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example. 173DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTEREST The following is intended as a guide to the kinds of interests that should be declared. Where members are uncertain as to whether an interest should be declared they should seek guidance from the Secretariat or,where it may concern a particular product which is to be considered at a meeting, from the Chairman at that meeting. If members have interests not specified in these notes but which they believe could be regarded as influencing their advice they should declare them. However, neither the members nor the Secretariat are under any obligation to search out links of which they might reasonably not be aware. For example, either through not being aware of all the interests of family members, or of not being aware of links between one company and another. Personal Interests Apersonal interest involves the member personally. The main examples are: Consultancies and /or direct employment: any consultancy, directorship, position in or work for industry which a ttracts regular or oc casional pa yments in cash or kind; Fee-Paid Work: any commissioned work by industry for which the member is paid in cash or kind; Shareholdings: any shareholding or other beneficial interest in shares of industry. This does not include shareholdings through unit trusts or similar arrangements where the member has no influence on financial management; Non-Personal Interests Anon-personal interest involves payment which benefits a department for which a member is responsible, but is no treceived by the member personally. The main examples are: Fellowships: the holding of a fellowship endowed by industry; Support by Industry: any payment, other support or sponsorship which does not convey any pecuniary or material benefit to a member personally, but which does benefit their position or department e.g. i)agrant for the running of a unit or department for which a member is responsible; ii) a grant or fellowship or other payment to sponsor a post or a member of staff or a post graduate research programme in the unit for which a member is responsible. This does not include financialassistance for students; iii) the commissioning of research or other work by, or advice from, staff who work in a unit for which the member is r esponsibl e.Annual Report 2005 174Members are under no obligation to seek out knowledge of work done for, or on behalf of, the industry or other relevant bodies by departments for which they are responsible, if they would not normally expect to be informed. Trusteeships :wher eamember is a trustee of a charity with investments in industry, the Secretariat can agree with the member a general declaration to cover this interest rather than draw up a detailed portfolio. DEFINITIONS In this Code, 'the industry' means: Companies, partnerships or individuals who are involved with the production, manufacture, sale or supply of pr oduc ts subjec ttothe f ollowing legislation; The Food Safety Act 1990 The Medicines Ac ts 1968 and 197 1 The Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 The Consumer Protection Act 1987The C osmetic (Saf ety)(Amendment) Regulations 1987 The Notification of New Substances Regulations 1982 Trade associations representing companies involved with such products; Companies, par tnerships or individuals who ar edirectly concerned with research, development or marketing of a product which is being considered by the Committees on Toxicity, Mutagenicity, or Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. In this Code 'the Secretariat' means the Secretariat of the COT. 175Introduction 1. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) and its sister committees the Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) are non-statutory independent advisory committees who advisethe Chairman of the Food Standards Agency and the CMO and, through them, the Government on a wide range of matters concerning chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment. 2. The Government is committed to make the operation of advisory committees such as the COT /COM /COC more open and to increase accountability. Proposals have been published in \"Quangos- Opening the Doors\" (Cabinet Office, July 1998). The COT /COM /COC have recently considered a number of options for greater openness of Committee business. There was a high level of agreement between the COT /COM /COC regarding the adoption of proposals for greater openness. 3. In discussing these pr oposals (during the course of 1999) the Committees were aware that the disclosure of information which is of a confidential nature and was communicated in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence is subject to the common law of confidentiality. Guidance is set out in the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (second edition, 1997). Thus an important aspec tof impl ementing initi atives for gr eater openness of C ommit tee business concerns setting out clear guidelines for the handling of information submitted on a confidential basis. General procedures for openness 4. The Committees agreed that the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed conclusions and statements (subject to the adoption of appropriate procedures for handling commercially sensitive information) and appointment of a lay /public interest member to each Committee would help to increase public scrutiny of Committee business. The Committees also agreed that additional open meetings on specific topics where interest groups, consumer organisations etc could attend and participa te should be held. 5. Asummary of the pr oposals is t abula ted. A mor edetailed outline of procedures regarding products where confidential data has been reviewed is given in paragraphs 11-13. 6. The C ommittees stressed that, in view of the highly technical nature of the discussions, there was a need f or al ldocuments r eleased to be finalised and agreed by the Committee, i.e. any necessary consultation with Members and Chairman should be completed before disclosure. 7. Statements and conclusions should summarise all the relevant data, such as information regarding potential hazar ds/risks f or human health in r espec tof the use of pr oduc ts and chemicals, and any recommendations for further research.Annual Report 2005 176ANNEX 3 - Openness8. The Committees will be asked for an opinion based on the data available at the time of consideration. It is recognised that, for many chemicals, the toxicological information is incomplete and that recommendations for further research to address these gaps will form part of the Committee's advice. 9. The release of documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the COT /COM /COC has agreed an opinion on the available data but where further additional information is required in order to finalise the Committee's conclusions, needs to be considered on a case-by case basis. The relevant considerations include the likelihood that such additional data would alter the Committee's conclusion,any representations made by a company about, for example, commercial harm that early disclosure could cause and also the public interest in disclosure. 177ISSUE PROPOSALS COMMENT Publish in accordance with procedures for previous years.Agreed Annual Report*Agreed conclusions/ statements published as appropriate including via the Int ernet and also made available on request.Agreed Conclusions/ statements *Anonymised minut es made a vailable upon r equest and on Int ernet site after appropriate consultation with members and agreement by the full committee.Agreed Minut es*Finalised papers to be made available upon r equest.

External consultation on identifying topics f or such meetings.Open meetings on specified topics (eg invit ed audienc e, int erest groups, consumer organisations, professional societies). *(Procedur es for handling confidential information outlined in paragraphs 11-13 below). 10 In the e vent tha tthe C ommit tees need to consider an item over several meetings, it might be necessary to keep relevant documents (e.g. papers and minutes) confidential until an agreed opinion (e.g. statement) is available.Procedures for handling confidential information Background 1C O T /COM /COC quite often consider information which has been supplied in confidence. For the most part this comprises information which is commercially sensitive. For example, this could include product formulations /specifica tions, methods of manufacture, and reports of toxicological investigations and company evaluations and safety assessment. 2 Normal procedure in the past has been to publish a summary of the Committee's advice in the Annual Report and to ask companies to release full copies of submitted reports for retention by the BritishLibrary at the completion of a review. Given the clear Ministerial commitment to the publication of detailed information regarding the activities of advisory committees, and in particular following the assessment of pr oduc ts which ar ealready a vailable to the general public, the COT /COM/COChave begun to adopt where possible a more open style of business where detailed statements have been published via the Internet soon after they have been finalised. 3 Except in cases where there is legislation under which information has been submitted and which deals with disclosur eand non-disclosure, the general principle of the common law duty of confidentiality will apply .This means tha tany inf orma tion which is of a c onfidenti al character and has been obtained in circumstances importing a duty of confidence may not be disclosed unless consent has been given or thereis an o verriding public int erest in disclosure (such as the prevention of harm to others). The following procedure will be adopted which allows confidential information to be identified, assessed and appropriate conclusions /statements to be drafted and published on the basis of a prior mutual understanding with the companies. There is scope for companies to make representations also after submission of the information and prior to publication regarding the commercial sensitivity of datasupplied and t ocomment on the text of statements which are to be published. However, companies would not have a right of veto in respect of such statements. Procedures prior to committee consideration Initial discussions 4. Upon r eferral to COT /COM/COC the Secr etariat will liaise with the relevant company supplying the product in the UK to: i) Clearly state the policy of Committee openness (as summarised above).ii)Toidentify and r equest the inf ormation /COM/COC ( e.g.test reports, publications etc).Annual Report 2005 178OpennessConfidential data iii) The company will be asked to clearly identify any confidential data and the reason for confidentiality. Handling confidential data iv) The procedures by which the COT /COM /COC will handle confidential data and the public availability of papers, minutes, conclusions and statements where reference is made to such datawill be discussed with the company prior to submission of papers to the Committee(s). The generalprocedures for handling documents are outlined in paragraphs 4-10 above. Companies will be informed that confidential annexes to Committee papers (e.g. where detailed information suppliedin confidenc esuch as individual patient information and full study reports of toxicological studies) willnotbe disclosed but tha tother inf ormation will be disclosed unless agreed otherwise with an individual company. v) The following is a suggested list of information which might be disclosed in COT /COM /COC documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements). The list is not exhaustive and is presentedas a guide: a) name of product (or substance /chemical under consideration), b)information on physico-chemical properties, c) methods of rendering harmless,d) a summary of the results and evaluation of the results of tests to establish harmlessness to humans, e) methods of analysis,f) first aid and medical treatment to be given in the case of injury to persons, g) surveillance data (e.g. monitoring for levels in food, air, or water). Procedures during and after Committee consideration 5. The timing of release of Committee documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the it em of business inv olved the consideration of confidential data would be subject to the general provisions outlined in par agraphs 4-10 above. Documents would not be released until a Committee - agreed conclusion or statement was available. 6. The most important outcome of the Committee consideration is likely to be the agreed statement. Companies will be given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to publication and to make representations (for example, as to commercial sensitivities in the statement). The Chairman would be asked toconsider any comments provided, but companies would not be able to veto the publication of astatement or any part of it. Companies will continue to be asked to release full copies of submitted repor ts for retention by the British Library at the completion of a review. 179apriori :The formulation of a hypothesis before undertaking an investigation or experiment. Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) :Estimate of the amount of a substance in food or drink, expressed on a body weight basis (e.g. mg /kg bodyweight), that can be ingested daily over a lifetime by humans without appreciable health risk. Acute :Short term, in relation to exposure or effect. Acut etoxicity :Effects tha toccur o ver a shor tperiod of time (up to 14 days) immediately following exposure. Adduct :Achemical grouping which is covalently bound (see covalent binding) to a large molecule such as DNA ( qv)or pr otein. Adenoma :Abenign neoplasm arising from a gland forming epithelial tissue such as colon, stomach or respiratory tract. Adverse effect :Change in morphology, physiology, biochemistry, growth, development or lifespan of an organism which results in impairment of functional capacity or impairment of capacity to compensate for additional str ess or increase in susceptibility to the harmful effects of other environmental influences. Ah receptor :The Ah (Ar omatic hydrocarbon) receptor protein regulates some specific gene expressions associ ated with toxicity. The identity of the natural endogenous chemicals which bind to the Ah receptor is unknown. Binding to the Ah receptor is an integral part of the toxicological mechanism of a range of chemicals, such as chlorina ted dibenz odio xins an alkyl group covalently bound to biologically important molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids (see adduct). Many alkylating agents are mutagenic, carcinogenic immunosuppressive. Allele :Alternative form of a gene. Allergen :Substance capable of stimulating an allergic reaction. Allergy :The adverse health effects that may result from the stimulation of a specific immune response. Allergic reaction :an adverse reaction elicited by exposure to a previously sensitised individual to the relevant antig en. Ames test :In vitro (qv) assay for bacterial gene mutations (qv) using strains of Salmonella typhimurium developed b yAmes and his c olleagues.Annual Report circumstances in which the total number of chromosomes within a cell is not an exact multiple of the normal haploid (see 'polyploidy') number. Chromosomes may be lost or gained during celldivision. Apoptosis :Aform of active cell death resulting in fragmentation of the cell into membrane-bound fragments (apoptotic bodies). These are usually rapidly removed in vivo by engulfment by phagocytic cells. Apoptosis can occur normally during development, but is often triggered by toxic stimuli. Base pair (bp): Two complementary nucleotide (qv) bases joined together by chemical bonds. Bias:In the context of epidemiological studies, an interference which at any stage of an investigation tends to produce results that depart systematically from the true values (to be distinguished from random error). The term does no tnecessarily carry an imputation of prejudice or any other subjective factor such as the experimenter's desire for a particular outcome. Bioavailability :Aterm r eferring to the proportion of a substance which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged after a particular route of administration. Bioinf orma tics:The scienc eof inf ormatics as applied to biological research. Informatics is the management and analysis of data using advanced computing techniques. Bioinformatics is particularly important as anadjunct to genomics research, because of the large amount of complex data this research generates. Biomarker: Observable change (not necessarily pathological) in an organism, related to a specific exposure or effect. Body burden :Total amount of a chemical present in an organism at a given time. Bradford Hill Criteria :SirAustin Bradford-Hill established criteria that may be used to assist in the interpretation of associations reported from epidemiological studies:- - Strength - The stronger the association the more likely it is causal. The COC has previously noted that the relative risks of <3need careful assessment for effects of bias or confounding. - Consistency - The association has been consistently identified by studies using different approaches and is also seen in different populations with exposure to the chemical under consideration. - Specificity - Limitation of the association to specific exposure groups or to specific types of disease increases lik elihood tha tthe association is causal. -Temporality - The association must demonstrate that exposure leads to disease. The relationship of time sinc efirst exposur e, duration of exposure and time since last exposure are all important in assessing causality. 181- Biological gradient - If an association reveals a biological gradient or dose-response curve, then this evidence is of particular importance in assessing causality. - Plausibility - Is there appropriate data to suggest a mechanism by which exposure could lead to concern? However, even if an observed association may be new to science or medicine it should notbe dismissed. - Coherence - Cause and effect interpretation of data should not seriously conflict with generally known facts. - Experiment - Can the association be demonstrated? Evidence from experimental animals may assist in some cases. Evidence that removal of the exposure leads to a decrease in risk may be relevant. - Analogy - Have other closely related chemicals been associated with the disease? Bronchial :Relating to the air passages conducting air from the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. C.elegans: Caenorhabditis el egans ,anema have its genome compl etely sequenced and all the genes fully characterised. Cancer: Synonym for a malignant neoplasm - that is, a tumour (qv) that grows progressively, invades local tissues and spreads to distant sites (see also tumour and metastasis). Candidate gene: Agene that has been implicated in causing or contributing to the development of a particular disease. Carcinogenesis :The origin, causation and development of tumours (qv). The term applies to benign as well as malignant neoplasms and no tjust t ocarcinomas ( qv). Carcinogenicity bioassay :Tests carried out in laboratory animals, usually rats and mice, to determine whether asubstance is carcinogenic. The test material is given throughout life to groups of animals at different dose levels. Carcinogens :The causal agents which induce tumours. They include external factors (chemicals, physical agents, viruses) and internal factors such as hormones. Chemical carcinogens are structurally diverse and include naturally-occurring substances as well as synthetic compounds. An important distinction can be drawn between genotoxic (qv) carcinogens which have been shown to react with and mutate DNA, and non- genotoxic carcinogens which act through other mechanisms. The activity of genotoxic carcinogens can often be predicted from their chemical structure - either of the parent compound or of active metabolites (qv). Most chemical carcinogens exert their effects after prolonged exposure, show a dose-response relationshipand tend to act on a limited range of susceptible target tissues. Carcinogens are sometimes species- or sex-specific and the t erm should be qualified b ythe appr opriate descriptive adjectives to aid clarity. Several different chemical and other carcinogens may interact, and constitutional factors (genetic susceptibility,hormonal status) may also contribute, emphasising the multifactorial nature of the carcinogenic process.Annual Report 2005 182Carcinoma :Malignant tumour arising from epithelial cells lining, for example, the alimentary, respiratory and urogenital tracts and from epidermis, also from solid viscera such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys and some endocrine glands.

Cell transformation :The process by which a normal cell acquires the capacity for neoplastic growth. Complete transformation occurs in several stages both in vitr oand in viv o.One st ep which has been identified in vitro is 'immortalisation' by which a cell acquires the ability to divide indefinitely in culture. Such cells do not have the capacity to form tumours in animals, but can be induced to do so by extended passage in vitro ,by treatment with chemicals, or by transfection with oncogene DNA. The transformed phenotype so generated is usually, but not always, associated with the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar and to form tumours when transplanted into animals. It should be noted that each of these stages of transformation caninvolve multiple events which may or may not be genetic. The order in which these events take place, if theyoccur a tall, in viv ois no tknown. Chromosomal aberrations :Collective term of particular types of chromosome damage induced after exposure to exogenous chemical or physical agents which damage the DNA. (see clastogen).

In eukaryotic cells, thechromosomes are thread-like structures, composed mainly of DNA and protein, which are present within the nuclei of e very c ell. They occur in pairs, the numbers varying from one to more than 100 per nucleus in different species. Normal somatic cells in humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each consisting of linear sequences of DNA which are known as genes (qv).

Metabonomics :Techniques available to identify the presence and concentrations of metabolites in a biological sample. Metaphase :Stage of cell division (mitosis and meiosis) during which the chromosomes are arranged on the equator of the nuclear spindle (the collection of microtubule filaments which are responsible for the movement of chromosomes during cell division). As the chromosomes are most easily examined inmetaphase, c ells are arrested at this stage for microscopical examination for chromosomal aberrations (qv) - known as met aphase analy sis. Metastasis :The process whereby malignant cells become detached from the primary tumour mass, disseminate (mainly in the blood stream or in lymph vessels) and 'seed out' in distant sites where they form secondary or metastatic tumours.

Mutant cells produce two forms of colony - large, which represent mutations within the gene and smal l, which r epresent lar gegenetic chang es in the chr omosome such as chromosome aberrations. Thus this assay can provide additional information about the type of mutation which has occurred if colony size is scored. Mouse spot t est:An in viv otest for mut ation, in which pr egnant mice are dosed with the test compound and mutations are detected by changes (spots) in coat colour of the offspring.

Mutation :Apermanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in an organism or cell, which can result in a change in phenotypic characteristics. The alteration may involve a single gene, a blockof genes, or a whole chromosome. Mutations involving single genes may be a consequence of effects on singleDNA bases (point mutations) or of large changes, including deletions, within the gene. Changes involving whole chromosomes may be numerical or structural.

Transg enic animal models :Animals which ha veextra(exogenous) fr agments of DNA incorporated into their genomes. This may include reporter genes to assess in-vivo effects such as mutagenicity in transgenic mice containing a recoverable bacterial gene (lacZ or lac I). Other transgenic animals may have alterations of specific g enes belie ved to be involved in disease processes (e.g. cancer). For example strains of mice have been bred which carry an inactivated copy of the p53 tumour suppressor gene (qv) -, or an activated form ofthe rasoncogene which may enhance their susceptibility of the mice to certain types of carcinogenic chemicals. Translation: In molecular biology, the process during which the information in mRNA molecules is used to construc tproteins. Tumour (Synonym - neoplasm): A mass of abnormal, disorganised cells, arising from pre-existing tissue, which ar echaracterised by excessive and uncoordinated proliferation and by abnormal differentiation. Benign tumours sho waclose morphological r esemblanc etotheir tissue of in slow expansile fashion; and form circumscribed and (usually) encapsulated masses. They may stop growing and they may regress. Benign tumours do no tinfiltr atethrough local tissues and the ydo not metastasise (qv). They are rarely fatal. Malignant tumours (synonym - cancer) resemble their parent tissues less closely and are composed of increasingly abnormal cells in terms of their form and function. Well differentiated examples still retain recognisable features of their tissue of origin but these characteristics are progressively lost in moderately and poorly differentiated malignancies: undifferentiated or anaplastic tumours are composed of cells whichresemble no known normal tissue. Most malignant tumours grow rapidly, spread progressively through adjac ent tissues and met astasise to distant sites. Tumours are conventionally classified according to the anatomical sit eof the primary tumour and its microscopical appearance, rather than by cause. Some common examples of nomenclature are as follows: Tumours arising from Tumours tissues are malignant and are called lymphomas (qv); they are often multifocal. Malignant proliferations of bone marrow cells are called leukaemias. Benign tumours may evolve to the corresponding malignant tumours; examples involve the adenoma carcinoma sequence in the large bowel in humans, and the papilloma carcinoma sequence in mouse skin. Tumour initiation: Aterm originally used to describe and explain observations made in laboratory models of multistage carcinogenesis, principally involving repeated applications of chemicals to the skin of mice. Initiation, in such contexts, was the first step whereby small numbers of cells were irreversibly changed, orinitiated. Subsequent, separate events (see tumour promotion) resulted in the development of tumours. It isnow recognised that these early, irreversible heritable changes in initiated cells were due to genotoxicdamage, usually in the form of somatic mutations and the initiators used in these experimental models can be regarded as genotoxic carcinogens (qv). Tumour pr omotion: An incr erm, original ly used, lik e'tumour initiation' to describe events in multistage carcinogenesis in experimental animals. In that context, promotion is regarded as the protracted process whereby initiated cells undergo clonal expansion to form overt tumours. The mechanisms of clonalexpansion are diverse, but include direct stimulation of cell proliferation, repeated cycles of cell damage and cell regeneration and release of cells from normal growth-controlling mechanisms. Initiating and promotingagents were originally regarded as separate categories, but the distinction between them is becomingincreasingly har dtosustain. The v arious modes of pr omo tion are non-genotoxic, but it is incorrect to conclude that 'non-genotoxic carcinogen' (qv) and 'promoter' are synonymous. Uncertainty f actor: Value used in extr apola tion from experimental animals to man (assuming that man may be more sensitive) or from selected individuals to the general population: for example, a value applied to the NOAEL to derive an ADI or TDI. The value depends on the size and type of population to be protected and the quality of the toxicological information available. Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS): DNA synthesis that occurs at some stage in the cell cycle other than the Speriod (the normal or ' schedul ed'DNA synthesis period), in r esponse t oDNA damage. It is usually associated with DNA repair. Volume of distribution :Apparent volume of fluid required to contain the total amount of a substance in the body at the same concentration as that present in the plasma, assuming equilibrium has been attained.
