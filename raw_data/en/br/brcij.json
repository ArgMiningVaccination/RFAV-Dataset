INTRODUCTION FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION THE YEAR'S WORK AND WORK ON HAND HOW THE WORK IS DELEGATED THE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR DUTIES PUBLICATIONS OF THE COMMISSION VIIANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION PART I. INTRODUCTION FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION The Federal Trade Commission was organized March 16, 1915, as a result of the passage of the Federal Trade Commission act of September 26, 1914. 1 The commission is a quasi-judicial and administrative body whose chief functions are (1) to prevent unfair competition, (2) to find facts in aid of legislation, and (3) to report facts in regard to alleged violations of the antitrust laws. Based on the Federal Trade Commissio n act, the duties of the commission are divided into two broad classes, legal and economic. Legal activities have largely to do with prevention and correction of unfair methods of competition in accordance with section 5 of the act in which it is written that \"unfair methods of competition in commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\" A large part of this annual report is given over to a description of the commission's activities in this field, beginning with \"General Legal Work\" on page 57 and continuing with \"Trade Practice Conferences,\" page 51, and \"Special Procedure in Certain Types of Advertising Cases,\" page 43. On page 86 will be found a description of many of the types of unfair competition against which the commission has taken action in its cases. Section 6 (a) of the act gives the commission power \"to gather and compile information concerning, and to investi gate from time to time, the organization, busines s, conduct, practices, and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, excepting banks and common carriers, * * * and its relation to other corporations and to individuals, associations, and partnerships.\" In pursuance of section 6 the commission conducts general investigations at the request of the President, either House of Congress, 1 The nucleus of the new agency was the old Bureau of Corporations of the Department of Commerce, which ceased to exist as such upon formation of the commission, although its work was taken over by the commission under what is now the economic division. The legal functions of the commission were brought into being by the act.12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION and the Attorney General, and makes reports in aid of legislation and in regard to alleged violations of the antitrust acts. More than 70 such inquiries have been conducted in the commission's life, digests of which appear beginning on page 261. Current investigations are reported beginning on page 11. CLAYTON AND EXPORT TRADE ACTS Besides its organ ic act, the commission also administers other acts. It enforces sections 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act, dealing, respectively, with unlawful price discriminations, so-called tying contracts, stock acquisitions which lessen competition or tend to create a mono-poly, and interlocking directorates. (See Consolidations and Mergers, p.61.) The Webb-Pomerene law, or export trade act, is administered by the commission. It is to promote export trade. It exempts associations of American exporters engaged solely in export trade from the provisions of the antitrust laws. (See p.129.) THE YEAR'S WORK AND WORK ON HAND During the year the commission continued seven general business investigations, completing one such inqui ry and bringing all the others into the final stages. These investigations and the status of each are described as follows: GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS Power and gas utilities.-- Public hearings held during fiscal year for six large utility groups, including many of their subsidiaries. Hearings on other groups are to continue throughout the fiscal year of 1932-33. (See p.11.) Chain stores-- All field work has been completed and final reports are now being written. Seven such reports have been issued, six of them printed, and it is likely the reports will be completed in 1933. They are being issued in serial form. (See p.21.) Cottonseed prices.-- Hearings in various southern cities completed during fiscal year and final report is being written. (See p.33.) Peanut prices.--Final report completed and submitted to the Senate June 30, 1932. (See p.34.) Price bases.-- First report, entitled \"The Basing-Point Formula and Cement Prices,\" transmitted to Congress March 26, 1932. (See p.36.) Cement industry.-- Field examination completed. Report to the Sena te now being prepared. (See p.38.) Building materials.-- Field work completed. Report to the Senate now being prepared. (See p.38.)HOW THE COMMISSION'S WORK IS DELEGATED 3 Bread and flour.-- This inquiry was not counted in the above enumerations of seven inquiries, as the report issued during the fiscal year was only to cover certain facts which the commission sought in an investigation conducted six years ago but which the commission did not receive until 1931 as the result of a court decision handed down at that time. (See p.39.) GENERAL LEGAL WORK During the year the commission issued 92 complaints against various companies and individuals charging various forms of unfair competition not in the public interest. Sixty-three orders to cease and desist from unfair practices were served on that many respondents. Representative cases of both classes are described, respectively, at pages 64 and 72, while digests of all complaints and orders appear respectively on pages 183 and 171. Trade-practice conferences.-- The report for the fiscal year, showing the number of new conferences held and the number of industries for which trade-practice-conference rules were acted on, is to be found on page 51, while on page 253 is a complete list of the 140 industries for which conferences have been held under auspices of the commission. False advertising cases.-- The commission's special board of investigation handling false and misleading advertising cases acted on 406 cases during the year. The types of advertising involved ranged from those of alleged fat-reducing compounds and cosmetics to those of alleged cures for practically every disease known to medicine. Export-trade work.-- Besides the report on the commission's admini stration of the export trade act alread y mentioned, there appears beginning on page 135, a comprehensive review of trust laws and unfair competition in foreign countries. HOW THE COMMISSION'S WORK IS DELEGATED The work of the commission may be divided into the following general parts: Legal, general investigations, and administrative. The legal division has charge of proceedings against unfair methods of competition forbidden by the Federal Trade Commission act and of other practices condemned by the Clayton Act, and with the trial of cases before the commission and in the courts. This work is carried on through the following officials; the chief examiner (for whose functions see pp.57 and 60), the board of review (pp.58 and 61), chief trial examiner (p. 59), and the chief counsel, who is legal adviser to the commission (p. 58). There are also the division of trade practice conferences (p. 51), the speci al board of investigation for cases of false and misleading advertising4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (p.43), and the foreign-trade work, which is under supervision of the chief counsel (p.129). Members of the trial examiners' division are delegated to presi de at trial of formal complaints and to sit as special masters in taking testimony in investigations under cong ressional resolutions, and to arrange settlements of application for com- plaint, by stipulation. A tabular summary of all legal work begins on page 117. The economic division, under the chief economist, carries on certain of the general inquiries of the commission, whether directed by the President, by either House of Congress, or by the commission itself. Such investigations are those regarding public utilities, chain-store systems, and price bases. It carries on that part of the public- utilities inquiry which deals with the financial structure, organization, and management of power and gas utilities, although the chief counsel has charge of the examination in public hearings. The chief examiner also cooperates with the economic division in legal aspects of the chain-store study. The investigations of cottonseed prices, cement industry, and building materials are in the custody of the chief examiner, the chief counsel furnishing an attorney for work on the cotto nseed inquiry, and the economic division cooperating in the cement inquiry. The administrative division, responsible directly to the assistant secretary of the commission, conducts the business affairs of the commission and is made up of units usually found in Gover nment establishments, the functions of such units being governed largely by general statutes. These units are as follows: Accounts and personnel, disbursing office, docket, publications, editorial service, mails and files, supplies, stenographic, hospital, and the library. THE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR DUTIES The Federal Trade Commission is one of the \"independent establishments\" of the Government and its control is lodged not in a Cabinet officer but in five commissioners appointed by the President. Not more than three of these members may belong to the same political party, accord ing to the law, in order to make the commission nonpolitical and bipartisan. The term of office of a commissioner is 7 years, as provided in the Federal Trade Commission act. The first commissioners were designated to continue in office for periods of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years, respectively, from the date the act became effective, but their successors were to be appointed for terms of 7 years. The term of each commissioner dates from the 26th of September preceding the time of his appointment, September 26 marking the day of passage of the act in 1914.THE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR DUTIES 5 The commission, at the close of the fiscal year, was composed of the following members: William E Humphrey, of Washington, chairman; Charles H. March, of Minnesota; Edgar A. McCulloch, of Arkansas; Garland S. Ferguson, jr., of North Carolina; and C. W. Hunt, of Iowa. Commissioner Humphrey, whose first term would have expired September 26, 1931, was given a recess appointment for a second term by President Hoover June 30, 1931, and was renominated December 10. The appointment was confirmed by the Senate January 27, 1932. Mr. Humphrey was chosen by the commission as its chair-man for the calendar year 1932, succeeding Commissioner Hunt. Each January a member of the commission is designated to serve as chairman for the succeedi ng year. The position rotates, so that each commissioner serves at least one year during his term of office. The chairman presides during meetings of the commission and signs the more important official papers and reports at the direction of the commission. Official activities of the commissioners are generally similar in character, although each assumes broad super visory charge of a different division of work. One commissioner maintains contact with the chief counsel and his staff; another keeps in touch with administrative functions and with the hoard of review, while trade-practice conferences, the trial examiners' division, and the special board of investigation make up the field of a third commissioner. A fourth and fifth commissioner have assigned to them, respectively, the economic division and the chief examiner's office. However, all matters scheduled to be acted upon by the commission are dealt with by the board as a whole or a quorum thereof; consequently, the facts in all cases to come before the whole body are previously placed befor e the commissioners individually for their consideration. The commissioners meet regularly for transaction of official business Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, except in July and August, when sessions are held only on call. They also conduct oral hearings, such as final arguments in cases before the commission and hearings on motion of the attorneys for either the commission or respondents. Besides these duties and their conferences with persons discussing official business, the members have a large amount of reading and study in connection with the numerous cases before them for decision. The comm issioners also conduct trade-practice conferences held for industries in various parts of the country. One of them usually presides at such a conference. The commission has a secretary, who is its executive officer.6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION PUBLICATIONS OF THE COMMISSION Publications of the commission, reflecting the character and scope of its work, vary in content and treatm ent from year to year, especially those documents relating to general business inquiries. Such studies are illustrated by appropriate charts, tables, and statistics. They deal not only with current developments in an industry but contain scientific and historical background that proves to be valuable not only to members of the industry under consideration but to the student and the writer. Many of these reports have been used as textbooks in universities and colleges. The findings and orders of the commission as published contain interesting material regarding business and industry. They tell, case by case, the story of unfair competition in interstate commerce and of the efforts put forth by the commission to correct and eliminate it. Wide discretion in issuing publications is given the commission by law. The Federal Trade Commission act, section 6 (f), says the commission shall have power-- To make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it hereunder, except trade secrets and names of customers, as it shall deem expedient in the public interest; and to make annual and special reports to the Congress and to submit therewith recommendations for additional legislation; and to provide for the publication of its reports and decisions in such form and manner as may be best adapted for public information and use. A complete list of all publications of the commission, 1915-1932, may be found on page 271. COMMISSION APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES ARE REDUCED The Federal Trade Commission, like other governmental bodies, has undergone drastic reductions in appropriations and expenditures. While the amount available to the commission for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1932, was $1,838,097, the amount available for 1933 was $1,396,719. 2 This reduction made necessary the dismissal or furlough of 84 employees out of a total of 511 following the close of the fiscal year. Most of these were \"temporary\" employees who had worked on the power and chain-store investigations. The total personn el was 511 as of June 30, 1932, including commissioners. Following the reductions in personnel, the total was 427 persons. DECISION IN ELECTRIC BOND & SHARE CO. CASE A recent development of importance to the commission its power investigation is the decision handed down August 19, 1932,2 The commission's financial statement for the fiscal year appears on p.145.PUBLICATIONS OF THE COMMISSION 7 by Judge Knox in the United States District Court of Southern New York in the case of the commission against Electric Bond & Share Co. This grew out of the company's resistance to the commission's efforts to obtain certain books of accounts. The decision is quoted in part on page 95. AMENDMENT OF ORGANIC ACT AGAIN SUGGESTED Renewal is made of the suggestion in the last three annual reports for an amendment to the commission's Organic act to put beyond question the grant of specific authority to the commission to make investigati ons, upon request of the President or of either House of the Congress in aid of its legislative function; and it is suggested that such an amendment might also set at rest any doubt as to the applicability of the provisions of section 9 of the act to such investigations and those authorized under section 6 (d) of the act (providing for investigations of alleged violations of the antitrust acts upon direction of the President or either House of Congress) . COMMISSION MOVES ITS OFFICES In September, 1932, the commissi on moved its executive offices in Washington from 1800 Virginia Avenue NW. to a large building at Constitution Avenue and Twentieth Stree t (2001 Constitution Avenue NW.), where part of its force had been quartered since the fire of August 30, 1930. The entire personnel is now in a single building for the first time since the fire.PART II.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS POWER AND GAS UTILITIES HOLDING COMPANIES--FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND PRACTICES Pursuant to Senate Resolution 83, Seventieth Congress, First session, and section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission act,1 the Commission continued its investigation of large utility holding companies, subholding companies, and numerous typical operating companies. The investigation is being conducted to ascertain and report the facts as to their complicat ed financial structures, the growth of capital assets and capital liabilities, methods of issuing various stocks and securities and the cost thereof, including organization expenses, commissions, discounts, and redemption charges, and including the capitalization of management and other types of supervisory and controlling contracts, creation and use of capital surplus, payments of dividends, and other practices. The pertinent facts relating to the various forms in use from time to time of management, supervision, servicing, engineering, construction and financing contracts, are also being ascertained. 2 Further examinations have been made by an engineer-examiner of the physical condition and efficiency of the plants and the equipment of the operating companies as well as of the organization and efficiency of management. During the fiscal year public hearings have been held beginning on the dates indicated, and testimony and reports presented on the following groups and companies: 1 Full text of the resolution appears on p.255. Section 6 of the Federal Trade commission act provides that-\" The commission shall have power-- (a) To gather and compile Information concerning, and to investigate from time to time, the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, excepting banks and common carriers subject to the act to regulate commerce, and its relation to other corporations and to individuals, associations, and partnerships. * * * * * * * \"(d) Upon the direction of the President or either House of Congress to investigate and report the facts relating to any alleged violations of the antitrust acts by any corporation.\" 2 No report of its conclusions and recommendations has yet been made by the commission on this investigation. 1112 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Hearings Company began ASSOCIATED GAS & ELECTRIC CO.

Occasionally officers of the corporations have been called to testify on special or specific points. At all hearings counsel representing the corporations whose records and transactions are under discussion have been present with full privilege to present objections, to cross- examine, and to offer testimony in behalf of such corporations. The hearings during the last fiscal year have covered chiefly the financial control, management, organization, and operations of Operating electric and gas utility companies doing an interstate or international business, and their holding companies, including (1) growth of capital assets and capital liabilities, (2) the issues of securities, and the proceeds and expenses of such issues, (3) capital and other surplus, how created and used, (4) operating, overhead, and other expenses, (5) earnings and dividends, including stock dividends, (6) the extent to which such bolding companies or their stockholders control or are financially interested in their subsidiary operating public utilities and other companies, and the relation one to the other of such corporations, (7) the various services furnished to their operating utility corporations by the holding companies and their affiliated and controlled companies, and the fees, commissions, bonuses, and other charges and the costs thereof and the profits therefrom, (8) the value or detriment to the public of such holding companies, particularly with relation to the financial and operating policies, including charges imposed by them upon their operating comp anies, and (9) the rates for service to various classes of customers. Reports have also been presented at the hearings dealing with intercorporate relations, management, supervision, and servicing, including for each group, methods of control through stock owner-ship and supervisory contracts, identical stockholders, identical directors, directors who are employees, identical officers, officers who are employees, conduct of meetings by proxy holders who are directors, officer's, or employees, and also reports stating the interstate transmission of electric energy.POWER AND GAS UTILITIES 15 TESTIMONY AND EXHIBITS ARE PRINTED The testimony and exhibits brought out by the investigation of the publicity and propaganda which has been conducted through utility associations are printed in parts 1 to 20 of the Senate print, together with accompanying volumes of exhibits with some additional material in part 35. The expenditures for the publicity work conducted by the public-relations sections of the several groups and companies are being presented in connection with other testimony and facts touching each such group and company. Records of the hearings, including transcripts of testimony and re ports and charts introduced as exhibits are, in accordance with the Senate resolution, transmitted to the Senate on the 15th of each month. Those so transmitted during the present fiscal year have been or are being printed as Senate Document No.92, Seventieth Congress, first session, parts 36 to 45, inclusive, as shown in list above. FIELD INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS IN 1931-32 The field examination of the business and relations of various electric and gas public-utility companies continued throughout the year, partly in broadening the previous inquiry into particular groups on which hearings have already been held, but especially in extending the inquiries into groups which have not yet been considered in the hearings. Six of these groups are among the most important in either the electric power or the gas industries. They are: Cities Service Co. group (Doherty), Niagara Hudson Power Corporation group (Morgan), Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation group (Morgan), Central & Southwest Utilities Co. (Insull), Associated Gas & Electric group, and United Gas Improvement Co. group (Morgan). It is estimated that in the production of electric energy, the combined output of these six groups in 1930 was more than 16 per cent of the total for the United States with an interstate or international movement of about 29 per cent of their production. These six are probably of even greater relative importance in the production of gas. The true measure of the importance of these companies for the purposes of this inquiry is not, however, in their proportion of the total production, but rather in the important light their history throws on various problems of the control and management of public utilities.16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SCOPE OF PUBLIC HEARINGS IN 1931-32 Hearings Were held during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1932, on certain companies controlled by Standard Gas & Electric Co. (Byllesby group), Middle West Utilities Co. (Insull group), Electric Power & Light Corporation and American Power & Light Co. (Electric Bond & Share group), North American Light & Power Co., and Associated Gas & Electric Co. These hearings covered various holding and management companies and also some of the operating companies within these several groups. Taking these five groups as a whole, they generated more than 17,500,000,000 kilowatt hours of electric energy in 1930 or more than 18 per cent of the total quantity generated in the United States for that year. In connection with the operations of these five groups, about 3,000,000, 000 kilowatt hours, or about 17 per cent of the total, moved in interstate commerce. ASSOCIATED GAS & ELECTRIC Co. Hearings on Associated Gas & Electric Co. were begun near the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1932. The Associated Gas & Electric System is controlled by Associated Gas & Electric Properties, a Massachusetts voluntary association, which in turn is controlled by H. C. Hopson and J. I. Mange. Associated Gas & Electric Co. controlled close to 180 operating companies, December 31, 1929. Its electric and gas companies operate in 22 States, as follows: New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tenne ssee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana, also in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and in the Philippine Islands. The total operating revenues of companies in the system from electric, gas, water, transportation, and other services aggregated $68,903,253.63 in 1929. The total income of the holding company Associated Gas & Electric Co., in 1929, was $48,815,755.62. The consolidated balance sheet of Associated Gas & Electric Co. as of December 31, 1929, showed a total of $673,174,481.10 for \"Plant, property, and franchises,\" and total assets of $962,117,862.28. The Associated Gas & Electric Co. and subsidiaries had outstanding long-term debt of $468,509,769.62 on that date, $71,481,104.17 in preferred stock, and $240,689,960.82 of different classes of common stock, trust certificates, etc. The hearings on this group were only just begun and reports on numerous subsidiary companies are to follow.POWER AND GAS UTILITIES 17 MIDDLE WEST UTILITIES Co. GROUP (INSULL) Hearings were held during the fiscal year on the following companies in the Middle West Utilities Co. group, the chief holding company of the so-called Insull group: Middle West Utilities Co., L. E. Myers Co., North West Utilities Co., Mississippi Valley Utilities Investment Co., United Public Service Co., United Public Utilities Co., Kentucky Power Co., National Electric Power Co., Electric Management & Engineering Corporation, National Public Service Corporation, New England Public Service Co., Central Main e Power Co., Georgia Power & Light Co., Florida Power Corporation, Tide Water Power Co., Commonwealth Light & Power Co., Andro- scoggin Corporation, Androscoggin Electric Co., Arkansas-Missouri Power Co., East Missouri Power Co., Central Illinois Public Service Co., Inland Power & Light Corporation, National Light, Heat & Power Co., and the Twin State Gas & Electric Co. The utility companies in the Middle West group as of December 31, 1930, operated in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey , New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and in the Dominion of Canada. The gross operating revenue s in 1930, of the utilities in the group amounted to $182,213,975. The fixed capital of the utilities on December 31, 1930, after deduction of depreciation and depletion reserves, was valued on the companies books at $952,574,784, of which utilities valued at $9,121 ,967 were in Canada. Against that fixed capital and other assets, there were outstanding $566,665,220 of funded debt, $153,245,513 of preferred stocks, $295,903,114 of common stocks and $370,205 of paid subscriptions to capital stocks. Certain subholding companies had outstanding $1,664,321 of bonds, $77,274,949 of preferred stocks, and $72,782,599 of common stocks, against whic h they held as assets certain of the securities enumerated in the preceding sentence. Middle West Utilities Co. itself, the apex holding company, held investments valued on its books at $249,774,782; and it had outstanding $50,000,000 of convertible notes, $60,756,382 of preferred stock and $142,042,260 book valuation of common stock with additional valuation of $22,115,762 designated as capital surplus. The utility companies on which hearings were held had gross revenues in the last year covered by the examinations aggregating $81,393,648. Their fixed capital had a total ledger valuation of18 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION $486,415,640, against which fixed capital and other assets there were outstanding $303,173,100 of bonds, $51,636,527 of preferred stocks, $22,159,279 of common stocks, and $137,824,729 of other capital Stocks (partly preferred, partly common). Certain subholding companies also had outstanding $21,934,474 of preferred stocks and $32,510,425 of common stocks against which they held as investments certain of the securities enumerated in the preceding sentence. About one-third of the mate rial on this group remains to be presented in future hearings. The facts developed in this investigation gain added interest, particularly as to alleged earnings and surpluses, in view of the fact that the Middle West Utilities Co. and a number of its allied companies are now in the hands of receivers. It should be noted, how-ever, that the examiners of the commission were not given access to the books and records of Insull, Son & Co. (Inc.) and Insull Utility Investments (Inc.), which were the first to go into receivership. STANDARD GAS & ELECTRIC Co. GROUP (BYLLESBY) During the fiscal year hearings were held on Standard Gas & Electric Co., inclusive of the chief operations of Mississippi Valley Gas & Electric Co., Utilities Investment Co., Standard Power & Light Corporation (Maryland) , Standard Power & Light Corporation (Delaware) , and California Power Corporation, also upon the following subsidiary holding and/or operating companies : Oklahoma. Gas & Electric Co., Louisville Gas & Electric Co. (Delaware) , Louisville Gas & Electric Co. (Kentucky) , Kentucky Coke Co., Kentucky Pipe Line Co. (Kentucky) , Kentucky Pipe Line Co. (Indiana) , Louisville Hydro-Electric Co., Madison Light & Power Co., Ivyton Oil & Gas Co. (Kentucky) , Ivyton Oil & Gas Co. (Delaware) , Northern States Power Co. (Delaware) , Northern States Power Co. (Minnesota), inclusive of Northern States Securities Corporation, and the Minneapolis General Electric Co. The operating companies on which hearings were held operate in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Their gross revenues during 1929 amounted to $59,930,830. As of December 31, 1929, their bonded indebtedness was $166,985,523, and they had outstanding $107,987,900 of preferred, $53,16 5,700 of common stock with par value, and 1,630,489 shares of common stock without par value. The total fixed capital of these operating companies at the end of 1929 was $335,977,236. Standard Gas & Electric Co., itself , the apex holding company, received in 1929 a gross income of $14,164,646, of which $13,886,756 was net; and the book valuation of the total investment in its busi-POWER AND GAS UTILITIES 19 ness at the end of 1929 was $183,146,684, of which $163,550,214 was reflected in the book valuation of its investments. Standard Gas & Electric Co. controlled other subholding and operating companies with properties in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, and Mexico. All together, the company's utility subsidiaries owned properties and operated in 20 States and in Mexico. The aggregate gross operating revenues of the operating companies, inclusive of oil and refining companies, amounted to $172,-702,748 in 1929. The aggregate funded debt of the holding company and its subsidiaries that was held by the public at the end of 1929 was $472,259,272; and there were outstanding preferred stocks with a ledger valuation of $292,718,660 and common stocks with a ledger valuation of $131,498,543. The consolidated surplus was $50,584,837 . The fixed assets of these companies at the end of 1929 had a ledger valuation, after deduction of retirement reserves, of $890,759,23 4. Other assets brought the total up practically to $1,000,000,000. The hearings on this group have been almost completed. A report on one more important company in the group is being prepared for presentation. NORTH AMERICAN LIGHT & POWER Co. As of December 31, 1930, the North American Light & Power Co. was controlled by three voting trustees; namely, Frank L. Dame, president of the North American Co., Samuel Insull, chairman of the board of Middle West Utilities Co., and Clement Studebaker, jr., president of North American Light & Power Co. Approximately 90 per cent of the common or voting stock is pledged under the voting trust agreement. Middle West Utilities Co. and the North American Co. each owned or controlled approximately 46 per cent of the stock in the voting trust and Clement Studebaker, jr., owned or controlled the remaining 8 per cent. Subsidiaries of North American Light & Power Co. operate in Illinois, Iowa , Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. On December 31, 1930, the fixed capital of wholly owned subsidiaries had a ledger value of $291,039,377, and the company's investments in the securities of companies in which it owned a minority interest amounted to $17,563,119, or a total fixed capital and investments of $308,602,496 for the system. The aggregate gross earnings from operations of the group were $47,157,845 in 1930. North American Light & Power Co. and subsidiaries had outstanding at the end of 1930, $170,210,400 of funded debt, $82,641,940 stated20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION value of preferred stock, and $39,527,350 stated value of common stock. The work on this group has been comparatively restricted. A report on one important operating and on one subholding company in the group remains to be introduced in the hearings. ELECTRIC BOND & SHARE Co. GROUP During the fiscal year hearings were held on Nebraska Power Co., a subsidiary of American Power & Light Co., and the following subsidiaries of Electric Power & Light Corporation: Arkansas Power & Light Co., Louisiana Power & Light Co., Mississippi Power & Light Co., Utah Power & Light Co. and its subsidiary, Western Colorado Power Co. American Power & Light Co. and Electric Power & Light Corporation belong to the Electr ic Bond & Share Co. group. These companies, and their subsidiaries, operate in Nebraska, Iowa, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Idaho, Utah,. Wyoming, and Colorado. The aggregate gross revenues of these six operating companies for 1930, were $38,011,441. As of December 31, 1930, their bonded in debtedness was $128,007,500 and they had $65,853,599 of preferred and $58,500,000 of common stock outstanding. The ledger value of the total fixed Capital of these six operating companies, at the end of 1930, was $241,858,967. Completion of the investigation of this group was still being held up at the close of the fiscal year, particularly as to exact costs and profits of its managerial, servicing , and supervisory contracts, 3 pending a decision of the commission's suit in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York to compel production and inspection of operating expense ledgers and accounts. This decision was handed down August 19, 1932. Further details may be read on page 95. INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRIC ENERGY AND GAS At each hearing on a holding company group reports are presented showing in detail the quantities of electric energy and gas, which are produced, sold, and transmitted across States lines by operating companies controlled by the group. Such information for both industries, so far as controlled by holding companies, has been collected for the calendar year 1930. The data are also in process of tabulation for more general use and this tabulation for 1930 was nearly completed during the year, although delayed by the late receipt of 3 The necessary relationship between cost of rendering such services and the fees collected therefor was recently pointed out by the United States Supreme Court In Smith v. Illinois (282 U. 5.138).CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 21 certain returns. Returns for all groups had been received prior to July 1, except for one gas group of moderate size, which was promised soon. It is believed that a collection and compilation of data for 1932, similar to that for 1930, will be desirable for the purposes of the public-utility inquiry. It is not intended to cover the year 1931. By utilizing the 1929 returns obtained on a broader basis under the Senate resolution calling for inquiry into interstate movement of electric energy, it is possible that trends as regards the proportionate volume of interstate movement will be definitely indicated. The gas data will not afford such a good foundation for a conclusion of this nature, although it may be expected to cover practically all the interstate movement of gas. The compilation of the data for 1932, when compared with 1929 data, will doubtless tend greatly to in-crease the correctness and adequacy of the information, for whatever use. REMAINING WORK OF THE INVESTIGATION It is planned that the field work of the entire investigation shall be completed during the fiscal year 1932--33. The ground covered by the entire inquiry into the financia l and economic problems of the industry will comprise most of the large holding company groups and a few of the smaller ones. Most of the principal holding, management, and servicing compani es in each of these groups will also be covered together with sampling of the operating companies. The total of the material collected will, it is believed, represent a good cross-section sample of the conditions among such companies in the electric utility field, which, in the aggregate, represented in 1929 more than 45 per cent of the total output for the United States, and more than 80 per cent of the electric energy sold by privately owned electric utilities doing an interstate or international business . The gas utility field is much less fully covered, but it is becoming a subje ct of increasing interest on account of the recent development in natural gas production and the great extensions of interstate pipe lines for gas CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY SIX ADDITIONAL REPORTS ARE SENT TO CONGRESS Work on the chain-store inquiry 4 during the fiscal year comprised the writing of six reports on different phases of chain-store operation and the preparation of field and schedule data for several other reports on the economic and legal aspects of the inquiry now in the 4 The investigation was undertaken pursuant to S. Res. 224, 70th Cong., 1st sess.1 and to see. 6, Federal Trade Commission act.22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION course of preparation. At the close of the preceding fiscal year, a comprehensive report on cooperative grocery chains was sent to Congress. During the last year the following additional reports were completed: Scope of chain-store inquiry. Sources of chain-store merchandise. Wholesale business of retail chains. Chain-store leaders and loss leaders. Cooperative drug and hardware chains. Growth and development of chain stores. The principal features of these reports are described herein. Reports in draft form as of June 30, 1932, embrace such important subjects as private brands 5 of chain stores, wages of chain-store employees, chain-store advertising, chain-store manufacturing, service features, pricing policies of chain stores, costs, profits, and margins of chain stores, comparative prices, margins of chain and independent stores, and manufacturers' discounts and allowances to chain stores. The basic tabulations of financial data in the chain -store schedules had been completed and the writing of reports on margins, profits, expenses, and rate of return on investment was under way at the end of the fiscal year. The reports on these important phases of chain-store business cover a substantial majority of chain-store operations as measured both by number of stores operated and by volume of sales. As with reports already released , this financial information covers chain stores in 26 different kinds of business. PRICE AND MARGIN STUDY NEARS COMPLETION By the end of the fiscal year the compilation of data for the analysis of comparative costs and prices of commodities handled by chains and independent dealers in five cities Was nearing completion. Approximately 1,200,000 retail price quotations obtained from about 6,000 grocery and drug stores in the five cities were carded and tabulation of these data on Hollerith machines was begun in October, 1931. More than 400 grocery items and approximately 450 drug items were included in this comparison of chain and independent selling prices. In addition to the retail prices of these commodities, the purchase prices to chains, wholesalers, and cooperative wholesalers were obtained in the five cities. Tabulation of these data was practically completed during the year for grocery items and was in progress at the end of the year for the drug items. 5 The report on \"Chain Store Private Brands\" was made public i summary form, Sept. 26, 1932.CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 23 Schedules covering discounts and allowances made by manufacturers to chain stores, wholesalers , cooperative chains, and individual retailers were sent out to 866 grocery manufacturers, 911 drug manufacturers, and 299 tobacco manufacturers. Schedules asking for discounts received from manufacturers were sent to 181 important chain- store organizations. The information derived from these schedules will permit making a comparison of manufacturers' selling prices to the three types of distributors mentioned. Taken in conjunction with the retail price data in the five cities, these figures will show margins between the manufacturer's selling prices and the consum er's buying prices through chain stores on a large number of the specific commodities in comparison with similar margins on the same commodities handled through independent dealers. In general, the response of manufacturers and chain stores to these schedules on discounts and allowances has been satisfactory. LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE INVESTIGATION That part of the chain-store investigation, involving legal questions, was assigned March 6, 1931, to the commission's chief examiner, and has been carried on throughout the fiscal year, 1931-32. At the beginning of the year a form letter was sent to some 134 of the larger chain- store Companies, in the various commodity groups, seeking information as a foundation for answering that part of the Senate resolution which inquires as to the extent to which consolidations of chain stores have been effected in violation of the antitrust laws. Replies were received from all except five of the chains, and of those replying 116 furnished answers to the questions propounded. These answers have been tabulated and compiled as the foundation for a report. The decisions of the commission and courts have been reviewed and jurisdictional questions have been studied. Special consid eration has been given to questions of interstate commerce, acquisitions of capital stock by one corporation of a competing corporation, monopoly, tendency to monopoly, restraint of trade, and unfair trade practices, all as applied to chain-store activities and based on the facts developed in this investigation by the commission. State laws have been studied to ascer tain the extent to which regulatory provision is made within the States analogous to that provided nationally by the Federal antitrust laws. This study has covere d regulation of trusts and monopolies and the correction of unfair trade practices, and, in addition, that special legislation aimed solely at the taxation and regulation of chain stores. 6 The senate resolution directing the chain store inquiry appears on p.256.24 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION The data obtained by the commission's economic divis ion on manufacturers' discounts and allowances were reviewed, and where necessary this information was supplemented by field work to obtain the facts particularly applicab le to the legal question involved in that part of the resolution relating to quantity prices. Four men have been in the field interviewing close to 200 manufacturers, and it is expected they will complete their work soon. REPORTS TO CONGRESS ARE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED Brief descriptions of the salient features of the reports issued during the fiscal year are given below. l. SCOPE OF THE CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY The report on the scope of the chain-store inquiry serves as a general introduction to the series of reports, defines the terms employed, and outlines the field covered by the inquiry. The letter of submittal defines the term \" chain\" or \"chain store\" as applying to-- Organizations owning a controlling interest in two or more establishments which sell substantially similar merchandise at retail. This definition has been made without reference to the extent of centralization in management, size of the chain, location of units, or particular management policies. Outlining the fields covered , the letter continues-- Because of the apparent intention of the inquiry, certain of the more highly specialized kinds of chains * * * were excluded from the analysis, and the study was confined to 12 major classes of chains which, with their subgroups, constitute a total of 20 types of organizations, as follows: Grocery; and shoes; and apparel; department store; general merchandise; furniture; musical instruments; and hardware. The 1,727 chains returning original schedules for tabulation operated 66,246 stores on December 31, 1928, and reported total 1928 net retail sales of more than five billion dollars. For 1,278 chains reporting on the supplementary schedule the number of stores operated on December 31, 1930, was 68,161, and the 1930 net sales were just short of five and a half billions. Practically one-half of the stores and more than one-third of the total reported sales of chains sending returns to the commission were submitted by chains engaged in the grocery-and-meat business , although less than 11 per cent of the total number of chains reporting belonged to this group. More than half the chains reporting are found in the 2-to-5 store group. These small chains, however, operate less than 5 per cent of theCHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 25 stores. In contrast, chains with 1,000 stores or more comprise less than 1 per cent of the chains, and account for approximately one-half the stores and about 40 per cent of the total sales. The classification by census geographic divisions shows the most extensive chain development in the Middle Atlantic and East North Central sections, while the East South Central and the Mountain sections show the least development. The commission's study represents approximately one-half of the number of stores operated and one-half of the aggregate sales volume of all organizations engaged in chain-store merchandising in 1929 in the 26 kinds of business covered by this inquiry, including chains of two and three stores, which are not classed by the census as chain stores. 2. SOURCES OF CHAIN-STORE MERCHANDISE The report on sources of chain-store merchandise shows the ex-tent to which chains in the several kinds of business buy their merchandise from original sources or through middlemen; that is, from manufacturers, growers, and growers' organizations, or through brokers, commission men, whole salers, and jobbers. It is shown that 92 per cent of all reporting chains patronize manufacturers and obtain 75.5 per cent of their purchases from that source. Wholesalers supply 7.9 per cent of the goods purchased by chains, brokers, and commission men supply 7.3 per cent, and growers and their organizations 7 per cent. Buying from wholesalers is quite generally practice d by chains, the report shows. While less than 8 per cent of their total merchandise is so purchased, 77 per cent of the reporti ng chains patronize that source. Smaller chains rely to a larger extent upon wholesalers than do the large chains, but the proportions of total number of chains buying some merchandise from this source is substantial even among the larger chains. All of the reporting drug, dry goods, general-merchandise and unlimited-price variety chains buy from wholesalers, and in seven other kinds of business more than 90 per cent of the chains do so. Grocery chains buy 12.4 per cent of their purchases from wholesalers, and the grocery and meat chains (excluding the two largest companies in that field) purchase 17.3 per cent from that source. Hardware chains report upwards of 40 per cent of their purchases coming from wholesalers. In general, the report shows, the wearing-apparel chains buy the largest proportion from manufacturers' while the grocery groups buy smaller proportions from direct sources and a relatively large proportion from brokers and commission men (14.2 per cent). 126056---32-----326 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Larger chains buy larger proportions of their merchandise from direct sources-- manufacturers and growers-than do the smaller chains. Grocery and meat chains, for example, purchase 32.7 per cent from these two sources in the group operating from 2 to 5 Stores, while the chains of more than 1,000 stores buy almost 85 per cent from these direct sources. Between 1922 and 1928 the direct buying of chains reporting for both years showed a moderate increase. Purchas e from manufacturers by all reporting chains increased from 76.5 per cent of the total in 1922 to 81.2 per cent in 1928. The proportion purchased from wholesalers dropped during this period from 13 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Specific purchasing practices of a few chains furnishing detailed information are discussed in the report. Sufficiency of supply of perishable products appears to be the most important factor in the buying practice of grocery and grocery and meat chains. Their relatively large patronage of brokers and commission men is explained on that basis. Variety chains and some department-store chains, on the other hand, place emphasis upon the development of new products, and for this reason these chains appear to be actively directing and supervising the manufacturing processes although they do little manufacturing under their own names. 3. WHOLESALE BUSINESS OF RETAIL CHAINS The wholesale business of retail chains is important, because a number of retail chains which sell also at wholesale do not separate their wholesale and retail sales and the only gross-profit figures obtainable by the commission from these concerns are for the business. as a whole. The larger the wholesale part of the business the more misleading is the total gross-profit rate as an index of the gross profit or margin of the retail function performed by chain stores. The wholesale business is limited to an analysis of bona fide whole-sale sales made to outside concerns, excluding accommodation sales and all transactions concerned solely with the supplying of merchandise to the chains' own retail units. Two hundred of the 1,655 chains answering the specific inquiry report doing wholesale as well as retail business. They operated 29,208 retail stores and reported combined retail sales of $1,835,484,202 in 1928. The chains engaged in wholesaling operate about six times as many stores per chain as those which report no wholesale business. The ratio of wholesale to total sales is shown to be 5.1 per cent for 113 chains reporting a breakdown of their 1928 sales between whole-CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 27 sale and retail business. These chains had total sales of $1,686,-0 05,590 in 1928, of which amount $86,087,693 was wholesale business. If the reports of the largest two grocery-and-meat chains included in the tabulations are excluded, then the ratio for the remaining 111 companies is much greater, or well over 12 per cent. Referring to the 26 kinds of business in which chains are engaged, the report shows that wholesaling is most extensive among musical-instrument, grocery-and-meat, hardware, and confectionery chains,. in each of which groups the proportion of the chains engaged in wholesaling exceeds 20 per cent. The ratio of wholesale to total sales is reported as above 45 per cent in women's ready-to-wear and dollar-limit variety chains, and as between 30 and 45 per cent in four of the wearing-apparel lines-men's and women's ready-to-wear, millinery, women's shoe, and men's and women's shoe chains. Almost half the total wholesale business reported by all companies is accounted for by the grocery-and-meat chains. If to this group the grocery, confectionery, and meat chains are added, then these four groups comprise more than one-half the number of retail chains reporting wholesaling, operate more than 95 per cent of total stores reported, and account for almost 70 per cent of the reported wholesale sales. On the question of wholesaling by chains of different sizes , the report states that four retail chains operating more than 1,000 stores each sell at wholesale 1.5 per cent of their total sales. They report; wholesale business of approximately $20,000,000 in 1928, representing almost 23 per cent of aggregate wholesale sales of chains of all sizes. The highest ratio of wholesale business to total business is reported by 25 chains operating from 6 to 10 stores, 37.4 per cent of their sales being at wholesale. It is not shown, however, that smaller chains generally wholesale greater proportions of their total sales than do the larger chains. In its analysis of chains by geographic divisions, the report shows the highest ratios of wholesale sales to total sales in the divisional chains of the West North Central, Mountain, and South Atlantic divisions, ranging from about 25 per cent upward. However, more than half of the divisional chains that sell at wholesale are situated in the three northeast divisions of the country, namely, New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central. The principal commodities commonly wholesaled by chains represent merchandise of the same general kind as that forming the bulk of the goods retailed by them. In the important food groups of chains, these commodities are sugar, flour, canne d goods, lard, and28 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION meats. The report analyzes the frequency with which leading classes of commodities are wholesaled by various kinds of chains. Nearly one-fourth of all items retailed by 49 reporting chains are, on the average, also wholesaled by them. More than 86 per cent of 171 reporting chains indicate that their wholesaling is conducted by the same company as that operating the retail stores. In this connection the report indicates that only a small and apparently diminishing proportion of retail chains is owned by wholesale houses. In most cases the chain-stor e executives , whose statements are discussed in the report, profess that their companies resort to wholesaling merely as an adjunct to their primary retailing operations; but in some other cases, referred to in the report, they state that it is their policy definitely to develop the wholesale side of the business. 4. LEADERS AND LOSS LEADERS The report on chain-store leaders and loss leaders summarizes data collected by the commission on merchandise sold below net purchase cost and below total cost. In a broad sense, leaders may be defined as merchandise featured or sold at reduced prices to attract buyers and thereby stimulate sales not only of these leaders but also of other goods. There are apparently four principal purposes for which leaders are used, all of which are briefly stated in the following explanation made by the president of a grocery-and- meat chain which operate several hundred stores: The extent to which prices are cut depends on compet ition, the necessity of introducing a commodity, the need for moving a line of goods, and the desire to bring customers into the store. In 1922, 69 of 777 chains, or 8.9 per cent of all the organizations reporting on this matter, at some time sold leaders at less than net purchase cost. By 1928, 11.9 per cent, or 174 out of a total of 1,458, so reported. The importance of these chains that sold leaders below cost is indicated by the fact that in 1928 the total net retail sales of $1,147,-673,000 reported by the 174 chains that sometimes sold leaders , other than private brands, at less than net purchase cost amounted to 31 per cent of the total net sales of all chains reporting. The average net sales per chain in 1928 for those that sold these leaders below net purchase cost amounted to $6,596,000, while for those chains that reported they did not sell leaders below net purchase cost the average net sales were $1,991,000. These are the total sales, of course, of the chains which used this practice and not the leader sales.CHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 29 The extent of such loss-leader sales is indicated by the following statement in the report: Out of a total of 827 chains reporting on the sale of standard-brand articles below total cost (Including operating costs) during the last week of December, 1928, 97 chains, or 11.7 per cent of the total reporting, stated that they did sell such leaders during that week. These 97 chains operated 12.949 stores in the last week of December, 1928, or more than one-third of the number operated by all chains reporting on the question. Although the proportion of these chains selling below total cost (11.7 per cent) is about the same as the proportion of the 1,458 chains (11.9 per cent) reporting that they sold leaders at less than net purchase cost in 1928, the proportion of total stores operated by the former (36A per cent) is more than twice that of those operated by the latter (16.8 per cent). About 99 per cent of the stores belonging to the 97 chains that reported such sales were operated by only three groups of chains. The only kinds of chains for which any considerable number of companies reported sales below total cost were grocery. grocery-and-meat, and drug chains. A limited amount of information is available of specific articles, indicating the amount of loss. For example, on 254 items in 25 commodity groups sold below total cost (including operating expenses) by 36 grocery and grocery-and-meat chains operating 11,369 stores during the last week of December, 1928, the average loss was 9.9 per cent and ranged from 3.3 per cent on toilet paper to 14.6 per cent on cigarettes. For drug products the losses range up to 26.2 per cent, and are taken on such commodities as cigars, soaps, ointments, tooth pastes, razor blades, shaving creams , toilet creams, hair tonics, emulsions, and lotions. 5. COOPERATIVE DRUG CHAINS The report on cooperative drug chains gives information on a total of 24 cooperative drug chains with a retail membership of 6,041 independent drug stores at the close of 1929. All but one of these chains are of the \" retailer\" type, their business being owned by the retail members. The commission estimates that there were 30 cooperative drug chains in the country (exclusive of the \"mutuals\") with a total estimated membership of 7,550 retail druggists at the end of 1929, which comprised 13.1 per cent of the total number of retail drug stores in the United States. These cooperatives had more than twice as many retail stores as had centrally owned chain organizations of four stores or more in the same year. The total wholesale sales in 1929 of 16 reporting cooperative drug companies amounted to $24,553,000, practically all of which represented sales to members. Cooperative drug chains have done little more to meet competitio n of centrally owned chains than to arrange for group buying and30 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION warehousing of their merchandi se. Policies and methods used by centrally owned chains, relating to uniform store features, managerial services, supervisors, and other things are not common in cooperative drug chains. The present coopera tive drug organizations originally required members to buy a minimum amount of stock in the cooperative and generally placed a maximum limit to such purchases. In many of these companies there is now no more stock to be sold, and the policy is generally to require the retail member to make a deposit of from $100 to $500 or more, as security against his purchases. Based on the average amounts of all required expenditures, as reported by the retailer type of cooperative drug chains, the average cost to a member of belonging to such a drug chain is about $54 a year. Unlike most cooperative grocery chains, the cooperative drug organizations make very little use of leaders. Group advertising is likewise little used by this type of cooperative. Private brands, generally consisting of standard articles of merchandise put up in package form, are used by about half the cooperative drug chains. The average number of private brand items carried by eight of these companies is 55. The report does not discuss the financial results of the individual retail members of the drug cooperatives, but the operating expenses, investment, rates of return, and profits of the retailer-owned cooperative organizations are shown in detail. On this subject the report states: The average gross profits of the reporting drug cooperatives were 9.5 per cent, 10 per cent, and 9.7 per cent for the three years for which data were submitted. Average operating expenses as reported amounted to 7.2 per cent for 1925 and 7.9 per cent for both 1928 and 1929. Salaries and wages make up over 60 per cent of the total of these expenses. Delivery expense of Co- operatives, amounting to about 8 per cent of total operating expenses, is the next largest expense item. Net profits for the reporting companies show a de cline for the three years studied, being 2.3 per cent on sales in 1925, 2.1 per cent in 1928, and 1.8 per cent in 1929. This downward tendency of net profit on sales is in contrast to that of the retailer grocery cooperatives which shows an upward trend. The total investment of 16 drug cooperatives in 1929 was $4,549,000, or an average of $284,000 per company. The average rate of return on this average total investment was 11.2 per cent in 1929, which was a somewhat smaller return than is shown for the two earlier years. The results shown by this report lead to certain definite conclusions. The drug cooperatives have centered their activities primarily on the distribution of merchandise to members at a low cost. Little attention has been given to special services for retail members or to developing an advertising program for them. Drug cooperatives are getting goods into the hands of their members on a gross margin of about 10 per cent on sales. The most important problems confronting the drug cooperative appear to be the lack of cooperation by drug manufacturers on the one hand and byCHAIN-STORE INQUIRY 31 retail members on the other. No comparison between operating costs of regular service drug wholesalers and cooperative drug chains is possible at this time, but will be presented at a later date. 7. COOPERATIVE HARDWARE CHAINS The report on cooperative hardware chains gives some information concerning the few cooperatives found in the hardware trade. Two paragraphs from the letter of submittal which accompanies the report contain the following statements concerning these organizations. Few cooperative chains are found in the hardware trade to aid the independent hardware dealer in meeting competition of regular chain stores, department stores, and mail-order houses. From the standpoint of age and number of groups organized the movement in the hardware field is still young as compared with the grocery and drug trades. This report includes such limited information and data as were procured from six retailer cooperative hardware chains having a membership of 990 retail stores. The total net sales for five of the cooperative hardware companies (excluding one small buying and advertising group that does not operate a warehouse) amounted to somewhat over $6,000,000 in 1929. The hardware cooperatives are, in general, organized in much the same way as the drug cooperatives, and like the latter usually perform few functions or services for the retail members other than buying and distributing merchandise to their members at reduced cost. 8. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHAIN STORES The report on growth and development of chain stores presents an analysis of store openings, store acquisitions, store closings, and net store additions based on a more or less complete record of 1,591 chains operating 61,766 stores on December 31, 1928. Returns made by these chains cover a period of from 1 to 43 years, depending upon the length of time for which a continuous yearly record of openings, acquisitions, and closing was available through 1928. Information for 1,687 and 1,478 chains, most of them included in the above-mentioned group, is also available for the years 1929 and 1930, respectively. These 1,591 chains reported a total of 58,040 gross total additions through 1928, of which slightly more than 11 per cent were acquired from others and the remaining 89 per cent represent actual openings of new units. Adding the Openings and acquisitions for 1929 and 1930, the gross total additions increase to 73,440 stores and the ratio of acquisitions rises to 15 per cent. It is estimated that, of the total acquisitions of reporting chains, only 12 per cent were acquired from independents, thus accounting for less than 2 per cent of the total growth of chains through 1928.32 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Based upon the number of stores in operation at the beginning-of each year, acquisitions have been made at the rate of 1.8 per cent per annum for the 1,591 chains for 1928 and one or more consecutively prior years as compared with 14.5 per cent for stores opened. If the figures for chains reporting in 1929 and 1930 are included, the corresponding ratios are 2.3 per cent for acquisitions and 12.7 per cent for openings from 1925 to 1929. The proportions of acquisitions to gross total stores added rose sharply from 3.3 per cent in the former year to 38.4 per cent in the latter, only to fall abruptly to 11.1 per cent in 1930. Substantial differences in the importance of acquisitions and openings to the growth of chain stores are found among the 26 kinds of business. Only three groups-grocery and meat, straight grocery, and drug-are numerically important in acquisitions. The bulk of the reported acquisitions in each of these kinds of business are those of one or, at most, a few of the larger chain-store organizations. The total number of closings through 1928 reported by these 1,591 chain-store systems was 11,506, which is 20 per cent of the 58,040 stores reported added by these chains during the period through 1928 either through acquisitions or openings, or 3.2 per cent per annum. Slightly more than half of the total closings reported were in two years, 1927 and 1928. Including 1929 and 1930, the chains have closed the equivalent of slightly less than 28 per cent of the gross total stores added and have shown an annual closing rate of 4.2 per cent per annum. The 1,591 chains reported a net addition figure of 46,534 for the period through 1928. This is an annual average increase of slightly in excess of 13 per cent. Combining the figures for the chains reporting through 1928 with those reporting for 1929 and 1930 the average rate of net annual increase becomes slightly less than 11 per cent per annum. Beginning in 1922, and with the exception of 1925,. the ratios of net additions to gross total stores added show a regular decrease from 88.6 per cent in 1922 to 14.7 per cent in 1930. A comparison for the 10 years, 1919-1928, of the openings and closings of chain- store units, as reported to the commission, with the corresponding figures of Buffalo, N. Y., independent merchants in the grocery, drug, hardware, and shoe fields (published by the University of Buffalo, Bureau of Social and Business Research) indicates that the opening rate of independent stores is substantially higher than that for the stores of chains. On the other hand, the independent closing rate is almost as high as their rate of openings, whereas the chain rate of closings is roughly one-fourth that of their openings. Using the data reported in the commission's schedules and such miscellaneous information as could be obtained from publishedCOTTONSEED INDUSTRY 33 sources, the commission has constructed, for the 26 kinds of business studied, estimates of the probable number of chains and stores in operation in the United States based on census of distribution figures of chain stores in operation in 1929. According to these constructed figures, there were probably in operation in 1900 in the 26 kinds of business studied by the commission some 700 chains, including 2 and 3 store organizations, and the total number of stores they operated was probably about 4,500. In 1910 it is estimated that in these lines of business there were 3,000 chains with 13,500 stores in operation; in 1920, 9,400 chains with 49,200 stores; and in 1928, 20,000 chains with 119,600 stores. COTTONSEED INDUSTRY PUBLIC HEARINGS IN VARIOUS STATES ARE CONCLUDED The inquiry was conducted pursuant to two Senate resolutions adopted during the Seventy-first Congress, first session, 7 and to section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission act. Resolution 136 requested the Federal Trade Commission to investigate activities of the cottonseed-oil millers in an alleged comb ination to fix prices in the purchase of cottonseed and in the sale of cottonseed meal, all in alleged violation of the antitrust laws. Resolution 147 directed the commission to investigate allegations that cottonseed-oil millers were acquiring the ownership and control of cotton gins for the purpose of destroying the competitive market for cottonseed and depressing cottonseed prices. The resolution specified public hearings. The Senate, June 30, 1930, approved Resolution 292 directing the commission to transmit to the Senate or file with the Secretary of the Senate a transcript of the testimony taken at the public hearings. The investigation was inaugurated in December, 1929, and as preliminary to the holding of public hearings, representatives of the commission interviewed crushers of cottonseed and officials of their trade associations. Wherever possible extensive examination was made of files of correspondence between crushers, associati on officials, and buyers of cottonseed. Ginners, officials of ginners' associations, farmers, cottonseed brokers, cottonseed products brokers, officers of commercial exchanges, State and Government officials, and others believed to have information regarding the sale of cottonseed were also interviewed. Public hearings began in Washington, June 2, 1930, and ended February 10, 1932. Testimony was taken in Atlanta; Montgomery, Ala.; Raleigh, N. C.; Columbia, S. C.; Jackson, Miss.; New Orleans, 7 Complete text of these resolutions will be found on page 257.34 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Shreveport, La.; Houston; Dallas; Oklahoma City; Little Rock; and Memphis. In pursuance of Senate Resolution 292, seven volumes (eight parts) of testimony and exhibits have been printed as parts of Senate Document 209. Four more volumes have gone to press. The voluminous record of testimony and exhibits is being studied, analyzed, and digested. PRICES AND COMPETITION AMONG PEANUT MILLS EVIDENCE SHOWS NO SECTION-WIDE OR STATE-WIDE PRICE FIXING This inquiry was made in response to a Senate resolution 8 requesting the commission to make an investigation of all the facts relating to an alleged combination of peanut crushers and mills acting in violation of the antitrust laws with respect to prices paid to farmers for peanuts by such crushers and mills. The report on the inquiry has been completed, submitted to the Senate, and ordered by that body to be printed. In its investigation the comm ission covered the entire territory wherein peanuts constitute an important commercial crop in 12 of the Southern States, such territory extending in a broad belt from southeastern Virginia along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts into Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The aggregate crop at times exceed s a billion pounds in weight and its value sometimes reaches into the millions of dollars. Each of the three associations of shellers and practically all the Shelling plants in the industry were visited by representatives of the commiss ion, who examined their records and obtained data therefrom. The inquiry shows that the price of peanuts began to decline at about the same time as that of many other commodities. An index-number comparison of the prices of peanuts over a period of 18 years with those of cotton and cottonseed, which grow in the same producing belt, shows that the trend of the prices of all these commodities was, in general, the same. Various causes for the peanut-price situation, aside from that of a combination in restraint of trade, were alleged by informants in active work in the industry, some of which were found in the course of the inquir y to be contributory to the price depression, although it was impossible to measure the extent of their influence in such a market as has existed since 1929. Some of these price factors are noted herein. In 1928, in anticipation of an increased tariff on foreign peanuts, unusual quantities were imported, and the same year saw the begin- 8 See page 258 for full text of resolution.PRICES AND COMPETITION AMONG PEANUT MILLS 35 ing of an unprecedented accumulation of stocks of shelled goods in cold storage which extended into the middle of 1929. Following upon this high tide of imports and stocks in cold storage came an unusually large crop of peanuts in the fall of 1929, the greatest harvest between the seasons 1918-19 and 1930-31, generally conceded to be an overproduction; and to this was added damage to the bumper crop by storm and other weather conditions in many sections in that year, injuring the grade so that goods which were expected to be shelled for the market had to be crushed for oil. These were factors, any one of which, if manifested to a consider able degree, could produce a serious depression in prices, a fortiori any two of them operating simultaneously. No widespread organization of peanut shellers was found to have been engaged in a combination to depress the price to the farmer. The conclusion of the commission in respect to these various causes is as follows: The steady, industry-wide decline in price of farmers' stock peanuts since 1928 has followed the same general course of practically all other farm products and all other commodities during the period of extraordinary depression through which this country is passing. Such widespread decline is not found to be due to a combination of peanut crushers and mills acting for the purpose of fixing such prices or of arbitrarily forcing them down. No evidence has been developed showing the existence of a section-wide or even a State-wide organization which has attempted to fix the price of farmers' stock peanuts, although the activities of certain groups of mills have undoubtedly been factors which contributed to the depression of the prices. The inquiry did, in fact, develop the information that the above-mentioned economic factors were not the only ones which Were influencing the peanut market; that in certain sections small groups of shelling companies had by their price activities so manipulated the situation as undoubtedly to contribute to the depression of prices paid to farmers in their respective localities. Instances of price discussions and exchanges of present and prospective prices, agreements as to the price to be paid and division of territory were found to exist in certain localities. Relative to the activities of these groups of shellers, the commission reaches this further conclusion: Those peanut mills which this inquiry shows to have participated in such practices as discussions and exchanges of present and prospective prices, price agreements, and division of territory have in so doing laid a restraint upon competition, the natural effect of which is to impede advancing and accelerate declining prices. Such practices , however, were found to originate in groups of companies within definite, circumscribed territories, the activities of such groups not being related the one to the other, not extending across State lines and not laying a burden upon commerce between the States. The commission, therefore, reached the conclusion that the36 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION methods employed by the participants did not bring them within Federal jurisdiction and that relief from the restraint which they placed upon competition is to be found within the States in which such practices are exercised. PRICE BASES FIRST REPORT IS SENT TO CONGRESS On March 26, 1932, the report on the Basing-point Formula and Cement Prices was transmitted to Congress. This report is the first to be issued under an inquiry instituted by a resolution of the commission which declared the \"economical distribution of commodities\" to be \"one of the chief problems of the day\" and directed that an inquiry be made into the methods of basing prices with respect to location. These methods include the selling on the bases of (1) shipping-point prices; (2) uniform delivered prices, either country wide or by zones; and (3) delivered prices made under what is known as a basing-point system. The object of the inquiry was to ascertain the causes for the adoption of these various methods, and their relation, if any, to the matter of competition, differences in prices, price levels, and cross freighting or other needless costs. While the present report deals chiefly with the multiple basing-point system as employed by the cement industry, it also includes a country-wide survey of the price- basing methods used by manufacturers generally together with a broad discussion of these several methods. Out of more than 3,500 firms reporting to the commission, it was found that 44 per cent sell on an exclusively shipping-po int price basis, 18 per cent on an exclusively delivered price basis, and 38 per cent on both bases. DIVERGENCE OF MILL NET PRICES IS SHOWN The delivered price for any destination is, under the multiple basing-point formula, that sum of price at some basing point and freight therefrom, whichever is lowest, all basing points considered. The mill net price for a given shipment is the delivered price less the actual freight from mill to destination and may be, and often is, less than that mill's price at the mill. The letter of submittal accompanying the report says: The most significant aspect of the basing-point system is found in the diver-gent mill net prices which usually prevail under that system and obtain in a marked degree in the cement Industry. Widely different mill net prices realized for any one mill at any one time upon substantial portions of the mill's sales are indicat ive of very imperfect price competition, because competition in price implies the frequent shading of a competitor's price, when costs permit,PRICE BASES 37 as an inducement of the seller to divert buyers from that competitor's product to his own. And the seller's costs presumably do permit it, if he is making to one group of buyers lower mill net prices than to some group or groups of buyers elsewhere in order to secure additional volume. Under active price. competition the higher net prices tend to be shaded and sales to the lowest net price group discontinued, if necessary, until net prices generally are substantially equal. Other tests which the report applies to basing-point prices in the cement industry to determine their competitive character, are price uniformity and price constancy. PRICE LEADERSHIP A FACTOR IN COMPETITION Price leadership is found to be a contributing factor to imperfect price competition. The letter says: All cement mills, as regards price making, fall into two classes--those that assume price leadership and those that do not. A mill that establishes a price at its mill point and delivered prices for other points lower than the base price of any other mill together with freight therefrom to those points, respectively, makes of itself a basing point and assumes price leadership at all such points. Outside such points it follows the leadership of other basing mills as regards prices. The nonbasing mill assumes no price leadership but adopts the delivered prices of others as it finds them. This may also be true of a mill located at a basing point where there are two or more mills. Many mills are so located. Such a price policy has directly only a negative effect upon the level of prices and in that sense denotes an absence of price competition on the part of these mills. About one-half the total number of cement mills operating in 1930 were nonbasing mills. PRICE DIFFERENCES IN THE CEMENT INDUSTRY Differences of mill net prices in the cement industry were found to affect buyers, and in some instances competitors, unequally. It is pointed out that-- Perhaps the most objectionable of all cases of price differentiation found in connection with the cement industry's use of the basing-point system is that resulting from one mill, or group of mills, setting the mill price of another mill, freightwise differently located, above which it may not go--objectionable not only because the aggressor mill makes a lower mill net price to one group of buyers than to another which it itself initiates, but because the setting of a relatively low mill price for another mill reduces its own average net realization much less than that of the mill whose mill price is thus set. Such price differences were found both where the mill against which these tactics were being employed was a State-owned mill and where the mill was one showing marked independence in its price policy by frequent failure to observe strictly the formula system. In response to a recent request of the commission costs were submitted to it by the cement industry, though not in time to be fully38 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION analyzed as to their bearing on the matter of the report and to be incorporated therein. They are now being compiled and studied for issue as a supplemental report should this seem to be justified by the results of the study. Price data from manufacturers invoices and other material relating to range boilers and industrial alcohol and illustrating other methods of basing prices are now being collected and compiled. CEMENT INDUSTRY REPORT TO SENATE IS BEING PREPARED This inquiry was begun in March, 1931, pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Senate, February 16, 1931 (S. Res. 448, 71st Cong., 3d sess.). The resolution directed the commission to investigate competitive conditions in the cement industry and report to the Senate concerning the following: The facts with respect to the sale of cement, whether of foreign or domestic manufacture, and especially the price activities of trade associations composed of either manufacturers or dealers in cement, or both. The facts with respect to the distribution of cement, including a survey of the practices of manufacturers or dealers used in connection with the distribution of cement. Whether the activities in the cement industry on the part of trade associations, manufacturers of cement, or dealers in cement constitute a violation of the antitrust laws of the United States and whether such activities constitute unfair trade practices. The work of gatheri ng the information, both by correspondence through questionnaire letters to cement manufacturers and dealers, and by field work, during which examinations were made of the files and records of trade associations, cement manufacturers, cement dealers, and State highway commissions, has been completed. The evidence collected is being classified and analyzed and a report is being prepared in response to the resolution. BUILDING MATERIALS LETTING OF GOVERNMENT BUILDING CONTRACTS IS INVESTIGATED This investigation was undertaken in response to Senate Resolution 493 9 and the commission's order supplemental thereto which was issued April 27, 1931. Briefly, the resolution calls for all facts relating to the letting of Government building contracts and for information concerning whether or not there has been price fixing on the materials used in construction work of which there are some two hundred and fifty. 9 For full text of the resolution see p.259.BREAD AND FLOUR 39 The various departments of the Government authorized to award construction contracts deal almost exclusively with gene ral contractors. Preliminary information concerning the sources of building materials used in Government buildings was obtained from these contractors by means of questionnaires. By the same method general contractors were called upon to submit their views as to whether or not there has been price fixing among subcontractors or material-men. The condition of the commission's appropriation made it necessary that the investigation be confined to a representative number of con-tracts and materials. Early in the investigation it became obvious that the specification, selection, and approval of materials for use in Federal buildings were of primary importance and were perhaps the most controversial matters in the entire program. It likewise was clear that the exterior materials, especially the natural products, were the ones over which such controversies most frequently arose. The initial selection of materials was therefore confined to granite, marble, limestone, and sandstone, and investigators were sent into the field to develop facts concerning competitive conditions in these industries. Later terra cotta, which to some extent is in competition with stone, was added to the list of materials under investigation. Some work of a general nature was also undertaken on brick, but this industry is scattered so generally throughout the United States that a comprehensive investigation would require expenditure of funds far in excess of those available. Facts relating to the letting of Government contracts were obtained largely from the Treasury Department, because this is the most important contracting unit of the Federal Government. Some 40 jobs were selected for investigation. In making this selection, the geographical location of the building, its size, cost, and the kinds of materials used were considered in order that the pictu re developed might be truly representative. The field work as outlined above was started in Octobe r, 1931, and completed in June, 1932. The data collected is now being compiled and the report is expected to be completed in a few months. BREAD AND FLOUR REPORT COVERS FACTS OBTAINED AFTER LONG LITIGATION A suppl emental report entitled \"Conditions in Flour-Milling Business\" was prepared and published during the year as Senate Document No.96, Seventy-second Congress, first session, pursuant to Senate Resolution 163, Sixty-eighth Congress, first session.40 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION This report is based upon documents requested in 1925, subpoenaed in 1926, and delivered in 1931 after long litigation, initiated by the Millers' National Federation on behalf of its officers and members The letter of submittal of the report is as follows: This supplemental report of the Federal Trade Commission on competition in the flour industry is submitte d in compliance with Senate Resolution No.103,. Sixty-eighth Congress, first session, which directed, among other things, an inquiry into \"the production, distribution, transportation, and sale of flour an bread, including by-products, and report its findings in full to the Senate, showing the costs, prices, and profits at each stage of the process of production and distribution, * * * the extent and methods of price fixing, price maintenance * * *,\" etc. The last and principal report hitherto submitted to the Senate on this subject was made under date of January 11, 1928, namely, a report on competition and profits in bread and flour. The reason that a supplemental report is submitted at this time is that, following the service of certain subpoenas on the secretary of the Millers' National Federation and others, in April, 1920, to appear and produce certain documentary evidence pertinent to the above-mentioned inquiry ordered by the Senate, and on the day before the date of the hearing, a petition for a temporary injunction against such proceeding was file in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, which injunction was granted by the court on the next day. From that time the matter was in the courts until February 2, 1931, when the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the decision of the lower court, which was duly followed by a decree in the lower court, dated March 10, 1931, setting aside and vacating the injunction. The Millers' National Federation and the other original respondents in the subpoena proceedings then satisfied the commission by the delivery of certain papers, namely, certain documentary evidence of the Millers' National Federation and a certain accounting statement of the business of the Washburn-Crosby Co., which had been prepared by examiners of the commission with the consent of the company, but which the company had taken from them. The information presented in this report comprises, therefore, first, additional documentary evidence regarding competitive conditions among the flour millers and, second, more comprehensive information regarding the Investment. and profits of the flour millers; that is, amplified by the inclusion of the data. for the Washburn-Crosby Co., the largest flour-milling company in the country, during the period in question. The inclusion of the additional financial data does net greatly change the results as to average rate of return on investment, which is shown to be somewhat higher by this addition, though the investment per barrel of output is considerably reduced. Three reports were previously issued pursuant to the above mentioned resolution.PART III. SPECIAL PROCEDURE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ADVERTISING CASES 126056--32----4 41PART III. SPECIAL PROCEDURE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ADVERTISING CASES EXTENT OF MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING More than 16,000,000,000 copies of daily, weekly, and monthly periodicals are printed and circulated every year, and every copy carries advertising matter intended to induce the readers to buy some article of commerce. Approximately $1,000,000,000 is paid publishers annually by advertisers. There are published in the United States 2,288 daily newspapers, with a total circulation of 42,110,890; 520 Sunday newspapers, with a circulation of 28,206,171; 3,445 weekly and monthly magazines, with a circulation of approximately 75,000,000; 12,820 tri-weekly, semi-weekly, and weekly newspapers; and 981 fortnightly, semi- monthly, bimonthly, and quarterly publications. Altogether there are published in the United States close to 20,000 daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers and magazines, with a total circulation of approximately 1,889,000,000 copies a month, or more than 16,000,000,000 a year. These publication s live on revenue collected from advertisers, and the advertisers live on money collected from the purchasing public. In 1930 national advertisers paid $192,327,954 to the publishers of 65 weekly and monthly magazines having a total circulation of 56,492,131. In 1931 they paid them $156,218,419. For years many publishers, without consideration for their subscribers, accepted and published advertisements filled with false and misleading representations and thereby became parties to the deception and fraud perpetrated upon their readers. PUBLISHERS VALUE READER CONFIDENCE Later many publishers awoke to the value of reader confidence and barred from their publications such advertisements as were clearly fraudulent. The publishers requested a trade-practice conference. It was held in New York City, November 12, 1928, with approximately 6,000 publishers present. Chairman Humphrey outlined the scope of the conference and the powers of the Federal Trade Commission; pointed out the extent to which advertisers were robbing the sick, the unfortunate, and the ignorant; the part publishers were playing in delivering innocent victims into the clutches of false advertisers; the responsibility of4344 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION the publishers and their plain duty to their subscribers and the purchasing public; and requested the cooperatio n of all publishers in the commission's efforts to eliminate falsehood and deception from advertising and to restore reader confidence. These assembled publishers pledged their support; and it may be said to the credit of a large majority of all publishers that they have loyally cooperated with the commission. Hundreds of vultures preying upon the public have been driven out of business; and thousands of otherwise honest business men, who had fallen into the habit of exaggerating and using deceptive and misleading superlatives, have revised their \"copy\" and find it pays to tell the truth in advertising. SPECIAL BOARD CREATED TO HANDLE COMPLAINTS To handle the great volume of complaints against advert isers, the commission, in May, 1929, created a special board of investigation. This board is composed of three members-all attorneys--and is authorized, by various orders of the commission: To make investigations with reference to false and misleading advertising in newspapers and magazines; To extend to advertisers, publishers, and advertising agents the privilege of informal hearings before the board prior to actual issuance of complaint and institution of formal proceedings; To hold such hearings or conferences in all cases where, in the opinion of the board, it appears the matter might be adjusted by stipulation or agreement; To make from time to time reports to the commission of its action in any case or eases; To prepare and submit to the commission for its consideration recommendations or suggested forms or plans for further proceedings in any case or cases or for the final disposition thereof; and To perform such other duties as the commission from time to time directs. PROCEDURE OF SPECIAL BOARD IS OUTLINED In actua l practice the special board considers all cases of false and misleading advertising in newspapers, magazines , and over the radio that are brought to its attention by reference, complaint, or otherwise, and recommends to the commission such action as it deems proper. Even though an advertisement considered by the board is not obviously false, still, to clear up any possible doubt, a questionnaire is sent to the adver tiser requesting copies of his published advertisements and of all booklets, folders, circulars, form letters, and other advertising literature used, together with a sample of the advertised article, and, if it is a medical preparation, the quantitative formula. These medicines and formulas are submitted to medical authorities for reports on their therapeutic properties. If it appears that an advertiser is making false and misleading representations to effect the sale of his goods, the board reports theSPECIAL PROCEDURE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ADVERTISING CASES 45 matter to the commission with recommendation that an application for complaint be docketed and the matter formally referred to the special board for further action. When the commission makes such order and reference, the board then notifies the advertiser and the publishers, extending an opportunity to the advertiser to submit such evidence as he desires to verify, justify, or explain the statements and representations he is making to the public or otherwise show cause why proceedings should not be prosecuted. The publishers are likewise notified and given opportunity to show cause why they should not be joined as respondents in such proceedings against the advertisers. Publishers usually declare they have no interest in the business of the advertiser or the further publication of advertising assertions which are questioned by the commission and agree to abide by any cease and desist order that may issue against the advertiser and by the terms and provisions of any stipulation that may be entered into with the commission by the advertiser to the same extent as if they were parties to such proceedings, order, or stipulation. On execution of stipulation to that effect the board recommends to the commission that the publishers be not joined as respondents in the proceedings against the advertiser. Advertising agents are treated in the same manner as publishers when the circumstances of the case so warrant. The board hears the advertiser informally, and receives and considers all evidence submitted. Where it appears that the advertiser is not violating the statute, the board recommends to the commission that the proceedings be dismissed. Where it appears that the advertiser has been making false and misleading representations, in violation of law, but is willing to discontinue them, a stipulation is prepared by the board in which the offensive assertions are recited and their publication admitted. The advertiser signs an agreement to the effect he will cease and desist from making any false or misleading statement or representation to sell his goods, and specifically that he will not thereafter make the certain assertions recited therein either in substance or form. The acceptance of such a stipulation by the commission operates to dismiss the proceedings without prejudice.1 If, however, it appears to the board that the advertiser has been making false or misleading statements in violation of law and is unwilling to discontinue such methods, the board recommends the formal prosecution of the charges. 1 Stipulations approved and accepted during the fiscal year are digested, beginning on p.217.46 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CURES AND COSMETICS LEAD IN FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING Investigations made by the commission have disclosed frauds of many kinds. The worst are perpetrated by those who prey on the suffering of those of their fellows who are willing to try anything to get relief from pain or the handicap of illness. Millions of dollars are paid annually for preparations worthless or of doubtful value but advertised as being effective for such uses as reducing flesh or building it up; removing wrinkles, age lines, freckles, moles, warts, and the footprints of time; tinting or bleaching the skin; growing hair or removing it; coloring hair or bleaching it; and the like. Investigations of the commission disclose that various preparations purveyed by some chemists, cosmeticians, and others who are looking for easy money, will not always stand up under careful scientific analysis. A \"wrinkle oil\" was found to consist of castor oil with a few drops of perfume, put up in 2-ounce bottles of pleasing shape, with beautiful labels, for $2. For fat people many reducing creams are offered, and numerous vendors advertise magic results, all of which are false and misleading, for there is no cream that will reduce fat by mere application. Some vendors offer the identical cream as a tissue-builder or flesh food to enable skinny folk at will to build up flesh on the neck, the arms or legs, the back, the bust, or wherever they crave it, yet there is no known cream that will build tissue or feed flesh. Having perfected the form divine by either reducing rolls of fat or rounding out the graceful curves, perhaps the color of the hair is not quite pleasing, and to remedy this there are tonics galore to remove dandruff and thicken the hair and cause it to grow, and dyes of many kinds to impart a color that might make one appear more youthful, if the lines of the face and the color of the skin did not belie the copper tint that displaced a natural and distinguished gray. Some concerns do a business approaching a million dollars a year in the sale of hair dye alone. In the large field of miscellaneous cases, especial attention has been given the past year, with Substantial results, to those of puzzle- contest advertisements, paid testimonials, luck charms, and excessive earnings for prospective agents. BOARD INVESTIGATES AND REPORTS ON 406 CASES During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1932, the special board concluded the investigation of and reported to the commission 406 cases. Of these, 341 were against advertisers, 57 against publishers. and 8 against advertising agencies.SPECIAL PROCEDURE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ADVERTISING CASES 47 In 45 cases the advertisers discontinued business, 12 more were forced out by post- office fraud orders, 3 discontinued false and misleading advertising before complaints were made, 42 cases were dismissed for lack of evidence or jurisdiction, 18 were referred to other divisions, 233 were disposed of by stipulation, and prosecution of formal proceedings was recommended in 9 cases. In 44 cases investigation s were completed, reported to the commission, and await further orders. The personnel of the special board of investigation numbers 8, including its 3 members, 2 official reporters, a secretary, and 2 stenographers. The board does no traveling. The cost of its operation during the last fiscal year was $23,400, or an average of $57.63 a case. While it is impossible to state accurately the numb er of false and misleading advertisements that have been discontinued entirely or revised to check fairly with the truth, it is estimated that such number for last year, considered as being directly due to the commission's activities, exceeds 20,000. The money saved to the purchasing public amounts to many millions of dollars. That rapid progress is being made for truth and honesty in advertising is evidenced by the following declaration adopted by the Advertising Federation of America at its twenty-eighth annual convention in June, 1932: We agree to conduct our business with due recognition that truth, honesty, and integrity must be the basis of every sound transaction; consider the mutual interests of supplier and consumer and, therefore, avoid anything tending toward misrepresentation, indecent or misleading advertising, deceptive methods, or the promise of perfor mance that can not be reasonably fulfilled. And a new advertising code was recently adopted by the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencie s. The practices particularly objected to are: (1)False statements or misleading exaggerations; (2) indirect misrepresentation of a product or service, through distortion of details, either editorially or pictorially; (3) statements or suggestions offensive to public decency; (4) statements which tend to undermine an industry by attributing to its products, generally, faults and weaknesses true only of a few; (5) price claims that are misleading; (6) pseudoscientific advertising, including claims insufficiently supported by accepted authority or that distort the true meaning or application or a statement made by professional or scientific authority, and (7) testimonials which do not reflect the real choice of a competent witness. These associations have formed a committee to enforce their code Such enforcement, according to announcements from the participating associations, among other benefits, will \"stem the tide of destructive advertising and restore belief in the eternal truthfulness of the printed word.\"PART IV. TRADE-PRACTICE CONFERENCES 49PART IV. TRADE-PRACTICE CONFERENCES COMMISSION ACTION ON TRADE-PRACTICE-CONFERENCE RULES IS SHOWN The commission approved and accepted trade-practice- conference rules for 10 industries and revised rules previously promulgated for 7 industries during the fiscal year.1 The 10 industries are: Furnace pipe and fittings, electrical contracting, electric wholesalers, feathers and down, waste-paper dealers, household furniture, metal burial vaults, multicolor printers of transparent and translucent materials, school-supply distributors, and silk weighting. The 7 industries referred to are: Commercial cold storage, grocery industry, plumbing and heating, scrap iron and steel, trunks-luggage- brief cases, warm-air furnaces, and direct-selling industry. Of the 10 industries for which rules were approved and accepted by the commission for the first time, 7 had held conferences during the fiscal year, and 3 had met previously. Of the 7 industries for which rules were revised by the commission during this period, 5 have accepted the action of the commission. The rules in each instance have been published. In the other 2 instances the rules are being considered either by the commission or the industries. Commission action on trade-practice-conference rules for any industry is not made public until such rules as acted on have been submitted to a committee or individual authorized to act for the respective industry in matters affecting trade-practice- conference rules. Trade-practice rules for a total of 63 industries were made public by the commission during the year. The commission's action on a number of these had taken place in the previous fiscal year. Of the 63 sets of rules made public, 37 were for industries for which rules had been previously promulgated and revised by the commission, while 26 were for industries for which trade-practice-conference rules had not hitherto been issued. RESULTS ATTAINED FROM THE TRADE CONFERENCE Results to the public from trade-practice conferences have proven incalculable in the form of voluntary elimination of methods of unfair competition which probably would otherwise remain undis- 1 Trade-practice conferences held by the Federal Trade Commission since inception of the movement i 1919 are listed on p.253.5152 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION covered and in use; in the speedier benefits derived from such elimination as compared with the time required in accomplishing the same objective by other methods of procedure; and in the economies effected through the saving of expense to the public by obviating the necessity for investigations and trials of complaints. Results to industries, while secondary to the main purpose of the commission in holding trade-practice conferences, are shown by a generally recognized and clearly marked trend toward the use of higher standards of business conduct, superinduced largely through the cooperative nature of the trade-practice conference, bringing into closer relationship industries and the commission. The educational value of trade- practice conferences is attested by the fact that many engaged in business and industry were not aware, until a trade-practice conference was held, that competitive methods commonly used by them constituted actual violations of law, or that the unnecessary cost of indulging in unfair competition and wasteful practices, if abandoned at one and the same time by voluntary agreement of all in the industry, may be transformed from an item of expense to an increase in profit without adding to the price paid by the ultimate purchasers of their products. REQUISITES OF A TRADE-PRACTICE CONFERENCE A trade-pra ctice conference is a voluntary proceeding duly authorized. by the Federal Trade Commission whereby an industry may assemble for the purpose of discussing any existing compe titive conditions and unfair methods of competition with a view to improving such conditions and eliminating such methods of competition. The first requisite of a trade-prac tice conference is a desire on the part of a sufficiently large number in that industry to eliminate such practices and to improve such conditions. TRADE-PRACTICE-CONFERENCE PROCEDURE Trade-practice conferences are usually authorized on applications from industries. At times they are initiated by the commission. Before the commission authorizes a conference it must be satisfied that it has jurisdiction and that the holdin g of the conference is desirable and feasible. Determination of these questions may be aided by the thoroughness With which the industry makes application for the conference. The application may be in letter form and should contain information along the following general lines: (1)A brief description of the business for which the conference is intended; the products manufactured or the commodities distributed should be named; the annual volume, production, capitalization, and like items should be approximated in order to give an idea of theTRADE-PRACTICE CONFERENCES 53 size and importanc e of the industry. It is at times difficult to judge the specific character of a business by the term ordinarily used therein to describe it. (2)The application should state whether the proposed conference is to be national or sectional in scope. While conferences in practically all cases are held for an entire industry, they have in some instances been held for all in the industry situated within certain geographical limits. This is usually due to the fact that the practices, problems, and competitive conditions in one section differ from those in another; but in no instance, whether national or sectional, is a conference held solely for an association or group but for the whole industry. For this reason, the application, if made for those situated within geographical limits, should specifically describe such limits and give plainly the reasons for the limitations. (3)The application should state whether the conference is in-tended for all branches of the industry or whether limited to branches such as manufacturers or manufacturers and distributors. Whether a conference should be limited to a specific branch depends upon the particular practices dealt with. If the resolutions adopted by manufacturers, for example, should be confined to practices which do not materially affect distributors, there would be no particular reaso n for including distributors. On the contrary, if the proposed actions involve distribution, distributors should be included. (4)The application should state jurisdictional facts which should show (a) whether the applicants are engaged in interstate commerce and (b) whether the practices, or some of them, are unfair methods of competition, and whether these practices are in use in the industry at the time the application is made. (5)The practices proposed for discussion should be named, and where necessary described. This does not limit the discussion at the conference to the particular subjects thus named, since the conference itself constitutes an open forum wherein discussion of any practice used in the industry is desired and encouraged. (6)Authority of the person making the application should also be shown. If made by an association executive, a resolution showing the action of the association, together with the percentage of the industry represented by the membership should be submitted. If made by a small group, it should be signed by each member thereof. (7)The application should be accompanied by a complete list of members of the industry, or such list should be furnished shortly after submission of the application. It should be divid ed, keyed, or symbolized to indicate association members, nonmembers, and types of concerns, such as manufacturers, distributors, etc.54 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION When this information is received by the trade-practice conference division the director makes a report and recommendation to the commission with reference thereto. If the commission determines on a trade-practice conference, the industry is assembled at a time and place specified by it. A commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission presides, but in order to give the widest possible range to the discussion of practices which may be proposed and to preserve the voluntary chara cter of the conference those present are encouraged to organize by electing their own secretary for the conference. After the industry has examined and freely discussed practices or methods the elimination of which would be beneficial and fair to all in the industry and to the public, resolutions are framed which, in the judgment of its representatives, are workable, and they are separately voted on. Following the conference the proceedings are reported to the full commis sion through its division of trade-practice conferences. This procedure deals with the industry as a unit. It is concerned solely with practices and methods, not at that time with individual offenders. It tends to wipe out on a given date all unfair methods condemned at the conference and thus place all competitors on an equally fair competitive basis in so far as such methods or practices are concerned. Mere attenda nce at a conference or actual participation in the deliberations thereat should not be taken as indication that any firm or individual thus participating has indulged in the practices condemned at such conference. The commission charges its division of trade-practice conferences with the duty of coordinating and facilitating the work incident to the holding of trade-practice conferences, of extending the scope of such work within its proper sphere, of observing and studying the work of such, and of encouraging closer cooperation between business as a whole, and the commission in serving the public. After a trade-practice conference is held, the commission retains its interest in the observance of the Group I rules of the conference by the members of the industry. The observance of Group II rules is a matter for the industry.2 It is the duty of a committee of the conference to notify the commission of any violations of trade-practice conference rules. During the year ended June 30, 1932, there were 40 violations of trade-practice conference rules, all of which were settled without litigation, and at a minimum cost to both Government and respondents. 2 Rules approved and accepted by the commission relate to practices violative of the law and are designated Group I. Other rules accepted as expressions of the trade are classed as Group II.PART V. GENERAL LEGAL WORK DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE LEGAL INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS STIPULATIONS REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS ORDERS TO CEASE AND DESIST TYPES OF UNFAIR COMPETITION CASES IN THE FEDERAL COURTS TABULAR SUMMARY OF LEGAL WORK 55PART V. GENERAL LEGAL WORK DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE A case before the Federal Trade Commission may originate in several ways. The most common origin is through application for complaint by a competitor or from other public sources. Another way in which a case may begin is by direction of the commission. No formality is required for anyone to make an application for a complaint. A letter setting forth the facts in detail is sufficient, but it should be accompanied by all evidence in possession of the com-plaining party in support of the charges being made. INFORMAL PROCEDURE (CONFIDENTIAL RECORD) When such an application is received, the commission, through its legal investigating division, considers the essential jurisdictional elements; Is the practice complained of being carried on in interstate commerce? Does it come under jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission act, section 5, prohibiting unfair methods of competition? Would the prosecution of a complaint in this instance be in the public interest? It is essential that these three questions be capable of answer in the affirmative. Frequently it is necessary to obtain additional data by further correspondence or by a preliminary investigation before deciding whether to docket an \"application for issuance of complaint.\" Once an application is docketed it is assigned by the chief examiner to an examining attorney or a branch office of the commission for investigation. It is the duty of either to obtain all facts regarding the matter from both the applicant and the proposed respondent. Without disclosing the name of the applicant, the examiner inter-views the party complained against, advising of the charges and requesting submission of such evidence as is desired in defense or explanation. After developing the facts from all available sources, the examining attorney summ arizes the evidence in a final report, reviews the law applicable thereto, and makes a recommendation as to action. 1 Or of one or more of those sections of the Clayton Act administered by the commission? See p.157. 126056---32-----5 5758 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION The entire record is then review able by the chief examiner. If it appea rs to be complete, it is submitted with recommendation to the board of review or to the commission for consideration. Recommendations for dismissal outright or upon the signing by the pro posed respondent of a stipulation of facts and an agreement to cease and desist from the unlawful practice charged ordinarily are sent direct to the commission. Recommendations for complaint and for certain types of stipulations go to the board of review. If submitted to the board of review, all records, including statements made by witnesses interviewed by the examiners, are reviewed and passed on to the commission with a detailed summary of the facts developed, an opinion based on the facts and the law, and the board's recommendation. The board may recommend (1) dismissal of the application for lack bf evidence in support of the charge or on the grounds that the charge indicated does not violate any law over which the commission has jurisdiction, or (2) dismissal of the application upon the signing by the proposed respondent of a stipulation of the facts and an agree- ment to cease and desist the unlawful practice charged, and (3) issuance of a complaint without further procedure. Usually if the board believ es that complaint should issue it, grants the proposed respondent a hearing. Such hearing is informal, involving no taking of testimony. The foregoing procedure is applied in all cases except those pertaining to false and misleading advertising in newspapers and periodicals as handled by the special board of investigation. (See p. 44.) Up to this point the procedure is informal and for the purpose of furnishing information to the commission. Nothing in regard to a case in this stage is made public, except in cases disposed of by stipulation, and even then only the facts are given, for information of the public and benefit of the industry involved; the names of parties stipulating are not revealed, unless the stipulation is for the public record. Withholding of names in informal cases is for protection of the respondent, against whom no formal complaint has been ordered or served. FORMAL PROCEDURE (PUBLIC RECORD) Only after most careful scrutiny does the commission. issue a complaint. Unlike the preliminary inquiries and applications for complaint, which are informal, the complaint and the answer of respondent thereto and subsequent proceedings are a public record. The case is now in change of the commiss ion's chief counsel for preparation of complaint and trial of the case. A complaint is issued in the name of the commission acting in the public interest. It names a respondent and charges a violation ofDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE 59 law, with a statement of the charges. The party first Complaining to the commission is not a party to the complaint when issued by the commission, nor does the complaint seek to adjust matters between parties; the proceeding is to prevent unfair methods of competition for the protection of the public. The commission's rules of practice and procedu re provide that in case the respondent desires to contest the proceedings he shall, within 30 days from service of the complaint, file with the commission an answer to the complaint. The rules of practice also specify a form of answer for use should the respondent decide to waive hearing on the charges and not contest the proceeding. Failure to appear or to file an answer within the time specified-- shall be deemed to be an admission of all allegations of the complaint and to authorize the commission to find them to be true and to waive hearing on the charges set forth in the complaint. In a contested case the matter is set down for taking of testimony before a trial examiner. This may occupy varying lengths of time according to the nature of the charge or the availability and number of witnesses to be examined. Hearings are held before a commission trial examiner, who may sit in various parts of the country, the commission and the respondent each being represented by their own attorneys. After the taking of testimony and the submission of evidence on behalf of the commission in support of the complaint, and on behalf of the respondent, the trial examiner prepares a report of the facts for the information of the commission, counsel for the commission, and counsel for the respondent. Exceptions to the trial examiner's report may be taken by either counsel for the commission or counsel for the respondent. Within a stated time after receipt of the trial examiner's report, briefs are filed and the case comes on for final argument before the full commi ssion. Thereafter the commis sion reaches ft decision either sustaining the charges or the complaint or dismissing the complaint; If the complaint is sustained, the commission makes a report in which it states its findings as to the facts and conclusion that the law has be en violated, and thereupon an order is issued requiring the respondent to cease and desist from such practices. If the complaint is dismissed, an order of dismissal is entered. These orders are final functions of the commission as far as its own procedure is concerned. CASES MAY BE TAKEN TO FEDERAL COURTS No penalty is attached to an order to cease and desist but a respondent against whom it is directed is required within a specified60 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION time, usually 60 days, to report in writing the manner in which he is complying with the order. If he fails or neglects to obey an order while it is in effect, the commission may apply to a United States circuit court of appeals for review of the commission's order. The respon dent may also petition for review. The circuit courts have power to affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the commission. These proceedings may be carried by either party on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States for final determination. LEGAL INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW PRELIMINARY INQUIRIES When the fiscal year began there were pending 307 preliminary or undocketed cases of alleged unfair methods of competition. During the year 1,659 new applications for complaint were received.2 Preliminary investigations were made by the chief examiner in 1,543 of these cases, leaving 423 undocketed applications for complaints yet to be handled. Of the preliminary cases, 317 were docketed as regular applications for complaint. These, with 198 pending at the first of the year, totaled 515, of which 378 were disposed of during the year. A considerable number of attorneys usually assigned to regular unfair-competition cases were engaged on special investigations directed by Congress. However, the regular work has been kept well in hand. The average length of time on all docketed applications as of June 15 of the present year was but four days more than at the same date. last year. This is shown in the following statement: Dock- Average length Dock- Average length eted of time of all eted on hand on at date of on at date of Date hand 6 report Date hand 6 report months months or more or more at date at date of re- Months Days of re- Months Days port port 1928-- Feb. 15 97 9 16 1930-- June 15 46 4 4 Apr.15 95 8 26 Aug. 15 47 4 15 June 15 86 8 13 Oct. 15 15 4 50 Aug. 15 78 7 26 Dec.15 72 5 5 Oct. 15 70 7 21 1931-- Feb. 15 61 5 12 Dec. 15 66 6 15 Apr. 15 75 5 10 1929-- Feb. 15 61 5 21 June 15 65 5 10 Apr. 15 62 5 17 Aug. 15 58 5 10 June 15 49 5 13 Oct. 15 60 5 21 Aug. 15 47 5 16 Dec. 15 53 6 10 Oct. 15 52 4 25 1932-- Feb. 15 51 6 0 Dec.15 44 4 23 Apr. 15 47 5 16 1930-- Feb. 15 41 4 22 June 15 42 5 14 Apr. 15 42 4 21 2 For further statistics on legal cases see numerical summary. p.117.CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS 61 During the last year the chief examiner, at the direction of the commission, met in conferences with members of the State Department, various other branches of the United States Government, and representatives of the Spanish Embassy for discussion, with a view to arriving at some solution under existing laws of trade complaints due to the use by American firms of labels and trade names suggestive of Spanish origin on American products. Another part of the legal investigating work is to conduct, by direction of the commission or on requests of different units of the commission, supplemental investigations in cases where (1) formal complaints have issued, (2) Violations of stipulations entered into with the commission are involved, or (3) where it may appear that the commission's orders to cease and desist are being violated. These investigations may be at the direction of the commission or as a result of complaints from other sources. The investigating and other work of the commission is carried on from Washington and through four branch offices, located at 45 Broadway, New York City; 608 South Dearborn Street, Chicago; 544 Market Street, San Francisco ; and 421 Lyon Building, Seattle. Business men and others desiring to bring matters of complaint to the attention of the commission can consult at these places with well-qualified repres entatives of the commission. BOARD REVIEWS CASES FOLLOWING INQUIRIES Following preliminary investigation by the chief examiner's staff, 114 applications for complaint were reviewed by the board of review, which consists of four attorneys. One hundred and three of these cases were forwarded during the Year, leaving 11 pending at the close. Of this number 45 applications were recommended for dismissal, 21 for complaint , 19 for stipulation, while in 10 cases further investigation was recommended and in 8 there were miscellaneo us recommendations. In connection with these applications 24 hearings were held. CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS FEW SUCH COMBINATIONS ARE RECORDED The year ending June 30, 1932, was a year of comparatively few consolidations and mergers. Only one consolidation or merger was investigated by this office during the last year to every four for the year 1929. The year seems to have been noteworthy for the number of companies passing into receivership or undergoing reorganization, rather than for the number of consolidations and mergers. There62 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION has been a gradual decline in the number of consolidations and mergers effected since 1929. Whereas the commission inquired into some 200 important industrial acquisitions, consolidations, and mergers three years ago, it was only necessary to institute some 50 like inquiries during the fiscal year just closed. The number of companies undergoing reorga nization, which included the acquisition and consolidation of subsidiary interest s chiefly because of economic necessity, and the number of concerns passing into the hands of receivers probably exceeded the total number of consolidations and mergers effected during the year. Twenty-two prelimina ry inquiries involving acquisitions, consolidations, and mergers were pending at the beginning of the year. Fifty-two additional inquiries were instituted during the year, and 6 were pending at the close of the year, indicating a disposition of 68 preliminary matters during the year, of which 67 were filed without docketing. Of the 67 matters filed without docketing, 42 involved the acquisition of. assets, 21 involved the acquisition of capital stocks, and 4 pertained to matters which failed of consummation. Among the 42 asset-acquisiti on matters considered and file d, 28 involved competitive products--of which 2 companies were in receivership and 2 did strictly an intrastate business--and 14 involved noncompetitive or complementary products. Among the 21 capital-stock-acquisition matters considered and filed, 9 involved noncompetitive or complementary products, 9 involved situations in which substantial competition could not be established, 2 involved matters wherein substantial competition was existent, but the acquired units were in receivership or in severe financial difficulties, and 1 was filed because of the inability to establish a tendency toward monopoly in compliance with the court decision in the commission's case against V. Vivaudou (Inc.), handed down in November, 1931. (See p.114.) Ten docketed matters involving section 7 of the Clayto n Act were pending at the beginning of the year; 2 were docketed during the year; 4 were dismissed or disposed of during the year; and 8 were pending at the close of the year. Eight complaints involving section 7 of the Clayton Act were pending at the beginning of the year; 1 was issued during the year; 5 were dismissed during the year; and 4 were pending at the close of the year. There were no section 7 matters pending in the courts at the close of the year. The Supreme Court decision in the Thatcher Manufacturing Co., the Swift, and the Western Meat Co. cases precludes commissionSTIPULATIONS 63 action in cases where, although capital stock has been acquired, a consolidation or merger is later brought about through the acquisition of assets before the final determination of the matter. The Supreme Court decision in the International Shoe Co. case has the effect of precluding commission action in cases where the acquisition, consolidation, or merger is effected through the purchase of capital stock and where the facts fail to disclose a substantial lessening of competition in the same area or areas in strictly comparable products. The Clayton Act may be said to apply only to those situations wherein the acquisition, consolidation, or merger is effected, through purchase of capital stock with the result of substantially lesseni ng or eliminating competition or restraining commerce in any section or community or where a tendency to monopolize any line of commerce is created. STIPULATIONS COMMISSION APPROVES 372 AGREEMENTS DURING YEAR Stipulations in which various individuals and companies agreed to cease and desist from unlawful practices charged were approved and accepted by the commission during the fiscal year in 160 cases, digests of which may be found beginning on page 217. During the 6 \u00bd years in which the stipulation system had been in effect, as of June 30, 1932, a total of 997 stipulations had been appro ved and accepted by the commission. These cases are in addition to 212 stipulations concerning cases of false and misleading advertising. (See p.229.) Applications for complaint are frequently disposed of by the stipulat ion method, particularly in cases where the practice complained of is not so fraudulent or vicious that protection of the public demands the regular procedure of complaint. The question of whether a respondent shall be permitted to sign a stipulation is entirely within the discretion of the commission, as the disposition of a case by stipulation is not a right but a privilege extended by the commission. The stipulation procedure provides an opportunity for the respondent to enter into a stipulation of the facts and voluntarily agree to cease and desist forever from the alleged unfair methods set forth therein. Such stipulation is subject to the final review and approval of the commission. A potential respondent decides he would rather quit the practice of which complaint is made than go through with trial of a formal complaint. If the commission approves such a course, he signs an agreement to \"cease and desist forever\" from the unfair practice64 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION with the understan ding that should he ever resume it the facts as stipulated may be used in evidence against him in the trial of a com-plaint Which the commission may issue. Publicity regarding stipulations is especially valuable to the other members of an industry to which a signer of such an agreement belongs. With this in mind the commission, in releasing for publication the facts surroundi ng a given stipulation, emphasizes the name of the commodity or industry invol ved so that newspaper or trade-paper representatives, trade-association secretaries, and members of the industries concerned may make note thereof. Names of respondents are not divulged, except occasionally, when a stipula tion agreement is designated for the \"public record.\" Commodities mentioned in stipulations. are of an infinite variety. Taken at random there would be such a list as follows: Hats, shoes, suit goods, fly-catching devices, tombstones, toy airplanes, perfumes, blankets, electrotherapeutic instruments, synthetic beverages, horse-shoes, radio cabinets, sea food, and tooth paste. The commission believes that its stipulation procedure is protecting the American consumer from numerous unfair methods of competition which, in the aggregate, are an important consideration. It is apparent also that large sums of money that otherwise would be spent in litigation are being saved the public. REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS MAJORITY INVOLVE UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION All but 1 of the 92 formal complaints issued during the year charged the use of unfair methods of competition violative of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission act, including one which involved the alleged violati on of the Federal Trade Commission act as extended by section 4 of the export trade act. The One remaining complaint issued charged violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act by the acquisition of the capital stock of competing concerns. No complaints were issued during the year under the three other sections of the Clayt on Act administered by the commission, namely, section 2 (price discrimination), section 3 (tying contracts), and section 8 (interlocking directorates). Herewith are presented brief summaries of the charges contained in a few of the compl aints issued by the commission during the fiscal year. Unless otherwise indicated, the practices charged are violative of the Federal Trade Commission act. These complaints are fairly representative. 3 3 Attention is especially invited to the fact that most of these complaints are pending, and, consequently, the commission has reached no determination as to whether the law has been violated as charged therein.REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS 65 ACQUIRING CAPITAL STOCK OF COMPETITOR Clayton Act, section 7.--It was alleged that the respondent, which is both a holding and operating company, owned the capital stock of a corporation engaged in the manufacture and interstate sale of wire strand, wire rope, and cable, and in January, 1930, acquired all the capital stock of a corporation also engaged in the manufacture and interstate sale of wire strand, wire rope, and cable. It is further alleged that the commission's complaint that for several years prior to the acquisition of stock of the latter company in 1930, the company owned and operated by the respondent before the acquisition, was in direct and substantial competition in interstate comme rce with the company whose capital stock was acquired in 1930 ; that the value of the sales of the products of the two operating companies were $2,500,000 each, four-fifths of which were in the same States. It is further alleged that the acquisition by the respondent of the capital stock of the corporation in 1930, as alleged, was contrary to law and in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, and the effect of such acqu isitions has been, is, or may be (a) to substantially lessen competition in interstate commerce between the two operating companies; (b) to restrain commerce in the sale of wire strand, wire rope, cable, etc., in those sections or communities where the operating companies were in competition prior to the acquisition; and (c) to tend to create a monopoly in the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of wire strand, wire rope, cable, etc. RESTRAINT OF TRADE IS CHARGED In a complaint issued in April, 1932, and amended in May, 1932, but only as to names of the respondents, the commission charged a number of corporations and an individual with entering into an agreement, combination, and conspiracy for the purpose and with the effect of fixing and depressing prices for waste paper purchased in Chicago and used by such corporations in the manufacture of cardboard boxes, and of similar products. The complaint charges that prior to the combination the respondent corporations purchased waste paper in Chicago in open competition with one another, but that in May, 1929, the conspiracy was entered into and consisted of the adoption and maintenance of a plan or scheme by which the individual respondent was to and did, acting for the corporation respondents, buy for them (but only from dealers approved by them) in the Chicago market waste paper available in that market, as the result of which waste paper buying prices were fixed and depressed, competition in bidding for waste paper was eliminated, and dealers66 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION in Waste paper in the Chicago market were deprived of the competition previously existing among respondent corporations in the purchase of such waste paper. The combinat ion is alleged to have had certain elements of boycott. Among them were these: (1) The respondents would not purchase waste paper from dealers who refused to sell at the prices fixed by the combination; (2) respondents refused to purchase waste paper from dealers who had purchased for resale such waste paper from dealers not approved by the respondents. The complaint further charged that, for the purpose of keeping prices for waste paper in the Chicago market depressed, respondents at various times made large purchases of waste paper outside of the Chicago territory. It is alleged that the combination lessened, restricted, and sup-pressed competition in the purchase of waste paper and made the prices substantially uniform and noncompetitive; that it depressed the price of waste paper; closed and curtailed the outlets of wastepaper dealers, and that as a result of these effects and by reason of the large volume of waste paper purchased by the respondent corporations they made and set prevailing prices for waste paper and thus obstructed the natural flow of commerce in the sale of waste paper and of waste-paper products. AGREEMENTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE In October, 1931, the commission issued a complaint against an association of ammunitio n manufacturers and its members, including practically all of the large manufacturers of ammunition, charging them with the use of unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission act. It is alleged in the complaint that the members of the association entered into a combination or conspiracy among themselves and with the association to restrain and suppress competition in the sale and distribution of shotgun shells and small-arms ammunition by fixing uniform prices, terms; and discounts, including arbitrary freight allowances to be observed by them in the sale of such products and by their jobber customers in the resale of such products. It is also alleged that the members of the association have agreed to maintain the uniform prices, terms, and discounts thus fixed and have arbitrarily advanced the prices of ammunition. It is also alleged that the members of the association have agreed to restrict the sale of ammunition to distributors who adopted and maintained resale prices fixed by the members of the association and the mem-REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS 67 bers would refuse to sell mail-order houses and others, who would not maintain such resale prices. Among the activities listed in the complaint as being performed by the members of the association pursuant to the conspiracy to suppress competition are the following: Publishing uniform list and suggested resale prices. Advancing the net and suggested resale prices on ammunition. Abolishing all discounts on ammunition. Refusing to sell ammunition to mail order houses and others who would not maintain suggested resale prices. Adopting and maintaining uniform seasonal terms and discounts. Adopting and observing uniform allowances for freight with established equalization points. Discontinuing distribution of free ammunition. Refusing to sell on consignment. Refusing to manufacture special brands. Adopting and observing uniform conditions of guarantee against decline Exchanging information with the executive manager of the association as to the performance of these activities. It is also alleged in the complaint that the activities and practices described have resulted in substantially lessening competition in the sale, in interstate commerce, of shotgun shells and small-arms ammunition; the development of uniform prices; enhancement of wholesale and retail prices; and curtailment of sources of supply for mail-order houses, and hardware jobbers. Answers have been filed to the foregoing complaint denying the allegations and evidence is being taken under the complaint and answers. UNFAIR METHODS IN FOREIGN TRADE Federal Trade Commission act, section 5, as extended by section 4, export trade act.-- One complaint was issued during the fiscal year charging violation of the export trade act. It is alleged that the respondent ships gasoline in cases of two cans of standard size with a capacity of 5 gallons each but filled only to the extent of 9.6 gallons per case, or in other quantities less than 10 full gallons per case. It is alleged in some instances that both the cases and cans are unmarked as to the contents, while in other instances the cases are stamped \"2/5 gallon tins,\" or the cans are stamped \"5 U. S. gallons.\" While it is set forth in the complaint that respondent indicated the exact liquid contents of such shipments on its quotation blanks and invoices and that the original purchaser is not misled, yet it is contended that such practice places in the hands of retailers and other sellers an instrument of fraud by means of which the ultimate con- sumer is misled and competitors injured.68 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Respondent in its answer alleges that the instances in which it sold gasoline as alleged in the complaint were few in number and were pursuant to specific orders, all of which were prior to the issuance of complaint. It is further contended by respondent that when standard size cans are filled to full 5-gallon capacity, not enough room is left for gas expansion. DISPARAGEMENT AND MISREPRESENTATION OF CIGARS In March, 1932, the commission issued a complaint against a cigar manufacturer, based on alleged misrepresentations of its own products, and disparagement of competitor's products, in the advertisement, sale, and distribution of certain machine- made cigars. It is alleged that the respondent corporation, in its advertisement s and other literature, decries, as filthy, insanitary, and generally repulsive and unhealthy, the use of the so-called practice of \"spit-tip-ping\" in the manufacture by hand of more than half of all the cigars made in this country, as contrasted with its own alleged certified and sanitary methods of manufacture under which \"every leaf, entering its factories, is scientifically treated by United States Government approved methods,\" when in truth and in fact the processes of manufacturing cigars by hand do not now generally involve the practice known to the trade and purchasing public as \"spit-tipping,\" or finishing the head of a cigar with saliva, and when in truth and in fact neither the United States Government, nor any department or bureau thereof, has officially, or otherwise, approved the methods used by respondent in the treatment of its tobacco or the cigars made by it therefrom. It is alleged that the aforesaid disparaging statements about competing products and misrepresentations of its own products tend to, and do, prejudice and injure competitors and the public generally, unfairly divert trade from said competitors, and operate as a restraint upon, and detriment to, freedom of fair and legitimate competition. Respondent filed its answer July 26, 1932. MISREPRESENTATION OF WATCHES A respondent corporation, engaged in manufacturing watches and watch parts, and in their sale and distribution in interstate commerce, is charged, in a complaint issued by the commission in June, 1932, with advertising in circulars, catalogues, newspapers, magazines, and other publications circulated in interstate commerce, and by means. of radio broadcasts, statements, and representations that its watches contain a designated number of jewels, every one of which serves a mechanical purpose as a friction bearing, when in truth and in fact they do not contain the stated number of jewels.REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS 69 Said respond ent is further charged with representing, in the aforementioned advertising matter and upon the barrel bridges of the watches themselves, that the said watches so manufactured and sold by it are adjusted so as to import or imply that the said watches have been adjusted to heat, cold, isochronism, and position, when in truth and in fact said watches or the movements thereof were not, and had not been, adjusted by respondent to heat, cold, isochronism, and position, as the term \"adjusted\" is generally understood in the industry and by the purchasing public. It is alleged that the said representations have misled and deceived the purchasing public, have induced the purchase of respondent's watches in reliance upon an erroneous belief that said representations were true, and have tended to divert trade from and otherwise injure competitors. Answer to the complaint was filed July 13 , 1932. MISBRANDING AND MISREPRESENTING MATTRESSES In September and October, 1931, respectively, the commission issued complaints against two concerns based on alleged misbranding and misrepresentation of the mattresses made by them. In both cases the respondents are individuals manufacturing mattresses and selling and distributing them in interstate commerce to furniture dealers and others. It is alleged in both cases that respondents have represented by labels and otherwise that the mattresses so sold and distributed are composed entirely of new material, when in truth and in fact said mattresses were composed of secondhand and used materials, such as cotton, cotton felt, cotton rags, jute, wool, woolen rags, and wool mattress ticking, all of which materials were secondhand, and in many instances filthy or unclean. It is further alleged that the said misbranding and misrepresentations of the contents of their mattresses tended to induce, and have induced, the purchase of respondents' products, to the injury of the public and of the competitors of respondents. Both respondents have answered, denying generally the allegations of the complaints. PURCHASE OF TESTIMONIALS OR ENDORSEMENTS Several complaints were issued during the fiscal year charging the respective respo ndents with the use in advertising of testimonials or endorsements for which substantial sums of money were paid or other valuable consideration given.70 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION In one case it is alleged that respondent paid to numerous prominent women sums ranging from $100 to $10,000 for such endorsements, together with consent for their use in advertising. Also, that other endorsements were obtained from screen and stage stars who received in return valuable publicity as a result of their use. It is alleged that such endorsements so secured are neither voluntary nor unbiased, and that their publication without revealing the means of their procurement implies to the purchasing public that they are given voluntarily, without consideration, and that they ex press the respective indorser's unbiased opinion, thus inducing the public to buy the products involved as the result of such erroneous beliefs, to the injury of competitors. Answers of respondents were duly filed. In them respondents admit the use of such endorsements as alleged but assert that all were bona fide and that the considerations involved were given to secure consen t for their use It is denied that the public is misled or that competitors are injured. Respondents further contend that the commission is without autho rity to act in the premises The commission has not yet decided what the future of these cases will be in view of the recent action of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, setting aside the commission's cease and desist order against Northam Warren Corporation in a similar case. In this latter case the commission has asked the Solicitor General to apply to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. MISREPRESENTATION OF CORRESPONDENCE-SCHOOL COURSES In May, 1932, the commission issued a complaint against two Chicago corporations and one individual who was the president and principal stockholder of the two corporations. The respondents were advertising for sale and selling correspondence courses of instruction. One of the courses was intended to impart information in the subject which was termed by the respondents as \"Pedopractic.\" This was represented as a course of instruction in drugless and nonsurgical methods for the alleviation and correction of foot ailments. The respondents asserted it was possible for their students to become foot specialists by taking this course. It was said further that such students could practice this science while they were still students and that a business could be built up which would pay them \"thousands yearly.\" Another course of instruction offered for sale and sold by respondents was physiotherapy or drugless healing. Similar representations were made regarding possibilities for lucrative returns in connection with the practice of this science.REPRESENTATIVE COMPLAINTS 71 In connecti on with both courses the respondents also represented that the money paid by students for either one of the courses would be refund ed in case they were dissatisfied. It is alleged in the complaint that the lucrative earnings held out to prospective students by respondents are neither always nor usually obtained by students of respondents' courses. It is further alleged that not only is it not possible in most States for students of respondents' courses to practice such sciences for pay while studying the course but that respondents' schools are not recognized schools within the meaning of statutes in most States providing for a licensing of various types of drugless healers, and that in most States a graduate of the respondents' schools would not be able to practice without first obtaining a license. It is further alleged in the complaint that the \"money-back agreement\" is not as represented by respondents in their advertising matter. MISREPRESENTATION OF PATENT MEDICINES A number of complaints were issued involving alleged misrepresentations of the remedial qualities or effects of so-called \"patent\" medicines and various appliances designed and represented to aid in correct ing different bodily conditions. One such involves a preparation described as a saline laxative, but which is represented and adverti sed as a treatment or remedy for obesity. It is alleged that said preparation is merely a laxative or diuretic. Respondent denies in its answer that it represents said preparation to be a cure or remedy for obesity, but alleges that it will reduce excess fat and that it is so represented in its advertisements. Respondent also denies that the commission has jurisdiction in the premises. RENOVATED HAT CASES The renovated hat cases mentioned in the annual report of the commission for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, were recently in course of trial and are expected soon to be brought on for final hearing before the commission. These cases involve the practice of respondents of buying secondhand, old, used, and discarded men's felt hats which are then dry-cleaned, steamed, ironed, and shaped by respondents. They are then relined and fitted with new ribbons, sweatband, and size labels. The new linings and sweatband bear various names and descriptions. The respondents sell these hats to jobbers, who in turn resell them to retailers, by whom they are sold to the public. It is charged that the hats are sold by respondents do not bear any marks or other indications that they are used hats which have been72 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION renovated and made over, and further that these hats are sold to the public by the retail dealers without the public being advised that the hats have been previously worn and renovated. Respondents vigorously deny that the practices charged constitute unfair methods of competition. During the present fiscal year seven additional complaints have been issued against various respondents engaged in the same line of business charging the same practices as described above. OTHER TYPES OF MISREPRESENTATION Other cases in which the commission during the year has issued complaints involving misrepresentation have ranged from mis-leading statements to actual fraud. These cases include a wide range of commodities and businesses, among which are alfalfa seed, automobile equipment , gasoline and kerosene, mirrors, mattresses, cigars, jewelry, silverware, cotton goods, rayon fabrics, radium, bay rum, groceries, umbre llas, cosmetics, wood rules, coffee, neckwear, lumber, paint, boiler nozzles, electric-lighting bulbs and fixtures, flour, cutlery, stationery, furs, candy, hosiery and lingerie, antiknock fluids, coal, yeast tablets, fountain pens, tooth paste, oleomargarine, proprietary medicines, flavoring extracts, malt syrup, correspondence courses, and stock and poultry remedies. FENDING CASES AT CLOSE OF YEAR At the end of the fiscal year 204 form al, public record cases involving charges of unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission act, were pending. Among the practices embrac ed in these cases were combinations and agreements to fix prices, suppress competition, and restrain trade, lottery schemes, commercial bribery, and various forms of misbranding and deceptive. representations. ORDERS TO CEASE AND DESIST SIXTY-THREE ORDERS ARE ISSUED IN FISCAL YEAR The commission issued orders to cease and desist in 63 cases during the year. As in past years, respondents upon whom the commission served its orders have, in a great many cases, accepted their terms and filed reports with the commission signifying compliance therewith. In some of the cases the respondents opposed the proceeding and probabl y will file petitions for review of the commission's findings and orders with the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal.ORDERS TO CEASE AND DESIST 73 The orders to cease and desist issued during the year are listed as follows: Orders to cease and desist issued during year [For details, see p. 171] Respondent Location Method of competition Alexander-Martin Co. et al Grand Rapids Representing ready-made clothing as tailor-made clothing; representing merchandise is given free of charge Aviation Institute of U.S.A.

REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS A number of represen tative cases resulting in orders to cease and desist issued during the fiscal year are described below. Unless otherwise indicated these orders pertain to violations of the Federal Trade Commission act. COERCIVE COMPETITIVE PRACTICES Waugh Equipment Co., Depew, N. Y.--The corporation respondent is a manufacturer of railroad equipment described as draft gears, which it sells to railroad companies foruse on freight cars to absorb the shock when the cars come together in switching and in the general operation of a train. The other respondents are individuals officially connected with Armour & Co., large Chicago meat packer, in charge of routing Armour products, who became associated with the Waugh Equip-REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 75 ment Co. in 1924 when they were given one-third of the promotion stock of that company (1,666 shares) as consideration for an agreement or understanding between them and the corporation, whereby these individual respondents would use their influence with railway traffic officials and, through them, the executive and purchasing departments, to obtain orders for draft gears for the Waugh Equipment Co. As alleged and found by the commission, the respondent corporation, cooperating with the individual responde nts pursuant to such agreement, was enabled to and did make substantial sales of Waugh draft gears during the last three or four years to leading railroad companies of the country, who were induced to purchase the Waugh gears in preference to the competitive gears because of the promises and assurances of Armour freight traffic to be shipped over their lines if they purchas ed the Waugh draft gears. The commission found that the effect of these practices leads to the injury of the public and competitors of the respondent corporation, because they unduly tended to suppress competition between the respondent and competing manufa cturers of draft gears and to create a monopoly in the respondent corporation in the sale and distribution of draft gears. The commission also found that the respondent, cooperating with. the individual respondents, had created and taken advantage of a competitive weapon, oppressive and coercive in nature, which prevented customers from exercising their free will and. judgment in determining which device is the most efficient, and had thus injected an element into the competitive field in which the respondent corporation was engaged which was unfair and abnormal, and tended to reduce the efficiency and economy in the production and sales methods of competing manufacturers by giving to that concern which controlled the largest volume of freight traffic an unfair advantage that would more than offset the higher efficiency in the production and sales methods of competing concerns which controlled no such traffic, and thus hindered and restrained the freedom of competition in the natural and customary channels of trade in the draft- gear industry. An appropriate order was entered against the respondent corporation and two of the individual respondents. ACQUISITION OF COMPETITORS BY HOLDING COMPANY Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Co. (Inc.) and others, Hart ford, Conn . (Clayton Act, section 7).--The respondent was organized as a holding company October 6, 1927, to acquire the voting stocks of two large manufacturers of electrical wiring devices, namely, Arrow76 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Electric Co. and Hart & Hegeman Manufacturing Co., both situated at Hartford, Conn., with a nation-wide distribution of a full line of products. As a result of the acquisit ion, the original respondent in the case, Arrow-Hart & Hegeman (Inc.) became the largest producer of electrical wiring devices in the United States and all competition which had theretofore existed between the two operating companies was eliminated. The commission issued its complaint against the Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Co. (Inc.) in March, 1928, and hearings were held before the board of review during that year. On September 7, 1928, answer was filed by the original respondent. Before testimony was taken in support of the charges of the complaint, namely, on November 10, 1928, preliminary steps were taken by the original respondent to distribute to its stockholders its assets, which consisted of the capital stocks of the two operating companies, so as to merge the two operating companies under he laws of the State of Connecticut. On November 30, 1928, the plan was changed somewhat to avoid a violation of the Federal income tax law and two new holding companies were organized, to which were assigne d the capital stocks of the two operating companies, following which transaction the original respondent was dissolved, and the two operating companies and the two new holding companies were merged under the laws of the State of Connecticut on or about December 31, 1928, forming a new corporation, the Arrow- Hart & Hegeman Electric Co., which was. later joined in the supplemental complaint served by the commission in June, 1929. The new respondent answered the supplemental complaint in October, 1929, and subsequent to that date testimony was taken in support of the charges of the complaint and also in support of the defense of the respondents. The commission, in its findings as to the facts, found that the course of action of the original respondent in organiz ing the new respondent, was not taken to restore the competition which had previously existed between the two operating companies, but was in part to avoid a claim for income tax by the United States Treasury Department, and in part to evade the provisions of sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act, and to perpetuate the elimination of all competition betwee n the two operating companies. It was also found that the effect of the acquisition of the original respondent of the common stocks of the Arrow Electric Co. and the Hart & Hegeman Manufacturing Co., the two operating companies involved, had been, was, and may be to substantially lessen competition between those two companies in the sale and distribution of electrical wiring devices in. intersta te commerce, and to restrain such commerce in those sections.REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 77 and communities where the two operating companies were engaged in business, and, finally, to tend to create a monopoly in the electrical wiring devices industry. It was further found that the effect of the organization of the new respondent and the acquisition by it through merger of the voting stocks and assets of the two operating companies named had been, was, and may be to substantially lessen competition between the two operating companies named, in the sale and distribution of electrical wiring devices in interstate commerce, and to restrain such commerce in the communities where the two companies were engaged in business and to tend to create a monopoly in the new respondent in the electrical wiring devices industry. The conclusion of the commission was that acquisition by the original respondent of the voting stocks of Hart & Hegeman Manufacturing Co. and the Arrow Electric Co., and the continued owne rship and voting of such stocks were culminated in the organization of the new respondent under the conditions and circumstances described in the findings constituted a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. Appropriate order was served upon the new respondent requiring it to divest itself of the capital stock and assets, which, according to the view s of a majority of the commis sion, it had illegally acquired (Commissioner Humphrey dissenting). The respondent has petitioned the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to set aside the commission's order and the case is pending in that court. PRICE-FIXING COMBINATIONS Machine Tool Distributors, Chicago District, Chicago - Machine Tool Distributors, Chicago District , is an association of manufacturers and dealers in machine tools situated in the Chicago territory. Some of the members are representatives of manufacturers located in other parts of the United States but who sell in the Chicago territory. The respondent association was formed on or about October 1, 1928, and includes between 85 and 90 per cent of the concerns engaged in the sale of machine tools in the Chicago district. It has been customary for many of the members of the respondent association to accept used machinery in part payment of the purchase price of new machinery sold by them. In its findings of fact based upon testimony taken before an examiner the commission found the association members had, on or about October 1, 1928, adopted the \"Chic ago appraisal plan\" governing the allowance to be made for used or old machinery, which had the effect and result of restricting, restraining, and suppressing78 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION competition between the members of respondent association in the purchase and sale of used or old machines which are offered in part payment on a new machine and in the purchase and sale of new machines, the said purchasers being deprived of the free and open competitive market for their used or old machines. The commission found that the members of the association were required under the Chicago appraisal plan to file with its central office all appraisals or bids made on said used or secondhand machiner y offered as part payment for new machinery and that whenever a member is offered used or old machinery he is required to call the central office and ascertain whether there is an appraisal on file. The appraised amount so registered by the member is required to be a firm cash offer and if any member of the association desires to raise an appraisal price made by any other member he shall notify the central office and file said raised appraisal which also is required to be a firm cash offer. The central office, on receiving a raised appraisal price on any used or old mach ine, notifies all other members and neither the member first raising the appraisal price nor any other member may advise the purchaser of the raised price until 11 o'clock in the morning of the next working day, if the member making the raised appraisal is situated in Chicago, or until 11 o'clock of the second working day if the member is situated outside of Chicago. If there have been one or more increases made in the appraisal price, then the member making the last increase shall purchase the used machine at that price regardless of whoever shall secure the order for the new machine. The commission further found that the provision in the Chicago appraisal plan requiring each member to make a firm bid or offer on all used machinery and if it filed a raised appraisal or bid to purchase such used machinery at the price offered regardless of who se cured the new business, operates as a penalty upon the members of the association and tends to restrict and restrain them from raising the price allowed by them for used or secondhand machinery offered by customers as part payment for new machinery. Appropriate order requiring respo ndents to cease and desist the use of the said Chicago appraisal plan containing the objectionable features described was entered by the commission. RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE Helena Rubinstein (Inc.), New York.-- As alleged and found by the commission, this respondent enforced a merchandising system adopted by it for the maintenance by its dealers, consisting of retailers, and to some extent of wholesalers, of uniform prices fixed by the respondent to be charged by the dealers in the resale of the prod-REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 79 ucts manufactured by respondent consisting of toilet preparations and cosmetics. It was alleged and found by the commissi on that the respondent accomplished its purpose of bringing about uniform prices in the resale of its products by dealers by fixing uniform prices for the resale of its products and entering into contracts, agreements, and understandings with its dealers for the maintenance of such prices. The commission found that the effect and results of the practices used by respondent were to suppress competition among dealers in the products manufactured by respondent and to deprive the purchasing public of the advantages in price which they would otherwise obtain from the natural and unrestricted flow of commerce. An appropriate order was entered. LOTTERY DEVICES Candy lotteries.--R. F. Keppel & Bro. (Inc.), Lancaster, Pa., the respondent, manufactures candy which it sells in interstate commerce to wholesalers, jobbers, and retailers throughout the United States. It was charged in the complaint that respondent corporation sold to and placed in the hands of retailers, directly or through wholesalers or jobbers, candy so packed and assembled by it as to bring about its sale to the general public by means of lottery, gaming devices, or gift enterprises. The respondent filed its answer, evidence was taken, and a final hearing had before the commissio n, after which detailed findings of fact were made in which the commission found, among other things: That certain of the candies sold and distribute by respondent were packed in boxes containing 120 pieces each for retail at 1 cent apiece, and that in each of 4 of the pieces of candy 1 cent was concealed, while the other 116 pieces contained no coin; that respondent also packed and distributed for retail sale boxes containing 60 pieces each of chocolate peanut bars, of uniform size and quality, and inclosed within the wrapper of said bars a slip of paper showing the price of the said bar as 1, 2, or 3 cents (10 of said bars having slips showing their price to be 1 cent each, 10 having slips showing their price to be 2 cents each, and 40 having slips showing their price to be 3 cents each); and that purchasers of the chocolate peanut bars pay 1, 2, or 3 cents, as the case may be, for identical bars of candy, such prices not being disclosed to the purchasers until after the candies are unwrapped and the slips exposed; that other packages of candy made and distributed by respondent contain 200 small chocolate- cream candies and 20 other pieces of chocolate candy, said 20 pieces being molded into the shapes of boys or girls80 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION or twins, and also containing a box called a \"School Companion,\" holding five lead pencils, a pen and penholder, a 6-inch ruler, and two erasers; that of the 200 chocolate- cream candies of uniform size and shape, 16 have pink centers, 4 have chocolate centers, and 180 have white centers, and that the purchaser, buying a chocolate-cream candy having a pink center receives, in addition to said chocolate-cream candy and at no additional cost, one of the chocolate boys or girls; if he procures a chocolate-cream candy with a chocolate center, he receives, at no additional cost, one of the chocolate twins, and if he buys the last piece of chocolate-cream candy in the package, he receives at no additional cost, the \"School Companion,\" while, if he purchases any one of the 180 pieces of the chocolate-cream candy with a white center, he receives no additional prize or premium. The commission further found that purchasers of respondent's candies are principally children, who purchase them for the gaming or lottery feature; and that use of the lottery or gaming feature is aga inst the public policy of many of the several States of the Union, as well as to the prejudice and injury of the public and of the respondent's competitors. Accordingly, an order was issued directing the respondent to cease and desist from: Selling and distributing to jobbers and wholesale dealers for resale to retail dealers, or to retail dealers direct, candy so packed and assembled that sales of such candy to the general public are by means of a lottery, gaming device, or gift enterprise, and from furnishing to wholesale dealers, jobbers, and retail dealers, candies packed and assembled in any way so as to be sold as a lottery or gaming device, or from furnishing representat ions, display cards, or other printed matter to be used by the retailers in selling candy in any similar manner. R. F. Keppel & Bro. (Inc.) has filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit asking that the commission's order be set aside. 4 SUBSCRIPTION BOOK COMPANIES Standard Education Society, Standard Encyclopedia Corporation, H. M. Stanford, W. H. Ward, and A. J. Greener, Chicago .--The commission issued a complaint February 25, 1929, against the Standard Education Society and H. M. Stanford; charging them with various representati ons in connection with the sale of a set of books known as the Standard Reference Work. 4 See p. 99.REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 81 It was charged they had represented by circular letters and through agents that the books would be given away free to certai n picked persons, and that a loose-leaf extens ion service supplied for the purpose of keeping each encyclopedia up to date would be furnished the recipients of these free sets on the same terms as the extension service was furnished to purchasers of the respondent's encyclopedia. It was alleged in the complaint that the encyclopedias were not given away free, but the price quoted for the extension service included the rice of the entire set of books. The respondents were also charged with having used unauthorized testimonials and with having published and sold the Standard Reference Work under more than one name. Testimony was taken in support of the complaint and the case on behalf of the commission was rested when it was ascertai ned that the respondent, Standard Education Society, was in the process of closing out its business, the stockholders thereof having formed another corporation, the Standard Encyclopedia Corporation, which was engaged in selling a revision of the old Standard Reference Work. A supplemental complaint was issued in which these facts were set forth, in which the Standard Education Society, Standard Encyclopedia Corporation, H. M. Stanford, W. H. Ward, and A. J. Greener were charged with using substantially the same methods of competition as those set forth in the original complaint. The three individuals were alleged to be the owners of the two respondent corporations. Testimony in support of the supplemental complaint was received and the case submitted to the commission which issued its findings as to the facts and directed the five respondents to cease and desist from (1) advertising or representing in any manner to purchasers or prospective purchasers that any books or set of books offered for sale and sold by them will be given free of cost to purchasers or prospective purchasers, when such is not the fact; (2) advertising or representing in any manner that a certain number of sets or any set of books offered for sale or sold by them has been reserved to be given away free of cost to selected persons as a means of advertising, or for any other purpose, when such is not the fact; (3) advertising or representing in any manner that purchasers or prospective purchasers of respondents' publications are only buying or paying for loose-leaf supplements intended to keep the set of books up to date for a period of 10 years, when such is not the fact; (4) advertising or representing in any manner that respondents' publication is a recently completed, new, and up-to-date encyclopedia, when such is not the fact; (5) selling or offering for sale any set of82 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION books of the same text and content material under more than one name or title; (6) advertising or representing in any manner that the usual price at which respondents' publications are sold is higher than the price at which they are offered in such advertisements or representations, when such is not the fact; (7) advertising or repre- senting any person as a contributor to or editor of any set of books or publications who has not performed services in making or preparing contributions to or who has not performed services in the editing of such books or publications and consented that he may be held out to the public as a contributor or as an editor or assistant editor; (8) advertising or representing that any person has given testimonials or recommendations for and concerning respondents' publications, when such is not the fact; (9) publishing or causing to be published and circulated testimonials or recommendations of, and concerning respondents' publications alleged to have been made by any persons when such testimonials or recommendations have not been so made. FALSE AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING Bailey Radium Laboratories (Inc.) and William J. A. Bailey, East Orange, N. J.-- These respondents manufactured and offered for sale a water which had been treated with radium and mesothorium. The water was intended for internal use. In each 2- ounce bottle of water (which constituted a dose) the respondents had suspended in solution 1 microgram of radium and 1 microgram of mesothorium (a microgram is one- millionth of a gram). This water, termed \"Radithor\" by respondents, was represented by them as being a treatmen t or cure for more than 160 conditions or symptoms ranging alphabetically from acidosis to wrinkles and included high blood pressure; arthritis, sexual decline, eczema, nausea, indigestion, pneumonia, psychosis, and pyorrhea. The complaint alleged that not only was the respondents' product valueless in treating these conditions or symptoms, but that the use of radium internally was dangerous. In support of this latter allegation of the complaint, a witness testified that he had taken some 1,300 bottles of Radithor. At the time of his testimony he was suffering from a pronounced necrosis of the jaw. His physician testified that this necrosis was caused by radium poisoning. This witness subsequ ently died from conditions induced by the radium poisoning. Subsequent to the taking of this testimony the respondents filed a motion with the commission in which they requested that their answer to the complaint be withdrawn. Respondents stated in this motion that they would refrain from contesting the proceeding.REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 83 Thereafter, in accordance with the rules of the commission, a cease and desist order was issued without findings as to the facts. By this order the respondents were directed to cease and desist from various representations theretofore made by them as to the therapeutic value of Radithor and from representing that the product Radithor is harmless. MISDESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT Lenape Hydraulic Pressing and Forging Co., Lenape, Pa--The order forbids this corporation to advertise its boiler nozzles in a way which would represent or imply that such nozzles are made in one piece instead of two pieces as they are in fact made. Specific statements prohibited, unless used with explanatory matter, are the following: A solid seamless wall against steam and gasket. By adopting the Lenape Forged Steel Nozzle you are assured that the steam will come in contact with a ONE-PIECE SOLID WAIL. It is further provided that diagrams of such 2-piece nozzles indicating solid construction, such as crosshatching running in the same direction, shall not be used unless accompanied by explanatory matter setting forth that such nozzles are made in two pieces. MISBRANDING ALFALFA SEED--ORIGIN, INSPECTION, AND PEDIGREE Dakota Alfalfa Growers, Mitchell , S. Dak.-- Respondents, Mac-Donald T. and Walter T. Greene, trading under the above name, were engaged in the purchase and resale of varieties of alfalfa seed known as Grimm, Cossack, and Common (Dakota No.12), from a cooperative growing association. They referred to their trade-mark registration in such manner as to mislead prospective purchasers into the belief that the seed was of an origin inspected, verified, and certified to by a Federal seed inspector; misrepresented the bags of seed as being shipped directly from the place of production to the purchaser with but one profit; misrepresented that the seed had been grown in fields of virgin Dakota soil specially selected because of its quality, purity of variety, pedigree, freedom from noxious weeds, and hardiness. Because of the importance of maintaining and improving the pedigree of such alfalfa seed the producers thereof in the various States, through crop improvements associations, had, for a number of years prior to the use thereof by respondents, attached blue and red tags to the bagged seed, which colored tags, from extensive use, had come to indicate to the purchaser the highest and next highest quality alfalfa seed of then Grimm or Cossack varieties exclusively.84 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION together with inspection and certification of origin under State supervision. Respondents were using in similar manner the tags of the identical colors which, when distributed by them in interstate commerce in territory coextensive with that of their competitors resulted in misleading prospective purchasers as to the quality, purity of variety and certification as to source. Respondents' blue and red tags were by them indiscriminately applied to Grimm, Cossack, or Dakota No.12 (Common) alfalfa seed, all to the prejudice of the public respondents' competitors. To the charges in the complaint respondents filed a pleading waiving further procedure and consenting that the commission might make, enter and serve upon them an order to cease and desist from the violations of law alleged. The order directed respondents, in the sale and distribution of alfalfa seed in interstate commerce, to cease and desist from using the above methods, and particularly-- From attaching to the bags or sacks, In which said seed is so packed, distributed, and sold, tags of the Identical shade of blue or red which through extensive use have come to and do indicate to the purchaser that said bags and sacks contain the highest and next highest quality of alfalfa seed of the Grimm or Cossack varieties together with inspection and certification of origin under State supervision, when such bags or sacks do not contain, respectively, the highest and next highest quality of alfalfa seed of said varieties and have not been inspected and certified under State supervision as to origin and do contain alfalfa seed known as Dakota No.12 (Common), unless and until respondents, in conspicuous printing on said tags clearly and truly inform the purchasers and prospective purchasers of the actual varieti es of said seed therein contained and that the origin and inspection have not been certified to under State supervision. UNFAIR COMPETITION IN THE SALE OF HAIR DYE Inecto (Inc.), New York.-- The order to cease and desist issued against this corporation prohibits the use of false and deceptive representations in promoting and effecting the interstate sale and distribution of a hair dye or hair coloring manufactured by the company and designated \"Inecto Rapid Notox.\" Represented to be the largest manufacturer of hair coloring in the world, the respondent corporation promoted the sale of the produ ct, national advertising expenditures running at times as high as $300,000 a year. The dye was sold for home use through drug stores, department stores, hairdressing establishments and other dealers, and direct by mail order. It was also sold for use by beauty parlors and hairdressers throughout the country for the treatment or coloring of the hair of their patrons. In addition to applying the word \"Notox\" to the product, the respondent promoted its purchase and use by the trade and con-REPRESENTATIVE CASES RESULTING IN ORDERS 85 suming public on numerous representations to the effect that the dye is nontoxic, safe, and harmless, without any poisonous or toxic ingredients, and that it will not produce or cause any harmful or deleterious effects upon the body or scalp; that no instances of harmful or deleterious effects have arisen or been reported. After trial and hearing the commission entered findings of fact covering the case. It found that such representations were false, misleading, and deceptive and that the dye is in fact a dangerously toxic, deleterious, and harmful product containing a toxic dye base and poisonous and injurious ingredients or properti es; that in its use and application to dyeing or coloring of the human hair it is not safe or harmless and that in many instances it has caused and produced toxic, deleterious, and harmful physical effects upon the Scalp and other parts of the body of users, including irritation and toxic poisoning of the scalp. The corporation also disseminated as trade promotional literature a large number of testimonials or endorsements purporting to be written statements by users or patrons praising and commending the respondent's brand of hair dye. Upon the evidence, the commission found that practically all of such testimonials or endorsements were false and as used by respondent had the capacity and tendency to mislead and deceive the purchasing public into the erroneous belief that they were genuine unsolicited testimonials or endorsements of its brand of hair dye received by respondent from patrons or users thereof. The commission also found that the tendency and effect of the false and deceptive practices of the corporation were to injure the public and the business of competitors; and that such misrepresentations operated as an unfair competitive advantage to the corporation and a detriment to and burden upon the legitimate hair-dye manufacturing and marketing industry in this country. Upon concluding that the practices constituted an unfair method of competition in violation of the statute, the false representations were prohibited in the order to cease and desist (Commissioner Humphrey dissenting). The respondent denie d most of the material, allegations of the complaint and vigorously contested the case. At this writing it is not known whether the respondent will petition the courts to review and set aside the commission's order. SELLING READY-MADE CLOTHES BY MEANS OF FALSE AND MISLEADING REPRESENTATIONS United Tailoring Co., Curtis Clothing Corporation, New York.-- Victor Klein, Herbert Klein, and Arthur Klein conducted their86 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION business through United Tailoring Co., and Curtis Clothing Corporation, owned and controlled by them, and under the trade name Continental Tailoring Co. The complaint charge d that respondents sold men's clothes in interstate commerce by representing them as tailor-made or made to order, out of cloth selected by the purchasers, altered or fitted at branch places of business, which, purchasers were assured, would be established by respondents in their particular communities. It was charged respondents represented that they were offering two suits at the price of one in order to introduce their business in such communities. Respondents answered denying charges of the complaint. Testimony and evidence were received; and after final hearing, the coin-mission found that respondents were not selling clothes tailor-made or made to order, or clothes made out of cloth selected by purchasers, but that clothes sold by respondents were ready-made clothes, which, practically in every instance covered by the evidence, were misfits, sometimes so much as to appear grotesque when worn, or attempted to be worn, by the purchasers. The clothes were made out of inferior cloth, cheaper than that selected by the purchasers. No branch places of business were established or opened by respondents. in any of the communities in which their clothes were sold under such representations. Accordingly, an order was issued directing respondents to cease and desist from offering for sale or selling, in interstate commerce, their clothes by representing, directly or indirectly, that they would be tailor-made, in accordance with the measurements of individual. purchasers; and fitted or altered at places of business to be established in the solicited localities by respondent, or from offering two suits for the price of one, unless such were the facts.

COURT CASES MATTERS IN WHICH ACTION WAS TAKEN ARE PRESENTED The number of court proceedings in which the Federal Trade Com-mission has been involved during the year, as well as a cumulative showing of this work throughout the commission's life, will be found in the statistical table s on pages 120 to 125 of this report.COURT CASES 91 Cases pending in the Federal courts during the year, in connection with which action was taken, are described as follows in alphabetical order: 6 Consolidated Book Publishers (Inc.), Chicago, engaged in the sale and distribution throughout the United States of set of books at retail under the name \"New World Wide Cyclopedia,\" and of the same set of books at wholesale under the name of \"The Times Encyclopedia and Gazetteer,\" on July 10, 1930, filed with the Seventh Circuit ( Chicago ) its petition to review the commission's order, which directed it to cease and desist from- (1)Selling or offering for sale, either at wholesale or retail, any set of books of the same text and content material under more than one name or title the same time.

Second Circuit, etc.92 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (8)Advertising of representing in any manner that its set of books is a new and up-to- date encyclopedia, when such is not the fact. Petitioner's brief was filed January 24, 1931, that of the commission March 9, and reply brief for petitioner March 17. The case was argued April 23. On July 8, the court, at the instance of the commission, entered an order granting leave to adduce additional evidence, allowing 90 days for this purpose. The application of the commission which resulted in this order was made as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Raladam case, referred to subsequen tly in this report. The additional evidence in question was taken during August; on October 2, 1931, the commission made supplemental findings of fact, which were certified to the court. These concerned the general effect of the methods employed by the Consolidated Corporation on the business of its competitors, and were based upon the additional evidence above refer red to. Both sides filed supplemental briefs; and the case was decided in favor of the commission, November 25, 1931 (53 F. (2d) 942). During the course of its opinion, the court said: The question presented to us is wheth er or not the facts and the law war-ranted the Federal Trade Commissi on in making the \" cease and desist\" order. We think the commission acted within the scope of its authority, and was abundantly justified by the facts. A close analysis of the contract convinces us that it was drawn by experienced hands and with the obvious intention of perpetrating a fraud upon the subscribing public. A mind trained in the law might well conclude that few rights, and less benefit, moved to the subscriber by virtue of the contract, and that under a technical construction of it no gift was intended. But the general public, not skilled in legal construction, upon reading the lead letter and contract would very naturally conclude that the books constituted a gift, and in our judgment this is what petitioner wanted them to think. This is essentially true, for if all the facts were known to the subscriber, be, if only of ordinary intelligence, in all probability would have declined the offer because the cyclopedia was neither new, up to date, nor accurate. It is quite obvious that it would not sell on its merits. A fair construction of the lead letter is that petitioner was distributing, as an advertising medium, a few sets in each community free to certain influential people, in consideration of their acting as local references to other unpreferred subscribers; and that, on account of his standing in his community, a free set was being held by petitioner for the person receiving such letter. This view is confirmed by the fact that the letter asks the receiver of it to treat it as personal and confidential. This was quite an unnecessary statement if petitioner was in good faith, for it no doubt would have permitted any person to sign the contract. This interpretation of the letter is further con-firmed by the fact that petitioner's sales agent, Mrs. Cowherd, construed it the same way. Of course petitioner contents that the agent exceeded her authority, and that it should be protected against the dishonest and unscrupulous agent; but we think the agent made no representation which was not warranted by the letter and contract. If the agent did exceed her authority, it does notCOURT CASES 93 comes with good grace from petitioner, who instituted the fraud, to abuse and bemean the agents for continuing the fraud which petitioner had started * * * * * * * The following propositions of law fully support the ruling: False and misleading representations resulting in deception of the public are matters of public interest which the commission has power to prevent. * * * * * * * The commission's jurisdiction is not limited to practices which tend to create a monopoly, but embraces false and fraudulent advertising, misbranding, and other practices which result in deceiving the public. Such practices injure competitors who do not use them. * * * * * * * The sale at the same time of a cyclopedia under two different names is an unfair method of competition. * * * * * * * Practices opposed to good morals because characterized by deception, bad faith, fraud, and oppression are unfair methods of competition. Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz et al., 253 U. S. 421.) On December 14, the Consolidated Book Publishers petitioned the court for a rehearing. The commission filed its answer December 26, and, on December 31, 1931, the court overruled the petition. As the opinion is short and has a bearing on the Raladam case (referred to hereinafter in this report), it is reproduced in full be low (53 F. (2d) 942) Sparks , Circuit Judge. Petitioner in its petition for a rehearing has called our attention to the fact that this court has not referred to nor commented upon the additional evidence taken on respondent's motion since the argument of the cause, relative to competition with and resulting injury to other concerns engaged in the same line of business; and it further contends that this court failed to consider Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Go. 283 U. S. 643, decided after the argument in this cause. Petitioner bases its right to a rehearing upon the following grounds: (a) The commission has failed to show the existence of competition between petitioner and the traders who it claims were Injured; (b) competitors were not Injured by any acts of petitioner; (c) competitors used methods the same as, or substantially similar to, those employed by petitioner. These matters were fully presented to this court and argued prior to the taking of additional testimony as referred to above; and the pendency of the Raladam case in the Supreme Court was also called to our attention. When that case was decided by the Supreme Court and the opinion was published it was considered by this court. Subsequently, when respondent asked permission to take, additional testimony, as above referred to, a part of the membership of this court thought that the evidence then in the record was sufficient to support the finding of the commission to the effect that there was competition and resulting injury; and also that the Raladam case was not controlling in the instant case because the facts of that case showed neither competition nor injury. Out of abundance of precaution, however, the court permitted the additional evidence to be taken, after which the commission found the existence of both competition and resulting injury to such competitors.94 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION It may be also stated that petitioner, in its answer to respondent's original complaint, admitted that it was in competition with various other persons, partnerships, and corporations similarly engaged. From a perusal of all the evidence, including the additional testimony given, it is quite apparent that the commission's findings are supported by material and competent evidence with respect to competiti on and resulting injury to competitors. It is true the injury shown is not expressed in specific terms of money, but this we do not regard as necessary. The statement of petitioner that the competitors are guilty of the same or similar methods as those charged to petitioner is not supported by the evidence. The Consolidated Corporation, March 31, 1932, filed with the Supreme Court of the United States its petition for writ of certiorari. A brief, on behalf of the commission, in opposition to the petition, was filed May 2, and the case was formally submitted to the court on that day. On May 16, 1932, the petition for certiorari was denied. The effect of this is that the decision of the Seventh Circuit, of November 25, 1931, sustaining the commission's order in every particular, stands (286 U.S. 553). Electric Bond Share Co., New York.-- The commission, Decemb er 1, 1928, filed, in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, its application for an order requiring certain officers and employees of this company to produce certain records and answer certain questions incident to the investigation being conducted by the commission pursuant to Senate Resolution 83, directing the commission to investigate and report upon the financial and business structure of the electric power and gas industry, the policies and practices of holding companies and their affiliated companies, their alleged efforts' to control public opinion on account of public or municipal ownership, and whether any of the conditions disclosed constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. The objections raised by counsel for the comp any to administering the oath and interrogation of the witnesses put in issue the fundamental question of the commission's power to issue subpoenas in the investigation directed by the Senate, whet her the Electric Bond & Share Co. was engaged in inter state commerce, and whether the attempt to subpoena the records was a violation of the const itutional prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. The case was argued before Judge, Knox February' 16, 1929. The commission, March 9, 1929, submitted a written offer of additional proof on the issues of fact it claimed were made by the application and answer. Briefs on behalf of the commission and respondents were filed March 9 and 22, 1929, respectively, and the commission's reply brief April 2, 1929. The court, July 18, 1929, handed down its opinion. (34 F. (2d) 323.) Briefly, the objections of the company to the commission'sCOURT CASES 95 subpoenas duces tecum were sustained, and those that were interposed to the pertinent and competent questions propounded to the individual witnesses by counsel for the commission were overruled. The court assumed that the company, in part, at least, was engaged in interstate commerce, saying, in this connection: If respondents wish to contest the propriety of this assumption, the matter will have to go to a master; or, if petitioner (Federal Trade Commission) wishes an adjudication to the effect that the intrastate business of the Electric Bond & Share Co. is so ointimately associated and connected with interstate commerce that all the company's activiti es are subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, a reference will be required to establish the fact. Both parties, desiring to take advantage of the opportunity thus affor ded by the court, agreed to the appointment of a master, who was duly appointed January 7, 1930. In the meantime, however, the parties came to an agreement upon the facts, a stipulation to this effect having been signed October 28, 1931, and filed with the court November 4. The commission's brief was filed December 18, and that of the company January 21, 1932. The case was argued on its merits January 21, 1932. On August 19, 1932 the court handed down its second opinion (not yet reported). After discussing the previous decision, the court refers to the matter, of subpoenas duces tecum in the following language: At the outset, notice should be taken that petitioner once more urges me to uphold the duces tecum subpoenas heretofore considered. That issue has gone against petitioner, and whatever inferences are here to be drawn from facts not previously before the court, they can not, retroactively, give vigor, to process already found to have been without vitality. The court then proceeds to an analysis of the relationships existing between the company and its subsidiaries, concluding-- that, in handling transactions of great volume and high value, Electric Bond & Share Co. was a ruling agent and actively participated in the interstate movement of commerce. But, irrespective of all that has been said, Electric Bond & Share Co. insists that it is outside any and all jurisdic tion of the Federal Trade Commission. In this, is the company right or wrong? If realities, rather than artificialities are determinative of the question, it is my belief that the company is wrong. It then demonstrates, by citations to decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, the error of the company's position, summarizing the situation in these words: At this point, note should be taken of the fact that, in the cases Just discussed, the Congress had not specifically undertaken to exercise supervision Or control over the matters which were there under review. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court believed them to be within the protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution. In the case at bar, the Congress has taken a step of affirmative character, even though it has not yet chosen definitely to regulate holding com-96 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION panies which, through intercorporate networks, control the destinies of subsidiary operating companies doing interstate business. In other words, it has enacted section 6-a of the Federal Trade Commission statute. Unequivocally, the Federal Trade Commission was vested with power \"to gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, pract ices, and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, excepting banks and common carriers subject to the act to regulate commerce, and its relation to other corporations and to individuals, associations, and partnerships.\" This enactment, at the very least, requires a conclusion that a corporation, whose activities are such as to give it the protection of the comme rce clause under the decisions set forth above, should not be held to be beyond the reach or the commission's authority. Continuing, the court says: But, say respondents, since the jurisdiction, of the commission is limited to interstate commerce, the intrastate business and affairs of Electric Bond & Share Co. are outside of the commission's authority, even though concession should be made that the company, as to some matters, engaged in interstate trade. If intrastate trade could definitely be separated from that which is interstate, I should agree. For example, if the company, charged its subsidiaries a specified fee for services rendered in connection with the purchase of apparatus and materials, it might well be that the investigation of the commission should be limited to inquiries relevant to the reasonableness of such charges as were made upon this account. Such, however, is not the method of operation. The parent company makes a blanket charge for substantially all of its services, and this is based upon certain percentages of the gross earnings of the subsidiaries. The reasonableness of this charge can not be ascertained merely by inquiring into the cost of rendering the purchasing services. The cost of rendering other services for which a fee is charged must also be determined, because they are inextricably involved with the cost of work having to do with interstate activity. The commission's jurisdiction must extend, therefore, to all services, for which a fee covering an interstate activity is charged. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., 224 U.S. 194. * * * * * * * By virtue of the control which respondent exercised over the subsidiary operating companies, it had a direct effect upon all their business, including that in interstate commerce. The power of the National Government over interstate commerce has been held to extend not only to activities which may be formerly denominated subjects of interstate commerce, but to acts which in fact affect that commerce. * * * * * * * It follows that the commerce power, in the exercise of which Congress enacted the Federal, Trade Commission act, is indubitably broad enough to comprehend the acts of respondent which have been shown to affect interstate commerce and, in the light of the foregoing decisions, it would seem clear that respondent is \"engaged in commerce\" within the meaning of that act. The manner in which the affair s of the operating companies having to do with interstate commerce are affected by Electric Bond & Share Co., as well as its own activities in the purchase and shipment of materials and equipment in interstate commerce,\" are quite sufficient to bring respondent within the investigatory authority of the Federal Trade Commission.COURT CASES 97 Accordingly, an order will be entered directing the individual respondents to answer all questions relating to the cost to Electric Bond & Share Co., of such services as it renders the operating companies in return for the payment of a fee based upon their gross earnings; to the cost of rendering purchasing services which result in interstate movements of materials, apparatus, and supplies to or from any of its subsidiaries, for which a separate fee is charged; and to the cost of rendering any services to subsidiary companies engaged in the interstate transmission of electricity or gas, for which a separate fee is charged. Everitt & Graf, Milwaukee.-- The commission, June 15, 1931, filed with the Seventh Circuit (Chica go) an application for the enforcement of its order in this case, which directed the respondent, a Wisconsin corporation, with its factory and principal place of business situated in Milwaukee, to cease and desist-- from using, directly or indirectly, the word \"California\" in trade-marks, labels, or brands stamped on linings of women's hats or containers in which said hats are sold, offered for sale, delivered, or shipped in interstate commerce, and/or advertising or re presenting, either directly or indirectly, by causing retail dealer customers to so advertise or represent, either on display cards, counter cards, advertisements inserted in newspapers, trade and fashion magazines, or in any other manner, advertising representing or designating its said hats as being manufactured in California unless and until said hats are actually manufactured in the State of California. The findings were to the effect that respondent sold its Wisconsin made hats (in competition with a large number of manufacturers of women's hats situated in California, and selling their product under the name of \"California Sports Hat\") under the trade name and style of \"California Sport Hat.\" Subsequent to the filing of the application for enforcement, Everitt & Graf filed with the commission a supplemental report, which the commission accepted as being in compliance with its order, conditional on further information as to continued compliance. As a result of this step the court, February 6, 1932, on joint petitions of the parties, suspended proceedings for the time being. A supple mental investigation having shown respondent's good faith in com plying with the order, the commission, on July 8, 1932, withdrew its application for enforcement, without prejudice. Flynn & Emrich Co., Baltimore , engaged in the manufacture and sale of stokers, grates, and coal-feeding mechanisms, with principal office and place of business in Baltimore, filed with the Fourth Circuit (Richmond) February 7, 1931, its petition to review the com mission's order entered December 20 1930. The findings were to the effect that the respondent, through its salesmen, was in bad faith threatening concerns installi ng stokers manufactured by a competitor with infringem ent suits, when, as a matter of fact, at the time the threats were made, respondent had98 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION not determi ned to bring any suit, and had not brought such suit at the time the commission issued its complaint. Brief for the petitioner was filed May 9, and that for the commission June 6. The case was argued June 25 (the court sitting at Asheville, N. C.), and decided adversely to the commission on October 12, 1931 (52 F. (2d) 836). Pertinent extracts from the decision follow: An examination of the record in this case fails to disclose any testimony to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the petitioner. Good faith is always presumed until the contrary is shown by proof. Here the petitioner, in claiming infringement, did only what its officers undoubtedly thought they had a perfect right to do and what they had been advised to do by their attorneys, who were clearly acting in perfect good faith. There was certainly no more wrong involved in petitioner's threat to sue the Perfection Company for infringement of their patents than there was in the act of the Perfection Company in threatening to sue to enjoin the petitioner and not doing it. A reading of the record leads to the inevitable conclusion that in doing what they did officers of petitioner did only what they thought, and were advised, they had a right to do to protect their legitimate interests. The reason given for the fact that no suit was brought was certainly a logical and reasonable one. * * * * * * * We are again confronted with what we consider an error of the commission, as, there was no public interest involved. The testimony shows that the only competitor involved was the Perfection Comp any. Only five purchasers of stokers were approached by petitioner's salesmen, and not one of these was prevented from purchasing the Perfection Company's appliance. There is no evidence, or even contention, that petitioner's stoker was in any way inferior to the Perfection Company's stoker, or that any attempt was being made to impose upon the public by the sale of an inferior article. The courts have uniformly held that parties claiming infringement without suing and in bad faith can be enjoined from continuing such a course. * * * * * * * The case here is rather a controversy of a private and personal nature between the petitioner and the Perfection Company, and could have been readily se tied the courts, and if a proper case were made an injunction would have issued against the petitioner. Application for certiorari was not made in this case. Hughes, E. Griffiths (Inc.), Rochester, N. Y.--The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, January 13, 1932, at the instance of this corporation issued a rule on the commission to show cause (1) why it should not be restrained temporarily from further making public its complai nt in this matter; (2) why it should not be restrained temporarily from taking in public any testimony in connection with its complaint, or making public the transcript of such testimony; and why (3) it should not be enjoined perpetually from making public the contents of its compla int or the transcript of testimony adduced in the trial of the case-until such time as the issues areCOURT CASES 99 finally determined-the basis for its proceeding being the claim that the publicity incident to the trial of the case would result in irreparable loss and damage to its business. The commis sion, January 25, filed its return to the rule, answer to. the complaint, and motion to dismiss the complaint; and the matter was presented orally to the court that day. The commission directed suspension of hearings until final judicial determination of the matter. The complaint charged that this corporation, engage d in the sale of proprietary preparations known as Kruschen Salts and Radox Bath Salts, was falsely representing that its Kruschen Salts was a cure or remedy for obesity, and that its Radox Bath Salts, when used in the bath and as otherwise directed, radiated oxygen in great quantities and sufficiently to produce an invigorating and energizing effect. The respondent denied these charges. The Supreme Court of the District entered its final decree dismissing the bill, February 11, 1932. The corporation noted an appeal in open court; and the appeal was docketed with the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, March 15. The next day the corporation filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for temporary injunction, praying that during them pendency of the appeal from the order of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia dismissing the bill of complaint (February 11), the commission be restrained from taking in public many testimony, or making public the transcript of such testimony. On March 18, the commission filed a motion to dismiss the petition (with brief in support), and, on March 19, the petition with the Court was denied. Printed transcript was filed of Appeals, April 28; the appellant's brief was filed May 26. The next steps are the filing of the commission's brief, and argument. The case will not be reached before the Fall term. Keppel, R. F., & Bros (Inc.), Lancaster, Pa., a candy manufacturer, filed with the Third Circuit (Philadelphia), January 25, 1932, its petition to review and set aside commission's order. The findings are to the effect that this corporation, in connection with the sale and distribution of its products, employs certain methods in the nature of lotteries or gaming devices. For instance, one assortment of its candies is composed of a number of pieces of candy in uniform size e, shape, and quality, retailin g for 1 cent each, a small number of which have concealed within them pieces of money.7 The next steps, in order, are the printing of the record, the filing of briefs, and argument. Hearing is expected during the fall term. Kirk, James S., & Co., Chicago, filed with the Seventh Circuit 7 For details of the commission's findings in this case see p. 79.100 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (Chicago), January 12, 1929, its petition to review and set aside the commission's order in this case, which, among other things, directed it to cease and desist from use of the word \"Castile,\" and the words \"olive oil soap,\" either alone or in conjunction or in associ ation with any other word or words which are the name of, or are descriptive or suggestive of, an oil or a fat, in labeling , branding, or otherwise describing soap offered for sale or sold in commerce, the oil or fatty composition of which is not wholly derived from olives. The court, October 8, 1930, granted the petition for intervention presented by the Proctor & Gamble Co., on the showing that this company had acquired all of the soap business of James S. Kirk & Co., including the brand and trade names used by the latter to designate the soaps manufactured and sold by it as \"Castile.\" The printed transcript was filed October 29, 1930. On November 25 a joint brief on behalf of the origin al petitioner (Kirk& Co.) and the intervener (Proctor & Gamble Co.) was filed; and on April 16, 1931, the commission filed its brief. The petitioner and intervener filed a reply brief September 1, 1931. The case was argued on the merits January 19, 1932, and the commission's order was reversed on April 15, 1932 (59 F. (2d) 179). Pertinent excerpts from the opinion follow: The commission finds as a fact that castile soap derives its name from t he fact that i was first made in the Province of Castile in Spain, in a very early day, and that its oily or fatty ingredient was derived exclusively from olives; that by custom and usage any soap whose sole oily or fatty ingredient is derived from olives is known as castile soap, regardless of Its place of manufacture. We are convinced from the record before us that during the earlier years castile soap was recognized and considered as a soap whose sole oily and fatty ingredient w as derived from olives, and the dictionaries of the various countries, including America, so defined it, and the pharmacopoeias designated it as the one to be used in all medical preparations and prescriptions in which soap was required because its sole oily or fatty ingredient was olive oil. The words \"castile soap\" thereby become synonymous with \"olive oil\" soap, and such synonymity still prevails with many people. In earlier years of the last century, however, some foreign manufacturers made and sold soaps they called \"castile\" soap who 'se oily or fatty ingredient was not solely of olive oil and much of those products was imported into America. At that time the soap industry in America was begun, and many of our earlier soaps makers did the same thing and have continued the practice up to the present time. During seventy-five years last past that practice has grown to such an extent that practically all of our soap makers are resorting more or less, to that custom. * * * * * * * A perusal of the very voluminous record in the case convinces us that the present contrariety of opinion as to the meaning of the words \"castile soap\" is a result of an effort on the part of certain soap manufacturers, both foreign and American, extending from very early times to the present, to corrupt and change the public's understanding of the meaning of those words to the manu-COURT CASES 101 facturers' advantage. That this effort has been in a great degree successful can no more be denied than the methods employed can be approved. As a result of such effort it is not at all surprising that the present laity should have such diversified views as to the meaning of the words, for the record supports us in saying that a greater part of the laity knows very little and cares less as to the constituent elements of any soap. That in former years the methods used did deceive and had the capacity and tendency to deceive is fully supported by the evidence; and were it not for the action of the Bureau of Standards of the United States Department of Commerce, that capacity and tendency would still exist. * * * * * * * By the act of 1901, 31 Stat. 1449, 15 U. S. C. A. 271, et seq., Congress established the National Bureau of Standards and authorized that bureau's director to issue bulletins for public distribution containing such information as might he of value to the public or facilitate the bureau in the exercise of its functions. Pursuant thereto, the following bulletin was promulgated and distributed: UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF STANDARDS Circular No.62, \"Soap,\" 3d Edition, published January 24, 1923, at p. 9 \"Castile soap was originally made from low-grade olive oils. The name now represents a type of soap, the term 'castile' being applied to a soap intended for toilet or household use, sold usually in large, unwrapped, unperfumed bars, which are cut up when sold or when used. It is often drawn directly from the kettle without 'crutching,' but is sometimes crutched a little or even enough to make it float and is sometimes milled. It is also sold in small bars, both wrapped and unwrapped. The type is not one easily defined, so now when made from olive oil it is invariably sold as olive-oil castile There are soaps made entirely from coconut oil which are sold as coconut castiles or hard-water castiles. Many other castiles are made from a mixture of coconut oil and tallow.\" This circular was discussed in petitioner's briefs and it was ignored by respondent. We deem it quite pertinent and decisive of the question before us. The Government, through its agency, the Bureau of Standards, has thus committed itself to the proposition that castile soap may be made of oily and fatty elements other than olive oil. Being solely a question of fact, we deem it expedient for other departments of the Government, including the judic iary, to accept such construction, if for no other reason than that of consistency. The commission, May 5, filed a petition for rehearing, based on the following grounds, among others: (1) That the Federal Government, through the Bureau of Standards, has not Committed itself to the proposition that castile soap may be made of oily and fatty elements other than olive oil, and does not purport to do so; (2) that the Bureau of Standards is without authority under its organic act to commit the Federal Government to the proposition that castile soap may be made of oil or fatty elements other than olive oil; (3) that the facts appearing in the record do not justify the conclusion that a secondary meaning of the term \"castile\" has been established; (4) that the statements in Circular No.62 of the Bureau of Standards are not based on evidence in the legal sense; and (5) that the commission's power to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition102 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION in interstate commerce can not be nullified by any action taken by the Bureau of Standards. The Kirk Co., together with the Proctor & Gamble Co. as intervener and copetition er, filed answer to the petition May 31, and the commission a short reply brief June 9. The petition was denied June 22, 1932. On July 1 the commission voted in favor of making an application for writ of certiorari. The Solicitor General was opposed to this, but authorized the commission to file a petition, which it did, October 22, 1932. Lomax Rug Mills, Philadelphia.-- The findings in this case were to the effect that one H. L. Lomax engaged in the purchase of rugs and carpets from manufacturers, and their resale to retailers and consumers; that a small portion of these products were \"fabricated\" by him from the standard carpet material thus purchased; that this \"fabrication\" consisted in cutting up the material into the desired sizes, sewing it together, hemming the ends, and putting a fringe on it; that he advertised extensively, stressing that he was a manufacturer those purchasing from him would effect sub- stantial economies by elimination of the middleman's profit. The commission directed Lomax to cease and desist: (1) From doing business under the trade name and style of \"Lomax Rug Mills,\" or any other trade name which included the words \"mill\" or \"rug mills,\" unless and until he actually owned or operated a factory or mills in which he manufactured the rugs and carpets which he sold; and (2) from inserting or causing to be inserted adver tisements in newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals, or distributing circulars, handbills, private mailing cards, or any other forms of advertising literature containing stateme nts, slogans, words, phrases, sentences, or representations indicating or creating the impression that he was the manufacturer of the articles which he sold, unless and until, he actually manufactured such articles. Lomax took exception to the order, and, on September 24, 1930, filed with the Third Circuit (Philadelphia) his petition to review and set it aside. By stipulation, the case was continued until the March, 1932, term; and on March 12, 1932, upon consideration of a stipulation of the parties, the court entered its order dismissing the petition for review. The basis for the commission's agreement to this met hod of disposal of the case, was the filing by Lomax of a report showing substantial compliance with its order, in interstate commerce. Marietta Manufacturing Co., Indianap olis, filed with the Seventh Circuit. (Chicago), August 18, 1930, its petition to re view and set aside the commission's order. It was engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling in interstate commerce a product used for interior walls, wainscoting, ceilings, table tops, counters, and likeCOURT OASES 103 purposes, which it advertised and described as \"Sanionyx,\" \"Sani-Onyx,\" and \"Sani- Onyx, a Vitreous Marble.\" The product was manufactured from various ingredients, the chief of which was silica. It was neither marble nor onyx but it was manufactured in slab form and was capable of being used in place of natural or quarried onyx or marble when such onyx or marble was in slab form. The commission concluded that the designations used by the company for its product were false and misleading, and entered its order accordingly. Petitioner's brief was filed January 5, 1931; and, January 14, the National Association of Marble Dealers, through its counsel, filed its brief amicus curia e, concluding with the statement that \"the order of the Federal Trade Commission was right and it should stand as entered.\" The commission's brief was filed January 26 and, February 5, petitioner filed a reply brief. The case was argued April 23, and on June 16, 1931, the court handed down its opinion in favor of the commission. (50 F. (2d) 641.) Pertinent excerpts from the decision follow: The Marietta Manufacturing Co. for 20 years has manufactured and sold a product used for interior walls, wainscoting, ceilings, table tops, counters, and other like purposes. This product has been advertised and sold as \"Sani-Onyx, a Vitreous Marble.\" It is not a product of nature. It is neither a marble nor onyx. Its chief ingredient 18 silica, and it is manufactured in slab form and may be used in place of natural or quarried onyx or marble when such onyx or marble is in slab form. It is made in a great variety of colors, and in some of its colors it resembles marble and in others a type of onyx. * * * * * * * Petitio ners assert that the commission's finding that the designation of petitioner's product is false and misleading and has the tendency and capacity to deceive purchasers into the belief that the product is onyx or marble is not sustained by the proof. The product, it is asserted, is sold, for the most part, to jobbers, contractors, and builders, who could not possibly be misled by the designation or by anything in the advertising into the belief that they were purchasing a kind of marble or onyx. A method of competition, inherently unfair, does not cease to be unfair because the falsity of the manufacturer's representation has become so well known to the trade that dealers, as distinguished from consumers, are no longer deceived. The honest manufacturer's busin ess may suffer, not merely through a competitor's deceiving his direct customer, the retailer, but also through the competitor's putting into the hands. of the retailer an unlawful instrument, which enables the retailer to increase his own sales of the dishonest goods, thereby lessening the market for the honest product. (Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Co., 258 U. S. 483, 494.) It may be that building contractors were not deceived. Petitioner, however, carried on an advertising campaign the effect of which was to create 'in the mind. of the public the belief that this product was a kind of marble and lead them to deal with it as such in agreeing to specifications or buying houses. The designation was adroitly selected and the advertisements cunningly framed so as to go as far as possible in giving the false impression without transcending the limits of literal truth, except in the use of the words \"marble\" find \"onyx.\"104 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION On July 6, 1931, the Marietta filed a petition for rehearing; and the commission, July 15, filed its answer thereto. The petition was denied July 25, 1931. Mennie, F. L., Omaha.-- This respondent, an individual trading under the names and styles of Mineral Coal Saver Co., Mennie Manufacturing Co., and M. & K. Manufacturing Co., with principal office and place of business in Omaha, Nebr., on February 6, 1931, filed with the Eighth Circuit (St. Louis) a petition for review of the commission's order. The findings were to the effect that Mennie was manufacturing and selling in interstate commerce a powder designated by him as \"Mineral Coal Saver,\" which was composed for the most part of common salt; that he represented that this product, when ii sed according to directions, would make poor coal good and good coal better; that it prevented and removed soot; that it increased the heat from a given quantity of coal from 22 to 28 per cent in British thermal units; that it gave 20 per cent more heat with less coal; and other similar statements. The order directed the cessation of these practices. The case was originally set for hearing on November 16, 1931, at St. Louis, Mo.; subsequently it was continued to March 14, 1932, at Kansas City, Mo. In the meantime, due to the continued failure of the petitioner to print the record and file its brief, the commission moved to dismiss the proceedings. The petitioner, Mennie, subsequently filed a motion of his own to dismiss, which was granted by the court March 14, 1932. Northam Warren Corporation, New York, filed with the Second Circuit (New York City), December 22, 1931, its petition to review and set aside the commission's order. Briefly, the findings were to the effect that the petitioner, which is engaged in the manu facture, sale, and distribution of toilet articles and preparations, including preparations used for manicuring 'jails and the care of the cuticle, sold under the trade name \"Cutex,\" published and circulated in nationally distributed magazines and trade papers, advertisements containing testimonials from socially or theatrically prominent individuals, for which testimonials the petitioner had paid substantial sums of money, without making any disclosure of the fact of such payment; and that the failure to make such disclosure had the capacity and tendency to misle ad and deceive the ultimate purchasers of the preparations into the errone ous belief that the testimonials were entirely voluntary and not purchased; and tended to divert trade from competitors not following a similar practice.COURT CASES 105 The order directed the petitioner to cease and desist \"from the use, or authorizing the use by others, in advertising or otherwise, of testimonials or endorsements of its toilet articles and toilet preparations, for which said testimonials and endorsements respondent has paid substantial sums of money, without disclosing the fact that respondent has paid substantial sums of money therefor.\" Briefs were filed, not only by the corporation and the commission but on behalf of the Pond's Extract Co. and Standard Brands (Inc.), respectively, as amici curiae; the case was argued May 5-6, 1932, and the court, on June 6, 1932, handed down an opinion reversing the commission's order (59 F. (2d) 196). During the course of its opinion the court said: There is no claim of misbranding, falsity, or insufficiency in the statement labeling the product. * * * The quality of the petitioner's products is not brought into question; nor is there a charge that its products were inadeq uately labeled or so testified to, by testimonials, as to induce the public to purchase from it tinder practices of deception. The endorsements are said to be neither exaggerations nor untruthful. There is no claim of monopoly. * * *It is doubtful if the public is gullible enough to believe that such testimonials are given without compensation. But If they are paid for, providing they are truthful, no one is deceived. * * * Because a prominent person ventures an opinion without being requested to do so is no guaranty either of veracity or good judgment. If the testimonials involved here represent honest beliefs of the endorsers, there is no misrepresentation concerning the product, and no unfair competition is created. We have no right to presume that endorsers of commercia l products falsify their statements because they have received compensation. There are no misrepresentations and the commission was without jurisdiction. The commission, July 1, voted in favor of making application for writ of certiorari. The Solicitor General decided not to apply for certiorari. The NuGrape Co. of America, Atlanta , filed with the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans), July 3, 1931, its petition to review and set aside the commission's order to cease and desist of May 19, 1931. The order entered, which is quite similar to those approved by the Sixth and Seventh Circuits in the Good Grape and Morrissey cases, respectively (discussed in prior annual reports), directed the corporation to cease and desist from using or authorizing the use of the words \"NuGrape\" or \"Grape,\" alone or in conjunction or combination with any other word or words, letter or letters, in any way in connection with the sales or distribution of a product not composed wholly of the natural fruit of juice of grapes, with the provisos: (1) That if such product is composed in such substantial part of the natural fruit or juice of grapes as to derive therefrom its color and flavor, the words \"NuGrape\" or \"Grape \" may be used if accompanied with a word or words, equally conspicuous in char-106 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION acter or type, clearly indicating that such produc t is composed in part of material or materials other than the natural juice or fruit of grapes; and (2) that if the beverage produced from respondent's sirup is not composed in such substantial part of the natural fruit or juice of grapes as to derive therefrom its color and flavor, the words \"NuGrape\" or \"Grape \" may be used if it is made prominently to appear that the product is an imitation, artificially colored and flavored. The order also forbade the use of any word or words falsely representing or suggesting that a product is made from the natural juice or fruit of grapes or contains the natural juice or fruit of grapes in such substantial quantity as to derive therefrom its color and flavor. The findings were to the effect that the respondent was engaged in the manufacture of a concentrate or sirup, called by it \"NuGrape,\" and in the sale of the same to numerous bottling plants and jobbers located in the various States, for the purpose of having manufactured therefrom a beverage also known, advertised, and sold under the name \"NuGrape\"; that exhaustiv e analyses made by chemists of the United States Department of Agriculture showed that this \"NuGrape\" sirup was an artificially colored invert sugar sirup containing added acid, principally tartaric, and not more than 20 per cent of grape juice; that the \"NuGrape\" beverage, made from respondent's sirup, was an artificially colored beverage sweetened with invert sugar and acidulated with said added acid and containing not more than 4 per cent of grape juice; and that respondent's product \"NuGrape\" sirup did not contain the natural fruit or juice of the grape in quantity sufficient to give it its color or flavor. For some months, certification of the record, briefing , and argument were held in abeyance pending possible settlement of the case out of court. On April 15, 1932, on motion of counsel for the company, the court entered its order dismissing the petition for review. This method of disposition was predicated upon the company's filing, with the com-mission, a report showing compliance with the latter's order i. e., that its drink was now, under a new formula, a true-grape beverage, containing as much real grape juice as a carbonated drink of this character could contain, and deriving both color and flavor from real grape juice. Paramoun t-Famous-Lasky Corporation, New York.-- The commission, July 9, 1927, entered its order to cease and desist in this proceeding, which, briefly, was directed against a conspiracy in restraint of trade in the business of producing, distributing, and exhibiting motion-picture films, against the practice of \"block booking \" of motion- picture films, and the acquisition of theater buildings for theCOURT CASES 107 purpose of intimid ating or coercing exhibitors of motion-picture films to lease and exhibit films produced by respondents. In due course respondents filed with the commission their report in writing, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they were complying with the order. This was accepted as unobjectionable, with the except ion of that portion relating to compliance with paragraph 2 of the order, concerning \"block booking.\" This particular portion was rejected as being insufficient to show compliance with the paragraph in question; and the next step was the filing by the commission, August 1, 1928, with the Second Circuit (New York City) of its application for enforcement, together with a complete transcript of the proceedings theretofore had before the commission. This record, one of the largest ever before the commission, comp rised more than 17,000 pages of testimony and extensive exhibits consisting of more than 15,000 additional pages, a total of more than 32,000 pages. By the rules of the Second Circuit the burden of printing the record in Federal Trade Commission cases falls upon the petitioner-in this case, the commission. The size of the record was, of necessity, one of the considerations which led the commission to agree that the issue before the court might be confined to paragraph 2 of the order relating to \"block booking,\" and as a result of this decision considerable time was devoted to negotiations looking to the elimination of such of the testimony and exhibits as was irrelevant to the point at issue. By the eliminations referred to the record was reduced to some 2,000 pages. On March 9, 1931, the court granted the motions of the commission: (1) For leave to amend its application for enforcement so as to limit the issue to paragraph 2, relating to \" block booking\"; and (2) for an order directing a revision and condensation of the transcript, the establishment of such revision and condensation as the record of the evidence, and that the commission cause to be printed only such record. Appropriate orders were entered March 17; the printed record, with the commission's brief in chief, was filed December 9, 1931. Respondents' brief in chief was filed March 5, 1932, and the case was argued March 9, 1932. On April 4 it was decreed against the commission (57 F. (2d) 152). In its opinion, the court, speaking through Judge Manton, said: There is free competition among producers and distributors for the distribution and marketing of their pictures. There is a lack of monopolization by the respondent and, in fact, lack of ability to achieve a monopoly and, there fore, not a business operation which would unduly hinder competitors. * * * The respondent's sales methods have not been shown to have any effect upon its competitors--the small producers--when the whole field is surveyed, and it is impossible to say on the evidence that the effect of block-booking as practice d by the respondent, or its accumulative effect as practiced independently by the108 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION respondent and others, has unfairly affected competition. On the other hand, it may fairly be said that all persons engaged in the production of pictures have been able successfully to distribute their product. This has permitted fair competition in the industry. * * * The respondent has lawfully exercised its right to sell its product. to the best advantages and in such quantities and to such persons as it chooses. * * * The means and methods employed in marketing its leases of films to prospective customers are matters within the business judgement of a private producer of films and carries with it the legal right to bargain and negotiate as the respondent did. The method of negotiation which has been condemned by the commission does not disclose a dangerous tendency unlawfully to hinder competition nor does it create a monopoly. The findings are insufficient in law to support the conclusions of fact reached and therefore the petition to enforce paragraph 2 of the order to cease and desist must be denied. The commission, April 25, 1932, voted in favor of making an application for writ of certiorari. The Solicitor General decided that the application should not be made. Philippine mahogany cases.-The Indiana Quartered Oak Co. (New York), filed with the Second Circuit (New York City), May 2, 1932, its petition to modify the decree of that court affirming the commission's order and commanding obedience thereto; and the petition was granted May 9 (58 F. (2d) 182). The grounds assigned for the petition were: That the commission, in 1927, ordered the company to cease and desist from advertising and selling certain woods of the Philippine Islands as \"mahogany\" or \"Philippine mahogany\"; a subsequent review of the order resul ted in its affirmance in 1928, and denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court; that, at the time of the decree (October 14, 1929), there were a large number of dealers in, and users of, the woods in question who had established business in the woods and products composed thereof which they are advertised, sold, and designated as \"Philippine mahogany\"; that a number of these dealers petitioned the commission to institute new proceedings against one of their number, to the end that a more complete disclosure of the facts regarding the subject matter might be obtained; that a test case was selected and tried (the allegations in the complaint being the same as in the complaint involving the Indiana Co.), and that the commission, upon the record made, dismissed this test case; that, subsequently, a number of other complaints involving the same practices were dismissed on the stipulation that respondents, in the sale, description, and advertisement of the wood in question would not employ the word \"mahogany\" without the modifying term \"Philippine.\" The prayer of the petition was that the court so modify its decree as to place the Indiana Co. on the same footing in describing the wood in question as enjoyed by the other dealers stipulating with the commission; or to vacate the decree and remand the proceedings to the commission for further consideration.COURT CASES 109 The commission, in its answer, admitted the allegations of the petition, and the matter was taken under advisement by the court, with the result as above indicated. Joint petitions to modify outstanding decrees were also filed, with the Eighth Circuit (St. Louis), on behalf of the Powe Lumber Co.; and, with the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco), on behalf of the Kirschmann Hardwood Co., the Hammond Lumber Co., and the Robert Dollar Co. The Eighth Circuit, May 31, denied the Powe petition for want of jurisdiction; on June 8, it vacated and set aside the order denying the petition; and, June 10, it granted the joint petition and entered the modified decree. In the cases in the Ninth Circuit, the joint petitions were granted and modified decrees entered June 6. Raladam Co., Detroit, May 16, 1929, filed with the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) its petition to review and set aside the commission's order. The findings were to the effect that the company was selling thyroid \"obesity cure\" tablets (under the name \"Marmola Prescription Tablets\") as safe, effective, and dependable in use, when the present knowledge of thyroid as a remedial agent does not justify such representations. The order directed the cessation of such practices. After briefing and argument , the court, June 28, 1930, handed down its decision, vacating and setting aside the commission's order. The court, in the course of its opinion (42 F. (2d) 430), said: The thing forbidden by the statute is unfair competi tion. This can not exist unless there is competition, and there can not he competition unless there is something to compete with. It must be evident that the trade which was to he protected against restraint (and unfair competition is a kind of restraint) was that legitimate trade which was entitled to hold its own in the trade field without embarrassment from unfair competition. The first thought might be that the one invoking protection should be a particular trader; but the Winsted case (258 U. S. 488) teaches that protection will also be given under this statute to the entire class of trade which is having its former customers taken away from it by false representations that the competing goods are of the same: descriptive qualities as those put out by the complaining class. It is apparent from this record, as well as from other recent or pending cases in this court and other decisions of the commission and from announcement by its members shown in this record, that the commission does not take this limited view of its jurisdiction, but that it believes itself authorized to issue its \"desist and refrain\" orders in any case where it concludes that sales methods may mislead a substantial part of the purchasing public, in a way and to an extent that, in the judgment. of the commission, is injurious to the purchaser. The general law of unfair competition uses the misleading of the ultimate retail purchaser as evidence of the primarily vital fact-injury to the lawful dealer; the commission uses this ultimate, presumed injury to the final user as itself the vital fact. The result is a realization of what was suggested in the former110 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION opinion as the opened vista (289 Fed. 992-993) and a pro tanto censorship by the commission of 411 advertising. * * * * * * * We have do occasion to deny, nor, indeed, reason to doubt, that this elimination would tend to the public good; but we can not think that Congress had any conception that it was creating a tribunal for that kind of action. Its failure for many sessions to pass a proposed \"pure fabric\" law, and others of similar character, is familiar; but if the commission's view of its jurisdiction is right, these laws are unnecessary. The commission filed its petition for writ' of certiorari September 27, 1930. Petition was granted November 3, 1930, the review to be limited to the question of jurisdiction of the commission. The commission's brief was filed April 4, 1931, and that of the respondent April 20. The; case was argued April 24 and decided against the commission on May 25, 1931. In the course of its opinion the court said (283 U. S. 643): Findings, supported by evidence, warrant the conclusion that the preparation is one which can not be used generally with safety to physical health except under medical direction and advice. If the necessity of protecting the public against dangerously misleading advertisements of a remedy sold in interstate commerce were all that is necessary to give the commission jurisdiction, the order could not successfully he' assailed. But this is not all. * * * * * * * It is obvious that the word \"competition\" imports the existence of present or potential competitors, and the unfair methods must be such as injuriously affect or tend thus to affect the business of these competitors; that is to say, the trader whose methods are assailed as unfair must have present or potential rivals in trade whose business will be, or is likely to be, lessened or otherwise injured. It is that condition of affairs which the commission is given power to correct, and it is against that condition of affairs and not some other that the commission is authorized to protect the public. * * * * * * * While it is impossible from the terms of the act itself, and in the light of the foregoing circumstances leading up to its passage, reasonably to conclude that Congress intended to vest the commission with the general power to prevent all sorts of unfair trade practices in commerce apart from their actual or potential effect upon the trade of competitors, it is not necessary that the facts point to any particular trader or traders. It is enough that there be present or potential substantial competition, which is shown by proof, or appears by necessary inference, to have been injured, or to be clearly threatened with injury, to a substantial extent, by the use of the unfair methods complained of. * * * * * * * Findings of the commission justify the conclusion that the advertisements naturally would tend to increase the business of respondent; but there is neither finding' nor evidence from which the conclusion legitimately can be drawn that these advertisements substantially injured or tended thus to injure the business of any competitor or of competitors generally, whether legitimate or not. None of the supposed competitors appeared or was called upon toCOURT CASES 111 show what, if any, effect the misleading advertisements had, or were likely to have, upon his business. * * * * * * * It is impossible to say whether, as a result of respondent's advertisements, any business was diverted, or was likely to be diverted, from others engaged in like trade, or whether competitors, identified or uniden tified, were injured in their business, or were likely to be injured, nor, indeed, whether any other antiobesity remedies were sold or offered for sale in competition, or were of such a character as naturally to come into any real competition, with respondent's preparation in the interstate market. All this was left without proof and remains, at best, a matter of conjecture. Something more substantial than that is required as a basis for the exercise of the authority of the commission. On June 1, 1931, on motion of the Solicitor General on behalf of the commission, the court granted leave to file, within 30 days, a motion to modify its judgment, at the same time staying its mandate until disposition of the motion in question. Such a motion with brief in support, was filed June 30, 1931. The motion asked that the judgment of the Supreme Court be modified by adding thereto a direction to the Sixth Circuit to so modify its decree as to permit further proceedings before the commission for the taking of additional evidence as to the Raladam competitors and as to the injury to such resulting from the company's trade practices, and for the making of further findings, of' fact and a further order based on such additional evidence. A brief in opposition was filed August 20, 1931. The court October 12, 1931, denied the motion, but without prejudice to application to the court of appeals for similar relief. Such an application, with brief in support, was filed with the Sixth Circuit on November 13, 1931. The company filed a brief in opposition December 16 and the commission a reply brief, on January 2, 1932. The court denied the commission's motion February 5, 1932. In so doing it entered the following order: This cause coming on to be heard upon motion of the Federal Trade Commission to modify the decree heretofore entered herein pursuant to our opinion as reported in 42 F. (2d) 430, so as to permit the taking of additional evidence bearing upon the existence of competition and injury to competitors, and this court deeming it unnecessary to decide the three questions principally argued, viz: (1) Whether it is still open to the commission to proceed with a new complaint; (2) whether the decision of the Supreme Court on appeal (283 U. S. 643) in effect found error in our decision that the representations of the safety and the scientific nature of the remedy were mere expressions of opinion, over which the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission did not extend; and (3) the jurisdiction of this court now to entertain such motion, whether as incident to the jurisdiction heretofore attaching, or under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission act. It is ordered that the motion be and the same is hereby denied.112 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Royal Milling Co., Nashville, etc.--On June 12, 1931, John McGraw and E A. Glennon, partners conducting business under the names of Royal Milling Co., Richland Milling Co., and Empire Milling Co., filed with the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) a petition to review and set aside the commission's order. Similar petitions were filed January 6, 1932, by the Tennessee Grain Co., Nashville Roller Mills, Snell Milling Co., State Milling Co., and the Cherokee Mills. The petitioners in question were all concerns situated at Nashville, Tenn., and selling flour in the Southeastern States; and the findings of the commission were to the effect that they used the words \"Milling\" and \"Mills\" in their corporate or trade names, and represented. themselves as \"Manufacturers of Flour,\" when, as a matter of fact, they did not extract flour from wheat, but bought it from concerns. actually grinding the wheat, and mixed the flours together by stirring them in what is known as a \"batch mixer,\" in some instances stirring in, with the flour, such substances as salt, soda, and phosphate, so that leavening ingredients would not have to be added later. The commission ordere d these concerns to cease and desist from the use of the words \"Mills,\" \"Milling,\" and \"Manufacturers of Flour,\" until they actua lly owned and operated the plants in which the flour, sold by them, was ground. The cases were briefed and argued together, and, on May 4, 1932, were decided against the commission (58 F. (2d) 581) The court, in its opinion, said: There is here manifestly no threat to competition. Such effect as the commission's orders may have upon the active competition that now exists will be in the direction of stifling rather than of preserving it. There is no oppression of the weak by the strong, the grinding millers, being strong concerns organized into powe rful trade organizations, and the record fails wholly to establish any injury to the public or any loss suffered by it, either individually or in the aggregate. * * * There is no finding that either dealer or consumer obtained an inferior product or a produ ct other than he sought to purchase. * * * Failing to see any public injury, or financial loss in the methods of competition here reviewed, we find no public interest exists, much less, one that is specific and substantial. If there is any decep tion in the petitions representations or trade names, it amounts at most to a private wrong, as in the Klesner case, and one not to be redressed by action of the commission. The commission, July 1, 1932, voted in favor of making application for writ of certiorari. Temple Anthracite Coal Co. Scranton, Pa., filed with the Third Circuit (Philadelphia), May 28, 1930, its petition to review and set aside the commission's order in this case, which was directed against stock acquisition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. Respondent was a holding corporation and acquired the stock of two competitive corporations engaged in interstate commerce. TheCOURT CASES 113 commission's order directed the divestiture of the stock of one of the competing corporations. The petitioner's brief was filed October 22, 1930, and that of the commission December 1. The case was argued Dec ember 4, 1930, and decided July 9, 1931 (51 F. (2d) 656), the order of the com-mission being set aside (Judge Woolley dissenting). Pertinent excerpts from the majority opinion of the court follow: The commission reached the conclusion as an ultimate fact that the effect of the purchase, acquisition, and holding of the stock of the two corporations by the respondent has been or may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporations, as alleged in its complaint. We will, therefore, consider whether that ultimate finding of fact is sustained by the basic facts as found from the evidence before the commission. * * * * * * * There are no facts found and we find n evidence produced before the commission to show the relation between the percentage of coal mined and sold by the Temple Coal Co. and its subsidiaries and that sold by the East Bear Ridge Colliery Co. to the total output of anthracite coal of the same kind and quality in the whole anthracite region. From the facts found as to the value of the annual output of the respective mines it is quite apparent that the percentage of these mines to the total output can not be consequential. Therefore, if competition were lessened, its effect upon the whole interstate trade in anthracite coal would not tend to create a monopoly through substantially lessen ing competition. There is no fact found or evidence to show that there was, prior to the acquisition of the stock, actual direct competition between the Temple Anthracite Co. and the East Bear Ridge Coal Co. The Temple Coal Co. disposed of all of its coal either by sale or agency contract , through Thorne, Neale & Co. (Inc.). The East Ridge Colliery Co. disposed of all of its coal either by sale or agency contract through Madeira, Hill & Co. However, the evidence shows and the facts found from the evidence show that these two wholesalers in coal were and are in active competition in obtaining orders for sale and in selling to customers through their offices in various cities. * * * * * * * It is shown that at the time of the hearings and during the period covered by the testimony these wholesalers were competing in the open market for customers not only for this coal but for coal mined by other collieries, and that they are still competing in the same markets and in exactly the same way as they were before the complaint was filed. As long as the contracts with the wholesalers continue in existence, and there is nothing in the case to show that they will not continue, they are each under the same incentive to acquire and sell the output of the respective collieries as they were prior to the complaint. There is no evidence, and no facts are found, to show that competition between Thorne, Neale & Co. (Inc,) and Madeira, Hill & Co., in selling the coal of these two companies, has been or may be reduced through the ownership of the stock of the respective companies by Temple Anthracite Coal Co. The only effect which the ownership may be found to have brought about is the reduction of overhead and operating expenses. * * * * * * * With no evidence in the case to support the finding of fact that the effect of the acquisition of the stock \"has been and is to substantially lessen competition,\" our conclusion is that the actual active competition which is shown114 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION by the evidence, without contradiction, to have existed and to continue to exist between Thorne, Neale & Co. (Inc.) and Madeira, Hill & Co. negatives, so long as it may exist, the very effect which the commission has found to be caused by the acquisition by the Temple Anthracite Coal Co. of the capital stocks of the mining companies. Judge Woolley, dissenting, first calls attention to the fact \"that the complaint charges a violation of the single provision of section 7 of the Clayton Act, which forbids the acquisition of two corporations by a third 'where the effect of such acquisition * * * may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations * * *,'\" and that \" the restraint of trade and monopoly provisions of the section were not invoked and are not involved.\" He subsequently commented as follows: While the two underlying companies before their absorption could, because of their complete indepe ndence, separately refuse orders that were satisfactory without disturbing competition between them, the power to decide when to accept and refuse orders passed from them on their acquisition by the petitioner and became vested in the petitioner which thereafter could alone determine when orders were unsatisfactory and by directing its self-appointed officials of the two corporations to decline such orders would \"substantially lessen competition\"--indeed, actually end competition--between the two corporations. * * * * * * * The petitioner thus has power, ever present, to be exercised at its will, to do the thing denounced by the law. In my judgment, when the petitioner acquired the underlying coal companies and at the same time acquired the power to cause them to decline unsatisfactory orders, there was a complete transfer of power with respect to competition, producing a situation \"where the effect * * * may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations\" and certainly will be to lessen or stop competition whenever the temptation to use the power shall arise. The commission voted in favor of making application for writ of certiorari; the Solicitor General decided that the application should not be made. V. Vivaudou (Inc.), New York , filed with the Second Circuit (New York City), July 22, 1930, its petition praying that the commission's order be reviewed and set aside. The findings were to the effect that the corporation had acquired the stock of competitors in the sale of perfumes and cosmetics, in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. The order directed the divestiture, in good faith, of all of the capital stock of its former competitors acquired and owned by it, such divestiture to carry with it all of the property and assets of the former competitors. After several continuances, during which the possibility of withdrawal of the petition was discussed, the commission, April 2, 1931, filed with the court a transcript of the proceedings before it. This was subsequently printed, and filed in its printed form May 2, 1931. Brief for the petitioner was filed August 24, 1931, the commission's brief October 5, and brief of Messrs. Root , Clark & Buckner, asCOURT CASES 115 amici curiae, October 9. The case was argued October 15, and decided adversely to the commission November 2, 1931 (54 F. (2d) 273). The court quoted the rule laid down in the International Shoe Co. case, namely: Mere acquisition by one corporation of the stock of a competitor, even though it result in some lessening of competition, is not forbidden; the act deals only with such acquisitions as probably will result in lessening competition to a substantial degree, that is to say, to such a degree as will injuriously affect the public. Obviously, such acquisition will not produce the forbidden result if there be no preexisting substantial competition to be affected; for the public interest is not concerned in the lessening of competition, which, to begin with, is itself without real substance. The court further said: This court may review this record to determin e whether the evidence requires a contrary conclusion to that arrived at by the commission as to the effect of the acquisition of the stock of the Smith Company and the Parfumerie Melba (Inc.) in substantially lessening competition. We must consider the extent of the trade carried on by the three companies and compare it with the volume of business carried on by their competitors previous to the period of ownership of the stock, and endeavor to ascertain whether the public interest has been affected. * * * There can be no monopolistic tendency in acquiring control of properties which added four million dollars to the petitioner's already three millions volume of business, when the total of the country's similar business, amounting to at least one hundred and twenty-five million, is considered, * * * in addition, it appears that there are from 300 to 500 different perfumery and cosmetic manufacturers throughout the United States, 3,000 face powder manufacturers, each claiming individual odors and the most of them having their own trade names. * * * Unless there be a monopoly or tendency toward monopoly, we would not be warranted in concluding that the public had an interest as referred to in the statute. There is no evidence of increase in price brought about through the ownership of the stock or supervision of the companies, nor is there evidence of elimination of any of the lines of production, or curtailment of the same, nor evidence of divisions of territory. The effect seems to have been to increase the sales of the products of the three companies. The commission voted against making application for writ of certiorari in this case. White Pine cases.-- Petitions for review of the commission's orders in a number of these cases were filed with the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco) during January, 1932. The names of the concerns involved are: Algoma Lumber Co., Big Lakes Box Co., George E. Breece Lumber Co., Cady Lumber Corporation, California Fruit Exchange, Clover Valley Lumber Co., Davies-Johnson Lumber Co., Diamond Match Co., Ewauna Box Co., Feather River Lumber Co., Hobart Estate Co., Lassen Lumber & Box Co., Pelican Bay Lumber Co., and Red River Lumber Co. They are situated in California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexic o. They are part of a group of 50 cases in which the commission issued complaints charging unfair methods of competition by using the phrase \"White Pine\"116 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION as part of such trade designations as \"California White Pine,\" \"Arizona White Pine,\" \"New Mexico White Pine,\" and \" Western White Pine\" for a species of yellow pine known as Pinus ponderosa . Of the 50 complaints, 11 were dismissed before trial or subsequently. Again st the remaining 39 orders to cease and desist were entered. Twenty-five companies have elected to abide by the orders. The commission's orders are based on findings to the effect that the lumber to which respondents apply the phrase \"White Pine\" is not, as above stated, white pine, but a species of yellow pine; that the latter is inferior for certain important uses; has a higher degree of variableness in such qualities as hardness, weight, density, and color; has a large proportion of sapwood; is less durable when exposed to the weather; has a greater tendency toward shrinking, warping, and twisting; and is excelled by true white pine in softness of texture, freedom from resinous content, paleness of color, lightness of weight, ease of working, ability to hold nails close to the edge, and to take paint. The commission further found that respondents' use of the phrase \"White Pine\" was misleading and confusing to the general public, architects and builders, many retail dealers, and to certain millwork manufacturers; and was to the detriment of the public and of competitors selling genuine white pine or selling Pinus Ponderosa lumber without designating it as \"White Pine.\" Many of these findings were attacked in the petitions filed in court. The order made by the court in this case, permitting the filing of petitions for review, required the inclusion, in the record to be certified by the commission, of a copy of the trial examiner's report upon the facts. The commission moved to amend the order by striking out this requirement, and the court, March 7, granted this motion. In the course of its opinion, 56 F. (2d) 774, it said: We are inclined to agree with the contention of the Federal Trade Commission that in the routine certification of its record to the courts it should not be required to certify the report of the examiner or the exceptions thereto unless such report and exceptions are referred to in the findings of the commission and thereby adopted by it as its findings. It is stated, and there is no suggestion to the contrary, that in the present proceeding the findings of the commission did not refer in any wise to the examiner's report. If upon the hearing of the matter before the court it seems desirable that any part of the record or proceedings before the Federal Trade Commission would be helpful in determining the cause, and such part of the record has not been certified, it can be supplied upon the hearing or afterward by stipulation of counsel or certification by the Federal Trade Commission upon a supplemental order requiring that to be done * * * We are not impressed that the report of the examiner would be of any assistance in coming to a conclusion in the matter, particularly where the contention is that it has been disregarded by the commission. * * * * * * *SUMMARY OF LEGAL WORK 117 It is in the interest of expedition that the uniform course of procedure adopted in the presentation of these records be followed, and we feel that the course usually adopted by the commission of omitting the examiners' report in the transcrip t is the better practice to be followed unless upon the hearing of the matter the inclusion of the report for some reason appears necessary to correct the decision. Brief for the petitioners was filed May 20, and that of the commission June 20. The case was argued on the merits June 24, 1932.

in the circuit courts of appeals. However, the Grand Rapids furniture (veneer) group (with 25 different docket numbers) is in reality 1 case, with 25 different subdivisions. It was tried briefed, and argued as 1 case, and was so decided by the court of appeals. The same holds true of the curb group (with 12 different subdivisions), and the Royal Milling Co. group (with 6 different subdivisions. In reality, therefore, these 43 docket numbers mean but 3 cases: and if eases and not docket numbers are counted, the total of adverse decisions would be 34.SUMMARY OF LEGAL WORK 121 TABLE 6.

FOREIGN TRADE WORK 127PART VI. FOREIGN TRADE WORK Foreign trade work of the commission, hand led by the export trade section, under direction of the chief counsel, includes administration of the export trade act (Webb- Pomerene law) and section 6 (h) of the Federal Trade Commission act. PROVISIONS OF THE WEBB-POMERENE LAW The Webb-Pomerene law of April 10, 1918 , grants exemption from antitrust laws to export associations that file with the commission their organization papers, charters, agreements, annual reports, and such other information as the commission may require. The law provides that such an association shall be organized for the sole purpose of engaging in export trade, and actually so engaged; that it shall not (1) restrain the trade of a domestic competitor, (2) artificially or intentionally enhance or depress prices within the United States of commodities of the class exported by the association, (3) substantially lessen competition or otherwise restrain trade within the United States. In case of violation of the law the commission may investigate and make recommendations for readjustment of the association's business , and if such recommendations are not complied with, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for further action.

This decrease in value was due largely to lower prices and the fact that some of the associations found it necessary to suspend their price agreements and permit members to sell at independent export prices, the independent sales not being included in the Webb law totals. Exports during the past three years were: Webb Law exports by commodities are shown Item 1929 1930 1931 Metals and metal products, including copper, iron, and steel, metal lath zinc, machinery, railway equip- ment, pipes, valves and screws, electrical apparatus,1 and signal apparatus 1 $271,000,000 $200,000,000 $109,000,000 Products of mines and wells, crude sulphur, phosphate rock, petroleum products, and carbon black 270,000,000 315,000,090 73,000,000 Lumber and wood products, pine, redwood, walnut, hardwood, naval stores,1 plywood, doors,1 and wooden tool handles 26,000,000 22,500,000 35,400,000 Foodstuffs such as milk meat sugar, flour rice, sardines, salmon,1 fresh fruit,1 dried fruit, and canned fruit 1 67,109,000 40,500,000 32,500,000 Other manufactured products such as rubber, paper, abrasives, cotton goods and linters, buttons, and chemicals 90,000,000 75,000,000 70,100,000 724,109,000 661,000,000 311,090,000 1 Doors and salmon in 1929 only; naval stores and fresh fruit, in 1929 and 1930 only; metal lath and carbon black, in 1930 and 1931 only; electrical apparatus, signal apparatus, and canned fruit, in 1931 only. Prices were much lower during the last year, and some Webb law members report they can not sell at the low prices now prevailing in foreign markets; others are selling only on a quality basis. It is said that foreign competitors, in some cases supported by Government credit insurance, have been able to make more drastic cuts in export prices than Americans. Increased tariffs, the revival of license restrictions and import quotas, the suspension of the gold basis of currencies and measures for the control of foreign exchange, in a numb er of countries, have materially lessened foreign sales. The exchange situation has been serious, and banks and boards administering the new control measures have broad powers to exclude goods which for one reason or another may be deemed \"unnecessary\" the countries of import. There has been an increasing demand for longer credit terms, and a generall y unsettled credit situation due to the large number of business failures and to political disturbances, especially in Latin American countries. WEBB LAW ASSOCIATIONS REVIEW YEAR'S WORK Trade conditions abroad as seen by American exporters in the light of their experiences in the last year, are reviewed in excerpts from reports of Webb law associations.132 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION An association which has been in operation since 1919 states that-- Compared to the previous 12 years, our total value of sales for 1931 was only 53 per cent of the average year. Compared to 1930, value was about 76 per cent while volume was about 90 per cent, indicating lower prices received in 1931. The outstanding advantages obtained in operation as an export association were: Greater prestige in the foreign markets, ability to fill orders for export where the range in materials required is difficult for the individual operator, centralization of sales effort, and lower costs of export operations. The most serious obstacles were financial conditions in the foreign markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, which takes the greater part of our product, and foreign import duties, particularly in Italy and now also true for the United Kingdom. Another factor which has greatly affected our exports is the unsettled condition of the trade due to Russian exports. One of the new associations reports that-- In 1931 we gained tonnage but suffered a further reduction in the price level, thus preventing complete demoralization and ruinous competition. By acting in concert members were able to establish safeguards in connection with trade in such countries where foreign currencies became unstable and exchange transactions were extremely difficult. An association exporting metal products reports-- Sales have continued to decrease since 1929. This is due to the general adverse conditions which exist in practically all foreign countries. With conditions in the export markets as they are now and with European manufacturers quoting prices which appear to be below the cost of materials and transportation, we have found it practically impossible to compete on a price basis, and, generally speaking, the business that we have obtained has been on a quality basis rather than price during the past year. The advantages in operating as an association have been: Economy resulting from elimination of competition through working as a single unit, with reduced sales costs; standardization as to quality and sh op practice; uniformity in packing and stamping methods and in the handling of shipping documents, etc.; centralization of inquiries and orders, the former enabling more effective dealing with foreign competition and the latter providing better service to the customer. We have encountered no objections to the handling of our export business as an association; there have been serious obstacles, however, that have retarded business, such as the unsound financial position of prospective customers and in many cases their inability to offer satisfactory agreements for payments. Also, the difference in the rate of exchange and the fact that many foreign governments have put through laws making it difficult or impossible to convert payments received in foreign currencies into dollars for transmission to this country. These are the only obstacles which stand in the way of a larger participation by the members of this association in foreign business. A small association shipping metal products states: Sales during 1931 were about 82 per cent below the corresponding figures for 1930. Foreign business in any volume would be impossible without operating as an association. Cooperation between the member companies enables the expense of marketing to be distributed among all of the companies, andFOREIGN TRADE WORK 133 any information of commercial value obtained by one is available to all. A more uniform quality of material is produced by this system of cooperative selling than would be the case if the companies were acting independently. Shipping papers and details of procedure in handling foreign orders are centralized and uniformly handled. All foreign inquiries and orders are centralized. The principal obstacles encountered during the year were competition from foreign manufacturers, slow payment on the part of a large percentage of our foreign customers, depreciation in exchange in cases where tenders must be submitted in local currency, also the foreign exchange limitations which are now in force in so many foreign countries. An exporter of raw materials reports: Due to the continuation through 1931 of the world-wide depression, our export business in 1931 fell off as compared with 1930 24 per cent in volume and close to 25 per cent in value. The outstanding advantages obtained by operation as an association were, as previously reported to you: We can better meet foreign competition in the export field. Centralized buying can best be met with centralized selling. Better opportunities are afforded to stabilize prices and standardize grades, contract terms and conditions. Selling costs are reduced. An association exporting a finished manufactured product reports: There was a great falling off in our export trade compared with the prior two years, particularly after the European producer s of our products abandoned the gold standard. The principal obstacles to our exports at present are the low values fixed on their exports by our competitors owing to the drop of about 25 per cent since Scandinavia, Finland, find England abandoned the gold standard Another drawback in these times of very strained financial conditions and difficulties of collection of our accounts is that we are hampered in competition with European countries by the fact that the Europeans have 66 per cent of their exports guaranteed by the respective Governments, whereas all our exports are done entirely at our own risk for the full amount of the invoices. This does not mean that we would advocate Government guarantees for our exports, but is mentioned to show how the competition is enabled to venture where we can not. An association exporting lumber reports: Very decided falling off in trade noticeable during the year as compared with previous years. But despite depression we believe the advantages of organization are many, enabling all of the mills in our association to obtain a fair share of the busines s being offered, with a better maintenance of price levels. Another lumber association: The quantity shipped during 1931 represe nts approximately 22\u00bd per cent decrease from 1930. Our loss in volume was due entirely to competitive conditions find the desire of our members to maintain prices commensurate with their costs, which policy resulted in considerable loss of business from time to time. Advantages included: Better service to buyers, lower selling cost at the individual mills, and the opportunity to distribute specifications to Individual member mills which best fit their operation.134 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION An association exporting food products states that-- While the tonnage exported by members of this association showed an increase over the tonnage shipped in 1930 the per ton value of same showed a decrease. This is accounted for by the fact that prices declined throughout the year. Unfavorable economic conditions prevailing in 1930, which were greatly aggravated during 1931, together with stringent financial conditions prevailing in several foreign countries, had a decidedly unfavorable effect on export business. Large available stocks throughout the year, together with declining prices, turned the situation Into a buyer's market. This condition was still prevalent at the close of the year. The ability of this association to maintain uniform terms has shown itself to be the outstanding advantage en- joyed by its members. The greatest obstacle encountered by the members during the year was the inability of many buyers to obtain foreign exchange. Another exporter of food products, shipping largely to Europe, reports: Export business during the year 1931 showed a decrease of approximately * * * tons (10 per cent) from the business done in 1930. The outstanding advantages obtained by operation as an association are: Uniform sales terms, uniform quality of shipments, members' credit protection by demanding payment of their drafts on foreign buyers. The serious obstacles encountered during the year were: The economic condition of Euro pean countries, England going off the gold standard, the placing of embargoes on Ameri can goods by foreign countries, and the placing of high tariffs on American goods. An association exporting a specialized product reports: A slight increase in our volume, due possibly to the fact that we lowe red prices to meet competition Tire advantages of operating as an association fire.: Elimination of separate export departments by members, standardization of grades, and more prompt deliveries by applying surplus stocks on orders received. An association shipping only to South America reports: Continued fall of volume of sales and prices due to general world conditions, particularly financial, and to some extent the dumping of Russian produ cts into the South American countries. Advantages have included the elimination of internal competition and lower selling and distributing costs. Another association which is developing exportation to Latin American countries reports: A decrease in 1981 of about 60 per cent, which is attributed to the worldwide economic depression, resulting in a decrease in the use of our products and an abnormal fluctuation in the exchange rates in practically every country to which we export. The outstanding adva ntages obtained by operation as an association are, chiefly: The association provides an organization through which we are better able to meet foreign competition in foreign markets, and a means wher eby minimum prices may be maintained consistent with competition on kindred commodities from foreign countries. It provides a means through which the members can and do obtain information concerning foreign market conditions. There has been greater willingness and interest on the part of dealers in foreignmarkets in handling our products because of the certainty of prices.FOREIGN TRADE WORK 135 Other reports received from Webb law groups present much the same story. INFORMAL FOREIGN TRADE COMPLAINTS UNDER SECTION 6 (h) Inquiries made under section 6 (h) of the Federal Trade Commission act included 19 foreign trade complaints handled by this office during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1932. These cases involve practices of American exporters and importers (not Webb law associations) in their trade with foreign countries. They are usually reported in the first instance by the foreign complainant to the American consul abroad. If it is found that inquiry in the States is necessa ry, the matter may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and facts obtained to substantiate or refute the allegations of the complainant. These facts, with inspection reports of the consul, frequently lead to an amicable adjustment by the parties, either in the form of settlement or arbitration proceedings. The commission's inquiries are made without publicity. Consuls report that this work has done much toward establishing good will for American products abroad, especially in out-of-the-way markets where American exporters have not a firmly establis hed trade and a complaint against an American trader reflects unfavorably against all Americans trading in the community. TRUST LAWS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES Under section 6 (h) of the Federal Trade Commission act the following may be noted as to recent measures in foreign countries and in international trade, along the lines of trust legislation and unfair competition: GERMAN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE LAW AND THE DEFLATION PROGRAM OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT An emergency decree issued March 9, 1932, amends the German unfair trade practice law of 1909, for the purpose of regulating certain forms of competition which are \"not compatible with sound business practice\" or which threaten the stability of the \"middle class retail stores \" in the towns of smaller or medium size. under the new decree the giving of premiu ms is forbidden; clearance sales may be held only in conformity with certain limiting rules; and unit-price stores may not be established in towns of less than 100,000 population. Penaltie s for the betrayal of business secrets are increased, and especially severe punishment is provided in cases where the secret is to be utilized abroad. The German program of price and wage deflation was continued by a number of decrees during the last year. One in December, 1931,136 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION requir ed that wages and salaries be reduced to the level of January 10, 1927, necessitating cuts from 10 to 15 per cent. As from January 1, 1932, salaries and pensions of civil servants were reduced by 10 per cent. Social insurance benefits were also to be reduced. It was said that the Government intended to effect reduction in prices, rents, and interest on capital, in order to maintain the purchasing power of wage and salary earners. Prices fixed by cartels, freights, charges for water, gas, and electricity were to be reduced by 10 per cent as compared with the level of July 1, 1931. No increases in prices were to be allowed before July 1, 1932. The ministry of industry is given broad power to dictate further reductions, and provision has been made for appointment of a price commissioner to supervise the reductions, with power to close businesses that do not comply with the orders. MEXICAN MONOPOLY ACT OF 1931 The Mexican monopoly act of August 24, 1931, prohibits the establishment of private or governmental monopolies or any act which injures the public by preventing free competition in production, industry, commerce, or services. Exceptions include the State's operation of radio, telegraph, banks of issue, coinage of money, the postal service, and patent and copyright privileges. Remission of taxes by the State or Federal Government to private interests is prohibited. Certain acts are cited as tending to create monopoly, including: (1) Combination or agreement to charge exaggerated prices, (2) a regular or permanent practice of selling goods or rendering service at less than cost, (3) the use of coupons or other devices at less than cost, (4) discrimination in price as between purchasers in different localities unless justified by costs of production or transportation or other marketin g circumstances, and (5) exclusive sales injurious to the public. The law specifically prohibits concentration or control in the marketing of articles of \"prime necessity\" for the purpose or with the effect of increasing prices, and provides that such articles may be imported free or their exportation may be prohibited when necessary. In case of shortage the Government may force the sale of such articles at fixed prices. The Federal Government may authorize the combination of producers or merchants for developing production, preventing ruinous or unfair competition , eliminating middlemen to lower prices, obtaining better distribution, exporting surplus production, or obtaining technical improvement to benefit national production. But such combines may not unduly raise price, and they must agree to permit the Government to fix their prices and direct their activities.FOREIGN TRADE WORK 137 THE CANADIAN TARIFF BOARD ACT, 1931, AND LITIGATION UNDER THE CANADIAN COMBINES INVESTIGATION ACT Under the Canadian Tariff Board act of 1931, the board may inquire into such factors as the price and cost of raw materials, the cost of transportation, the cost of production, the cost, efficiency, and conditions of labor, and the prices received by producers in Canada and elsewhere; and into all conditions and factors affecting cost of production and price to the consumers in Canada, as compared with other countries. Under the combines investigation act and section 498 of the Criminal Code a decision was rendered by the Ontario Supreme Court, January 12, 1932, the King v. Harry Alexander (Ltd.), and others. Seven corporations and 15 individuals associated with the Electrical Estimators' Association, a combine of electrical contractors in To- ronto, were found guilty of a conspiracy or agreement to enhance prices and prevent or lessen competition unduly or unreasonably. Fines totaling $26,200 were imposed. In a judgment delivered in the Assize Court at Toronto, March 7, 1932, the King V. Famous Players Canadian Corporation, and others, all parties charged as members of an alleged combine in the motion-picture industry were acquitted and found not guilty of violation of the combines investigation act and section 498 of the Criminal Code. PERSIAN UNFAIR COMPETITION ACT, 1931 Articles 244 and 249 of the Persian Penal Code were repealed August 7,1,931, and new articles substituted therefor, whereby unfair competition is forbidden and penalties are prescribed. Article 244 defines unfair competition to include misrepresentation in the sale of goods, and disparagement of the goods of another through intrigue or false accusations or other fraudulent means. Article 249 prohibits infringement of the rights of an owner of a patent; the use, imitation, or forging of another's trade-mark; the importation exportations, sale, or offer ing for sale within Persia of goods bearing a forged or imitated mark; and the sale or offering for sale of goods without the use of a mark which, on such a product, is compulsory. PAIR MARKING OF SILK AND IMITATION PRODUCTS Meetings of international silk interests were held in Paris and Milan in 1931, and it was agreed that the \"Butterfly \" trade-mark be placed on all pure silk material, effective March 1, 1932, for the purposes of protecting the public from imitations and stimulating the silk market. The mark will be placed on the goods by the 126056---32-----10138 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION printers and dyers after the material has been guaranteed by the manufacturers. In response to complaints of the National Silk Corporation of Italy, that rayon products have been largely sold as silk, the ministry of Corporations of that country has drawn up a set of regulations under which the word \"seta\" (silk) may be applied only to yarn, tissue, or fabricated articles which are in fact of silk of animal origin; products in which silk is mixed with other contents must be so marked; and loaded or weighted silk must be marked to indicate the degree of loading. BRITISH GIFT COUPON BILL, 1932 In response to widespread protests against the issuance of gift coupons, as an unfair trade practice, a bill was introduced in the House of Commons in February, 1932, which would make unlawful the issuance and redemption of gift coupons, which are specifically defined as-- Any coupon, stamp, token, cover, package, document, or other thing issued by any person upon or in connection with the sale of goods which, either by Itself or in connection with other coupon or coupons, or any other act or thing, entitles or purports to entitle the holder thereof to receive in respect of the purchase of such goods any gift, allowance, concession, consideration, benefit, or advantage of any kind whatsoever other than an unconditional payment in money or insurance benefits. ARGENTINE ANTIDUMPING DECREE, 1931 An Argentine decree of August 8, 1931, provides for the application of duties on goods imported from a foreign country (1) if the country of origin concedes subsidies, special rewards, or other advantages for the exported products; (2) if special rewards, exemptions, or other advantages are accorded for transportation of foreign products or to persons engaged in shipping; and (3) when foreign competitors are favored by legislation, rates of exchange, low wages, forced labor, or other forms of \"dumping\" harmful to Argentine production. FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL, IMPORT QUOTAS, AND RESTRICTIONS Emergency measures for the control of foreign exchange, the establishment of import quotas, and other restrictions upon international trade have been adopted in many countries during the last year. Banks and boards charged with the administration of these measures have broad powers to control the terms of payment and to exclude goods that may be deemed \"unnecessary\" or \"luxury products.\"FOREIGN TRADE WORK 139 Some of these newly adopted measures are briefly noted as follows: Argentina : Exchange control commission established in October, 1931. Australia : An exchange pool is in operation. Austria : Foreign exchange under control of Austrian National Bank.

Uruguay : Exchange controlled by the Bank of the Republic. Yugoslavia : Exchange under control of the national bank. GOVERNMENT T CONTROL OF GRAIN, SUGAR, AND OTHER FOODSTUFFS The British profiteering act, or act to prevent the exploitation of foodstuffs, 1931, is an emergency measure under which the Board of Trade is given wide powers to remedy or prevent shortage or unreasonable increase in the price of foodstuffs. The sugar monopoly act of Latvia, passed January 4, 1932, established a Government monopoly in the manufacture, importation, and wholesale trade in sugar. A similar sugar monopoly act was passed during the year in Egypt. A bill introduced in the Danish Rigsdag in February, 1932, would also provide for a Government sugar monopoly. The Latvian Government monopoly of grain was established by a decree, April 9, 1932, replacing acts of 1930 and 1931 under which importation has been restricted and the Government has purchased large quantities of home-grown grain for sale at prices in excess of world-market prices, a plan adopted for relief of the domestic growers. The 1932 act includes also power to regulate proportions of cereals used in milling and baking, to establish prices for bread, and to supervise the operation of mills, bakeries, and stores dealing in flour, bread, and other cereal products. The Yugoslavian wheat monopoly act of September 5, 1931, provides for the formation of an association of commercial mills which will cooperate with the Privileged Export Co., established for state control of the import and export trade of grain and flour under the decree of July 5, 1931. In Bulgaria, a Government bureau for the purchasing and exporting of cereals was operative from February to September, 1931,FOREIGN TRADE WORK 141 with authority to sell in both domestic and foreign markets and to fix prices in the domestic market higher than export prices. There is a bill now before the Bulgarian Parliament which would create a Government wheat monopoly in that country. The Rumanian agricultural marketing act of July 23, 1931, provides for export premiums on wheat and flour,. the funds to be raised through an internal tax on bread. The British whea t quota bill, which has received much attention in the last few months, is said to be for providing wheat growers in the United Kingdom with a secure market and an enhanced price for home-grown wheat without a subsidy from the exchequer and without encouraging the extension of wheat cultivation to land unsuit- able for the crop. The bill would provide for a wheat commission empowered to establish a guaranteed average price and to reserve a percentage (70 per cent now proposed) of the British market for wheat grown in the Empire. The result would be a substantial decrease in importation from countries outside of the Empire. The South African mealie control act of 1931 established an \"export-quota percentage.\" Each corn trade must hold available for export a certain percentage of each month's supply. The maize control act of Southern Rhodesia, 1931, establishes a complete monopoly of the trade in corn and corn meal for three years. Prices will be fixed for the domestic market, but corn will be sold for export at whatever it will bring. The Corn Control Board will negotiate all sales and will determine how much shall be exported. At the end of each exporting season settlement will be made with the growers. A Cana dian law passed August 3, 1931, provided for a bounty of 5 cents a bushel on every bushel of wheat grown in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba during 1931. The Cuban yuca flour law, effective July 2, 1932, provides that all forms of bread, crackers, or bread products manufactured in Cuba must contain from 10 to 40 per cent of pure yuca flour. Its purpose is to stimulate the cultivation and use of yuca in order to effect a saving in the imports of wheat flour. In Brazil the bumper coffee crop in 1931-32 led to restriction of output, the purchasing of all stocks in Sao Paulo on July 1, 1931, and a tax on exports. Proceeds were used for the purchase and destruction of surplus supplies in an effort to keep the price at level. INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED IN 1931-32 A world accord on the sale of platinum was announced in London in October, 1931, affected by organization of Consolidated Platinum (Ltd.), which is said to have contracted to market virtually all of the new platinum production of Soviet Russia, Canada, South142 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Africa, and Colombia, the major part of the world's production of that metal. The international zinc cartel was revived for a period of five years at a meeting in Brussels in July, 1931. The new agreement provides for production quotas and a drastic cut in output for producers in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, England, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Spain. The international aluminum cartel was reorganized in October 1931, under the name of the Alliance Aluminum Compagnie A. G. of Basel, Switzerland. It now includes the Canadian industry as well as that of Switzerland, Germany, France, and Great Britain. Small producers in Austria and Norway and subsidiaries of German and Swiss controlling companies in Italy, Austria, and Spain are also associated. A marketing agreement among producers of viscose rayon in Ger. many, Italy, Holland, and Switzerland was effected in 1931, and more recent reports are to the effect that French and Belgian producers may join the group. Meetings of European and British dye interests in November, 1931,. and February, 1932, resulted in agreement by the British industry to join the continental dye cartel already effective between German. French, and Swiss producers. The purpose of the new pact is said to be to control prices and divide the world's markets among the producers represented. Producers of pencils in Germany and Czechoslovakia entered into an international agreement in January, 1932. It is said that marketing quotas will be established and scientific and technical research pooled. A German-Belgian agreement on coal was signed in August, 1931, for a 4-month period, whereby imports of coal into Belgium should be reduced by about one-half and the Belgian output should be curtailed. Coal-mine owners from seven European countries held a. conference in London in the fall of 1931, but failed to reach an agreement. The coal industry was the subject of a special study and report by the economic committee of the League of Nations early in 1932, in which rationalization of the industry and negotiation of an internatio nal commercial agreement for the marketing of coal were recommended. The economic committee of the League of Nations issued a general. report on the Economic Aspects of International Industrial Agreements (Official No. E 736) in October, 1931, in which the effects of some of these agreements upon the industries, upon consumers, upon labor were discussed.PART VII.

The eligibility of a director under the foregoing provision shall be determined by the aggregate amount of the capital, surplus, and undivided profits, exclusive of dividends declared but not paid to stockholders, at the end of the fiscal year of said corporation next preceding the election of directors, and when a director has been elected in accordance with the provisions of this act it shall be lawful for him to continue as such for one year thereafter.

That authority to enforce compliance with sections two, three, seven, and eight of this act by the persons respectively subject thereto is hereby vested: in the Interstate Commerce Commission where applicable to common carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce act, as amended; in the Federal Communications Commission where applicable to common carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio transmission of energy; in the Federal Reserve Board where applicable to banks, banking associations, and trust companies; and in the Federal Trade Commission where applicable to all other character of commerce, to be exercised as follows: Whenever the commission, authority, or board vested with jurisdiction thereof shall have reason to believe that any person is violating or has violated any of theTHE CLAYTON ACT 159 provisions of sections two, three, seven, and eight of this act, it shall issue and serve upon such person a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the commission, authority, or board requiring such person to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. Any person may make application, and upon good cause shown, may be allowed by the commission, authority, or board, to intervene and appear in said proceeding by counsel or in person. The testimony in any such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the commission, authority, or board. If upon such bearing the commission, authority, or board, as the case may be, shall be of the opinion that any of the provisions of said sections have been or are being violated, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violations, and divest itself of the stock held or rid itself of the directors chosen contrary to the provisions of sections seven and eight of this act, if any there be, in the manner and within the time fixed by said order. Until a transcript of the record in such hearing shall have been filed in a circuit court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided, the commission, authority, or board may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify or set aside in whole or in part, any report. or any order made or issued by it under this section. If such person fails or neglects to obey such order of the commission, authority, or board while the same is in effect, the commission, authority, or board may apply to the circuit court of appeals of the United States, within any circuit where the violation complained of was or is being committed or where such person resides or carries on business, for the enforcement of its order, and shall certify and file with its application a transcript of the entire record in the proceeding, including all the testimony taken and the report and order of the commission, authority, or board. Upon such filing of the application and transcript the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have Jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the commission, authority, or board. The findings of the commission, authority, or board as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfa ction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the commission, authority, or board, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the commission, authority, or board and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manne r and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The commission, authority, or board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive, and its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order, with the return of such additional evidence. The Judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided in section two hundred and forty of the Judicial Code. Any party required by such order of the commission, authority, or board to cease and desist from a violation charged may obtain a review of such order in said circuit court of appeals by filing in the court a written petition praying that the order of the commission, authority, or board be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the commission, authority, or board, and thereupon the commission, authority, or board forthwith shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record as hereinbefore provided. Upon the filing of the transcript the court shall have the same jurisdiction to affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the commission, authority, or board as in the case of an application by the commission, authority, or board for the enforcement of its order, and the findings of the commission, authority, or board as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall in like manner be conclusive. The Jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals of the United States to enforce, set aside, or modify orders of the commission, authority, or board shall be exclusive.160 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Such proceedings in the circuit court of appeals shall be given precedence over other cases pending therein, and shall be in every way expedited.

That the words \"trade within the United States\" wherever used in this act mean trade or commerce among the several States or in any Territory of the United States, or in the District of Columbia, or between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory or Territories and any State or States or the District of Columbia, or between the District of Columbia and any State or States. That the word \"Association\" wherever used in this act means any corporation or combination, by contract or otherwise, of two or more persons, partnerships, or corporations. SEC. 2. That nothing contained in the act entitled \"An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies,\" approved July second, eighteen hundred and ninety, shall be construed as declaring to be illegal an association entered into for the sole purpose of engaging in export trade and actually engaged solely in such export trade, or an agreement made or act done in the course of export trade by such association, provided such association, agreement, or act is not in restraint of trade within the United States, and is not in restraint of the export trade of any domestic competitor of such association: And provided further, That such association does not, either in the United States or elsewhere, enter info any agreement, understanding, or conspiracy, or do any act which artificially or intentionally enhances or depresses prices within the United States of commodities of the class exported by such association, or which substantially lessens competition within the United States or other wise restrains trade therein. SEC. 3. That nothing contained in section seven of the act entitled \"An act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes\", approved October fifteenth, nineteen hundred and fourteen, shall be construed to forbid the acquisition or ownership by any corporation of the whole or any part of the stock or other capital of any corporation organized solely for the purpose of engaging in export trade, and actually engaged solely in such export trade, unless the effect of such acquisition or ownership may be to restrain trade or substantially lessen competition within the United States. SEC. 4. That the prohibition against \"unfair methods of competition\" and the remedies provided for enforcing said prohibition contained in the Art entitled \"An act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to define its powers and duties, and for other purposes\", approved September twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and fourteen, shall be construed as extending to unfair methods of competition used in export trade against competitors engaged in export trade, even though the acts constituting such unfair methods are done without the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. SEC. 5. That every association now engaged solely\" in export trade, within sixty days after the passage of this act, and every association entered into hereafter which engages solely in export trade, within thirty days after its creation, shall file with the Federal Trade Commission a verified written statement setting forth the location of its offices or places of business and the names and addresses of all its officers and of all its stockholders or members, and if 161162 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION a corporation, a copy of its certificate or articles of incorporation and by-laws, and if unincorporated, a copy of its articles or contract of association, and on the first day of January of each year thereafter it shall make a like statement of the location of its offices or places of business and the names and addresses of all its officers and of all its stockholders or members and of all amendments to and changes in its articles or certificate of incorporation or in its articles or contract of association. It shall also furnish to the com- mission such information as the commission may require as to its organiza tion, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other associations, corporations, partn erships, and individuals. Any association which shall fail so to do shall not have the benefit of the provisions of section two and section three of this act, and it shall also forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each and every day of the continuance of such failure, which forfeiture shall be payable into the Treasury of the United States, and shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the United States brought in the district where the association has its principal office, or in any district in which it shall do business. It shall be the duty of the various district attorneys, under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, to prosecute for the recovery of the forfeiture. The costs and expenses of such prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the courts of the United States. Whenever the Federal Trade Commission shall have reason to believe that an association or any agreement made or act done by such association is in restraint of trade within the United States or in restraint of the export trade of any domestic competitor of such association, or that an association either in the United States or elsewhere has entered into any agreement, understanding, or conspiracy, or done any act which artificially or intentionally enha nces or depresses prices within the United States of commodities of the class exported by such association, or which substantially lessens competition within the United States or otherwise restrains trade therein, it shall summon such association, its officers, and agents to appear before it, and thereafter conduct an. investigation into the alleged violations of law. Upon investigation, if it shall conclude that the law has been violated, it may make to such association recommendations for the readjustment of its business, in order that it may thereafter maintain its organization and management and conduct its business in accordance with law. If such association fails to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Trade Commission, said commission shall refer its findings and recommendations to the Attorney General of the United States for such action thereon as he may deem proper. For the purpose of enforcing these provisions the Federal Trade Commission shall have all the powers, so far as applicable, given it in \"An act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to define its powers and duties, and for other purposes.\" Approved, April 10, 1918.PROCEDURE AND POLICY POLICY IN PURELY PRIVATE CONTROVERSIES It shall be the policy of the commission not to entertain proceedings of alleged unfair practices where the alleged violation of law is a purely private controversy redre ssable in the Courts except where said practices substantially tend to affect the public. In cases where the alleged injury is one to a competitor only and is redressible in the courts by an action by the aggrieved competitor and the interest of the public is not substantially involved, the proceeding will not be entertained. SETTLEMENT OF CASES BY STIPULATION The end and object of all proceedings of the Federal Trade Commission is to end all unfair methods of competition or other violations of the law of which it is given jurisdiction. The law provides for the issuance of a complaint and a trial as procedure for the accomplishment of this end. But it is also provided that this procedure shall be had only when it shall be deemed to be in the public interest, plainly giving the commission a judicial discretion to be exercised in the particular case. It has been contended that the language of the statute using the word \"shall\" is mandatory, but in view of the public-interest clause no member of the commission as now constituted holds or has ever held that the statute is mandatory. Hence, the proposed rule for settlement of applications for complaint by stip- ulation may be considered on its merits. If it were not for the public-interest clause it might appear that the statute would be mandatory. It remains to determine what effect the public-interest clause has. In the interest of economy and of dispatch of business as well as the desirability of accomplishing the ends of the commission with as little harm to respondents as possible, therefore all cases should be so settled where they can be except where the public interest demands otherwise. But when the very business itself of the proposed respondent is fraudulent, it may well be considered by the commission that the protection of the public demands that the regular procedure by complaint and order shall prevail. Indeed, there are some cases where that is the only course which would be of any value at all. As for instance the so-called \"blue-sky cases\" and all such where the business itself is inherently fraudulent or where a business of a legitimate nature is conducted in such a fraudulent manner that the commission is warranted in the belief that no agreement made with the proposed respondent will be kept by him. The rule shall be that all cases shall be settled by stipulation except when the public interest demands otherwise for the reasons set forth above. ON AFFORDING PROSPECTIVE RESPONDENTS OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW CAUSE WHY COMPLAINT SHOULD NOT ISSUE Except as hereinafter provided, the board of review, before it shall recoin- mend to the commission that a complaint issue in any case, shall afford the proposed respondent a hearing to show cause why a complaint should not issue. Such hearing shall be informal in character and shall not involve the taking of testimony. The proposed respondent shall be permitted to make or submit such statements of fact or law as he shall desire. The extent and control of such hearing shall rest with a majority of the board. The respondent shall have three weeks' notice of the time and place of hearing, to be served on the respondent by the secretary of the commission. Provided, That if in any case the majority of the board shall be of opinion that a hearing is not required because (a) the respondent has been fully interviewed and has given to the examiner every fact or argument that could be 163164 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION offered as a defense, or (b) the practice has been fully established and is of such character that in the nature of the case nothing could be adduced in mitigation, or (c) to delay the issuance of a complaint to afford a hearing might result in a loss of Jurisdiction, or (d) otherwise unnecessary or incompatible with the public interest, the board may transmit the case to the commission, via the docket section, with its conclusions and recommendations, without a hearing, as in this rule provided. ON PUBLICITY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF CASES In the settlement of any matter by stipulation before complaint is issued, no statement in reference thereto shall be made by the commission for publication. After a complaint is issued, no statement in regard to the case shall be made by the commission for publication until after the final determination of the case. After a complaint has been issued and served the papers in the case shall be open to the public for inspection, under such rules and regulations as the secretary may prescribe. It has been the rule, which is now abolished, to issue a statement upon the filing of a complaint, stating the charges against a respondent. Concerning the withholding of publicity where cases are settled by stipulation without complaint, the custom has always been not to issue any statement The so-called applicant or complaining party has never been regarded as a party in the strict sense. The commission is not supposed to act for any applicant, but wholly in the public interest. It has always been and now is the rule not to publish or divulge the name of an applicant or complaining party, and such party has no legal status before the commission except where allowed to intervene as provided by the statute. ON DEALING WITH UNFAIR COMPETITION THROUGH TRADE-PRACTICE CONFERENCES The trade-practice conference affords, broadly stated, a means through which representatives of an industry voluntarily assemble, either at their own instance or that of the commission, but under the auspices of the latter, for the purpose of considering any unfair practices in their industry, and collectively agreeing upon and providing for their abandonment in cooperation with and with the support of the commission. This procedure deals with an industry as a unit. It is concerned solely with practices and methods, not with individual offenders. It regards the industry as occupying a position comparable to that of friend of the court\" and not as that of the accused. It wipes out on a given date all unfair methods condemned at the conference and thus places all competitors on an equally fair competitive basis. It performs the same function as a formal complaint with out bringing charges, prosecuting trials, or employing any compulsory process, but multiplies results by as many times as there are members in the industry who formerly practiced the methods condemned and voluntarily abandoned. The beneficial results of this form of procedure are now well established, and the commission is always glad to receive and Consider requests for the holding of trade-practice conferences. 2 1 The commission does. however, after omitting the names of the proposed respondents, make public digests of cases in which it accepts stipulations of the facts an agreements to cease and desist. 2 The commission has prepared and published for public distribution a pamphlet entitled \" Trade Practice Conferences,\" in which the history, theory, and working of this procedure and the various trade- practice conferences theretofore held by the commission are described.RULES OF PRACTICE I.

The commission shall investigate the matters complained of in such application, and if upon investigation the commission shall have reason to believe that there is a violation of law over which the commis sion has jurisdiction, and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, the commission shall issue and serve upon the party complained of a complaint stating its charges and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed, at least 40 days after the service of said complaint. III.

Reports transmitted February 21, 1927, and January 12, 1928. Empire Cotton Growing Corpor ation (S. Res. 817, 68th Cong., 2d sess., January 27, 1925).--This inquiry concerned the development, methods, and activities of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, a British company. The report discusses world cotton production and consumption and concludes that there is little danger of serious competition to the American cotton grower and that it will be many years before there is a possibility of the United States losing its position as the largest producer of raw cotton. Transmitted February 28, 1925. Export Grain (S. Ra 133, 67th Cong., 2d sess., December 22, 1921).--The low prices of export wheat gave rise to this inquiry, which developed extensive and harmful speculative manipulation of prices on the grain exchanges and conspiracies among country grain buyers to agree on maximum prices for grain purchased.

Flags (S. Res. 35, 65th Cong., 1st sess., April 16, 1917).--A sudden increase in the prices of American flags led to this inquiry, which disclosed that while a trade association had been active to fix prices shortly before the price advance had been so great on account of the war demand that further price fixing had been superfluous. Report transmitted July 26, 1917. Flour Milling (S. Res. 212, 67th Cong., 2d sess., January 18, 1922) .--A report on the inquiry into the flour-milling industry was sent to the Senate in May, 1924.

Res. 109, 63d Cong., 1st sess., June 18, 1913).--The report on this inquiry, which was begun by the Bureau of Corporations, showed the dominating importance of the pipe lines in the great mid-cont inent oil fields, and that the pipe-line companies, which were controlled by a few large oil companies, not only charged excessively high rates for transporting petroleum but also evaded their duties as common carriers by insisting on unreasonably large shipments, to the detriment of the numerous small producers.

Res. 533, 66th Cong., 2d sess., June 3, 1920).--All inquiry into the prices of leaf tobacco and the selling prices of tobacco products. The unfavorable relationship between them was reported to be due in part to the purchasing methods of the large tobacco companies.

Better systems of grading tobacco were also recommended by the commission. Report transmitted December 11, 1920. Tobacco Prices (S. Res. 129, 67th Cong., 1st sess, August 9, 1921).--This inquiry was also directed to the low prices of leaf tobacco and the high prices of tobacco products.

Res. 329, 68th Cong., 2d sess., February 9, 1925).--The report on this investigation related to the activities of the American Tobacco Co. and the Imperial Tobacco Co. of Great Britain.

Res. 83, 70th Cong., 1st sess., February 15, 1928).--This resolution directed the commission to make an investigation of electric and gas public utility companies and their holding companies with respect to their financial development and practices, the conditions respecting the control of the industry, propagand a in opposition to public ownership, and attempts to in fluence elections to certain offices.
