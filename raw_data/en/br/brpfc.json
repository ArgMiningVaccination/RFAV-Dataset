This chiropractic practice focuses mainly on the nervous system, however there are many other systems such as the digestive, cardiovascular, immune, and nueromusculskeletal systems. Dr. Shahlaye Geer has put together an all-star team of our favorite wellness providers. We've worked hand-in-hand with some team members while others come highly recommended. Feel free to scout out the best players you can find, interview them and make sure that they can provide you what you need to help you create and support your wellness lifestyle. Acupuncturist, Dr. Michael Chen: Acupuncture is a method of encouraging the body to promote natural healing and improve function. This is done by inserting sterilized, stainless-steel needles (that are as fine as a human hair) into specific points located near or on the surface of the skin which have the ability to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions in order to treat a wide variety of illnesses. Dentist, Dr. Carol Summers: We all know what a dentist does. The dental profession has done an exceptional job teaching people about wellness. Although some people do not go to the dentist until they are in pain, few people argue that it is a good idea to see your dentist for preventative care and optimal hygiene. How you take care of your teeth is often a great analogy for how you should think about taking care of your spine. Homeopath, Ivy Wong: Homeopathy is practiced by a wide variety of health-care practitioners, including medical doctors, osteopaths, naturopathic physicians, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, dentists, veterinarians, chiropractors, acupuncturists, nurse midwives, and podiatrists, as well as by professional homeopaths,who practice only homeopathy and are unlicensed in any other discipline. You will find a variety of homeopathic remedies at most health food stores, and these can often be an effective way of relieving symptoms without the use of pharmaceuticals. Massage Therapist, Misha Swaroski: Massage is one of the oldest, simplest forms of therapy and is a system of stroking, pressing and kneading different areas of the body to relieve pain, relax, stimulate, and tone the body. Massage works on the soft tissues (the muscles, tendons, and ligaments) to improve muscle tone. Massage also stimulates blood circulation and assists the lymphatic system (which runs parallel to the circulatory system), improving the elimination of waste throughout the body. Although a single massage will be enjoyable, the effects of massage are cumulative and a course of massage treatments will bring the most benefits. Massage can help reduce fatigue, leaving the person with a feeling of replenished energy. At its best, massage has the potential to restore the individual physically, mentally and spiritually. Rates can range from $50 to $125 per hour depending on who and where you are receiving your massage. You can expect to pay more for someone who is willing to travel to your home of for a spa massage. Medical Doctor, Dr. Aaron Miller: It is best to have a good understanding of what to expect from your medical doctor. Generally speaking, most medical doctors are trained to diagnose and treat disease with the use of pharmaceuticals and/or surgical procedures. It is best to try to develop a relationship with your primary medical doctor so that the doctor can best understand your values and concerns. Studies have shown that a high percentage of people go to their doctor wanting a specific medication that they may have seen advertised. It is no secret that doctors do not have a lot time to spend and often aren't sure whether you are the type of person who is not interested in lifestyle recommendations and just wants a prescription. Or you may be the type of person who would prefer a more conservative approach and prefers not to take medication unless it is absolutely necessary. Do your best to find a medical doctor who is willing to provide you the care you most prefer. Naturopath, Jules Martin: A licensed naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as a medical doctor, but who also studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopath is required to complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology and counseling (to encourage people to make lifestyle changes in support of their personal health). A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician. Nutritionist & Dietician, Amy Sanders: So many different health concerns can be related to the foods we eat, that having a nutritionist or dietician can be a great resource. Nutritionists are professionals who can fully assess your condition including lab testing for allergies and other health concerns. A nutritionist can assist in specific recommendations on nutritional supplements and healthy food choices to help you return to optimal health. Do you know which supplements and vitamins are good for you? A nutritionist can provide a structured nutritional program based on your individual needs. Optometrist, Dr. Ellie Weil: Our eyes are our windows to the world. It is recommended that you be aware of your vision and make sure that you can see clearly. Visiting an optometrist helps to ensure that you are seeing correctly and ensures that for those who need are using the proper strength corrective lenses. Personal Fitness Trainer, Vance Strong: A personal fitness trainer is someone who is trained in recommending exercise programs. This can often include recommending nutritional advice as well. Personal trainers have a variety of certification programs. You may look for a trainer who is a CSCS (Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist) or a CPT (Certified Personal Trainer). The most important thing is to find a trainer with whom you feel comfortable and with whom you would like to work. Knowing what to do is often the easy part; finding someone that will inspire you to stay with the program and keep you accountable to get results is the hard part. Rates can range from $40 to $90 per hour and you can often receive discounts by purchasing packages of sessions. Podiatrist, Dr. David Miles: Podiatrists are responsible for diagnosing and treating foot, ankle, and lower leg disorders, including sports and other injuries. Podiatrists use a range of clinical, surgical, and therapeutic techniques to treat patients. They give professional advice on the prevention of foot problems and on proper care of the foot. Podiatrists work in private practices, hospitals, and clinics. Pilates Instructor, Mika Levi: Pilates has become one of the fastest growing forms of strengthening your core muscles. There are new Pilates studios in cities nationwide. Developed in the 1920s by the legendary physical trainer and founder of The New York Pilates Studio, Joseph H. Pilates, The Pilates Method is an exercise system focused on improving flexibility and strength for the total body without building bulk. Not surprisingly, some of the first people to use the Pilates Method were dancers. The Pilates Method is not just exercise, however, it is a series of controlled movements engaging your body and mind, performed on specifically designed exercise apparatus and supervised by extensively trained teachers. Yoga Instructor, Misha Weis: Yoga is an ancient system of practices originating in India. It is aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to enhance health and well-being. There are many different forms of yoga. Hatha yoga, the most widely practiced form of yoga in the Western world, uses specific postures and breathing exercises. Yoga studios are opening up in cities everywhere. Often fitness centers will offer yoga classes as well. Find somewhere convenient to where you live or work and take advantage of their introductory programs. Almost all studios have specials for people just looking to check it out. "}
