Authorizations of Appropriat ions Expiring on or Before September 30, 2008, by Appropriation Act 9Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations Overview Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is required to report to the Congress on: BAll programs and activities funded for the current fiscal year for which authorizations of appropriations have expired and BAll programs and activities for which authorizations of appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year. That requirement is specified in section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The purpose of that provision is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legisla- tion that must be in place before the regular appropria- tion bills can be considered.\"1 The Role of Authorizations The term \"authorization\" is used to describe two types of laws. The first describes an \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" stat- ute, which creates a federal agency, establishes a federal program, prescribes a federal function, or allows a partic-ular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may maintain a federal agency, program, or function indefinitely, or it may main- tain it for only a specific period. Such an authorization may constitute a direct spending program because it con-tains the direct authority to draw money from the Trea- sury to implement the statute, or it may simply specify a purpose for which a subsequent appropriation is made available. Although enabling statutes, particularly those whose implementation depends on future appropriation action, are necessary for prog rams to operate, authoriza- tions of that type are not the focus of this report. Instead, this report focuses on the second type of law described by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision that authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the program or function established in the enabling stat- ute. Such a provision constitutes guidance to the Con- gress regarding the amount of funding that will be neces-sary to implement the enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be cont ained in the enabling stat- ute or may be provided separately. Such an authorization may be for a specific dollar amount (definite authoriza-tion) or for \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefinite authorization) and may be permanent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this report, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's authorization of appropria-tions has expired. (This report does not address appropri- ations that have never been authorized.) 1. H. Rept. 99-433, at 114 (1985) (Conference report accompany- ing the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report).2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS House and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19th cen- tury\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appropriations that are unauthorized. In both the House and the Senate, legislation containing unauthorized appropriations is subject to a point of order.2 However, House and Senate rules are not self-enforcing. An indi- vidual Representative or Senator must raise a point of order for the rules to be enforced. If no Member raises a point of order, an unauthorized appropriation may pro- ceed through the legislative process. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriations that have expired or will expire, it should not be considered definitive regarding the application of House or Senate rules. What constitutes an \"unauthorized appropriation\" under such rules is determined by the precedents of the House or Senate, and the applicability of those rules is determined by the respective Office of the Parliamentarian. Listings of Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations This report covers all programs funded through the annual appropriation process that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has expired (see Appendix A) or will expire this year (see Appendix B). Each program listing includes the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount (definite or indefinite) authorized in that year. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing commit- tee, and by appropriation act. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonp ermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the first session of the 110th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropria- tions committees, in their reports on general appropria-tion bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never been enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or is scheduled to expire. Many laws establish programs with an authoriza-tion of appropriations that does not expire. The reports of the appropriations committees as well as this report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent. Programs Funded in Fiscal Year 2008 with Expired Authorizations of Appropriations For certain programs and acti vities funded by an appro- priation for fiscal year 2008, the authorization of appro- priations has expired (see the listings in Appendix A). If the applicable 2008 appropriation law (or its legislative history) provides an explicit amount of funding for a pro- gram, that sum is shown under \"Unauthorized FY 2008 Appropriations\" in each listing. If no specific amount is provided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account, or a program that is funded in several appropriation accounts), CBO determines whether the program is still being funded and, if so, how much is allocated for it. If that amount cannot be determined, the listing notes that the specific dollar amount of unauthorized 2008 appro- priations is \"not available\"\u2014meaning that it is not specif- ically identifiable. The Congress has appropriated about $748 billion for fis- cal year 2008 for programs and activities whose authori-zations of appropriations have expired (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). That total is significantly higher than in past years because the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis- cal Year 2008 (H.R. 1585)\u2014which contained about $688 billion in authorizations\u2014was not signed by the President . (Defense programs are normally authorized annually.) Because there is no 2008 authorization act (as of this writing), the appropriations provided in the Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, and the Consolidated 2. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under it. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Sen- ate, where it can be waived, generally by a majority vote.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Laws 110-116 and 110-161, respectively), include about $581 billion for programs and activities whose authorizations have expired. They are shown as such in Appendix A. Other large programs or agencies with expired authorizations include the Coast Guard ($8.7 billion), programs within the Department of State ($ 10.8 billion), and the commu- nity development block grant program ($3.9 billion). Several laws enacted in 2007 and the early months of fis- cal year 2008 provided authorizations for agencies or pro-grams with annual appropriations. They include the National Science Foundation (reauthorized through 2010), the National Institute of Standards and Technol-ogy (through 2010), the Pell Grant program (through 2017), the Head Start program (through 2012), and the Food and Drug Administration (through 2012). Law-makers also enacted temporary authorizations for most farm bill programs (through March 15, 2008), most higher education programs (through March 31, 2008), and certain programs of the Small Business Administra- tion (through May 23, 2008). Authorizations of Appropriations That Expire on or Before September 30, 2008 For certain programs and activities, the authorization of appropriations expires by the end of fiscal year 2008. (Appendix B shows the amounts authorized to be appro- priated in 2008 for the expiring programs and activities, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year.) Definite authorizations contained in laws under the juris- diction of House and Senate authorizing committees that will expire by the end of this fiscal year totaled about $27 billion (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). That total is significantly lower than in previous years because it excludes amounts in the Defense Authorization Act, which cleared the Con- gress but was not signed by the President. Authorizations for intelligence activities are also typically renewed annu- ally. However, the authorization for those activities for 2008 has not yet been enacted. In the interim, section 8084 of the Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, deems as authorized the appropriations for intelligence activities until the enactment of this year's intelligence authoriza- tion act. Some of the large programs and agencies whose authori- zations are expiring in 2008 include the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration (authorized in 2008 at $18.7 billion) and a program to combat HIV/AIDS globally (authorized in 2008 at $3 billion). Indefinite authorizations expiring in 2008 include provisions in the Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act (P .L. 108-96) and the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 (P .L. 108-36).4 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS Table 1.
