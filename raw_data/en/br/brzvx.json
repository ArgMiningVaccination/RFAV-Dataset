Page content [Vaccinations for children](#children) [Vaccinations at-risk groups](#risk_groups) Vaccinations for children In Finland, all children and young people are eligible for vaccinations against 13 different diseases, related secondary diseases and long-term adverse effects (table). Each vaccine is given at an age that provides the child with the optimal protection at the right time. Vaccinations for adults Adults must personally make sure that they have received at least three tetanus, diphtheria and polio vaccines as a primary series. The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccinations given during childhood and youth are boosted in adulthood (table). There is normally no need for a booster for the polio vaccine for adults who have been given the primary vaccine series. The booster is recommended only for those travelling to or from risk countries. Every adult must have protection against measles, rubella and mumps, either through immunity acquired through having had the diseases or a dose of the MMR vaccine. Adults' MMR vaccination protection is boosted if it is inadequate. Vaccination programme by age Table.
