The process of awakening is an ever-unfolding one, a deepening of that which is beyond all words and thoughts. We are in service of discovering that for ourselves. I accidentally ate A high dosage edible I've only eaten edibles like one time and I had a very intense experience I had an edible last night and it was way too much.. it put me on such a bad trip.. there was like pockets of sadness in my mind opening up and I felt like really alone and scared was really intense .. I wanted to escape the pain but I was forced to go through it I had very bad feelings..it was like feeling real intense suffering.. I went to the hospital so they could flush me out or something I was having a panic attack i started becoming afraid .. but then my feelings we're getting better just deep thinking about like we are connected and if I was to die there would be nothing... not a bad nothing not a good nothing it's also everything..I felt like three holes in my mind 1 of static 1 dark suffering 1 love compassion happiness ....I felt like we are lines on paper...we are the paper the pencil and the lines like we are 2D almost.. I felt intense.. I wanted to die.. the feeling of calling out for help ...I remember having the thought that this must be what hell is like its a constant fearing of something bad happening .. but then I started having appreciation for life and everything was so beautiful happiness of just being there I was grateful for this experience "}
