Yet investment in public goods such as clean water and sewage systems remains insu\u000ecient in many developing countries (G\u007f unther and Fink, 2011). It is often argued that democratization or increased political participation can help solve these issues, through increased support for redistribution or overcoming elite capture: most theories predict that extensions of the right to vote to the poor will be as- sociated with increases in government expenditure (e.g., Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Lizzeri and Persico, 2004; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000). But severe public health challenges re- main even in long established democracies, and it does not appear that democratization is associated with lower mortality rates once sample selection is accounted for (Ross, 2006). I use a new model of the extension of voting rights to argue that low investment in public goods can be explained by the opposition of the poor as well as the wealthy. In classic models of franchise extension, poorer citizens demand greater levels of redistribution, hence government spending increases once they are granted the right to vote. However, the same argument may not apply to government expenditure on public goods, since if public goods are normal goods then the poor may prefer lower taxes and lower government expenditure than the middle class. I show that in a framework where the poor pay taxes and governments can only spend on public goods, both the rich and the poor desire lower government expenditure than the middle class. As a result, if the right to vote is extended in order of income (from the highest to the poorest) then the relationship between the franchise and government expenditure is inverted-U-shaped: spending is highest when the middle class control government, and extending voting rights to the poor can reduce government expenditure on public goods. To test this prediction I construct a new dataset of local government expenditure and the 2extent of the local franchise in England and Wales between 1867 and 1910. Britain at this time faced demands for new public goods|such as clean water and sewer systems|similar to those required in developing countries today, and so the political obstacles they encoun- tered are of continuing relevance. Further, the institutional structure present in Britain at this time allows a clean test of the model predictions. Decisions over spending on important local public goods and services|including streets, sewer systems, water supply and refuse collection|were made by town councils, providing variation within a common cultural and institutional environment. However, town councils did not control spending on redistribu- tive transfer expenditure and were also legally constrained in their ability to redistribute through taxation. These facts closely match the assumptions of the model, and allow me to isolate the e ects of franchise extension where governments are constrained in their ability to redistribute. To identify the e ects of extending the franchise to the poor I exploit variation in the level of the local franchise across time and across towns. I argue that, conditional on ob- servable town characteristics, this variation was plausibly exogenous since it was a result of externally imposed national reforms and decisions by other local authorities distinct from town councils. Consequently the variation was unrelated to councils' decisions over public goods expenditure|a claim supported by the fact there is no evidence of any relationship between the parish-level choices a ecting the franchise, and either earlier municipal spending or nancial constraints. The results show strong support for the inverted-U-relationship between the extent of the franchise and two main dependent variables: tax receipts per capita and public goods expenditure per capita. I rst estimate the relationship semi-parametrically using the proce- dure of Baltagi and Li (2002), nding evidence that tax receipts and government expenditure per capita were maximized when approximately 50% of the adult male population had the right to vote. Further extensions, however, were associated with a decline in both taxation 3and spending. I then test the relationship further by estimating panel regressions with linear and quadratic terms in the franchise and including time and year xed e ects. The results are robust to the inclusion of time-varying demographic controls, including potential sources of spurious correlation such as population growth, urban crowding, and the tax base per capita, as well as lagged dependent variables. The remainder of the paper focuses speci cally on the opposition of the poor to expenditure| the downward sloping portion of the inverted-U-curve. First, in Section 5.2, I use the en- franchisement of poor voters by national reforms as a treatment event in a di erence-in- di erence analysis. Using town-level information on the distribution of house rental value, and a poverty de nition based on household budgets, I identify a group of towns where the share of the poor in the electorate increased following the reforms. The results show that, consistent with the theory, the enfranchisement of the poor led to lower public goods spending per capita. In the penultimate section of the paper I focus on the mechanisms driving the opposition of the poor, drawing on reports of political debates in local newspapers. I collect systematic information on twenty years of council elections in one major city, Liverpool, and twenty- four local plebiscites regarding public goods expenditure. These reports demonstrate that, consistent with the model, debate over new expenditure was dominated by questions of cost and taxes, and that the poor were an important political constituency. Alternative mechanisms raised in the previous literature do not t the historical evidence as well. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these ndings outside the con- text of nineteenth-century Britain, particularly in modern developing economies. In recent years development agencies have had increasing interest in passing responsibility for key in- frastructure projects|such as clean water supply|to local governments on the basis that encouraging local participation will encourage more e\u000ecient levels of investment (Bon glioli, 2003). Scholarly papers have investigated the role of increasing political participation and 4avoiding elite capture on improving both legitimacy and the representativeness of politi- cal decisions (Chattopadhyay and Du and Enikolopov, 2012; Olken, 2010). The ndings here suggest that such policies may lead to reductions in spending on critical sanitation infrastructure. 1.1 Related Literature Previous authors have noted that demand for public services may be increasing in income, without discussing the possibility of an inverted-U-relationship (Husted and Kenny, 1997; Kenny, 1978). Other papers have suggested similar non-monotonic relationships with the franchise based on the characteristics of speci c public goods and services, such as the poten- tial for private provision (Epple and Romano, 1996a,b), or their value to speci c occupational sectors Llavador and Oxoby (2005). The results here are more generally applicable, in that they rest on a attribute of consumption utility that applies regardless of the public good in question. Further, I show that the nding holds with progressive taxation, rather than a standard linear tax scheme, as long as all voters are required to pay some tax. This paper is also related to a broader literature investigating why the poor do not \\soak\" the rich.1Major explanations for a lack of radical redistribution have included upward social mobility (e.g., Benabou and Ok, 2001), political institutions (e.g., Iversen and Soskice, 2006), ine\u000eciencies from taxation, (e.g., Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Perotti, 1993), multidimensional policy spaces (e.g., Levy, 2005), and fairness norms (Scheve and Stasavage, 2016). The model in this paper shows that, in certain institutional settings, being very poor is su\u000ecient to explain a unwillingness to raise taxes. Further, in Section 6, I argue that it is a better match with the historical context than those in the previous literature. Empirical studies of the e ects of the extension of the franchise have focused on national- or state-level expenditures, and so overlook many of the key infrastructure investments un- 1See Putterman (1997) and Alesina et al. (2001) for overviews. 5dertaken at city- or town-level. This limitation has led to a focus on redistributive govern- ment expenditure (e.g., Husted and Kenny, 1997; Lott 1999; Aidt et Brown and Hunter, 2004; Baum and Lake, 2003). The evidence that is available does not identify a clear cut e ect of franchise extension on the provision of public goods. Female enfranchisement had no e ect on investment in sanitation infrastructure between 1905 and 1930, although this may re ect the fact that by this point large towns had already invested in these public goods (Miller, 2008). More generally, there is evidence that poorer citizens sometimes oppose government expenditure (Brown, 1988; Harding and Stasavage, 2014; Bursztyn, 2016). Two previous papers have focused on the e ect of local democratic reform in nineteenth- century Britain. Drawing on the model in this paper, Chapman (2018) shows that an 1894 reform reduced the rate of investment in new infrastructure, particularly where local elites were predominantly middle class. Aidt et al. (2010), using a subset of the data in this paper, nd evidence of a \\retrenchment\" e ect, whereby the middle class opposed expenditure on public goods. The results here di er as a result of utilizing a larger, more comprehensive dataset encompassing information from a broader range of accounts and hence more accurate measures of town council spending.2I introduce that dataset in detail in Section 3, but rst I introduce the theoretical model underpinning the empirical predictions. 2Speci cally, I take account of additional expenditure before major extensions of the franchise in 1869 by including the spending by town councils as \\Improvement Commissions\". I also bene t from a much broader and longer panel dataset, as a result of collecting additional data relating to the municipal franchise. 62 Model This section presents a simple model in which the poor and the rich desire lower government expenditure on public goods than the middle class. Consequently, if the franchise is extended rst to the rich, then to the middle class, and then to the poor, the relationship between municipal expenditure and the extent of the franchise is inverted-U-shaped. This prediction results from assumptions relating to the shape of citizens' utility functions, particularly the fact that the poor have a relatively high marginal utility of consumption. Those assumptions are particularly plausible in a low income economy, where poorer citizens may struggle to pay for a su\u000ecient food intake. The rich, on the other hand, oppose higher tax rates because they face a relatively high tax burden. Government spending in the model is limited to the provision of public goods, and all citizens have to pay tax. For exposition purposes, in the main text this is implemented through a linear tax rate but, as shown in Appendix A.1, the results hold when extending the model to incorporate progressive taxation.3Consequently, the model has implications for any setting in which the poorest bear some of the burden of paying for public goods. Consider an individual iwho receives utility from private consumption and from expen- diture on a local public good G. Utility from the public good is dependent on the per capita level of expenditure g=G N, whereNis the town population.4Individuals receive an income yi, with aggregate income denoted by Y. The tax rate and government spending are set through a standard two-candidate simple majority election, in which candidates' promises are binding. A critical assumption in the model is that all citizens pay the taxes that fund the public good. For exposition purposes, in the main text this is implemented through a linear tax 3Speci cally, I consider a tax system which is progressive in the sense that, for some yi, the tax elasticity \u000f(yi) =t0(yi) t(yi)yi>1. In addition, I assume marginal tax rates are between 0 and 1, and are weakly increasing. 4This assumption re ects the fact that, for instance, a xed investment in clean water supply may only be able to serve a certain number of citizens. 7rate 2[0;1], leading to a government budget constraint of G= Y. As such, the utility of individual i is given by: Ui=u(ci) +v(g) Assumeuandvare strictly x!0u0(x) = limx!0v0(x) =1and that the returns to the public good are exhausted at some point: that is, there is some ^G<Y such thatv0\u0010 ^G N\u0011 = 0. In addition, assume the following conditions on the coe\u000ecient of relative risk aversion foru(c),rR(c;u) =\u0000cu00(c) u0(c). 1.@rR(c;u) @c<0. 2. limc!0rR(c;u)>1 and lim c!1rR(c;u)<1. These assumptions state, essentially, that poor individuals are very sensitive to reduc- tions in consumption, but that this is less true of the wealthy. Intuitively, poor households may be unwilling to gamble, since any loss means more to them. Ogaki and Zhang (2001) provide evidence that this form of utility is appropriate in modern-day developing societies with low income households.5 These assumptions are su\u000ecient to give the following proposition:6 Proposition 1. Denoteg\u0003 ias the optimal level of government public goods expenditure per capita for an individual with income yi. Then there exists ~ysuch that: 5One type of utility function that meets these conditions is a subset of Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA) models (Merton, particular, if: u(ci) =1\u0000 \u0012 ci ed for s>0 and 0< < 1. Heres\u00150 can be interpreted as a subsistence level of consumption from which individuals receive no utility (that is below this level they are essentially unable to meet their basic needs). 6All proofs are contained in Appendix A. 81.@g\u0003 i dyi\u00150foryi\u0014~y 2.@g\u0003 i dyi<0foryi>~y This proposition states that the optimal tax rate is inverted-U-shaped in income: the rich and poor desire lower government spending per capita compared with those with medium levels of income. The preferred level of spending is increasing in income until a point, ~ y, after which the preferred amount of spending decreases in income. Intuitively, this is because at low levels of income citizens cannot \\a ord\" spending on the public good, since an increase in taxation moves them to very low levels of disposable income. As income rises, this cost is reduced, increasing the preferred tax rate. However, at the same time, the marginal cost of taxation increases since richer citizens have a greater income to be taxed. Thus eventually demand for per capita public expenditure declines. The next proposition translates these preferences into the level of spending implemented by the government. Denote the most limited (that is the initial) electorate as E0and suppose the right to vote is extended sequentially in decreasing order of income: i.e., a citizen iis only enfranchised once all citizens with yj> yiare already enfranchised. Further, assume that the distribution of income in the town is such that yi6=yjfori6=j,jfijyi\u0015~y; i =2E0gj\u0015 2 andjfijyi<~y; i<~ gj\u0015 2, where ~ denotes the median level of \u0003 ifor all individuals for whomyi\u0015~y(the decreasing part of the optimal tax function). These latter assumptions ensure that the median voter in the initial electorate is su\u000eciently wealthy, and that there some individuals su\u000eciently poor to want a lower tax rate than the rich. Finally, assume thatNandE0are odd. The key testable implication for the empirical analysis is then given by the following proposition. Proposition 2. The tax revenue and amount of government spending per capita will be inverted-U-shaped in the level of the franchise. 9This proposition states that, under assumptions regarding the composition of the elec- torate, extensions of the franchise will initially lead to higher public goods spending and taxation but then, eventually, lower levels of spending on the public good. The empirical analysis in Section 5 tests this proposition in the context of nineteenth- century Britain. The next two sections explain that historical context, introduce the dataset used in that analysis, and discuss the sources of variation in the local franchise that underpin the identi cation strategy. 103 Data I test the existence of the inverted-U-relationship using a new dataset of town expenditure and the extent of the franchise in England and Wales between 1867 and 1900. This section starts by discussing the historical context, and explains how the constraints on local govern- ments closely follow the assumptions of the model. I then introduce the dataset and main variable de nitions used in the empirical analysis. 3.1 Institutional Context The councils of incorporated towns (\\municipal boroughs\") during the nineteenth century were all locally elected but, critically for our analysis, varied in the extent of the franchise| variation I discuss in detail in the following section.7A combination of local and national factors led to extensive variation in the proportion of the adult population holding the right to vote in di erent towns. Town councils faced tight legal constraints over the types of spending they could under- take, and the types of taxes they could levy. Their spending was largely limited to spending on infrastructure and other public goods. For most of the period of the empirical analysis, much of this spending was associated with sanitation|including water supply, sewer sys- tems and paving or cleaning of streets. Later on, in the 1890s, this role expanded to include electricity supply and tram systems. Importantly, however, municipal councils did nothave authority to undertake transfer payments and did not control spending on either welfare (that is poor relief) or on education.8This framework then closely matches the assumptions of the model. 7The councils were locally elected from the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act onward. Interested readers are referred to the Appendix B for the discussion of other speci c Acts that a ected the municipal franchise: for the sake of brevity I refer to most legislative changes only by the dates when they occurred. 8Welfare expenditure was controlled by Boards of Poor Law Guardians. Education spending was deter- mined by local school boards. 11The need to improve urban environments was a major source of political debate following the Industrial Revolution. From the 1840s onward, reacting to squalid urban environments| famous even now, due to the work of Dickens and Engels|sanitary reformers pressed for greater government intervention to improve public health. Yet despite the sanitary bene ts of these investments, the reformers' progress was often stymied by taxpayer opposition to new expenditure that would dramatically increase their tax burden (Hennock, 1973, 1963; Wohl, 1983). Consequently, sanitary conditions remained extremely poor: in Manchester and Liverpool mortality in the decade 1895-1904 was 10% higher than that in New York (Lampard, 1973). Many had to endure truly appalling conditions, as summed up by a contemporary health observer at the endof the nineteenth century: \\...children, even of respectable parents, were encouraged to make a convenience of the open street, if not of the kitchen oor...I have seen without enthusiasm, both earth closets and middens where pails were used ...and the ies that bred in and swarmed around these lthy places also settled thickly about the eyes of the babies in the wretched little houses, whose front doors opened within a few feet of these insanitary conveniences.\" (Quoted in Thompson, 1984, p.141) How could there be continued opposition to increased government expenditure in the light of such conditions? Critically, towns had to raise their own funds to pay for new expenditure, with no recourse to grants from central government. Councils also faced restrictions on the type of taxes they could impose. Tax raising power was limited to taxes on property, and was restricted to a single proportional rate|there was no possibility of a progressive tax rate. Nor was it is possible to impose other taxes, such as business or income taxation, that could have led to a more progressive schedule. Further, taxes fell on all property occupiers, rather than just owners; tax thus became extremely salient in local elections. This tax structure ties closely to the theoretical assumption of a proportional tax rate, if spending on housing as percent of income was similar across income groups. One com- plication not considered in the model, however, is whether the full value of taxation was 12passed onto tenants and not absorbed by landlords through lower rents. The historical ev- idence about the incidence of taxation is somewhat mixed (for instance, see the discussion inHansard , 20 February 1850 col 1118-27). However, for the purposes of the theoretical prediction, it is su\u000ecient that part of the cost was passed on to tenants since the model extends to a situation of progressive (or regressive) taxation. Taxation and the right to vote were tightly connected in nineteenth century England, providing a further parallel between the historical context and the model. Non-payment of taxes disquali ed a citizen from voting, meaning that all tax-payers were also voters. One complication, discussed in detail in Section 4, is that some extensions of the franchise were a result of taxing poor renters for the rst time: meaning the tax base and the franchise moved together (whereas in the model they are independent). In principle, the growing resource could counteract the opposition of the poor to greater spending. In practice, however, this does not appear to have been important: the increase in the tax base following such enfranchisements was \\generally but a small, often an insigni cant fraction\" of the total value (House of Lords, 1859, p.v). Further, the empirical results are unchanged when controlling for the size of the town tax base. 3.2 Data Sources and Variable De nition I now provide an overview of the sample and variables used in the empirical analysis. A more detailed discussion is provided in Appendix B. Table I summarizes the variables used in the regression analysis. Sample The analysis focuses on towns that were both incorporated and had control of sanitary expenditure in 1867 (i.e., the start of the study period). The group of incorporated towns in England included nearly all the largest towns in the country: the major exception was London which was governed under its own set of councils. However, it also included a number of small market towns, due to historical charters obtained prior to the Industrial 13Table I: Descriptive Statistics Variable Obs Mean Std. Dev.

See text and Appendix B for data sources and variable construction. Revolution. A total of 214 towns had been incorporated by 1867; however only 154 had control of sanitary expenditure prior to this date. A further four towns are excluded due to either franchise data that appeared implausibly high (above 90% in some cases) or (in one case) because of di\u000eculties identifying boundary changes. The remaining 150 towns include 92% of the 1881 population of the 214 municipal boroughs incorporated by 1867. Further, they include all towns with population above 100,000 in 1881, and 35 of 41 towns with population above 50,000 in 1881.9 The Extent of the Franchise My measure of the franchise is the male franchise, since the key prediction of the model relates to the extension of voting rights to poorer citizens. This is important since using the total franchise could con ate two (potentially very di erent) 9These gures exclude West Ham and Croydon, which became London Boroughs at a later date. 14sources of changes in the franchise: the broadening of the male franchise, and the extension (for the rst time) of the franchise to women. As discussed in detail in Section 4, it is reasonable to assume that growth in the male franchise involves extensions of the right to vote to poorer citizens. However, this is not necessarily the case for women, since their right to vote depended on being a head of household, and it is not clear how the preponderance of female household heads may have varied across income groups. I measure the level of municipal franchise for each sex as follows: Male (female) franchise =Number of male (female) electors Male (female) population of voting age The numerator of the measure is calculated using the number, and gender breakdown, of municipal electors reported in a number of parliamentary papers for ten cross sections between 1864 and 1897. The franchise in intervening years is interpolated using a compound average growth rate. The denominator is calculated using total male and female municipal population collected from decennial censuses, adjusted by the estimated proportion of male and female citizens of voting age, using information from the 1881 census. To account for potential delays between the date of registration and actual change in expenditure, I use the value of the franchise lagged by three years. This time lag is chosen to re ect the fact that municipal councils were elected across a three year period; the results, however, are robust to di erent lag periods (including no lags). To ensure that the results are not driven exclusively by the tails of the franchise distribution, I also exclude the top and bottom 1% of franchise values. The results are, if anything, stronger when including these observations|see Appendix E. Financial Data The analysis uses a new annual panel dataset for the years 1867 to 1910.10 10Since data on the franchise is unavailable after 1900, nancial data for the years 1901{1910 is used only to estimate the ongoing expenditure measure discussed below and is not used in the main regressions (the year 1901 is used when aggregating the data into ve year periods in the analysis in Table IV). 15The dataset was constructed from the Local Taxation Returns contained in the Parliamen- tary Papers collection. These nancial accounts detail the sources of revenue and types of expenditure in each town. Financial values are then translated into constant values using the Rousseaux Price Index (Mitchell, 1971, pp. 723-4) following Millward and Sheard (1995). I construct three measures of government revenue and expenditure: tax revenue per capita and two measures of public goods expenditure. The rst includes all public goods expenditure. This has the advantage of being available for the whole period from 1867 onwards|expenditure was not generally disaggregated before 1872. After 1890 some street expenditure was nanced by transfers from the newly reformed County Councils and, as such, this is subtracted from overall street expenditure. One concern is that the nancial accounts do not di erentiate between investment and ongoing (e.g., maintenance) expenditure on public goods. As a result, it is clear from inspec- tion of the dataset that there are a large number of extremely high one time expenditures (see Appendix Figure A.IV). To deal with this issue, I construct a measure of ongoing ex- penditure. To separate ongoing expenditure from investment expenditure, I rst identify \\investment periods\" by analyzing deviations in trend expenditure for each type of expen- diture. In non-investment periods, the level of ongoing expenditure is simply the per capita expenditure in that period. In investment periods, the level of ongoing expenditure is the level of expenditure in the next non-investment period. For instance, if 1873 and 1874 were investment periods, but 1875 was not, then the level of per capita expenditure in 1873 and 1874 is set equal to that in 1875. Investment periods are identi ed using both the level and year-on-year increase in expen- diture.11An investment period is identi ed as starting either when a town begins spending 11Appendix B.2 contains full details of the methodology used to identify investment periods, and plots the unadjusted versus the adjusted spending data. An alternative approach is to simply remove the obser- vations with very high values from the analysis as outliers. There is still strong support for the inverted-U- relationship, for instance, when excluding the highest 1% or 5% of observations of expenditure per capita on public goods in year. However this approach has the di\u000eculty that it may be biased against towns with 16for the rst time, when year-on-year expenditure increases by more than 100%, or if the town's per capita expenditure is higher than twice the median of per capita expenditure in the town in future years. An investment period is then identi ed as continuing until expen- diture falls signi cantly again, relatively both to other towns and future expenditure in the same town. Prior to the existence of disaggregated data in 1872, investment periods are also identi ed if expenditure is more than twice the aggregated 1872 ongoing expenditure. The results are robust to alternative ways of identifying these periods. The accounts also report the size of the tax base|the aggregate \\rateable\" value of property in the district|in each town. Data are available (almost) annually from 1872 onwards, and also for 1866 and 1870: values for missing years are interpolated linearly. Census Data Information regarding the population and number of inhabited houses for each town were gathered from census reports between 1861 and 1901, and from the parish- level statistics for the 1911 census gathered by Southall et al. (2004).12I interpolate between these census years to create an annual data series. I construct three demographic variables using this information: a categorical popula- tion measure, \\urban crowding\": de ned as (population/number of houses), and population growth. In addition to these variables, I also include information regarding the occupational structure, and the percentage of men that were household heads in the town using data from 100% census samples|see Appendix B.4 for more details. generally high expenditure, and may lead to bias by excluding periods when important expenditure occurred. 12An \\inhabited house\" in this context was de ned as a distinct building which was inhabited, including \\all space within the external and party walls of a building\" (Newman, 1971, p.11). 174 Variation in the Extent of the Franchise The extent of the franchise varied considerably across towns and across time, as we can see in Figure I. This section starts by discussing the regulations that determined that variation, and a series of major national reforms that caused large expansions in the franchise over time. In particular, the regulations mean that the variation in the level of the franchise re ects di erences in the extent to which the poor were able to vote|an important assumption of the model. I then analyze the sources of the cross-sectional variation in voting rights, providing historical and quantitative evidence that franchise decisions were made independently of municipal concerns. Consequently, the franchise variation is plausibly exogenous to the decisions over town spending analyzed in the following section. Figure I: The extent of the franchise varied over time and within individual cross-sections. Density 20 40 60 80 Extent of Male Franchise (% Adult Male Population) 1866 1876 1886 1896 Note: The large expansion of the franchise due to the 1869 reforms is clear from the rightward shift in the distribution between 1866 and 1876. The width of the distribution also decreases, due to the reforms standardizing the franchise regulations across towns. Further increases then occurred as a result of legislation in 1878, 1882, and 1888 that consolidated these 1869 changes. For details of variable construction, see Section 3 and Appendix B. 18At the beginning of our period, the municipal franchise was extended to male heads of household that met three major conditions.13First, they had to have been resident in or near the town for a period of three years prior to each election. Second, they must have paid all local taxes for the previous two and a half years and, third, they could not have received poor relief in the previous year.14A series of national reforms lightened these restrictions and, as result, caused signi cant expansions of the franchise: the median level of the franchise increased by almost 20% of the adult male population between 1866 and 1885.15 The largest increases resulted from a set of reforms in 1869 which enshrined the right of tenants to vote even when paying their taxes indirectly through their landlord. Second, the reforms signi cantly reduced both the length of residence and tax-paying requirements by two years. At the same time women also gained the right to vote, although the restriction to heads of household meant that they remained a small proportion of the electorate. Further reforms, clarifying and consolidating the 1869 changes, then led to further expansions. These national reforms were motivated not by concerns in any particular town, but were rather a follow-on to changes in the Parliamentary franchise. As such they provide shocks to the level of the franchise that are exogenous to municipal concerns. The tax-paying requirement was the major source of disenfranchisement during our pe- riod (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.66{69). Collecting taxes directly from occupiers of low value accommodation could be prohibitively expensive, meaning that such occupiers were often not taxed|and hence were unable to vote. In some areas, tax collectors collected taxes from landlords on behalf of their tenants, often in return for a discount of around 25%|a practice known as \\compounding\". However, taxes could only be collected in this way if 13The historical discussion in this section draws heavily on Keith-Lucas (1952), especially pp.66{74. 14These restrictions di ered from those governing the right to vote in Parliamentary election, particularly in not imposing any minimum threshold for property occupation. See Appendix C.2 for details. 15The right to vote was only given to heads of households, and so these gures indicate that by the 1880s a very high proportion of households had the right to vote in these towns. This also explains the comparatively low level of the female franchise since, in 1881, fewer than 7% of adult women were heads of household. 19parishes obtained the authority to do so under an Act of Parliament|leading to variation across (and within) towns in both whether and how compounding was practiced and, even if was, whether these so-called \\compounders\" then had the right to vote. The 1869 and later reforms reduced this variation by both allowing compounding everywhere, and clarifying that compounders did, indeed, have the right to vote. The fact that it was poor renters that were disenfranchised by the regulations is im- portant, as it means that the historical context meets the theoretical assumption that the franchise would be extended in descending order of income.16Appendix D.1 provides quan- titative support for this claim, showing that the pre-reform franchise was lower where those with the right to vote in Parliamentary elections (who were generally wealthier) were over- represented in the electorate. In addition, regressions show that the franchise was higher in towns with a higher percentage of compounders in the electorate before 1869. The change in the franchise following the 1869 reforms was, in contrast, lower in those towns|evidence that the reforms enfranchised poor renters. The variation in whether compounding occurred|and hence poor renters enfranchised| is plausibly exogenous to town spending for three reasons. First, it was parish authorities, rather than town councils, making decisions over whether and how to adopt relevant leg- islation. Second, the precise legislative mechanism used to enable compounding a ected the franchise in ways that could not have been predicted when making adoption decisions. Third, poorly worded national legislation meant continued uncertainty even after legislation was adopted locally. I rst explicate each of these points, and then directly test whether parishes' decision to adopt compounding is correlated with municipal characteristics. Crucially, decisions over adopting the additional powers were made by parish authorities rather than municipal councils. Parishes were small geographic units, with boundaries that 16The long residence requirements would also fall more heavily on poorer citizens, who would move more often and not be tracked by parish o\u000ecials (House of Commons, 1878, para 2204). 20di ered considerably from the towns making spending decisions. There were generally several parishes within a town, and parishes often fell only partly within a town boundary.17Parish responsibilities in this period consisted largely of managing the collection of taxes for both municipal and poor relief purposes, and parish o\u000ecials decided who was rated for taxation, and how taxation was collected.18It was thus parishes that could seek, and be granted, the right to compound. Signi cant variation in the adoption of compounding emerged after the 1850 Small Ten- ements Rating Act (henceforth STRA). Prior to 1850, obtaining the right to engage in compounding required parishes to obtain a Local Act of Parliament|a costly and di\u000ecult process. The STRA, in contrast, allowed parishes to simply opt-in to these powers, but included a clause ensuring that the compounders would obtain the franchise. Many parishes chose to adopt the Act, and in doing so saw large increases in the expansion of the municipal franchise|across towns where it was (at least partially) adopted the electorate grew from 101,338 to 254,118 by 1866 (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.67). The take-up of this act is thus critical to the variation in the franchise before 1866. Historical evidence indicates that parishes did not consider the e ect on the municipal franchise when making decisions over adopting the STRA. An 1859 Select Committee com- mented that \\as it bestows no parochial votes on the tenement holders, it is not surprising that the vestries should look at the question of its adoption merely in a nancial point of view\"(House of Lords, 1859, p.vii). Further, di erent parishes within a town varied in their decisions over the STRA, indicating that municipal concerns were at most only one factor 17Only 22% of towns were comprised of a single complete parish in 1871, with almost 50% containing more than 3 parishes. Several towns contained over twenty parishes. Calculations using House of Commons (1872a). 18Historically parishes played a role in determining poor relief; however after the 1834 New Poor Law decision-making power was passed to Boards of Guardians that governed multiple parishes. However, even though they no longer controlled the level of tax, they were still responsible for rating and tax collection. As such, parishes generally decided whether to seek the power to compound, although there were a small number of exceptions, whereby town councils included compounding as part of Corporation Acts. 21in the decision over adoption. Within a sample of 85 towns, only 33% had adopted the Act within all of their parishes, whereas 47% had adopted it within some parishes.19Finally, Parliament itself failed to anticipate the signi cant e ect the STRA had on the franchise (Keith-Lucas, 1952). Further, the extent to which the adoption of compounding would a ect voting rights was unpredictable in advance. The legal position of compounders was ambiguous, and apart from the STRA, legislation did not make it clear whether paying rates indirectly quali ed tenants to vote. Local authorities turned to the courts, who could come to di ering decisions over similar questions in di erent parts of the country. Even after the 1869 reforms seemingly con rmed that compounders had the right to vote, it remained legally questionable whether this applied regardless of the legislation under which compounding was authorized, and lawyers continued to ght over the issue at least into the 1870s (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.74). The e ect on the franchise was thus determined by the interaction between the initial legislation enabling compounding, poorly worded national legislation (potentially decades later), and the decisions of local justices|all plausibly exogenous to town council decisions. There could, of course, be threats to exogoneity even if parish-level authorities were mo- tivated purely by nancial concerns. Reverse causality is possible if parishes were motivated to adopt the STRA in response to the burden of municipal spending. Alternatively, parish decision-making may have re ected some local characteristic, such as the local tax base or density of poor renters, that could also a ect municipal spending. Both concerns are mit- igated somewhat by the di erences between municipal and parish boundaries, and the fact that poor relief was a much bigger nancial burden for parishes than municipal spending at this time.20However, we can also test the importance of municipal-level issues directly by 19Figures based on data from House of Commons (1866). The sample consists of towns consisting of multiple parishes with coterminous Parliamentary and municipal boundaries in 1866. 20Across England and Wales in 1857, non-poor law bodies accounted for approximately 22% of the revenue raised by parishes. Across fourteen Poor Law Unions identi ed as being part of Britain's biggest cities by Szreter (2005), the percentage was 24%. 22examining the adoption of the STRA at parish-level. The evidence in Table II supports the claim that parishes were not motivated by munic- ipal concerns when deciding whether to adopt the STRA. Here I analyze the take-up of the Act across all parishes in towns represented in Parliament|most, but not all, of which were also represented in Parliament. I rst simply consider whether we see di erent patterns of adoption in parishes within municipal boundaries, and then test directly whether adoption is associated with either the pre-STRA burden of municipal spending,21or two municipal characteristics that could be correlated with spending: occupational structure or the tax base per capita. None of the six speci cations suggest that adoption of the STRA was in uenced by municipal factors. As discussed above, the STRA enfranchised compounders for municipal, but not other, elections; thus we would expect a di erent adoption pattern if the STRA's e ect on the franchise was an important concern for parishes. There is no evidence of such an e ect: the coe\u000ecient regarding being within a municipal boundary is statistically insigni cant and close to zero both across the whole sample (speci cations 1 and 2), and when focusing on the variation within towns where the parliamentary and municipal boundaries di ered (speci cations 3 and 4). Further, speci cations 5 and 6 show no evidence that the willingness to take-up the STRA was una ected by the burden of municipal spending, or town characteristics associated with the demand for public goods. These key parish-level enfranchisement decisions are not correlated with town-level factors. Appendix D.1 presents similar results when estimating regressions at town-level. Again, there is no evidence that either early town spending or the size of the tax base are corre- lated with the pre-reform level of the franchise, or the change in the franchise due to the reforms. Further, there is no evidence that the pre-reform party of the town mayor|who 21The level of town expenditure here includes only municipal spending accounts, and so may miss some additional expenditure. However, this is less of a concern for these earlier years since prior to the 1848 Public Health Act it was considerably more di\u000ecult for councils to invest through these other bodies. 23was responsible for overseeing elections|had any e ect on the change in the level of the franchise, providing reassurance that o\u000ecials could not control the e ects of the reforms on the franchise.

These results o er considerable reassurance that the variation in the franchise is plausibly exogenous to town decisions. In the next section I thus turn to testing the existence of an inverted-U-shaped relationship with government expenditure on public goods. 245 Empirical Results This section tests of the key hypothesis of the model: that the relationship between the extent of the franchise and per capita expenditure on public goods is inverted-U-shaped. Semi-parametric plots show clear evidence that the relationship has the shape predicted by the model; a nding robustly supported by panel regressions with xed e ects. The second subsection uses national reforms as an exogenous shock to the franchise, and shows that towns where poor citizens were enfranchised saw lower growth in public goods spending. 5.1 Tests of the Inverted-U-Relationship I start by allowing a exible relationship between the franchise and the size of government, while assuming a linear relationship with other town characteristics. That is, I estimate the following speci cation: g(\u0001) is a function to be estimated, and \u000fis an error term. Dependent variables include total public goods expenditure per capita, total tax revenue per capita, and sanitation expenditure per capita. As the latter is only available from 1872 onwards, some speci cations focus only on the rst two variables. I also include placebo tests using the total property receipts per capita, as explained in more detail below. Xis a vector of town-speci c time-varying controls; ZandTrefer to town- and year- xed e ects respectively. The e ect of extending the franchise is identi ed based on the assumption that the variation in the franchise is exogenous conditional on four observable characteristics. As discussed in the previous section, cross-sectional di erences in the extent of the franchise were a result of parish-level (not town council) decision-making and legal ambiguities, while 25changes in voting rights were a consequence of national reforms that were exogenous to each town. Nevertheless, there are town characteristics that we might expect to be correlated with both the extent of the franchise and public goods. Town population is linked to our franchise variable by construction, but might also be related to economies of scale in the provision of sanitation. Population growth and urban crowding may a ect demand for public goods, and also the extent of the franchise, because of the head of household and residence requirements. Finally, previous studies suggest that female enfranchisement may be associated with greater demand for public goods, and also capture idiosyncrasies in voter registration. Consequently, I control for these four variables, as well as town and year xed e ects, in all speci cations. To capture possible economies of scale in city size, population is binned into six categories to allow for potential economies of scale, while the other three|population growth, urban crowding, and the female franchise|enter linearly. Town xed e ects control for time-invariant characteristics of towns (e.g., proximity to water supply), and year xed e ects capture common trends in town council expenditure. I start by estimating g(\u0001) semi-parametrically, using the procedure suggested Baltagi and Li (2002) That is, I rst \\residualize\" each dependent variable by deducting predicted values from the parametric part of (1). I then investigate the shape of the relationship between the male franchise and those residuals using a Nadaraya-Watson non-parametric regression. Figure II shows clear evidence of a robust inverted-U-shape relationship for both town tax receipts and spending on public goods|both total spending, and when restricting to only sanitation expenditure. To aid interpretation, each dependent variable is scaled as a percent of the sample median. In all three panels, there is evidence that the dependent variable increases until a franchise of approximately 50% of the adult male population, and then declines beyond this point. This level of the franchise represents around the median level of the franchise prior to the reforms of 1869, and around the 25th percentile of the franchise immediately following the reforms. The more limited data available for sanitation 26expenditure|available only from 1872 onward|is re ected in the less emphatic upward sloping portion of the curve. The gure also suggests that the estimated e ects of franchise extension were economi- cally signi cant, and robust to inclusion of additional alternative control variables|a nding reinforced in Table III below. First, I include a measure of the tax base per capita. This variable captures potential wealth e ects in the town, and also controls for the fact that an in- creasing franchise could, in principle, be associated with a higher tax base (see Section 3.1).22 Town occupational structure provides an alternative source of variation in demand for pub- lic goods|water supply was, for example, demanded partly for industrial purposes (Hassan, 1985)|and so I control for the percentage of the population engaged in agriculture and commerce, and the percentage of the population heads of household.23I include population{ decade xed e ects to capture the fact that there may have been di erential take-up of new public goods (e.g., trams, or electricity supply) according to town size. Finally, I include lagged dependent variables to capture di erences in prior investment in public goods. None of these lead to major changes in the shape of the observed relationship between the size of government and the franchise. The existence of an inverted-U-relationship is also demonstrated when modeling g(\u0001) with a standard quadratic speci cation, as shown in the rst six columns of Table III. These speci cations support the visual relationships for the three dependent variables in Figure II. In nearly every case, the quadratic terms are both individually and jointly statistically signi cant|with the sole exception (the coe\u000ecient on the linear term speci cation (6)) likely re ecting the fact that sanitation data is not available before 1872. Further, they meet Lind and Mehlum (2010)'s test, which tests the joint restriction that the relationship should 22This variable also addresses an alternative potential connection between the franchise and the tax base: that poorer towns were forced to tax the poor and hence give them the right to vote. However the analysis in Table II has already demonstrated that this does not occur to have been the case. 23This latter variable is included to account for possible di erences in the presence of servants (and so town wealth), since not being a head of household could directly lead to male disenfranchisement. 27be positive at lower franchise levels, and negative at higher levels. Additional regressions reported in Appendix E con rm that similar results hold when including the additional control variables. There is consistent evidence that extending voting rights led to signi cant declines in the town spending after around half of the male population was enfranchised.24 Figure II: Semi-parametric regression shows inverted-U-relationship between franchise and both per tax receipts and expenditure. 60800Spending per Capita (% Median) 20 40 60 80 Male Franchise (% Adult Male Population)Public Goods Spend per Capita 60800Revenue per Capita (% Median) 20 40 60 80 Male Franchise (% Adult Male Population)Tax Receipts per Capita 60800Spending per Capita (% Median) 20 40 60 80 Male Franchise (% Adult Male Population)Sanitary Spend per Capita (from 1872 Only) Main Results Occupational Controls Tax Base p.c.

All speci cations include include year and town xed e ects, female franchise, population (in 6 bins), urban crowding and population growth in all speci cations. The relationship is estimated using annual nancial data from 1867{1900, with franchise data lagged three years. \\Occupational controls\" include the % of the population engaged in agriculture, the % in commerce, the % of men over 20 that are heads of household. \\Population x Decade FE\" allows for di erential time trends for each population category. The procedure is as follows. First, the parametric element of the speci cation is estimated using the Baltagi and Li (2002) xed e ects estimator for partially linear data models. The residuals are then plotted above using a Nadaraya-Watson nonparametric regression with an Epanechnikov kernel, and bandwidth of 3. 24See Appendix Tables A.XVII and A.XVIII for details. In addition to the inclusion of the control variables in Figure II, I also include a speci cation replacing the dummy variables for population with a quartic in town population. 28I use the quadratic speci cation due to ease of interpretation, however the inverted-U- relationship is strongly supported when allowing for a more exible relationship. In Ap- pendix E.1 I model the relationship with fractional polynomials, allowing for a much wider range of non-linear shapes|not imposing, for instance, symmetry.25The estimated turning points are similar and, for total publics goods spending, the quadratic provides the best t to the data. The nal two columns of Table III present the results of a placebo test, showing that the inverted-U-relationship is not driven, in some way, by the structure of the data. The dependent variable here is the per capita town receipts from property sales and rents|a variable over which the town councils had limited control because it was determined by the extent of their estates, which varied considerably across towns.26As we can see, there is no evidence of a relationship|and the signs of the coe\u000ecients are inconsistent with an inverted-U-shaped relationship. 25Speci cally, the approach compares the t of models based on choosing from a set of fractional powers, as well as allowing for logarithmic relationships. Following Royston and Altman (1994), I allow the degrees to be chosen from the set f-2,-1,-0.5,0,0.5, 1, 2 ,3 g, where a degree of 0 refers to log(x), and non-zero degrees refer to exponents. 26See Millward and Sheard (1995) for discussion of the variation in estate holdings across towns. The relationship is also weak and statistically insigni cant when allowing for a linear relationship with the franchise, with coe\u000ecients of 0.10 (S.E.=0.17), and 0.16 Variable (per Capita, % of Median): Public Goods Spend Tax ReceiptsSanitation Spend Property Receipts (from 1872 only) (Placebo, from 1872 only) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Panel A: Inverted-U-Shape Turning Point (%) 52 53 44 43 48 50 39 F-test Variable: Increase ( fran\u0014T) 44 42 15 11 34 20 - - Decrease ( fran\u0015T) 37 28 37 31 50 43 - - Panel B: Regression Details No. Towns 150 149 150 149 150 149 150 149 Year Fixed E ects Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Town Fixed E ects Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Demographic Controls Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Occupation Controls N Y N Y N Y N Y Tax Base per Capita N Y N Y N Y N Y Note: Panel A shows the details of the inverted-U-shape estimated from the quadratic speci cations using annual nancial data for 1867{ 1900. \\F-test\" relates to a test of joint signi cance of the two franchise variables.

In these speci cations, I separate the data into six equally spaced time ve-year periods (1867-1871, 1872-1876, etc.) around the reforms. By doing so I focus the identi cation on the changes in the franchise resulting from these reforms, and also avoid the extensive interpolation needed to construct the annual franchise data used in the main speci cations.27Again, the results demonstrate an inverted-U-relationship with a turning point when around half of adult men are enfranchised. The inverted-U-relationship is robust to varying the sample of towns used in the regressions| results are reported in Appendix E.2. To check the results re ect within-town variation| rather than di erences between towns with a low franchise (to the left of the turning point) and those with a high franchise|I re-estimate the results using only those towns initially below the turning points identi ed in Table III. I also report speci cations with i) a balanced panel of towns, ii) including towns excluded as outliers due to very high or very low values of the franchise, and iii) removing the top or bottom 10% of the sample of population and (separately) removing towns in the top and bottom decile of the 1873 tax base per capita. The conclusions are similar in all cases. 27These speci cations use franchise data only from years the number of electors was reported to estimate the average level of the franchise in each 5 year period. Some towns had missing data for speci c years: in this case I use the interpolated data. 31Table IV: Inverted-U-shape evident when aggregating data into 5 year periods.

I use information on local income distributions to estimate where national reforms enfranchised the poor, and where 32new voters consisted of only \\middle class\" individuals. This approach accounts for the fact that two towns could have very di erent electorates even if they had exactly the same percentage of the population enfranchised. To identify the e ect of the reforms on the composition of the electorate, I take advantage of an 1866 Parliamentary Paper reporting the distribution of housing rental values in those towns represented in Parliament.28I then seek to de ne a group of \\poor\" voters whose in- come is low enough that they would fall on the downward sloping portion of the inverted-U: according to the model, towns where such voters were enfranchised will have lower expendi- ture than towns with a more restricted franchise.29To do so, I de ne a household as \\poor\" if the rental value is less than the average rent paid by an urban working class household (estimated using information from Horrell (1996)). I then estimate the percentage of voters that were poor in each town on the basis of two assumptions: rst that all compounders (indirect tax payers) were poor and, second, that the franchise was extended in the order of income. With this measure in hand, I examine the e ect of the reforms by de ning a \\treatment\" group of towns in which the proportion of poor voters increased between 1866 and 1879. Using this binary measure ensures the results are not driven by variation regarding the percentage of new poor voters|which could more plausibly be within the control of elites| but just whether the reforms increased the share of poor voters at all.30I then compare changes in spending and revenue in the two groups across three periods: pre-reform (1867{ 1872), immediately post-reform (1873{1878), and after the reforms have consolidated (1879{ 1884).31 28Appendix D.2 provides full details of the construction of this variable, and Appendix D.3 demonstrates that the results here are robust to alternative de nitions of \\poor\" households. 29The de nition of poor here does not, however, seek to identify all voters on the downward portion of the curve; hence even if these voters are not enfranchised, the franchise may be broad enough to generate opposition to spending. 30However, as shown in Appendix D.3 the results are similar when using a continuous measure. 31The pre-reform period includes years after 1869 on the basis, as above, that changes in the electorate 33Figure III: Lower growth in spending where poor voters were enfranchised. 0100200 Public Goods Spending Per Capita (% Median) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Share of Poor Voters in Electorate (%)Public Goods Spending 050100 Taxation Per Capita (% Median) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Share of Poor Voters in Electorate (%)Tax Receipts Line of Best Fit Note: The gure displays change in spending over two periods: 1867{1873 and 1879{1884. The x-axis displays the change in the share of \\poor\" voters in the electorate measured in 1866 and 1879 respectively (see Appendix D.2 for details of the construction of this variable). Data on poor voters is only available for towns that were represented in Parliament. There is clear evidence that towns where the poor were enfranchised experienced lower growth in both tax revenue and expenditure, both graphically (Figure III) and in regression analysis (Table V). The gure displays the negative relationship between the change in each dependent variable between the pre-reform to the post-reform period, plotted against the change in the share of poor voters. The regressions then allow us to control for other changes in town characteristics. As a nal test that the relationship is causal, in speci cations (3) and (6) I restrict the sample to those towns in which not all compounders were enfranchised by the Small Tenements Rating Act in 1866. In doing so, I focus on towns in places which had (to varying degrees) opted against such enfranchisement prior to the analysis period. Once again, it is will take some time to a ect town decision-making. As shown in Appendix D.3, the results are similar (but noisier) when using four-year periods, and restricting the analysis to the years 1867{1881. 34clear that the enfranchisement of the poor was followed by both lower tax revenue and lower spending on public goods.

I now focus more sharply on the mechanism underpinning the opposition of the poor to greater public goods provision. The rst subsection starts by showing that the assumption of high marginal util- ity of consumption is reasonable in this context|the poor in nineteenth-century England had insu\u000ecient calories and poor nutrition. It then explains the political economy of town spending decisions, in particular the importance of the poor as a political constituency. This analysis justi es the use of the Median Voter Theorem in the model, and demonstrates the importance of taxation in contemporary political debate. The second subsection then ad- dresses alternative explanations for the empirical results, and explains that they do not t well with the historical context. I analyze the reasons for opposition (and support) to public spending using the newspaper reports of political debates in both town council elections and plebiscites. We cannot directly measure voter preferences during this period, but we can gain insight into them through the arguments used by the politicians seeking their support. To do so, I collect data from two sets of local newspaper reports of political debates.32First, I investigate the debate surrounding local plebiscites regarding public goods expenditure between 1855 and 1905.33 Second, I undertake a systematic analysis of the topics discussed in the \\ward meetings\" of candidates seeking election to the Liverpool town council between 1860 and 1880. At these meetings candidates met supporters and canvassed support|I categorize the major topics of 32Local newspapers were an important way in which local politicians could reach their electorate: \\many readers, including increasing numbers of newly-enfranchised working-class men, wished to follow carefully the actions of local politicians and the columns of the local paper allowed them to do so in relative comfort\" (Walker, 2006, p.383). The existence of subscription reading rooms meant that purchase price was not a barrier for the working classes|a rough estimate suggests copies of newspapers were read by around twenty- ve people on average (Aspinall, 1946, p.29{30). 33See Appendix B.5 for a list of the plebiscites, and details of how they were identi ed. 36discussion in each.34These sources demonstrate that the cost of public goods was the main source of opposition to spending, and that the poor were an important political constituency. 6.1 The Opposition of the Poor to Public Spending The opposition of the poor to public spending has been documented by both contempo- raries and historians. The Royal Sanitary Commission in 1869-71 concluded that a plural voting system, under which the wealthy received multiple votes, should be implemented be- cause after the 1869 enfranchisement of the compounders \\sanitary reforms [were] in many cases rendered impossible by the hostility of the...poorest class\" (House of Commons Par- liamentary Papers , 1871, p.30). Politicians stood|and won|elections on the basis of their resistance to spending, often as part of a local \\economy\" party, or with the support of a \\shopocracy\" of small property owners or local ratepayers' association (see, e.g., Hennock, 1963, 1973; Yasumoto, 2011; Aidt et al., 2010). In one Welsh town \\workers were willing enough to admit they were killing themselves, but they saw immediate income as more important than environmental quality\" (Hamlin, 1998, p.298). The resistance to spending becomes less surprising when we consider that industrial workers appear to have been worse nourished than the poor in modern day developing economies. Logan (2009) nds that calorie demand in a sample of 1,000 British households in 1888 was signi cantly greater than those in rural Indian households in 1983. Speci cally, nineteenth-century British households consumed around 40% fewer calories, and had higher income-calorie elasticities|i.e., a greater proportion of income increases were spent on addi- tional calories. Further, a smaller proportion of additional food spending in Britain consisted of higher quality food, indicating a greater degree of hunger.35Working class households thus 34Liverpool was chosen for this exercise due to both the availability of archival material, the size of the city, and because the need for improved water and sanitation was constantly discussed during this period, culminating in the passing of a plebiscite in favor of the Vyrnwy water scheme in 1879. 35In Britain of a 1% increase in food spending around three-quarters went into more food, and 25% into better food (e.g., dairy, meat, vegetables and fruit); in India around half went into better food. These results 37faced trade-o s between improved sanitary environments and better nutrition. Opposition to expenditure on public goods could be expressed both through elections to town councils and directly through local plebiscites. Council elections occurred annually, with councilors serving three-year terms.36Those councils then controlled spending decisions, but sometimes turned to plebiscites to con rm taxpayer support for speci c projects or increased borrowing, either voluntarily or due to legal requirements.37 The high cost of public goods was at the core of opposition to greater spending in both of these settings. There is no evidence in the local newspaper reports that politicians questioned the responsibility of town councils to maintain sanitary environments or public health|we see no equivalent of, for instance, an anti-vaccination movement.38Town spending and taxation was a constant theme in the Liverpool elections|a major topic in 92% of ward meetings. Frequently (in 62% of reports) that discussion speci cally addressed the sanitation and water supply. But the need for \\economy\" or a lighter tax burden was consistently emphasized as well|in 49% of meetings, and in all of the campaigns surrounding local plebiscites.39In some ways, of course, this is unsurprising: cost is an easy stick with which to beat any proposal. However, it demonstrates that discussions concerning expenditure were consistently centered around a cost-bene t calculus: the results in this paper indicate are particularly striking given that the industries represented in the British sample mean that the average earnings are much higher than in the population, and are \\not generally representative of the laboring poor\" (Horrell and Oxley, 1999, p. 499). 36Additional details about the election process are provided in Appendix C.3. 37Speci c pieces of legislation required plebiscites to be held. These plebiscites were by no means symbolic, and were often defeated. Across a sample of 112 plebiscites, based on a search of all ratepayers' polls relating to public goods spending in the British Newspaper Archive, only around 55% were successful. (See Appendix B.5 for further details). The coverage of that database is undoubtedly skewed towards larger areas, and so it is unlikely that the sample is representative of all polls. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the signi cant opposition to growing expenditure. 38One reason for this could be, as noted by Williamson (2002), that sanitary reformers were proposing correct solutions to sanitation issues even before the germ theory of disease was properly understood. 39Other topics were mentioned much less frequently. The most common examples included discussions around temperance and liquor licenses (around 20% of meetings), and the position of Catholics (around 13%). Reports of ward meetings were generally short, and so the absence of a topic does not necessarily mean it was not mentioned. 38that for the poorest citizens, the bene ts of higher sanitation were simply not worth the taxes they had to pay. The newspaper reports also show the importance of the working class as a political constituency, justifying the median voter assumption in the model. Both in the Liverpool council elections and in many of the plebiscites, candidates' arguments stress the interests of the \\working man\".40Further, evidence for Parliamentary elections suggests that turnout was similar across di erent classes of voters: Berlinski et al. (2011) nd only weak evidence that franchise extension reduced turnout between 1865 and 1868, and no evidence of any e ect by 1874. While we would ideally observe municipal elections directly, this suggests that the poor were represented in elections as much as other classes of voter. The history of Birmingham demonstrates how both council meetings and plebiscites could be used to block growing expenditure. An 1851 Act of Parliament allowed the town council to embark on a program of sanitary improvements.41As costs increased, how- ever, a group of \\Economists\" emerged on the council, blocking the purchase of the town waterworks, and opposing the expansion of the council's borrowing powers. In the lat- ter case, the Economists were outvoted in the council, at which point they instigated a plebiscite|in which the population overwhelmingly refused to sanction greater expenditure. The Economists then took charge of the council; blocking street improvements and halting drainage works. Further attempts to expand expenditure continued to meet widespread opposition, par- ticularly among the working classes. Plebiscites in 1860 and 1874 were held under a system whereby occupiers of more valuable property could receive up to six votes; the results thus 40In an 1860 plebiscite on expanding Birmingham's voting powers, for example, both sides of the debate sought to appeal to poorer citizens: proponents of the bill claimed it \\was of great importance to the poor, who paid rates and received nothing\", while opponents hoped that \\working men...would see to their own interests and throw out the measure\". See Aris's Birmingham Gazette , Sat 08/12/1860, p.10 and p.5 respectively. 41The discussion in this paragraph is based on Hennock (1973, p.31{33). 39provide some evidence as to the support for the bill amongst di erent classes of voters. In 1860, supporters of the bill (expanding town borrowing powers) held 2.4 votes per voter, compared to 1.5 amongst opponents of the bill. A similar pattern held in 1874 poll, when 80% of the \\ordinary\" voters with just one vote opposed a motion to increase town council revenue raising powers.42The middle classes were willing to pay for greater government spending, but the poor were not. 6.2 Alternative Explanations The support of the middle class for higher public goods spending is contrary to the pre- dictions of models that explain limited government through the voter with median income (the \\median voter\") aligning with the rich. In Benabou and Ok (2001), for example, such a coalition forms because the median voter believes her income will be above the mean in the next period. The results in Section 5 show, in contrast, that it is the poor that form a coalition with the rich to resist higher taxation. Models allowing for multiple policy dimensions could explain the results, however they are inconsistent with the empirical context. The model's assumption of a single policy dimension ts well with the legal restrictions on council activities. In particular, town councils' spending powers were limited to spending on public goods and they could not, for instance, engage in redistribution. Low public goods spending could thus not be compensated by reallocation of resources.43Further, taxation was the prominent issue at local elections and, as we have seen above, local plebiscites allowed the electorate to be heard even on speci c expenditure projects. Spending decisions were not confounded by other policy issues. Further, there is little evidence that attitudes toward public goods expenditure were 42In 1874 the average voter for the proposal held 3.3 votes, and against 2 votes; these ordinary voters formed 62% of those turning out. See Appendix Table A.VI for additional details. 43This rules out for instance, the situation analyzed in Levy (2005), whereby lower overall government spending is compensated by a shift of resources from redistribution towards education. 40capturing a\u000eliations to national political parties. Political parties did operate at municipal level during the nineteenth-century, but local|rather than national|issues dominated when it came to matters of town improvement. There was not a clear mapping between national and local party politics on the issue of public goods provision|the two major political parties (the Tories and the Liberals) were on di erent sides of the debate in di erent cities, and in general \\divisions could be both across and along party lines\" (Fraser, 1976, p175). Opposition to growing expenditure was centered around the detail of local issues, and not party attachment. More generally, the analysis of the political debates make it clear that class was the key cleavage in town politics. There are frequent mentions of class di erences in the newspaper reports, and particular reference to the working classes or the poor (in 15% of reports). Other demographic di erences are, in contrast extremely rare|the main exception being a small number of wards where the \\Irish-catholic\" vote was emphasized in the mid-1870s. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, the key characteristic of the new voters was their low income. An alternative set of explanations for the inverted-U-relationship allows for the bene t of public goods to vary across groups. The model in this paper assumes a non-excludable public good with equal bene ts to all citizens|meaning that variation in demand for public spending is purely due to the di erences in tax payments. In those other models, in contrast, the rich prefer private to public provision (Epple and Romano, 1996a,b), or public policies are bene cial only for speci c industries (Llavador and Oxoby, 2005). Such explanations do not, however, t well with the fact that sanitation investment led to signi cant health improvements for all economic classes. Urban infrastructure led to major reductions in mortality not only from waterborne diseases, but from airborne diseases as well (Chapman, 2019). Moreover, even wealthy citizens were continually exposed to the unsavory conditions around them, as \\even with the growing separation of the classes, many 41elements of sanitary condition|water supply, drains, muck in the streets, odors, facilities for relieving oneself, complexion and stature of the people|were truly public\" (Hamlin, 1998, p.281). The life expectancy of di erent social classes moved closely over time (Lizzeri and Persico, 2004), and di erences in life expectancy between inner and outer portions of cities remained relatively constant between 1851 and 1900 (Szreter and Mooney, 1998, Table 2). The wealthy could not obtain these public health bene ts privately, nor did they gain more from public goods expenditure than poorer voters. For similar reasons, the public goods here do not correspond closely to the theoretical framework of Llavador and Oxoby (2005), in which government policy bene ts only manufac- turing interests|leading to opposition from both landlords and agricultural groups. While some sanitation public goods, such as water supply, had industrial as well as health bene ts, few of the towns we had analyze had important agricultural interests: the median town only had 12% of the population engaged in agriculture.44Further, politicians did not criticize spending on the basis that it would only bene t speci c occupational groups.45The poor bene ted from public goods, but they preferred not to pay for them. 7 Discussion This paper has shown that the extension of voting rights to the poor can increase opposition to government expenditure on critical public goods, including sanitation. In nineteenth- century England, the relationship between the extent of the franchise and voting rights was inverted-U-shaped: spending was highest when the franchise was extended to around 50% of adult male citizens. I have presented a model, supported by empirical evidence, that argues 44Moreover, that percentage includes some surrounding areas of towns, meaning that this gure is likely an over-estimate. 45There are occasional suggestions in the (very large) cities of Birmingham and Liverpool, that speci c items of expenditure were focused in wealthier neighborhoods. However, as shown in Appendix E, the main results are similar when excluding the largest towns, indicating that this e ect is not driving the ndings. 42that the poor were unwilling to pay taxes because of a high marginal utility of consumption. Crucially, they had to bear some of the cost of providing those public goods|a cost that they had to trade-o with additional calories, and better nutrition. These results have important implications for studies of the relationship between in- equality, redistribution, and democracy. Most theories suggest franchise extension will lead to an increase in the size of government (e.g., Boix, 2003; Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Lizzeri and Persico, Robinson, 2000, 2001, 2006).46This model, however, sug- gests that may not be the case if the franchise is extended far enough: elites may thus, in some contexts, prefer broad rather than narrow franchise extensions. More generally, the results imply that spending and taxation will be highest when political power rests with the middle class, contrary to the classic prediction that higher inequality will lead to higher redistribution. The paper's ndings apply to a range of historical and contemporary contexts. The model relies on two key assumptions regarding government activity, both of which are frequently met in practice. First, government spending must be focused on public goods rather than transfers|true of legally constrained subnational local governments today, and national governments prior to the nineteenth century. Second, the poor must bear at least some of the burden of taxation|as they do through the continued use of consumption taxes, excise duties, and user fees in nearly all countries.47In the speci c context of public goods provision, taxes to combat climate change are often criticized due to their impact on the poorest (Chiroleu-Assouline and Fodha, 2014; Mathur and Morris, 2014). A particularly relevant modern parallel is the widespread emphasis on cost recovery in the provision of sanitation and water supply in developing countries. There is evidence 46See also Conley and (2007). 47A recent study of 20 OECD countries found that citizens in the bottom income decile face a VAT tax burden of almost 14% and an excise tax burden of almost 5% of income (OECD/KIPF, 2014). Author's calculations using simple cross-country averages based on data in Table 2.1 and 2.5. 43that low willingness-to-pay can hamper the provision of such public goods (Cameron et al., 2019), and that high subsidies may be required to increase take-up (Dupas, 2014; Guiteras et al., 2015). In some cases, political opposition to increased tari s has precluded sustainable investment (Boland and Whittington, 1998; Herrera and Post, 2014; Marson and Savin, 2015; Herrera, 2014). If public goods provision is to be decentralized, as is often advocated, then such political constraints need to be accounted for. How might one overcome opposition to expenditure on these essential public goods and services? The clearest answer is to reduce the burden of taxation that falls on the poor. The examination of the English case suggests that a major barrier was the restricted tax schedule that town councils were allowed to impose. If they had been able to implement a more progressive taxation schedule then the poor would not have faced the same incentives to oppose expenditure, and political outcomes may have been very di erent. 44References Abrams, B.

Individuals consume whatever remains after taxation ci=yi(1\u0000 ). Denote average income as \u0016y=Y N. Then the individual's problem is max iU=u(yi(1\u0000 i)) +v( i\u0016y) First note that this problem has a unique maximum since U(ci;G) is strictly concave. The assumptions that lim x!0u0(x) =1ensures an interior solution. Sinceg\u0003 i= \u0003 iY NI proceed by identifying the optimal tax rate as a function of individual income. Taking the rst-order conditions, the optimal \u0003is implicitly de ned by be the case that c\u0003 iincreases. To see this, consider otherwise. Since consumption is lower, the value of the left hand side would increase relative to the right hand side. Further for consumption to fall, the tax rate must be higher. But then the right hand side of the equation will decrease, meaning there is no equilibrium. Using implicit di erentiation to identifyd \u0003 52The expression strictly positive, since both u(\u0001) andv(\u0001) are strictly concave by assumption. risk Implicitly de ne ~ ybyrR(~y(1\u0000 ~ \u0003 i)) =RR(~c\u0003) = 1. Then by assumption 2, for any yi<~y RR(c\u0003 i)>1. Further, since rRis monotonically decreasing, it is su\u000ecient to show that there is jwithc\u0003 j\u0015~c\u0003. Consider an individualjwithyj>~c\u0003+^G. Sincev0(^G) = 0,jwill consume strictly more than ~ c\u0003This completes the proof. Proof of Proposition 2 Proof. First, note that preferences over are single peaked, since U(\u0001) is strictly concave. Then for a given electorate we can apply the standard Median Voter Theorem. (Note that the median voter here is not necessarily equivalent to the voter with the median income). From Proposition 1, we know that \u0003 ireaches a unique maximum at yi= ~y, and the optimal tax rate is decreasing in yiforyi>~y. De ne 0as the median tax rate under E0, and m ias the median optimal tax rate when iis the poorest enfranchised citizen. Order the voters in order of income. That is voter i+ 1 is the next richest voter after voter i. For all citizens fijyi\u0015~y; i6=E0g; \u0003 i> \u0003 i+1\u0015 0. Thus as each of these citizens are enfranchised m(weakly) increases. Further, this increase is strict at some point since jfijyi<~y;i6=E0gj\u0015 2. By proposition 1, the optimal tax rate is increasing in yiforyi<~y. Then all citizens fijyi<~yg; \u0003 i> \u0003 i\u00001. As a result, if the median tax rate decreases as the franchise is increased, it will always decrease for further 53extensions. Now suppose mnever decreases as the electorate increased. Then m i\u0015~ 8iwith yi<~y. But this is not the case, since by assumption there are at least two citizens for which \u0003 i<~ . To complete the proof, note that the level of the tax rate directly maps to the level of public goods expenditure per capita, since g= Y N A.1 Extension to Progressive Tax System In the main text I present the model with a proportional tax rate both for simplicity and because it closely matches the historical setting of the empirical analysis. However, the result of proposition 1 holds for a more general, progressive, tax structure where the consumption of individual iis: ci=yi\u0000t(yi) andt(yi) is a tax burden varying according to income, characterized by t(yi) =s(yi)T whereTis the total tax revenue (and hence public goods spending) and s(\u0001) is a function identifying the share of the total taxation paid by an individual. Note that if s(yi) =yi Ythen this simpli es to a proportional tax system. I consider tax systems that are (weakly) progressive as de ned by constraints on the tax elasticity\u000f(y): \u000f(y) =t0(y) t(y)y A tax system is, as usual, de ned as progressive if \u000f(y)>1, and regressive if \u000f(y)<1. 54For a proportional tax system \u000f(y) = 1. I assume that there is some ysuch that the tax system is progressive at yand that, in addition, the tax system is increasingly progressive at higher incomes: \u000f0\u00150 with weakly increasing marginal tax rates: s00(y)\u00150.48To ensure marginal tax rates of between 0 and 1 I assume that s0(y)2[0;1 ^G+1]8y. Finally, I assume thats(y)>08y>0|that is, all citizens bear some of the tax burden. With these assumptions I re-state the proof of proposition 1 as follows. Proof. The proof proceeds by rst characterizing the conditions under which the optimal level of taxation is increasing in income and showing that this function has a single turning point. Individuals face the following optimization problem: max TU=u(ci) +v\u0012T N\u0013 This problem has a unique maximum since U(\u0001) is strictly concave. Taking the rst-order conditions, the optimal 0 (3) where for simplicity I drop the isubscripts on yiandciand denote i's consumption at their optimal level of taxation as c\u0003= (y\u0000s(y)T\u0003). The assumptions that lim x!0u0(x) = limx!0v0(x) =1ensure an interior solution. In the remainder of the proof I only display the arguments of the c\u0003;s;s0;T\u0003if needed for clari cation. 48Note that increasing marginal tax rates are implied by an increasing tax elasticity if the tax is progressive but not if the tax is regressive. 55Lemma 1 The optimal level of consumption is increasing in y: dc\u0003 dy>08y Proof. First note that we can write: 1\u0000s0T\u0003\u0000dT\u0003 dys Since, by and only ifdT\u0003 and v0(T\u0003 2)<v0(T\u0003 1) violating this expression is negative since both u00(\u0001) andv00(\u0001) are strictly negative and s > 0. Then the sign of this derivative is determined by the sign of the numerator anddT\u0003 dy\u00150 if and only if: \u0000[\u0000s0u0(c\u0003)\u0000s(1\u0000s0T\u0003)u00(c\u0003)]\u00140 Denoting the coe\u000ecient of absolute risk aversion of relative risk aver- 56sion atc\u0003asR\u0003 AandR\u0003 1 Note that in this sequence we rely on lemma 1 to show that s(1\u0000s0T\u0003)>0. Inequality 4 establishes the conditions under which the optimal tax rate will be increasing in individual income. To complete the proof I proceed in two steps. First I show that there is at least one income y1where the inequality holds strictly (the optimal tax rate is rising in income) and some point y2>y1where the inequality strictly fails to hold. In the second step, I then show that there is no point y3> y 2where the tax rate is again increasing in income. Now, consider any income ^ ysuch that\u000f(^y)>1 (i.e. the tax system is progressive). Then the right hand side of (4) is greater than 1, since (1 \u0000s0T\u0003)>0 by Lemma 1. By assumption there exists ^ csuch thatRR(^c)<1. An individual with income ^^y= ^c+^Gwill consume at 57least ^cand so will have relative risk aversion less than one, and so inequality (4) will strictly fail to hold. I now show there is ysuch that (4) is strictly satis ed. By assumption 2 there exists y such thatRR(c\u0003(y))>1 and so it is su\u000ecient to show that for low enough ythe right hand side of (4) is less than or equal to 1. First, consider the case where the tax schedule is at some point regressive. Then the right hand side of 4 is always less than one. Now consider the case where the elasticity \u000f(y)\u001518y. It is su\u000ecient to show that: lim y!0ys0 s= 1 (5) since (1\u0000s0T) is bounded above by our assumption on s0and the fact that T\u0003(y)<^G8y. As such, if (5) holds then the right hand side of (4) will tend to 1 as y!0. We can write 5 as follows lim y!0f(y) g(y)\u0012f0(y) g0(y)\u0013\u00001 wheref(y) =yandg(y) =s(y). y!0f(y) g(y)= limy!0\u0010 f0(y) g0(y)\u0011 and we are done. To apply this rule, three conditions need to be met i) lim y!0y= 0 ii) lim y!0s(y) = 0 and iii) s0(y)>0 ify >0. The rst condition is trivial. To see the second, suppose otherwise that 9Lsuch thatlimy!0s(y) =L>0. Then lim y!0\u000f(y)<1 and the tax system is regressive at some point. Similarly for the third condition, consider that s0(y) = 0. Then \u000f(y) = 0 and the tax system is regressive. So far I have shown that there is some point at which the optimal tax function is increasing and a point with higher income at which it is decreasing. However, to complete the proof I must show that T\u0003cannot not again increase after it has begun to fall. Since T\u0003 is continuous, it is su\u000ecient to show there is not a point y3>y2such thatdT\u0003(y3) dy= 0. 58Suppose otherwise that such a point (or points) exists and consider the lowest such point. De ne the following function: h(y) =RR(c\u0003(y))\u0000(\u000f(y)\u00001) dy= 0 thenh0(y3)<0 and we have a contradiction. This completes the proof. B Data The majority of the data used in the paper are drawn from reports to Parliament downloaded from the House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Database49. A full list of the reports used is available upon request. Other sources are discussed below. B.1 The Sample The main sample includes only Municipal Boroughs that were both incorporated (i.e. had councils elected under the system described here) and had control of sanitary expenditure in 1867 (the start of the study period). This does not include London, which was governed separately. A total of 214 towns had been incorporated by 1867; however only 154 had control of sanitary expenditure prior to this date. These towns are identi ed using a House of Commons paper (House of Commons, 1872b). Speci cally, town councils are identi ed as having had control of expenditure if they are speci ed to either \\have become urban sanitary 49See http://parlipapers.chadwyck.co.uk/ 59authorities in place of Local Boards under The Local Government Act 1858\" (category 2 in the report) or to have \\acted as sanitary authorities under Local Acts before the date of The Public Health Act 1872\" (category 3). For each year, observations are then included if either the town reported sanitary information (as either a Local Board or Improvement Commission prior to 1872) or if b) the town is included in category 3 and never reported separate sanitary accounts|indicating that the accounts were consolidated (this is also supported by hand- checking the original data sources). This leaves 155 towns, after which ve towns were excluded due to speci c data issues: \u000fFolkestone: The town council is stated as having control of sanitary expenditure, however the post 1872 reports of sanitary expenditure are not controlled by the Town Council \u000fHastings: The population of the sanitary authority jumped considerably at some point in 1860s, leading to potential downward bias in the level of per capita expenditure pre-reform. \u000fShaftesbury, Cardigan and Congleton: values of the franchise are very high (over 90%). The total population in the included towns in the 1881 census was 6,875,689, comprising 92% of the total population in the 214 towns of 7,446,209. The sample includes 35 of 41 towns with an 1881 population above 50,000 and all towns with an 1881 population above 100,000.50 50These gures include West Ham and Croydon, which are suburbs of London. The six large towns that were not included are Birkenhead, Bury, Hudders eld, St. Helens, West Bromwich (all incorporated after 1867) and Walsall (where the town council did not control sanitary authority at the start of the period). 60B.2 Financial Data Information is collected from the annual nancial accounts reported to Parliament and col- lated in the Local Taxation Returns contained in the Parliamentary Papers collection.51 These accounts contain detail on the sources of revenue and types of expenditure in each town annually. Each town reported separately as both a municipal borough and as a sanitary authority (as a local board, improvement commission or urban sanitary authority): these accounts are aggregated together. This information is used to construct an annual panel dataset between 1867 and 1910.52Financial values are then translated into current prices using the Rousseaux Price Index (Mitchell, 1971, pp. 723{4) following Millward and Sheard (1995). De ning ongoing public goods expenditure Prior to 1884 the nancial data does not distinguish between one-o and ongoing expen- diture items: as such the accounts include a number of very high expenditures, re ecting investment activities. To separate ongoing expenditure from investment expenditure for dif- ferent types of public good, I rst identify \\investment periods\" by analyzing deviations in trend expenditure in each of the following categories \\sewerage and sewer systems\", \\water supply\", \\highways, watering and scavenging\", and \\other public works\". The rst three of these categories are de ned separately in the nancial reports (albeit with some changes over time in the name). However, from 1890 onwards some towns (those that were not made County Boroughs) began to receive much higher transfer funding for spending on roads from their County Council. As such, I adjust expenditure on \\highways, watering and scavenging\" to remove the amount received from this source. To do so, I sep- arate between revenue from County Councils from the \\Exchequer Account\" and \\Other\", since it was the latter that was predominantly consisting of payments for main roads. The 51A full list of the papers used is available from the author upon request. 52Comprehensive data is not available prior to 1867. 61\\other public works\" series is the aggregate of (loan nonloan) expenditure periods, the level of ongoing expenditure is simply the per capita expenditure in that period. In investment periods, the level of ongoing expen- diture is the level of expenditure in the next non-investment period. For instance, if 1873 and 1874 were investment periods, but 1875 was not, then the level of expenditure in 1873 and 1874 is set equal to that in 1875. For the period following 1871, a year is identi ed as the beginning of an investment period for each good if: 1. Expenditure per capita exceeds the median percentile of expenditure per capita (across all towns and years) in the relevant category; and: \u000fthe town started expenditure on the relevant good in that period (the spending in the previous period was 0); or \u000fthere is a 100% year-on-year growth in expenditure on the good, and the expen- diture p.c. exceeds the median future per capita spending for the town; or \u000fthe two previous years of data are missing, and the expenditure p.c. exceeds the median future per capita spending for the town; or \u000fthe level of expenditure p.c. is higher than the previous year and twice the median future per capita spending for the town. The years following the start of an investment period are identi ed as investment periods if either: 1. expenditure p.c. is greater than the previous period; or 622. the expenditure p.c. exceeds the median future per capita spending for the town; and either: \u000fthe expenditure is twice the town's average expenditure over the period; or \u000fthe level of expenditure exceeds the median percentile of expenditure per capita (across all towns and years) in the relevant category. Between 1867 and 1871, public goods expenditure is not disaggregated in the nancial reports, and so I cannot use the process above. Instead, investment periods are identi ed as being twice the level of ongoing expenditure in 1872, and the above process is then applied to total public goods expenditure in those towns.53 Figure A.IV displays the unadjusted and adjusted spending on each of the three compo- nents of the sanitation public goods measure, and also the total public goods expenditure. In each case, the plots indicate how, in the absence of adjustment, there are a number of extreme values which could skew the analysis. The percentage of observations identi ed as investment periods was as follows: Water supply, 13% sewers, 18%; streets 10%; and for total public goods, 36%|where the latter identi es that any of the subcomponents had an investment period. Figure A.V shows that there was an increasing trend over the analysis period in both town council expenditure and revenue. That growth did not, however, remove the considerable variation in the size of government across towns. 53For a small number of towns the rst period that disaggregated data was available is later than 1872: in this case investment periods are de ned relative to the rst period data is available. 63De nition of nancial variables Tax receipts: Aggregation of all di erent \\rates\" collected by towns as municipality and sanitary authority. Sanitary public goods expenditure: Sum of ongoing expenditure per capita on \\sewerage and sewer systems\", \\water supply\", \\highways, watering and scavenging\". See previous subsection for details of construction of series. All public goods expenditure: After 1872, sum of \\sanitary public goods expenditure\" and ongoing expenditure on \\other public works\" series (see previous subsection for details). Prior to 1872, total of expenditure on \\public works\" and on sewerage and lighting. Tax base per capita : Information on the value of the tax base (the \\rateable value\" of the district) is reported annually in the Local Taxation Returns from 1872 onward, with the exception of 1883. For many years, the tax base is reported separately for the town as a sanitary district, and as a municipal borough|I use the maximum tax base reported by the town in each year. Before 1872 information regarding the annual value of the tax base was not reported alongside the nancial accounts. However, two additional parliamentary papers do provide information regarding the size of the tax base in sanitary districts (but not municipal boroughs) in 1866 and 1870. In addition, for towns with similar municipal and parliamentary boundaries, I can use information on the rateable value in the parliamentary boroughs in 1866. I then linearly interpolate per capita values for missing years. B.3 Electoral Data Information as to the number of electors was collected from returns to Parliament supple- mented by information for 1879 reported in Vine (1879). Information for the total number of electors in each town was collected for years 1852, by gender was collected for 1871, 1885, and 1897. Values relating to the number of electors in Shaftesbury (for all years), Carlisle 64(1854) and Buckingham (1866, 1869, and 1873) were excluded, since there were clear discrep- ancies in the returns (for instance, where the number of parliamentary electors was reported rather than the number of municipal electors). The time series for total number of electors was estimated as follows. First, the franchise is calculated as a percentage of the total population, using the series relating to the number of electors above. The missing years are then interpolated using a constant compound growth rate|with the exception of the years 1867 and 1868 which are replaced with the 1866 value, since reforms in 1869 led to a large jump in the level of the franchise. Missing values for 1864 and 1865 are replaced with the value from 1866. A compound growth rate is used in order to match the assumption made on the growth of population between decennial censuses. Linear interpolation between periods could bias the results toward nding a downward relationship between a high level of the franchise and spending since it leads to higher estimated values of the franchise in later periods while, at the same time, the estimated population is also higher. To estimate the male / female franchise used in the main speci cations, I rst estimate the proportion of male electors in 1871, 1885, and 1897. This series is then interpolated at a constant growth rate for the intervening years. (In general this proportion did not tend to change substantially between periods). Multiplying these two series provides an estimate of the number of male and female electors in each year. The franchise measure is then estimated using the estimated adult male population discussed in the following two subsections. The key franchise variable used in the paper is calculated using an adjustment factor relating to proportion of males and females that were of voting age (21 and 30 respectively). The main measure uses individual-level census data obtained from the North Atlantic Pop- ulation Project (Minnesota Population Center, 2008; Sch\u007f urer and Woollard, 2003). The individual-level data is aggregated to identify the age distribution of voters at the level of 65administrative sub-districts.54Each town was then matched to the relevant sub-districts using the 1881 census: often each municipal borough was spread across several of these sub- districts (the boundaries did not, unfortunately, overlap directly). To estimate the town-level age distribution I then average across the di erent sub-districts, weighted by the proportion of 1881 population in each of the sub-districts (which is also identi ed in the 1881 census). While this measure should accurately account for variation in the age distribution across towns, one potential concern is the use of a constant adjustment factor for every year. To check whether this is an issue, I compare the estimated proportion to data from the period 1861{1870 collected from the decennial reports of the Registrar General. Unfortunately, this data is only available at the level of the registration district rather than sub-district, and so can be matched to towns less precisely.55The resulting comparison shows a very high degree of correlation over time in the town age distribution, providing con dence that our use of a constant adjustment factor is appropriate. Further, the results are robust to these di erent measures of the franchise. 54More precisely, these are the registration sub-districts used by the Registrar General. 55Smaller boroughs were often only a small part of a registration district. As such this measure combines urban and rural areas. 66B.4 Census Data Information regarding the population and number of inhabited houses for each town were gathered from census reports between 1861 and 1901, and from the parish-level statistics for the 1911 census gathered by Southall et al. (2004). An \\inhabited house\" in this context was de ned as a distinct building which was inhabited, including \\all space within the external and party walls of a building\" (Newman, 1971, p.11). Between censuses the population is interpolated at a constant annual growth rate. In several cases towns underwent boundary changes between census years. To adjust for this, I have identi ed the towns that underwent boundary changes using the census and the year of the boundary changes using both the census reports themselves and the annual reports of the Local Government Board. The population series is adjusted to the revised population (provided in the census reports) at this date and binned into six categories: less than 10,000 citizens, 10,000-25,000, 25,000-50000, 50,000-100,000, 100,000-250,000 and more than 250,000 citizens. Occupational structure, and the percentage heads of household, are measured at the level of the Registration Districts used for registration purposes. Occupational data was obtained from the Integrated Census Microdata service through the UK Data Archive, while the percentage heads of household was constructed using the 100% census samples available at Center. (2019).56The registration districts changed over time, and so I create a set of synthetic districts with standardized boundaries that accounted for mergers and splits. Each town is then linked to one or more of these districts as explained in the discussion of the franchise data above. 56Occupational data could not be obtained for one town due to ambiguity in the place names used in the ICEM data. 67B.5 Local Politics Data on local politics was collected from national and local newspaper collections relying, in particular, on the digital collection of the British Newspaper Archive57 Party Mayor A\u000eliation The political a\u000eliation of mayors was identi ed from newspaper reports. From 1871 onwards, incomplete lists were published in national newspapers. (Prior to this date, newspapers that reported lists of mayors reported little (at most) information regarding party a\u000eliation.) This information was then supplemented, including for earlier years, with information from local newspaper reports. Liverpool Ward-Level Politics A search was undertaken for details of local election debate in each of Liverpool's sixteen wards annually between 1860 and 1880 using the local newspaper collection of the British Newspaper Archive. Speci cally, this involved nding newspaper reports of local \\ward meetings\", where candidates would address the public. Reports were found for a total of 230 candidates (reports were less common in the many cases where no contest was held). Local Plebiscites A search was undertaken of the British Newspaper Archive58for local plebiscites between 1848 and 1905. Over three hundred polls of various nature were identi ed (including some in Scotland and Ireland). Of those polls, 112 appeared to relate to town expenditure on public goods|such as the adoption of new powers, undertaking speci c projects, or purchasing private providers or water or gas.59The scale of the projects ranged from improvements to a single street, to enabling a $1 million loan to the Manchester Ship Canal Company.

The BNA provides scans of millions of pages of local news- papers from the British Library's collection. 58The primary search term used was \\ratepayers' polls\", with addition of other terms, such as \\elections\" to identify most relevant results. 59Other common topics related to the adoption of church rates, the adoption of the free libraries act, adoption of school boards, or boundary changes. 68average, around 5 articles were identi ed for each poll. Twenty-six of these plebiscites were chosen for more detailed investigation.60Polls were selected based on town and project size (in the expectation that more information would be available), and with a primary focus on sanitation. However, to ensure coverage of a broad range of experiences, some smaller projects and alternative topics were also selected. For each of these polls, additional searches were undertaken to nd reports of town meetings or other debates. Those articles were then used to provide more detail on the subject of each poll, and the key arguments used by both proponents and opponents of the motion. Table A.VI provides a brief description of each of these plebiscites. The topics considered were often complex, particularly if they related to a Parliamentary bill|here the topic highlights the elements most relevant to this paper. We can see that the plebiscites were often keenly contested, and that motions were often lost: only 50% in this list were successful. For a few locations we can glean some insight regarding the preferences of di erent classes by comparing the number of votes and number of voters for and against each proposal. In these locations a graduated franchise was used, where voters owning or occupying valuable property would have multiple votes.61In four out of the six polls, the votes per voters is notably higher for supporters; in the remaining two (Reading and Sunderland), the groups are very similar. These results then provide further evidence that the poor could be part of the opposition to growing expenditure. The main text refers to twenty-four polls because little or no information was available for the polls in Warrington and Filey. 60An additional ve polls, implemented simultaneously as part of the debate over the Cardi Corporation Bill in 1900, were initially selected. However, it became clear that the sprawling nature of the bill meant that the issues of relevance to this paper were little reported, and so these polls were excluded. 61In general limited information regarding the way in which polls were undertaken is provided, and so it is possible that other towns used a similar system without results being reported in this way. 69Figure A.IV: Unadjusted and adjusted nancial data. 024Unadjusted Spending p.c. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Adjusted Spending p.c.Sewers 024Unadjusted Spending p.c. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Adjusted Spending p.c.Streets 051015Unadjusted Spending p.c. 0 0.5 1 1.5 Adjusted Spending p.c.Water 051015Unadjusted Spending p.c. 0 1 2 3 Adjusted Spending p.c.Total Public Goods Not Investment Period Investment Period Note: The data used in the regression analysis is plotted on the x-axis in each panel and the unadjusted (apart from conversion to real terms) per capita spending on the y-axis.

Larger boroughs were divided into wards, with councilors elected separately for each ward. The councilors would then appoint aldermen for a six year term and a mayor for a one year term. Prior to 1882 the latter position was restricted to those already councilors or aldermen, but then open to any individual quali ed for such a position. The mayor (or in his absence the aldermen) would hold a casting vote in council meetings. The mayor, or the relevant alderman for each ward, would also preside over elections. Elections were carried out using signed ballot papers until the 1872 Ballot Act implemented the secret ballot in both Parliamentary and local elections. There were no term limits, and in some cases councilors served for decades. Signi cant property quali cations were in place for both councilors and aldermen. In larger boroughs, they had to own $1,000, or occupy property of $30, while in smaller boroughs the amounts were$500 and $15 respectively (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.156). These requirements were essen- tially removed by the 1882 Municipal Corporations Act, which allowed any person on the burgess roll to act as either a councilor or alderman. Following the 1835 Act, the following procedure was used to draw up the list of quali ed voters. Parish overseers would draw up a list of burgesses in their parish. The list was then published, and objections could be made. After 1878 a simpler system was implemented in those boroughs represented in Parliament, whereby registration lists were drawn up alongside those in Parliament. Under this system Revising Barristers, rather than local assessors, held 62The discussion in this section draws heavily on Keith-Lucas (1952), particularly pp. 134{135. 73responsibility for revising the overseers' lists. After 1888 this revised system was implemented in all boroughs. C.2 Parliamentary versus Municipal Elections The restrictions on the municipal franchise di ered from those governing the right to vote in Parliamentary elections. In Parliamentary elections prior to 1867, the right to vote in boroughs (town constituencies) was restricted to those occupying property worth more than $10 rental value per annum, but no such restriction was in place for municipal elections. However, other restrictions were were more severe for municipal elections: to qualify for the municipal franchise voters must have been resident for at least three years (rather than one year for Parliamentary voting), and had to have paid local taxes for at least two and a half years (rather than 6 months). These di erences, combined with the fact that citizens not qualifying for the Parliamentary franchise were poorer, and hence less likely to meet the tax paying requirement, meant that in practice the municipal franchise was more restricted then the municipal|by approximately 15% in a sample of 39 towns in 1835 (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.61). Some, but not all, of the municipal boroughs were represented in Parliament. At the start of our period, 112 of the 150 towns in the main analysis had Members of Parliament elected for the town|it is this set which have information available regarding the rental distribution used in Section 5.2. C.3 Legislation A ecting the Municipal Franchise This Appendix summarizes the major pieces of legislation a ecting the municipal franchise between 1835 and 1900. 1835 Municipal Corporation Act: Established the structure of municipal councils in 178 74towns with historic charters, with unincorporated towns allowed to petition for incorporation at a later date. Under the terms of this Act, councils were chosen under a system of annual elections (with one third of councilors replaced each year) by an electorate consisting of all male householders subject to residence and tax-paying requirements. Prior to 1835 female householders were able to vote in some towns, but were disenfranchised by the Act. In order to vote citizens had to have resided in the relevant municipal borough for three years and paid local property taxes (the \\rates\") for 2.5 years prior to the election. This included a stipulation that individuals were ineligible to vote if they had received poor relief in the twelve months prior to an election. Precisely, they had to have occupied a property (e.g., a house or shop) in the town and lived within seven miles of the borough. 1850 Small Tenements Rating Act: This Act gave local authorities the ability to collect taxes directly from landlords for poorer tenants, on the condition that the tenants were granted the municipal franchise. This practice was known as \\compounding\", with the tenants whose taxes were collected in this way known as \\compounders\". In particular, the Act applied to those in tenements of annual rental value of 6 pounds or under. This decision was not taken by the municipal council, but by the local vestry, who held responsibility for tax collection. 1869 Assessed Rates Act: This Act enshrined the right of compounders to vote. 1869 Municipal Franchise Act: This Act reduced the period of residency from three years to one|and the length of tax-paying required from two and half years to six months. The Act also enfranchised female householders aged 30 or older. 1869 Municipal Franchise Act: This Act reduced the period of residency from three years to one|and the length of tax-paying required from two and half years to six months. The Act also enfranchised female householders aged 30 or older. 1878 Parliamentary and Municipal Registration Act: This Act clari ed the registra- tion rules for both Parliamentary and Municipal elections. Of particular relevance to this 75paper, this including further clari cation that all \\compounders\" (see above) had the right to vote. 1882 Municipal Corporations Act: Consolidating Act bringing together several previous small amendments to the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In addition, it allowed that \\every person quali ed to elect councillors was also quali ed to be elected\" (Keith-Lucas, 1952, p.167). Revisions were also made to the system for registering voters for those boroughs represented in Parliament, as discussed above. 1888 County Electors Act: Allowed for occupiers of vacant land over 10 pounds to be granted the right to vote, as long as they paid assessed taxes and had resided in the borough for six months prior to the election. The simpler registration system implemented in Parliamentary Boroughs in 1878 was now implemented in all boroughs. 76D Variation in the Extent of the Franchise This Appendix investigates variation in the extent of the franchise in more detail. I start by analyzing the sources of variation before the 1869 reform, identifying in particular the role of legislation a ecting the compounders that paid tax indirectly through their landlord. D.1 Variation Before the 1869 Reforms Table A.VII provides evidence that the extent of the franchise was correlated with the prevalence of indirect tax payment, but was not a ected by the demand for town expenditure. A higher franchise before 1869 was associated with a higher proportion of \\compounders\"| renters paying their taxes through their landlord|in the municipal electorate. The change in the franchise however was negatively correlated with the pre-reform enfranchisement of these poor renters: suggestive evidence that the e ect of the 1869 and 1878 reforms was to enfranchise these poor renters. We can also see that urban crowding, which plausibly re ects poverty, is associated with a lower franchise before 1869.63 There is no evidence that the level or the change in the franchise is associated with the pre-STRA town tax base, the magnitude of town spending before the STRA, or the share of the population working in agriculture (a proxy for industrial demand for public goods). The coe\u000ecients on all three variables are consistently insigni cant, and small, across all seven speci cations. The pre-reform party a\u000eliation of the town mayor also does not appear to have a ected the size of the \\shock\" to the franchise (speci cation 7)|evidence that elites could not limit the e ects of the reform. 63However, this variable could also be capturing a smaller proportion of men being household heads. 77Table A.VII: Indirect tax payment was a major determinant of variation in the franchise.

As an alternative way to test whether the 1869 reforms were associated with the poor gaining the vote, I analyze the composition of the electorate before and after the reforms. Unfortunately we do not have information directly on the composition of the electorate. However, we can glean some insight by comparing the representation of Parliamentary voters in the electorate before the election, the most citizens could only vote in parliamentary elections if they occupied a property of at least $10 annual rental value. In 1866 this requirement excluded, on average, around two-thirds of citizens. If extensions of the municipal franchise increased the representation of relatively poor 78citizens, then the rich would be more over-represented in the electorate the smaller the fran- chise. I measure the over-representation of the wealthy through comparing the percentage of parliamentary voters in the municipal electorate to the percentage of parliamentary voters in the entire population: Over-representation =% Parliamentary electors in municipal electorate % Parliamentary electors in population(8) where \\population\" refers to the number of male occupiers in the town|that is the potential electorate under the male household franchise. If the electorate were entirely representative, the measure would equal one. If the wealthy were over-represented, on the other hand, then the number will be greater than one. In 1866 there was a clear negative relationship between the extent of over-representation and the extent of the municipal franchise, as shown in the left hand panel of Figure A.VI, This relationship indicates that the electorate was more representative of relatively poor citizens when the franchise was higher. After the reforms of 1869, however, the downward- sloping relationship had disappeared|in 1876 there is no relationship between the extent of the franchise and the make-up of the pre-reform electorate. Further, the largest increases in the franchise occurred in those towns where the parliamentary electors were most over- represented, providing further evidence that the e ects of the reforms was to extend the vote to poorer citizens. D.2 Enfranchisement of Poor Voters I estimate the proportion of \\poor\" households in the voting population using data on the distribution of housing values in the towns represented in Parliament, reported in the 1866 Electoral Returns and subsequent Parliamentary Papers (House of Commons Parliamentary Papers , 1866a,c,b). Speci cally these papers report the at di erent gross 79Figure A.VI: Over-representation of wealthier citizens predicts extent of franchise before, but not after 1869 reforms. 0 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 41866 1876 Male franchise Fitted valuesMale franchise (% male voting age population) % Over-representation of parliamentary voters in 1866 Over-representation of parliamentary voters denotes the extent to which citizens qualifying to vote in Parliament were over-represented in the municipal electorate (see Equation 8). Af- ter the 1869 reforms there is no evidence that these wealthier citizens were over-represented amongst the electorate. Source: Author's calculations using data from House of Commons (1866), and municipal franchise series (see Appendix B). rental values|that is, the value at which it was estimated the property could be rented for a 12 month period ( communibus annis ). The rental value information is highly disaggregated, with information on the number of occupiers renting property split into 27 bins: under $4, at$1 intervals to $20 (and also at $10 exactly), at $10 intervals to $100 and over $100. I assume that rental values were uniformly distributed within each bin. The distribution of rental value in the reports is particularly apposite for our purposes, since it relates to male occupiers|precisely the category of potential voters in the main franchise measure. The data was collected to examine the potential e ect of altering the 80rental value at which the Parliamentary vote was gathered, and so was based on identifying possible additions to the electorate. Individuals occupying two properties were, for instance, included only once (at the maximum of the two values). The way in which these values were assessed means that they provide an accurate es- timate of property values. Property values in Britain were assessed at least once per year, since they formed the basis of local taxation. Tax assessments were carried out by local parish o\u000ecials, and then con rmed by an Assessment Committee at the level of the Poor Law Union. This latter stage was implemented in the early 1860s to address concerns that parishes were distorting values to reduce the tax burden. Further, to the extent that val- ues were distorted prior to this date, it was through allowing considerable deductions (for repairs, insurance and other expenses) in assessing the \\rateable\" value on which tax was determined. To estimate the proportion of the population that are working class, I use information from household budgets in Horrell (1996, particularly Tables 1 and 5). These budgets report the household expenditure and rents of 7 occupational groups across a diverse mix of geo- graphical locations between 1840 and 1854. Two of the occupational groups are agricultural: I remove these, and then estimate the average rent paid by working classes, weighted by occupation.64|providing an estimate of $7.2 per annum. I then de ne poor households as those paying a rent lower than this value|the resulting distribution across towns is displayed in the left hand panel of Figure A.VII. The proportion of these poor households in the town electorate is then calculated on the basis of two assumptions. First, that all compounders are poor (the percentage of the town voters that are compounders in 1866 is reported in House of Commons Parliamentary Papers (1866a)). Second, I assume that, apart (potentially) from compounders, the franchise is extended in descending order of income. In other words, I assume the poor are enfranchised 64Occupational shares are given in Horrell (1996, fn. 38). 81Figure A.VII: Variation in the estimated proportion of poor households and poor voters across time.

The right hand panel displays the percentage of municipal voters in these towns estimated to be poor before and after the reforms. Data is displayed only for those towns included in the main analysis in Section 5: a total of 112 towns. See text for data sources and estimation details. only when the extent of the franchise is greater than the share of non-poor voters in the town. As the franchise grows over time, this threshold is crossed in an increasing proportion of towns. As shown in the right hand panel of Figure A.VII, there is a clear rightward shift in the distribution of this variable following the reforms in 1869 and 1878. As a sanity check, I re-estimate the regressions in Table V re-de ning \\poor\" as those below the median household income in 1860 estimated by MacKenzie (1921). She estimates that 18% of households worked in agriculture, so this value translates into approximately the sixth decile of urban households. Her standard household at this income level included 3 children, with an income of $53 and rental spending of $7.8 per annum. I carry out a robustness test using this alternative threshold in the following subsection. Further reassurance that these estimates are reasonable is that living in a dwellings of over$6 rateable value was frequently used as a potential \\lower limit\" for obtaining the 82Parliamentary franchise in the 1850s and seen as a bulwark against providing the working classes with democratic control (Seymour, 1915). On average across Parliamentary boroughs the rateable value was around 18% less than the rental value (calculations using House of Commons, 1866, Return F); and so the poverty de nition above is in line with this threshold. D.3 Robustness Tests The results in the main text are robust to inclusion of alternative controls, alternative de - nition of poor voters, and varying the de nition of the periods in which enfranchisement is allowed to take e ect. Table A.VIII repeats the speci cations from Table ??with the addition of controls for the tax base per capita (speci cation (3)) and the lagged dependent variable (speci cation (5)). The ndings are largely unchanged, except that the e ect size is smaller when controlling for the lagged dependent variable (as expected, since doing so reduces unexplained variation in the variable of interest). Table A.VIII presents the e ect of re-estimating the speci cations with the alternative de nition of poor voters, de ned using MacKenzie (1921) and discussed above. The results are extremely similar to those with the main results (that is, using the de nition based on Horrell (1996)). In some ways this is not that surprising since the alternative poverty thresholds di er by less than 10%; however it demonstrates that the results are not sensitive to small changes in the way the poverty threshold is de ned. As a more stringent test of robustness to the poverty de nition, in Table A.X I re- estimate the results again, de ning households as poor only if their rental income is less than 80% of the threshold in my primary de nition. The results are in line with the theoretical prediction that the negative e ect of adding even poorer voters should remain if we de ne poverty more stringently, with the coe\u000ecients for the second period consistently higher than those in the main speci cation. The same is generally true for the rst period, except when 83including town size time trends or limiting the sample. We must be cautious with these results given the small sample|only 12 towns are \\treated\" (compared to 29 in the main regressions)|but they at least demonstrate that the ndings are not an artefact of the way \\poor\" households are de ned. Finally, Table A.XI shows that the results are not dependent on the speci c periods into which I split the treatment. Here, I identify four windows: a pre-reform period of 1867{69, an intermediate period 1870{1873, and two post-reform periods (shorter than the main analysis), also 4 years in length, of 1874{1877 and 1878{1881. The \\intermediate\" period here is immediately after the main reform, but I largely include the relevant years as \\pre-reform\" in the main analysis on the basis that the new electorate would take time to have an e ect on council decisions. By varying that de nition here, I check whether the main ndings are driven either by the inclusion of post-reform years in the \\pre-treatment\" period. Shortening the total period also allows me to check that the ndings are not driven by events more than 12 years after the most important reform in 1869. The results of these speci cations is consistent with the main ndings, although the smaller treatment windows lead to noisier estimates. In the main speci cations ((1) and (7)) the coe\u000ecients for last two periods are negative and statistically signi cant at a 5% level, while the coe\u000ecient for the rst post-reform period is zero or weakly negative|consistent with a weaker e ect in these early years as the new electorate takes time to have an ef- fect. Coe\u000ecients in robustness checks are similar, although in some cases lose statistical signi cance at conventional levels|consistent with greater noise due in the smaller analysis windows. Together, the speci cations demonstrate that the ndings in Table ??are not a consequence of the speci c way in which the treatment windows have been de ned. Finally, Table A.XII repeats the analysis using a continuous measure of the change in the enfranchisement of the poor voters, than the binary indicator used previously. The results are again similar, with negative coe\u000ecients in both periods. In contrast to the main results, 84the coe\u000ecient in the rst period is not always statistically distinguishable from zero at conventional levels. This noisiness is again not surprising, given the extent of approximation in constructing the level of poor enfranchisement. 85Table A.VIII: Results in Table V are robust to inclusion of additional control variables.

First, fractional polynomial regressions demonstrate that the inverted-U- relationship is robust to allowing for more exible parametric reforms than the quadratic regressions reported in the main text. Second, additional quadratic speci cations show that the results are robust to the inclusion of alternative control variables, and to varying the sample of towns included in the analysis. E.1 Fractional Polynomial Regressions The inverted-U-shape is robust to allowing for a more exible parametric form than the quadratic speci cation presented in the main text. In particular, I model g(x) in equation 1 using a fractional polynomial (Royston and Altman, 1994) of up to two dimensions. This approach allows for a much wider range of non-linear shapes than achieved with the tra- ditional quadratic relationship|not imposing symmetry, and allowing for variation in the parametric form across speci cations.65In place of the U-test of Lind and Mehlum (2010) used in the quadratic speci cations, I implement a cluster bootstrap test of whether there is an internal turning point by re-estimating the fractional polynomial speci cation with each bootstrap two-degree lowest model deviance in each case.66The p-value is then calculated as the percentage of bootstrap samples for which the turning point is within the observed distribution of the franchise. This approach allows for the uncertainty in the model imposed when estimating the relationship, and so provides 65Speci cally, the approach compares the t of models based on choosing from a set of fractional powers, as well as allowing for logarithmic relationships. Following Royston and Altman (1994), I allow the degrees to be chosen from the set f-2,-1,-0.5,0,0.5, 1, 2 ,3 g, where a degree of 0 refers to log(x), and non-zero degrees refer to exponents. 66Speci cally, for each bootstrap sample, the turning point is classi ed as internal if both a linear function is rejected in favor of 2 degree fractional polynomial at a 10% signi cance level, and the estimated 2 degree polynomial implies a turning point within the range of the franchise data. 91a very strong test of the inverted-U-relationship. Table A.XIII shows that the inverted-U-relationship is supported for the three variables discussed above. In our case, the best tting model for total public goods expenditure in our main speci cation (1) is actually the quadratic function used in the main text. The shape is slightly di erent for the tax and sanitation expenditure dependent variables, but the turning points and e ect magnitudes remain similar to those in the main text. Again, there is no evidence of any relationship with the property receipts: the inverted-U-shape is not a result of allowing \\too much\" exibility in parametric form. Table A.XIV shows the same fractional polynomial speci cations for the analysis with the data split into 5 year periods (as in Table IV). Again the results are similar to those using the main speci cation. The inverted-U-shape emerges clearly from the data, and is not an artefact of the quadratic functional form. 92Table A.XIII: Inverted-U-Shape is robust to exible parametric form.

Tables A.XVII and Tables A.XVIII show the robustness of the results to alter- native control variables, including both those used in Figure II, and controlling for population using a quartic polynomial, rather than the categorical variable used in the main text. Ta- 94bles A.XIX and Tables A.XX repeat the main speci cations within subsamples of the main dataset. Finally, Table A.XXI shows that the lagged franchise is preferred to the current franchise in a \\horse race\" between the two variables. These additional speci cations consistently support the results in Section 5.1. Both the magnitude of the estimated e ect and statistical signi cance of the relationship are largely similar to the main results. Inclusion of additional controls for town population (either as a quartic, or the inclusion of town{decade xed e ects) does reduces the estimated magnitude, but the estimated e ects remain large: an increase of around 30% of the median spending on public goods up to the turning point, and a reduction of approximately 18% after it. E ects of the lagged dependent variable also lead to lower e ect estimates: which could re ect the franchise variable (which is lagged three years) having an e ect in previous years, or the fact that this leads to the loss of observations, particularly before the 1869 reforms. The few subsamples in which the evidence of an inverted-U-shape is only weak are likely to be explained by limited data. The U-test is insigni cant at conventional levels in three speci cations: for taxation when limiting the sample to towns with franchise beneath the turning point in 1866 (speci cation (4) in Table A.XX, p-value=0.13), and for sanitation expenditure when limiting to a balanced panel or towns without boundary changes (spec- i cations (2) and (3) in Table A.XIX, p-values 0.25 and 0.29). In both cases, the sample limitation excludes a lot of data, particularly in the early years of the analysis (recall that sanitation data is only available from 1872 onwards in any case), increasing noise in the estimates. Further, in both cases, the magnitude of the decrease after the turning point|for which the available data is less limited|remain large. Consequently, these results do not provide a major caveat to the conclusion that the relationship with the franchise and the size of government is inverted-U-shaped. 95Table A.XV: Full Results for Quadratic Speci cations in Table III.
