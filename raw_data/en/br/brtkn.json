In college, I spent several years conducting basic science research in immunology, but I found myself wanting a more direct connection with people. In medical school, famed neurologist Norman Geschwind introduced me to the magic of the brain and the mind. At that time, the field of neurology covered only a few disorders that were treatable by doctors. Epilepsy was one such disorder in which doctors had an opportunity to help patients. It also offered a window into how the brain works. I am fortunate to be the director of NYU Langone's [Comprehensive Epilepsy Center](/locations/comprehensive-epilepsy-center), where we have one of the world's finest epilepsy surgeons: Dr. Werner Doyle. We have a large, dedicated team of epileptologists and neuropsychologists who have collaborated to pioneer several techniques, including responsive neurostimulation therapy, multistage epilepsy surgery, and multiple subpial transection. We often treat patients who were told by other medical institutions that they couldn't benefit from treatment. Our professionals are experts in many diverse areas, from new medication development and diagnostic procedures, to scientific studies of cognitive and behavioral functions, to surgical procedures. These specialists are bound together by a deep, shared sense of teamwork and compassion. At the center, our philosophy isn't simply \"no seizures, no side effects\"; it involves finding a treatment balance that allows children and adults with epilepsy to lead full, high-quality lives.

The major goal of the Center is to provide comprehensive care to people with epilepsy. Routine and advanced diagnostic studies, 10 clinical pharmacologic trials, and a variety of therapeutic interventions are carried out to better understand the disorder and improve treatment. Dr. Devinsky and his co-investigators are presently conducting studies of several investigational antiepileptic medications such as topiramate, tiagabine, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine, and remacemide, as well as vagal nerve stimulator implantation. The Comprehensive Epilepsy Center offers 16 inpatient video-EEG-monitored beds in a specialized Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. Each bed has the capacity for 64 channels of EEG data with on-line computer analysis for 24-hour seizure and spike detection. Preoperative neuropsychological assessment, invasive monitoring including depth and subdural electrode studies, intraoperative electrocorticography and functional localization of language, motor and sensory areas permits precise surgical approaches to remove epileptic tissue while sparing necessary brain areas. Dr Devinsky is the Principal Investigator of the [SUDC Registry and Research Collaborative](https://sudc.org/research-and-medical-info/sudc-registry-research-collaborative), a multisite collaborative created at NYU Langone Health with Columbia University, the Mayo Clinic, and a team of national forensic pathologists which studies sudden unexplained deaths in children (SUDC). It is the largest study into SUDC ever created. SUDC represents the fifth leading category of death in toddler aged children.
