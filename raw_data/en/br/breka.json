Recommendation for Further Services (Referrals) Guidelines HealthPartners offers many types of commercial plans to meet the needs of our employers and individuals. Most employer groups choose plans with an open access network that does not require a Recommendation for Further Services for claims payment (a referral); however, there are employers that choose Primary Clinic Plans that may require referrals. Some of the Primary Clinic product types that re quire referrals are: HealthPartners Primary Clinic Copay Options IV SI, Allina Advantage, Park Nicollet First Plan, and HP Tiered Referral Plan -Benefit Level 1, 2,3, and 4. This list is subject to change. It is up to the provider to check eligibility in formation to determine if referrals are required for their patients. Eligibility may be checked on the Provider Portal at healthpartners.com/provider/ . After logging in, select Eligibility. If you ha ve a patient that is part of a Primary Clinic Plan or one of the product types noted above that requires referrals you can access and enter referral information through the Provider Portal using the Referral Maintenance Application health partners.com/provider /. After logging in, select Referral Inquiry or Referral Maintenance to (create, update, view, and retrieve/answer Referral Authorization Inquiries (RAI). An RAI is generated when a member assig ned to a Primary Clinic receives services outside of that clinic's specialty referral network. The member may or may not have been directed by the Primary Clinic care system; however, it is important for providers to respond to these RAI's indicating if t he care was referred by the Primary Clinic care system or not. The RAI response is needed so the outstanding claim can be processed appropriately. RAI notifications are sent to providers via the Provider Portal. There is no indicator on the portal that an RAI has been sent when you log on so it is important to check your work queues regularly to view and respond to RAI's.

It was important for us to achieve sustainable clinical improvement in ventilator weaning rates. Instead of solely focusing on nursing and pulmonary disciplines, we created a five -phase, integrated interdisciplinary pathway to ventilator liberation involving multiple hospital departments, many of whom are not typically included in ventilator weaning programs. O utcomes included: Above the national benchmark standard for ventilator weaning for the last 17 months resulting in patients regaining their mobility and voice. 2% drop in mean length of stay with reduction in total cost of care. Fast Facts November 2011 6 Allina Hospitals & Clin ics Effectively Using Lay Persons to Support Chronic Disease Care There is a clear imperative to ensure that care is provided to all patients effectively and systematically and address the inadequacies and consequences of the typical 15 minute patient- physician encounter. Our innovation introduced a new primary care paradigm - a team -based, patient -centered approach focused intensely on chronic disease management for patients with diabetes, heart failure and hypertension using non -clinically trained lay pe rsons called care guides. Outcomes included: 28% improvement (p<.001) on adherence to 13 nationally recommended care guidelines. One patient worked with a care guide for less than three months on exercising and diet to lose weight. She lost 26 pounds and r eported \"never feeling happier or healthier.\" Her physician remarked, \"I can't believe it. I've been trying to get her to lose weight for 3 years.\" HealthEast Care System Successful Outpatient Management of Kidney Stone Disease Many patients with kidn ey stones return to the ED multiple times due to recurrent symptoms. Patients then tend to receive duplicative imaging studies and are frequently admitted to the hospital. Our apporach was to offer early expert review and care in decision making regardi ng hospital adm ission and to facilitate outpati ent management with same -day and next -day visits using a dedicated subspecialty stone management clinic. Outcomes included: Very high patient satisfaction ranking in the 91st percentile nationally. 96% of pa tients were able to get an appointment as soon they wanted. Reduced unnecessary repeat ED visits, hospital admissions/readmissions and non -definitive surgery resulting in a 21.2% reduction in cost of care overall. Allina Hospitals & Clinics Reducing Di sparities of Quality and Access in the Emergency Room Assessment of Mental Health Conditions Using Telemedicine . We wanted to provide access to mental health specialty care at regional sites that currently do not have the volume to support on -site staffing . We used the Tele- Health technology, currently available in regional sites, to provide the same high quality mental health assessment and treatment plan no matter where a patient presents for care. Outcomes included: Improved access to specialty care wi th immediate face to face crisis assessments with the patient, their family, and ED treatment teams by a licensed clinician. Decreased ED length of stay and \"avoidable\" hospitalizations. Therapy Partners, Inc Value Based Purchasing Model for Physical Ther apy Health care providers are challenged by present insurers' reimbursement models to provide services that achieve the \"Triple Aim\" - measurable quality, exceptional service, lower total cost. Therapy Partners (TPI) and Focus on Therapeutic Outcomes, Inc (FOTO) developed a value -based measurement of patient outcomes that considered risk -adjusted utilization and functional improvement measures. Outcomes included: Faster recovery with more effective care plans - Therapists and patients effectively adjust ca re plans and expected outcomes based on more responsive treatment data. 33% less utilization compared to FOTO national average and 50% less utilization compared to other national database.

Fast Facts November 2011 7 North Memorial Honoring Choices Across the System We lacked a system -wide approach to advance care planning. We used an interdisciplinary team using the Honoring Choices model of advance care planni ng across the enterprise with both our patients and our employees. Outcomes included: Employees had assistance from coworkers whom they trusted. Patients and their family had timely answers to questions and help in completing the form. St. John's Hospita l - HealthEast Late Pre -Term Infant Program Little research existed about the needs of late pre -term infants, even though they are at higher risk of complications, including potentially life -threatening ones. Evidence -based protocols for this group rema in rare. Our maternity care center physicians and nurses have long been concerned by the readmissions for these infants. Our gap analysis identified infants born in the 36th week are the most vulnerable. We created a n NICU navigation system designed spec ifically to assess late pre -term infants, providing them an increased level of care. Two follow -up phone calls are made with all families. Outcomes included: Parents have their baby's first primary care clinic appointment scheduled before discharge. Mar ked decrease in readmissions, with only 2 re -admissions out of 57 infants compared to 16 re -admissions the previous year.

Induction of Labor Prior to 39 Weeks - New DHS Requirements Effective January 1, 2012 The Department of Human Services (DHS) has implemented a new progra m, Evidence -Based Childbirth , to reduce the number of elective inductions of labor prior to 39 weeks gestation. The program promotes hospitals having policies and procedures in place to prohibit the use of elective inductions prior to 39 weeks. Attendi ng providers must adhere to the policy established by the hospital. If the hospital where the delivery occurred does have a policy that prohibits the elective induction of labor prior to 39 weeks, and the policy has been approved by DHS, attending provider s are not required to submit further documentation with claims submission. If the hospital where the delivery occurred has no policy, the attending provider must submit additional information with the claim submission regarding the nature of the labor and delivery, including any induction that was performed. The information is required to be submitted on a form that is currently in the process of being created by DHS. If the additional information is not included with the claim, the professional claim m ay be denied. DHS will maintain a list of hospitals that have approved policies in place. This list will be maintained on the DHS web site. In addition, all hospitals and health plans will be required to submit an annual report to DHS of labor and deliv ery inductions for Medical Assistance members. The format and process to submit these reports are in the process of being established. Watch for further information from the Department of Human Services DHS and HealthPartners. Performance Improvement P rojects For Minnesota Health Care Program Seniors Aspirin Therapy for Members with Diabetes and Heart Disease - This collaborative project was successfully concluded on September 1, 2011. The improvements seen during the three years of the project will continue with the support of care providers. Eligible members who do not have a contraindication for aspirin will benefit from a prescription for aspirin therapy based on best practice guidelines. A written or electronic prescription for aspirin allows mem bers to use their benefit coverage to defray the cost and promotes awareness and patient safety in medication use. Fast Facts November 2011 15 New Member Utilization of Preventive Care - New members are encouraged to have a comprehensive physical examination within six (6) months of enrollment. This annual exam is a covered benefit for Medicaid and now Medicare members. Based on a recent audit using billing codes, a comprehensive annual exam is being coded in only 10 -12% of new members to the health plan. This does not appear accu rate based on a review of a sampling of medical records and from anecdotal reports by the member's Care Coordinators. These members are usually seen frequently for medical reasons and, often, preventive care and/or a comprehensive physical exam is perform ed during one of these visits. If a member is seen for a 'routine office visit to manage a disease and receives a full comprehensive examination both the disease management code and the comprehensive examination code can be entered for 'reason for visit'. By doing so, a more accurate reflection of the percentage of new members receiving a comprehensive/preventive care exam can be made. Comprehensive/ Preventive Care Exam - Definition Preventive visits are annual physical exams that include: a review of their ongoing medical conditions, assessment of functional status, with attention to fall risk, incontinence, high risk medications, and advanced directives, anticipatory guidance, risk factor reduction interventions or counseling, and orders for appropriate immunizations or laboratory/diagnostic procedures.

The first year of the project showed, at the collaborative level, a modest increase in rates of blood pressure management to the goal of BP less than 140/90. Member activation postcards are mailed and MTM letters are sent to educate and encourage more member involvement in their care. Transitions of Care - Each of the three plans participating in this collaborative project is w orking with one provider group and one hospital to improve the percentage of the providers' patients that are discharged from hospital to home and seen in for an office visit within 15 days. The hospitals within the project have undertaken one or more pro jects to improve the discharge process within the facility and increase the post -discharge primary care provider visit rate. This multi- disciplinary project supports the Safe Care Transitions initiatives and Reducing Readmission initiatives promoted local ly and nationally.
