This is partially offset by lower Other Expenses ($6.7 million) mainly dueto lower demolition and transfer expenses and lower Interest Expens e ( $0.2 mill ion) in accordance with the repayment schedule for the Commonwealth loans.

Strategic I ndicator 1 shows that public housing is highly targeted: all of t hose housed within three months we re in greatest need. Households i n g reatest need are those that are homeless, in inappropriate housing such as living in very overcrowded conditions, or in housing that isadversely affecting their health or whose safety is at risk including people experiencing domestic violence. Of the households that were in greatest need and allocated within thr ee mo nths, one in five were households experiencing domestic v iolence. Data for Strategic Indicator 2 is gathered from a national survey undertaken in 2018, taking a random sample of housing tenants. Tenants are asked whether or not they experience various benefitsthrough living in public housing. Around four out o f every five tenants report that public housing assists them to participate in the community. Against Strategic Indicator 3, Canberra's homelessness services show a high level of success in achieving positive employment outcomes for people who are homeles sness or at risk of homelessness. Of those clients who needed assistance with employment or training (1 65), the number who were employed at the start of assistance compared to thenumber who were employed at the end of assistance, shows a 55 % i ncrease (aga inst a target of a 62% increase) . T he below target result for Strategic Indicator 3 reflects fluctuat ion over time in the relatively small number of clients needing assistance in this domain and moving from unemployment to employment . There wer e mo re clients employed after support in 2016 -17 than in 2015- 16 (45 compared to 41), but because the indicator measures change in clients 3ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: employed before and after support, the indicator result is lower for 2016- 17. Housing ACT has redeveloped this indicator to improve its stability , cl arity and relevance and in future years will report on the a chievement of independent housing for clients of homelessness services. This will bemeasured as the proportion of all specialist homelessness service s cl ients who achieve independent housing at the end of support. Key Information The February 2018 Auditor- General's Report on strategic and accountability indicators ma de recommendations regarding the ACT Government's Performance and Accountabil ity Framework (the Framework). A specific recommendation for Housing ACT was that we address problems identified with Strategic Indicator 3 (employment outcomes for homeless people, see Attachment B). In particular, the indicator was assessed as not meeting the criteriaof: oRepresentative - because the 2016 -17 Budget in Brief did not specify employment outcomes of homeless people as a Government priority, oClarity - because it was unclear if the indicator was measuring changes in employment outcomes or access to support services. oSustainable - because it was unclear how this measure could be consistently measured overtime. Housing ACT consequently proposed a new indicator Strategic Indicator 3: People who are homeless or at risk of homelessness are assisted to achieve independenthousing. This indicator will be measured as the proportion of all specialisthomelessness services clients (with a closed support period in the financial year)who achieve independent housing at the end of support. The new indicator addresses the represe ntativeness criteria because it is directly related to the purpose of homelessness services to reduce homelessness. Itaddresses the clarity of the indicator by providing more detailed information aboutthe method of calculation in the indicator description. It addresses the sustainabilitycriteria by drawing data from all clients who have exited ACT homelessness services in the year, thus producing more stable results over time due to the larger number of cases. 4ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Strategic Indicator One Percentage of all ocations housed within 90 days that were in the greatest need Original Target Actual Result Variance 2017 -18 2017 -18 % Percentage of Tenants 99% 100% 1% Str ategic Indicator Two Percentage of tenants indicating that public housing assists them participate in the community Original Target Actual Result Variance 2017 -18 2017 -18 % Percentage of Tenants 79% 79% 0% Str ategic Indicator Three Improvement in employment o utcomes as a result of support Original Target Actual Result Variance 2017 -18 2017 -18 % Improvement in employment outcomes 62% 55% -11% 5ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 24/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: Accountability Indicators for the year ending 30 June 2018 (p.331) Talking points: Total cost of $191,934 million was 6% below target. One of the main reasons for this was that the anticipated depreciation expenses for th e di sposal of Northbourne and Stuart Flats (under the Public Housing Renewal Program) occurred in 2018 -19 rather than 2017- 18. Indicator (a) shows that Housing ACT continue s to assist those in greatest need with 9 9% of new allocation of housing to applicants wh o w ere in the high need or priority category and 9 4% of public housing tenants are receiving a rental rebate. Indicators (b) and (i) show t he 30 June 2018 results for the total number of social housing properties (11,903) and occupancy rate for publi c ho using dwellings (96%). B oth are influenced by the progress of the Public Housing Renewal Program. At 30 June 2018, both Northbourne Flats and Stuart Flats were largely empty as residents were transferred out to their new homes. These large multiunit complexes wer e t ransferred to the Suburban Land Agency in the first quarter of 2018 -19. Indicator (f ), the public hous ing tenant satisfaction measure for 2017 -18 w as lower than anticipated (73% against a target of 80%). The target for public housing tenant satisfaction had been set high relative to trend with expectation that the improved housing situation of tenantsrelocated through the Public Housing Renewal Program, and the improvement of services offered through the digitisation of services , w ould result in higher satisfaction . H ousing ACT is in the early stages of digital transformation of service s w ith the first pr oduct launch to coincide with the release of the Housing Strategy. The benefits of digitisation will be progressively realised through iterative redesign of service channels. By 30 June 2018 tenant relocation under the Public Housing Renewal Program had af fected a relatively small proportion of the tenan t po pulation and where the sample had captured those affected by the move, the survey is likely to have measured their satisfactio n i mmediately after or during the transition period of settling into a new 6ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 24/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: home. Again, the benefits of renewal are expected to become evident over the coming years. Key Information Material variances from target The following accountability indicators had a result that was a greater variance : oTotal cost ( -6%); o(f) Satisfaction with the provision of public housing ( -9%); o(h) Satisfaction with the provision of community housing ( -18%); o(j) Percentage of tenant accounts >=$500 and four or more weeks in arrears on repayment agreements ( -19%). Tenant satisfaction with community housing fell short of the target of 85%. A mong the diverse range of community housing organisations participating in the collection, some faced particular challenges in 2017 -18. Maintenance concerns were issues for tenants of some organisations. C oncerns about long term tenure has also impacted on the satisfaction reported by tenants of one organisation. The measure of tenants on an agreement to repay their rental debt has fallen below target. The result is a reflection of the cost -of-living pressu res facing the lowest income households. Between 2016 -17 and 2017 -18, the number of public housing tenants on an agreement to repay their debt has changed little (529 and 526 respectively). However the number of tenants with rental debt at $500 or more orwith four or more weeks in arrears has increased over the two years, from 678 to730. Housing ACT works with tenants to reduce their arrears, particularly throughearly intervention and engagement strategies. Tenants of Ainslie Village have reported some scepticism regarding the ACT Governments intentions for the Ainslie Village site. This has impacted on the overallsatisfaction reported by tenants of Ainslie Village and on contributing measures such as satisfaction with the information provided to them. 7ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 22/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext:74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: Rent Revenue and Rebates 2017- 18 Talking points: Housing ACT manages over 11, 500 properties (as at 30 Sep 2018) on behalf of the ACT Government. The portfolio generated $232 million in market rent revenue in 2017 -18, a slight increase on the $228 million in 2016 -17. Housing assistance occurs through the provision of rental subsidy to eligible tenants. Tenants are generally required to pay 25% of a ssessable income or market rent whichever is lower. The rental subsidy amounted to $145 million in 2017- 18 ($142 million in 2016- 17).

The Summit brought together 200 people with wide -ranging expertis e a nd perspectives, including representatives from industry, the housing and community sector, as well as public housing tenants and people with lived experience of homelessness. Summit participants were invited to: oGenerate and discuss potential solutions and innovative ideas tosolve the housing and homelessness challenges in the ACT; oFurther develop suggested inputs to the ACT Government housingand homelessness strategy; a nd oIde ntify tangible, efficient and practical solutions which do not need Government intervention and which could be progresse d w ithin the community. The Summit was the final stage of an extensive seven week community consultation process which sought feedback on the Towards a new Housing Strategy discussion paper. Participant feedback on the Summit was predominantly positive a nd s howed enthusiasm for continued collaboration to address housing a nd ho melessness challenges in the ACT. A summary report of what we heard at during the Summit and widerconsultation process has been released on the YourSay Towards a New Housing Strategy website. The ideas and discussions heard from the Summit are helping to guide and inform the development of the new ACT Housing Strategy , currently being progressed in collaboration between Housing ACT and EPSDD. 11ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: A key priority in developing the Housing Strategy has been ensuring alignment with other key pieces of work being progressed across government, including the Public Housing Asset Management Plan, th e H ousing Choices project, and the upcoming review of the Residential Tenancies Act. Key Information The Housing and Homelessness Summit was organised by Housing ACT and EPSDD in collaboration with key community organisations. It was a one -day event held at the QT Hotel and brought together a wide range of experiences and perspectives of the challenges of housing affordability and homelessness. PricewaterhouseCoopers provided facilitation and logistical support for the Summit and much of this effort was provided on a pro bona basis. This support is estimate d to be valued at up to $250,000. The Summit provided the Minister for Housing and Suburban Development, Ms Yvette Berry, with an opportunity to announce three key initiatives to support innovative solutions to housing affordability and homelessness. This included: o$1 million for a Housing Innovation Fund to support new affordable housinginitiatives in the Territory; oreleasing 530 sites in the 2017 -2018 financial year for affordable home purchase and public and community housing; and oestablishing a new affordable home purchase database to ensure that future affordable home purchasers are appropriately targeted. Background Information - from the annual report On 17 October 2017, the Minister for Housing and Suburban Development hosted the ACT Housing and H omelessness Summit. The Summit marked the culmination of an extensive program of community consultation to inform the development of a new 10 year housing and homelessness strategy to reduce homelessness, strengthen social housing assistance and increase h ousing affordability in the ACT. A diverse range of participants across industry, community and government, as well as people with lived experience of homelessness have contributed to this comprehensive strategy which will be released in 2018 . 12QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Community Services TRIM Ref: Portfolio Housing & Suburban Development I SSUE: Continued Support for tenants during and beyond the relocation process as part of the Public Housing Renewal Program Talking points: The Public Housing Renewal Program will deliver new homes that will better meet tenants' needs now and into the future, creating a mor e s ustainable public housing system. The Program includes the relocation of public housing tenants fro m 1, 288 properties across 13 public housing sites. The Public Housing Renewal Program Tenant Relocation Team has bee n wor king on the relocation of tenants from all of the 13 multi -unit sites that are part of the program. Tenant Relocation Officers work with each individual tenant for nine months prior and three months post relocation. Post relocation support has a focus on ensuring that the tenant hassettled into their new home and community, supports are in place and provide an opportunity to engage additional supports , if required. For each renewal site the relocation and follow up happens over fivephases. The first phase of each site reflects on the program's scope, deliverablesand timelines , along with any lessons learnt from prior site relocations. The second phase involves speaking with tenants individually about their relocation needs and location preferences. Tenant Relocation Officers and members of the Transforming Communities Partnership actively engage with tenants to raise awareness of relocation a ctivities , such as BBQs or information sessions. Phase three commences when stock being acquired (purchased or built ) by the Taskforce is transferred to Housing ACT. Once stock is available , the logistics of tenant relocation can be planned. 13QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Community Services TRIM Ref: This include s processing transfer applications, viewing properties, arranging removalists and signing tenants to new tenancy agreements for their new homes. Phase four is the supported move of tenants, cost reimbursements a nd r econnection of utilities. Phase five consists of follow up engagement with tenants and client service visits post -relocation. The successful relocation of so many people is a result of listening to tenants and engaging through a strength based person centre d a pproach. As the renewal program continues it remains a government priority that tenants continue to be supported during and beyond their journeys to their new homes. At 3 October 2018, 702 tenancies, resulting in 945 people have bee n r elocated to their new homes over the life of the program s o far.

I n overseeing the relocation of tenants the LINCT has tasked the Transforming Communities Partnership - a practitioners group to undertake continuous engagement and consultation with the tenants to be relocated before, during and after the relocation p rocess. The Tenant Relocation Strategy underpins the relocation of public housing tenants from 1,288 dwellings across 13 public housing sites along Northbourne Avenue and other sites across the city. The Strategy acts as a framework for government, the c ommunity sector and residents to co -design their successful relocation and maximise the opportunities created by planned social housing redevelopment. There will be different considerations for each site over time. In realising the opportunitiesof planned redevelopment a key strategy applied to tenant relocation has been a person - centred and strengths -based approach to tenant engagement activities. 15QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 30/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Portfolio Housing & Suburban Development I SSUE: Implementation of the Public Housing Asset Management Plan under the ACT Housing Strategy Talking points: Public housing is a vehicle for better lives, social inclusion, building stronger communities and for the long term financial viability of the Territ ory. Our stewardship of this significant public asset is important to ensure that safe, affordable and secure housing is made available for vulnerable Canberrans who need it - now - and into the future. Work is underway to develop a plan for the strategic management of th e publ ic housing portfolio. The Public Housing Asset Management Plan will set the strategic vision for growth and renewal of the public housing portfolio and guide the development of our five year capital works program from 2019- 20 to 2024-2 5. The plan continues work - already commenced under the Public Housi ng A sset Management Strategy 2012 -2017 and the Public Housing Renewal Project - to upgrade Canberra's ageing public housing stock, improve tenant outcomes and support the broader renewal of Canberra's city and urban areas. The asset management plan will guide the sales, purchase a nd r edevelopment of the public housing portfolio into the future, with a focus on creating better: oclient outcomes - by growing, renewing and reconfiguring dwellings to suit contemporary tenant need; ocommunity outcomes - by further promoting the 'salt and pepper' approach to support diver se and vibrant local communities, positive social and ec onomic outcomes and client choice; and oprogram sustainability - by responsibly maintaining the value a nd quality of this substantial public good. 16QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 30/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: This plan will support the achievement of the future ACT Housi ng S trategy goal to strengthen public housing assistance and leverages th e e xtensive community feedback provided on the issue of affordable housing leading up to the Affordable Housing Summit in October 2017 .

Under the new agreement the ACT receives around $130.7 million i n C ommonwealth funding over five years. This provides much needed certainty for the ACT's social housing and homelessness sectors. This funding is in addition to the $125 million the ACT Governmentspends each year on social housing, and $144 million paid each year i n r ental rebates for public housing. This Agreement complements the extensive range of work alre ady unde rway in the ACT. It aligns with current ACT homelessness service delivery and the new budget commitments to increase frontline homelessness service. The new ACT Housing Strategy has become a condition of funding underthe Agreement and will be key to its implementation. The new Housing Strategy will focus on assisting those who need it most - people experiencing homelessness and low income households in housingstress. While the ACT Government is dedicated to implementing an effectiv e s trategy, it is vitally important that the Commonwealth Government uses its unique policy levers to influence improved affordability a nd a ddress the social and economic drivers of homelessness. Key Information The National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA) cam e into effect on 1 July 2018. The NHHA replace s the existing National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) and related National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (NPAH).

The new ACT Housing Strategy will meet these conditions as it will cover both homelessness and housing. The new ACT Housing Strategy is due to be released in October 2018. Under the new NHHA, the ACT Government is represented on a national data working group, led by the Commonwealth, to develop nationally consistent indicators for housing and homelessness. NHHA funding consists of general funding, homelessness funding and SACS. Table 1 below outlines the estimated funding components for the ACT under the new Agreement. The Commonwealth homelessness funding component of theagreement must be allocated to homelessness services, however generalCommonwealth funding can be allocated to either housing or homelessness.

Background Information The NHHA is a multilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and States and Territories, supported by a series of outcomes -focussed bilateral agreements between th e C ommonwealth and each state and territory jurisdiction. The NPAH has previously been a t ime limited agreement, and, since 2013, has been on a year to year arrangement. The ACT Government has welcomed the NPAH being rolled intothe ongoing NHHA, and the commitment to apply indexation to all funding. On 26 October 2017, the Commonwealth introdu ced a Bill in the House of Representatives seeking changes to the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. States and Territories were no t c onsulted on the draft Bill and opposed the Commonwealth taking unilateral action. 19QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: The Senate referred the legislation t o the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry. The Committee issued its report on 6 February 2018 with the recommendation that the Bill b e p assed. States and Territories made a joint submission to the Inquiry recommending that the Bill be withdrawn an d replaced, highlighting that in its current form it could place funding for critical front line homelessness and social housing services at risk. The submission also recommended significant amendments in the event the Bill is passed, in order to ensure ju risdictions retain control over the content of their own housing strategies. On Thursday 1 March 2018, in recognition of State and Territory concern about theCommonwealth's span of control under the new legislation, the House of Representativespassed the Bill with significant amendments. In particular, amendments made clear that the quality or effectiveness of State and Territory housing and homelessness strategies,including the accuracy of the level of housing supply, is a matter for states and territoriesonly. 20QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Portfolio Housing & Suburban Development I SSUE: STUDY INTO SUPPORT NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH HIGH AND COMPLEX NEEDS (COHORT STUDY INCLUDING MYHOME AND AINSLIE VILLAGE) ($0.350 million in 2017- 18) Talking points: The Government is committed to addressing the challenges faced by people in the ACT who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. For people with enduring mental illness, substance abuse and othercomplex problems who can often find it difficult to access accommodation and sustain tenancies, these challenges can be particularly great. People with high and complex needs may also require tailored a nd s ustained support to achieve good housing, health and well -being outcomes. The Government has recognised this and has allocated $350,000 in the2017- 18 Budget for a study ('the cohort study') into the long -ter m a ccommodation models and support requirements of people who are chronically homeless or at -risk of becoming homeless. The study is intended to help us to better understand who is at risk i n o ur community, and what their needs are, and will help us to continue to build on the strengths of our homelessness services sector. Drawing on Australian and international experience, the study is looking at models ranging from the shared living community housing at Ainslie Village to supportive housing innovations such Common Ground i n G ungahlin and HOME in Queanbeyan (which is the model for the MyHome in Canberra proposal), and help us understand how this infrastructure can meet those needs. This is an exciting era for the ACT Government and there is a great level of community interest in progressing this work. Findings from the cohort study will inform future asset and serviceplanning and delivery in the ACT. 21QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: As part of the study process, researchers from the University of Queensland have interviewed 54 people from 27 organisations fro m a cross the ACT's public and community service system as well as 16 people with a lived experience of homelessness. The study has also included the analysis of various administrative a nd po pulation- based data sets to establish the characteristics of peopl e w ho are homeless or at risk homelessness and, in particular, identifying those with 'high and complex needs'. Hous ing ACT and the consultant team are working together to bring the various parts of the study together and deliver a report to th e G overnment . Key Information Finalisation of the study has been delayed to enable further work with the consultant team on elements of the analysis and development of the report. Thecontract with the University of Queensland has been extended to the end of October 2018. Background Information The 2016 Parliamentary Agreement includes a commitment to \"work with community and business partners to construct purpose built accommodation for people experiencing mental health concerns and housing difficulties, utilising the 'MyHome for Canberra' project plan\"(PA4.7). Funding of $350,000 is provided in the 2017 -18 Budget to undertake \" work to inform future support requirements and associated long-term accommodation types for clients with highand complex needs such as the people living at Ainslie Village and the clients eligible to beaccommodated in services such as MyHome\". A Referenc e Group with representatives from peak bodies, consumer advocates and othe r k ey stakeholders including service providers with an interest in the welfare of, and services for, people who homeless or at risk of homelessness has provide d advice on the conduct of t he study, and on stakeholder engagement. Members include Diane Kargas (Chair, Board o f D irectors, Common Ground Canberra), John Tucker and Shukry Sahhar (President and Vice President, MyHome in Canberra), and Wendy Middleton (CEO, Argyle Housing whic h provides management services to Common Ground Gungahlin and Ainslie Village). The study has both quantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative componentincludes interviews with service providers and with people who are homeless or at -risk of homelessness and use their services. During April 2018, the research team held a series ofinterviews and/or focus groups with some 27 specialist services providers and othe r p eak/advocacy organisations to explore: ohow services providers understand the needs of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessne ss 22QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Community Services TRIM Ref: ohow service providers perceive the contribution of their service to addressing people's needs othe barriers or challenges that service providers face in terms of identifying andaddressing people's needs, including the challenges that they face in terms of connectin g wi th other support services othe perceived gaps in the service system or unmet client needs as identified through service providers' practice knowledge. A program of consultation with service users took place in May 2018. A number of service provider organisations assisted the research team by facilitating access to a sample ofservice users. Homelessness is regularly reported on in the media particularly in relation to rough sleeperswho are often visible and have complex vulnerabilities which contribute to the ir experiences of chronic homelessness. The release in May of the Australian Homeless Monitor 2018 showed that while the ove rall n umber of homeless people decreased in the Territory over the period 2011 to 2016, th e n umber of rough sleepers grew.

The complex of five 2 bedroom units opened in September 2016, withtenancies commencing in November 2016. The homes allow tenants to maintain connection to their family,community and culture. The Government committed to b uild on this example and identified $250,000 in the 2017 -18 budget to undertake planning and early design of further dedicated housing for older Aboriginal and Torres StraitIslander people . We have also committed a further $4.488 million over two years in t he 2018- 19 Budget to deliver on this second complex for older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Housing ACT has worked with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body to find a suitable site in Lyons for the second older persons' complex and we will continue to work closely during the community consultation period.

In late -2017, five sites were identified as potentially suitable for the second site, taking into account proximity to essential services, heritage, environmental or planning constraints,block size, yield capacity and any known sensitivities. Following a visit to each of the sites, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Bodyadvised in February 2018 that a site in Lyons was its preferred location for the secondcomplex of 5 units.

The Project Control Group has been meeting since June 2018 and has been considerin g p ossible design options for the site. Housing ACT has been undertaking community engagement on the proposed developmentsince early August 2018, including conducting two community information sessions at theLyons shops (11 August and 29 September 2018). Following feedback from the first information session, one of the original concepts was revised to address concerns about possible noise from the proposed communal open space. It is anticipated a development application will be lodg ed in October 2018 subject to the relocation of tenants and community engagement.

As a result of this collaboration the Government launched a trialprogram in December 2017 to improve energy efficiency and lower utility bills in ACT pub lic housing homes under the Energy Efficiency Improvement Scheme. This program helped public housing tenants by replacing more than 200 old, inefficient heaters with better systems, including electric reverse-cycle units that will reduce energy bills and i mprove the comfort of ho mes all year round. In 2017 -2018, 240 properties had new appliances installed. Building on the success of this trial program, the Government hasallocated a further $5.7 13m to be spent over three years, on the nex t s tage of the prog ram, with an aim to improv e energy efficiency to more than 2,000 public housing properties. The expanded program will target inefficient gas heating as well as electric space heaters. Public housing tenants will also be able to access education programsand energy audits through the Energy Efficiency Improvement Scheme and the Actsmart Low Income Program. The scheme will help tenants to reduce their power bills, use energymore efficiently and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Housing ACT will meet with the var ious business units within the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate to discuss the program design and ensure the most vulnerable householdsare being correctly targeted. 30QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 11/09/2018 Cleared by: Director Ext: 71514 Contact Officer Ext: Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Key Information As part of the Energy Efficiency Improvement Scheme Trial A ctewA GL was contracted to replace up to 75 ducted gas heaters and up to 160 gas wall flued heaters with split system heaters by 30 June 2018. The trial program has concluded with 83 ducted gas heaters and 157 gas flued heaters replaced . The inclusion of public housing properties in the program assists the retailer and ACT Government to reach the legislated targets. Housing ACT supplied a list of properties known to have gas heating to A ctewA GL who prioritised installations based on those hous eholds that consumed the largest amount of gas and would therefore benefit most from inclusion in the program. Housing ACT further prioritised those households known be experiencing utility stress as advised by the Energy and Water section of the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The continuation of the program through budget funding of $5.713 million over three years, will provide approximately 2,200 energy efficient products and upgrades. Quote from Housing ACT tenant when asked about her new reverse cycle split system installed as part of the Energy Efficiency Improvements in Public Housing trial: \"The new heater works 140 times better than the old one! It has reduced my energy bill by $40 per fortnight and now I can heat the whole house.\" B ackground Information Housing ACT have met with the various business units within the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate to discuss the program design and ensure the mos t v ulnerable households are being correctly targeted. The meetings have focused on ensuring that ensure ActewAGL 's Priority Household Targets and Housing ACT's priorities are aligned. Housing is contracting ActewAGL to undertake these energy efficiency activities and establish ing service delivery parameters.

Last year through our consultations, we heard from the community that there are groups of people either falling through the gaps or emerging aspriority groups who are at risk of homeless ness . To provide further support to our frontline services and address these gaps , the Government has allocated $6.524 million over four years. This funding will help services intervene early and support people beforetheir situation gets worse. This initiative is about: opreventing older women from losing their housing; opreventing children from entering into the statutory chil d pr otection system by supporting young mothers gain vital education and training and life skills; osupporting people who have no income because they have uncertain or no immigration status; and okeeping women and children escaping family and domesti c v iolence from churning through crisis accommodation. This funding complements the funding to front line crisis workers, s uch a s the Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DVCS) and the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, by increasing accommodation and support for women who are fleeing violent relationships. The funding includes : o$100,000 per annum to specialist domestic violence services , D oris Womens' Refuge, Beryl Women Inc and Toora Women Inc; o$80,000 per annum for Karinya House for Mothers and Babies Inc; 32QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Services TRIM Ref: o$586,000 over four years for OneLink to extend its operating hours and access brokerage funds, so that appropriate crisis support can be provided at the time it's needed. More than $1.8 million over four years will be allocated to establish a new service to better support asylum seekers and other migrants with uncertain immigration status who are in need of housing assistance . oThis funding will provide medium term accommodation a nd s uppor t to gain community connections, employment, educatio n a nd training to enable people to sustain accommodation in the longer term, while their immigration status is being resolved. Over $1.7 million over four years will also go to establish support for older women who are either homeless or at ris k of becoming homeless . T he ACT government will work with the community sector and service users over the coming months to design the new programs for asyl um s eekers and older women to ensure the funding will address key service gaps . Key Information The funding for this budget initiative scales up over the four years (budget table below refers). Therefore, p lacements also scale up from 28 in 2018 -19 to 45 in 2021 -23. Based on this we have estimated that the sector can employ additional staff time to undertake intensive case management for 36 individuals or families at any one time. The placements do not equate to beds. We are funding staff time and resources to increase the capacity of the service to support more people. One support placement could be one person for a month - or a family of six for three months , depending on the level of support required. Depending on family size and length of support thiscould be hundreds of individuals and families in a single year. For example - we currently have 900 placements across the sector at any one time - which supported nearly 5,000 clients last year. A service funding agreement variation will be put in place for Doris Womens' Refuge, Beryl Women Inc, Toora Women Inc, Karinya House for Mothers and Babies Inc. Forthe new programs to support older women and new migrants we will work with the sector to co -design these programs and then proceed to tender. 33QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Community Services TRIM Ref: B ackground Information The objective of this budget initiative is to relieve the burden on high cost crisis accommodation and support, and address gaps in service delivery by: oProviding cohorts who are at risk of homelessness with support to sustain their existing housing, or identify more suitable sustainable housing - for example older women in financial stress - before they reach crisis. oPreventing asylum seekers from entering short -term crisis accommodation by providing longer -term transitional housing and support while they resolve immigration status, gain employment and vital life skills to sustain accommodation in the long term. oIncreasing medium term support places to women and children, including thoseescaping domestic and family violence, and at risk of statutory intervention, to re-establish safe and secure housing. This initiative was informed by the extensive seven week consultation process for the new ACT Housing Strategy and the outcomes form the Housing and Homelessness Summit inNovember 2017. These activities will form the foundation of the ACT Government's response to homelessness in the new ACT Housing Strategy. They will also form part of the bilateral agreement between th e A CT Government and the Commonwealth under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. As part of this budget initiative we are also extending the operating hours of the Human Services Gateway, OneLink, to better connect people to the help they need, when they need it.

This portfolio underpins the broader human services system providing accommodation, assets and purpose -built facilities for not only public housing, but also people with mental health or a disability, refugees,older persons, people exiting corrections, those in need of childprotection, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islande r people, homelessness and mainstream services. Around seven per cent of ACT households are provided with securehousing through public and community housing programs managed or funded by Housing ACT. At 30 June 2018 , there were 10,621 households in public housing . The ACT continues to lead the nation in allocating social housing to those most in need. Of the 523 new allocations to public housing, 99% were households in greatest need . *Greatest need refers to people who are homeless, escaping domestic viol ence, in unhealthy living situations, and experiencing housing stress in the private market. T he majority, 60%, of new households placed in public housing were households with persons with specific needs. This includes people with a disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, or main tenants who are under 25 years or people 75 years and older. In 2017 -18 Housing ACT finance d a $50 million capital program to provide housing to meet tenant needs and approximately $40 million expenditure on maintenance across the portfolio. Housing Managers make over 9,000 visits to tenants in a year. 1.

To qualify for public housing in the ACT applicants must meet the eligibility criteria . Once an application is submitted, the person will be contacted by a n Asse ssment Officer from Housing ACT to arrange an assessment interview . The assessment process, including the application, an interview and any suppor ting documentation allows Housing ACT to determine an applicant's eligibility and needs category . The Multi -Disciplinary Panel, made up of Housing ACT senior officers a nd co mmunity services agencies, is engaged to assess whether applications for housing a ssistance meet the criteria for the priority housing category as outlined in the Housing Categories Needs Determination. The public housing waiting list consists of the Housing Register for people seeking public housing accommodation and the Transfer Regi ster for people seeking to transfer from their current public housing home. Housing ACT also helps people applying for housing assistance to engage with available support services while th ey are on the housing register. At 15 October 2018, there were 1,809 households on the Housing Register - that is people currently not housed by Housing ACT who are seeking housing assistance. Key Information Needs Category Standard Housing - People face significant affordability issues in obtaining housing on the private market. High Needs Housing - People must demonstrate significant needs that cannot be resolved by any reasonable means other than the provision of social housing within a reasonable timeframe. This includes significant affordability issues in obtai ning housing on the private market. 48QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Community Services TRIM Ref: Priority Housing - People must demonstrate exceptional, urgent and critical needs that cannot be resolved by any reasonable means other than the early provision of social housing and they must be able to demonstrate an ability to sustain a tenancy. Applicants that are assessed as potentially meeting the criteria and qualifying forpriority housing are referred to the Multi- Disciplinary Panel. During 201 7-18 the Multi -Disciplinary Panel met on 27 occasions and considered 168 applications. 149 of these applications (8 9%) were approved onto the priority category of the housing register. Out of turn transfers In the case of the tenants being transferred under the Public Housing RenewalProgram, these tenants will have the administrative category of \"Out of Turn\"applied. Out of Turn is not a housing needs category that applicants can apply for. Applicants who have the Out- of-Turn status receive property offers before priority housing applicants, reflecting our commitment of ensuring no -one is made homeless as a result of a redevelopment. Background Information In order to discharge Housing ACT responsibilities as a landlord under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 there is a requirement to relocate tenants due to the redevelopment of their homes and for property related condition. Housing ACT meets its obligatio n to existing tenants alongside the management of the transfer and housing registers. 49QU ESTION TIME BRIEF MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT 05 November 2018 SUBJECT: Housing ACT Waiting Lists ISSUE: Public housing in the ACT is targeted to those people in the community who are most in need ____________________________________________________________ TALKING POINTS When looking at the social housing register, two important aspects need to b e co nsidered. T he first is the total number of people on the register and how many are in each category ; the second is how long it takes to be allocated a house. As at 05 November 2018, there were 1, 801 applicants on the public housing waiting list - that is people currently not housed by Housing ACT who are seeking housing assistance. Of these 1,801 applicants, 751 are on the standar d l ist, 1,008 are on the high needs list and 42 are on the priority list. An additional 588 existing public housing tenants were seeking to transfer to another public housing property. Waiting times depend on several factors, the number of suitable vacancies that occur and the number of people who are placed on the list above peoplewho do not have a priority need. Because we target to those people most in need the people on the standard and high needs register may wait for a considerable time before a suitable property becomes available (about two to two and a half years). The waiting times for people on the priori ty list are m uch shorter - it is depende nt on a property being available that meets an applicant's needs, b ut on average it takes about three months but in some circumstances can be a m atter of weeks. There are however, some individuals who may have physical needs whi ch r equire specific structural responses which may impact the wait times. 50Q UESTION TIME BRIEF MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT 05 November 2018 Updated: 5 November 2018 BACKGROUND The number of households on the waiting list dropped from 2,309 at the end of 2015 to 1,759 at 30 Ju ne 201 8, the lowest figure since 2012. The waiting list numbers are affected by a number of factors including external factors such as housing market and economic conditions, and internal factors such as policy and program settings. Over the past few years there have been higher vacancy rates and a drop in rental prices thus making it easier for more people to access private rental. However, the latest figures show a tightening in the rental market and we expect that this will flow through to an increase in households on the waiting list. The drop in the number of households on the public housing waiting list is also partly due to a strengthening of conditions on the suitability of applications and tighter targeting in the assessment processes to ensure t hat public housing is allocated to those people who need it most. Housing ACT regularly reviews applications for housing assistance in order to respond to changes in an applicant's circumstances (such as escalating an application to a higher category or cancelling an application where applicants are no longer interested or eligible for public housing). In 201 7-18 , there were 603 applications that were removed from the waiting list. Removals were most commonly due to being assessed an d ineligible ( 30%), client withdrawal or failing to provide some relevant information (40%) and removal through the Wait List Review process ( 12%). Housing ACT also provides information to applicants about alternative options to public housing, including information on CHC Affordable Housing. Whilst people are waiting for housing, Housing ACT works with individuals to identify and respond to their specific needs and circumstances. This includes provision of information and referral to appropriate services such as Family Support Services and the Sustaining Tenancies Program. For people who are experienc ing homelessness while on the Housing ACT waiting list, Onelink is available to assist in crisis accommodation and outreach support. Onelink maintains contact with people who ar e homeless and on their waiting list to continually assess their circumstances to ensure people do not \"fall through the gaps\". Each month, an average of approximately 144 applications for new housing or transfer within public housing are received. On aver age 79 households will be housed or transferred in an average month. O ver the 201 7-18 year there were 523 new allocations to public housing, and 439 transfers. 51Q UESTION TIME BRIEF MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT 05 November 2018 Updated: 5 November 2018 Table 1.

Housing ACT is a 'social landlord' and seeks to leverage tenan t ca pabilities and strengths, respond to changing tenant circumstances, focus on early intervention responses and social, community and service system outcomes. Under the Modernising Tenancy Services model tenants are supporte d to enable them to sustain their tenancies and to live, contribute and engage positively in the community. Modernising Tenancy Services seeks to engage tenants early and tackl e p roblems before they get too large. Debt management, property condition, neighbourhood conflict and anti -social behaviour are all issues that can impact on the quiet enjoyment of one's home. Antisocial behaviour All tenants must abide by their tenancy agreement and not cause disruption to others. Housing ACT has specialist housing managers who work directly with tenants who exhibit anti -social behaviour. Housing ACT may provide referrals to agencies such as the Conflict Resolution Service for effective mediation and conflict resolution to all parties impacted by neighbourhood disharmony. Tenancy matters involving criminal activities or criminal behaviour are outside the jurisdiction of Housing ACT and are managed b y A CT Policing. Housing ACT and ACT Policing have a Memorandum of Understanding to support a close working relationship. Breach of Tenancy Agreement Substantiating complaints regarding noise and disturbance can be alengthy process. Housing ACT is impartial, transparent and fair in its 53QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Community Services TRIM Ref: approach when investigating complaints regarding disruptive or anti - social behaviour. Where evidence has been substantiated that a public housing tenant has breached their tenancy agreement Housing ACT may take action throug h th e ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal to terminate the tenancy. The tenant may be served notices under the terms of the ResidentialTenancies Act 1997 giving the tenant 14 days to remedy a tenancy breach. If the tenant is unwilling or unable to remedy the breach, formal orders for remedy or, in extreme cases, termination and possessio n o rders will be sought. Key Information Tenan t Experience is responsible for the management of social housing tenancies. Management activities include linking tenants with support (if required), monitoring tenants' compliance with residential tenancy agreements, property visits, rental rebate assessment s, and complaint and debt management. Housing ACT adopted the Modernising Tenancy Services service deli very model in 2015 to provide targeted, differentiated and outcomes focused services to tenants. An evaluation of the Modernising Tenancy Services model is to be progressed this financial year to assess its effectiveness and to identify opportunities for improvement. 54ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 22/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: 74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: T alking points: Rental rebates for public housing tenants provide a safeguard against housing stress. A household is defined as being in housing stress when it pays more than 30% of its gross income in housing costs and its income is amongst the lowest 40% of all households. The majority of public housing households have household incomes inthe lowest income quintile. They largely rely on Centrelink pensions or benefits as their main source of income. A rental rebate ensures thatthese households pay no more than 25% of the income on rent. More than 94% of tenants in public housing do not pay market rent for their property. They r eceive a rent subsidy from Housing ACT. The average weekly rental subsidy per rebated household in publichousing in 2017 -18 was $267. Over a year, this is an average rental subsidy of approximately $14,000 per household for public housing tenants. The 20 18 National Social Housing Survey of ACT tenants show s that many people appreciate the benefit that living in public housing has provided to them. In particular, they report feeling more able to cope with life events (89 % agreed this was a benefit for them ) and being able to continue living in areas that might otherwise be unaffordable (9 2% agreed this was a benefit for them). Key Information - from Annual Report Tenants are required to pay market rent unless they are eligible for a rental subsidy (rebate) , which ensures they pay no more than 25 per cent of their assessable household income as rent. Over the last five years, rental rebates have increased at approximately the samerate as market rents. The total rent subsidy provided to tenants in 2017 -18 wa s $145 million. This compares with $142 million in 2016 -17. With continued targeting of housing assistance to those most in need, the majorityof newly allocated households in 2017 -18 had a Centrelink /Commonwealth Government pension or benefit as their so le or main source of income and would most likely be eligible for a rebate. 55ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 22/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: 74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing ACT assists tenants to address their debt at the earliest possible opportunity and ensure negotiated rental repayments or arrears are no more than 30 per cent of their asse ssable weekly household income. Background Information - suitable for public disclosure At least 76% of all public housing households have a main income sourced from a Centrelink benefit (income details are not known for households who are not on a rebate). Amongthose households receiving a rebate, 81% receive a Centrelink benefit as their main income source. 56QUESTION TIME BRIEF MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT 22 October 2018 SUBJECT: Public Housing Rental Debt ISSUE: The ACT Government is committed to effectively managing debt to assist low income and disadvantaged households to sustain their public housing tenancies. ____________________________________________________________ TALKING POINTS Among 10,584 public housing tenancies, 86% have no rental debt as at 22 October 2018 . At 22 October 2018, there were 1,494 public housing households that were behind in their rent payments. The average rental debt for those behind i n pa yments was $ 1,451. At 22 October 2018, there were 6 83 households with debt over $500 and whose rent was four or more weeks in arrears. Of these, 74 % had signed a repayment agreement. The total value of rental arrears for curren t tenants at 22 October 2018 is $2,167,257. This represents approximately 2.59% of the net annual rental income . On an annual basis, the ACT Government achieves a high level of overall rental return through effective support of tenants regarding debt management and recovery . As at 30 June 2018 , the rent collection rate (total value of rent collected divided by total value of rent charged) was 9 8% i nclusive of collection of rental arrears from former and current tenants. . ____________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND Housing ACT advises tenants as soon as their rent account falls into arrear s a nd assists them to make arrangements to repay the debt, either in full or via a repayment agreement. The overall purpose of the process is to offer assistance to tenants to helpthem meet their rental commitment and, when they experience financial problems, to ensure that they are given the opportunity to repay their arrears at an affordable amount. This assists tenants to retain their home and avoi d t he possibility of homelessness. 57QUESTION TIM E BRIEF MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT 22 October 2018 Updated: 5 November 2018 Given the circumstances of many tenants, it can take some time for a debt to be repaid, therefor e debt levels may only reduce slowly. Housing ACT employs Tenant Support and Community Connection Officers(TSCCO's) to assist tenants who experience particular problems that require special attention. The TSCCO may also refer the tenant to community suppor t a gencies such as Mental Health, CARE Financial Counselling Service, Publi c T rustee, Canberra Community Law, or the Sustaining Tenancies Team. If tenants refuse to enter into a repayment agreement or to address their debt, Housing ACT will apply to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) for an order. The ACAT may make a conditional order for repayment of the arrears or issue of an unconditional Termination and Possession order (warrant of eviction). Eviction action is taken as a last resort and only in cases when a tenant is substantially behind in rental payments and has refused to take reasonable steps to address their debt.

It also provides people with an opportunity to raise their concerns a nd be heard. Housing ACT, as part of the Community Services Directorate, has implemented a new Complaints Handling and Management Policy - CHAM P T he number of complaints received by Housing ACT continues to drop. In 2016 -17, 2,211 complaints were received, reducing to 1,939 in 2017- 18. The change reflects improved practices in providing greater educatio n a nd guidance to people enquiring about anti -social behaviour a nd ne ighbourhood disputes through information and referral to external agencies. Housing ACT is committed to investigating and resolving complaints from tenants or members of the community within 28 days. In the majority of cases, this time frame is achieved. Some complaints involving anti-social behaviour and the complex nature of some issues may require a longer timeframe. Total Facilities Management - complaints Complaints and queries regarding maintenance are handled by the TotalFacilities Manager, Spotless. From 1 November 2018 Program Facility Management will provide allrepairs and maintenance services on behalf of Housing ACT. Programe d w ill manage all complaints and queries regarding maintenance and the quality and timeless of responses will be monitored by Housing ACT 59QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 22/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Ext: Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: through Quality Assurance processes and the performance management system. The majority of all complaints are resolved within the require d t imeframe and generally tenants have been satisfied with the respon se and follow up action. This is evident by the low number of second level review complaints , where the tenant has felt the need to escalate th e issu e directly to Housing ACT . Key Information From 1 July 2018 to 22 October 2018, Housing ACT has received 574 complaints, for which 228 were complaints about anti -social behaviour. From 1 July to 30 September 2018, Spotless registered 11 formal complaints with regards to maintenance and resolved 388 escalated phone calls where the caller did not want to lodge a formal complaint.

The relevant business unit is responsible for investigating complaints and taking any a ctions required to resolve the matter, including a written response to the complainant. If a complainant is not happy with a response to their complaint they may seek an independent arbiter to assess their complaint. The independent arbiter could be the AC T C ivil and Administrative Tribunal, the Human Rights Commissioner or the Ombudsman. Recently Housing ACT hosted the NSW Ombudsman in providing six sessions of training in best practice complaints handling as part of the new Community Services ComplaintsHandling and Management Policy (CHAMP). As part of the training, people who attended received a number of tools and documents with practical strategies for resolving a person's complaint. 60ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 05/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Lead Directorate: Services Housing & Suburban Development I SSUE: P ERFORMANCE ORDERS MADE BY ACAT Talking points: Performance orders can be sought when a tenant is in breach of their tenancy agreement but the breach is not sufficiently serious to justify seeking the termination of the tenancy. The power to seek these orderscomes under section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 . In 2017- 18, Hous ing ACT made seven applications for Performance Orders to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Five Performance Orders were issued for property condition and two orders were issued restraining public housing tenants from permitting or displaying ant i-social behaviour. No Performance Orders have been sought this financial year. Key Information - from Annual Report Housing ACT seeks a Performance Order when a public housing tenant is found to be in breach of their tenancy agreement because of anti -social behaviour, property condition or for abandonment of a property. In 2017- 18, Housing ACT made seven applications for Performance Orders to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Five Performance Orders were issued for property condition (a lthough one of these was only approved on 13 August 2018) and two orders were issued restraining public housing tenants from permitting or displaying anti -social behaviour. 61QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 11/09/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Lead Directorate: TRIM Ref: Portfolio Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: Evictions from Housing ACT properties Talking points: Termination of a public housing tenancy is considered an action of last resort once all other avenues have been explored to assist the tenant sustain their tenancy. In 2017- 18, 17* tenants were evicted by the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal . Housing ACT cannot evict tenants without an order from the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Following the issuing of notices as required under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997, Housing ACT needs to make an application to the Tribunal, who then determine whether the tenancy should be terminated. * In Estimates QoN #564, preliminary data indicated nine evictions in 2017- 18. Final reconciliation of data shows 17 evictions in 2017-18. This figure was corrected in a letter to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Key Information As at 3 October 2018, across 13 multi -unit complexes and 914 tenancies relocated as part of the Public Housing Renewal Program, there have been three tenancies that have required the eviction process. Legal action had commenced on two of these matters before the Tenant Relocation Team started engagement at the relevant site. Despite ongoing attempts from the Tenant Relocation Team to engage with andsupport this tenant, all offers and options to rehome in a public housing propertywere refused. During 2017 -18, 13 evictions were for non- payment of rent and four evictions were for property condition. During the first quarter of 2018 -19, there were four evictions. Background Information There has been a media focus on Northbourne Flats, Braddon and Turner as a result of tenants who had been evi cted by Housing ACT. The eviction processes were well underway for both tenants of Northbourne Flats, Braddon and Turner prior to the Relocation program commencing. Due to privacy restrictions, Housing ACT was not able to comment on the specifics of these cases to the media. They were complex situations and all avenues for an alternat ive and positive outcome for these tenants w ere explored. 62ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: Exits from Institutions into homelessness Exits from Institutions into homelessness was a key theme that emerged from last year's Housing and Homelessness Summit. The issue is now being explored as pa rt of the ACT Housing Strategy. It is well recognised there is more work to be done on this issue. We have started exploring more opportunities for cross- government collaboration particularly with the Justice and Health Directorates to provide a whole of government approach to supporting those who exi t i nstitutions. We have also commissioned a study to provide advice on the mos t a ppropriate support and accommodation requirements for people wit h hi gh and complex needs, many of which will be exiting either a justice or health institution .

We need to balance the interests of tenants who are incarcerated against the increasing demand for limited public housing stock. Consistent with this approach, when a public housing tenant isremanded in custody or incarcerated, we work with tenants and their supports, on a case by case basis , to determine how long they are likel y to be away from the property, and what support are required. Tenants who are incarcerated a re eligible for a minimum weekly rent of $5. Depending on the circumstance we might issu e a 26 -week 'No Cause' notice to terminate the tenancy. This action is taken in accordance withSection 94 of the Standard Residential Tenancy terms. Housing ACT will only progress the notice if the tenant is unlikely to be released within a reasonable period. A Termination and Possessionorder would be sought through the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT). The decision to terminate the tena ncy is made by ACAT. In 2017 -18, 13 applications were made to ACAT for termination and possession orders following 26 -week 'No Cause' notices. Four termination orders were granted. However, Housing ACT is currently renewing policies aroundincarcerated ten ants , we will be engaging with stakeholders this year, including Canberra Community Law, the Aboriginal Legal Service, theHuman Rights Commission and the Justice and Community SafetyDirectorate. 65ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Ext:76043 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Key Information Ensuring public housing properties are not left vacant while tenants are in custody or incarceration is important to help ensure that properties are maintained in a satisfactory condition and are available for those most in need. Early action to secure properties and, where possible, to return them to Housing ACT reduces the potential of adverse outcomes and enables properties to be reallocated to other Canberrans in need. Every effort is made to ensure that no incarcerated tenant exits into homelessness.Former tenants are able to apply for ho using assistance when in custody and they are placed on the appropriate housing register based on their individual circumstances. Housing ACT also works with the ACT Corrections Service and supported accommodation providers to deliver the 'Throughcare' pr ogram which provides supported, short- term accommodation for exiting prisoners to help their transition back into the community. Tenants who are incarcerated are eligible for a minimum weekly rent of $5 whilethey are in jail. In the first quarter of 2018 -19 no applications have been made to ACAT for termination and possession orders following 26 -week 'No Cause' notices.

Almost half of these ended tenancies (507) were households who wer e t ransferring to another public housing property better suited to their needs. 26 households moved into home purchase in the private market. 10 households purchased the public housing dwel ling that they wer e l iving in under Housing ACT's Sale to Tenant Scheme and two households purchased their home under the Shared Equity Scheme. Another 153 moved into the private rental market. Very few tenancies end due to eviction. Termination of a public housing tenancy is considered an action of last resort. In 201 7-18 there were 1 7 tenants evicted by the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal due toserious tenancy breaches. These breaches include: non- payment of rent, property condition, and anti -social behaviour. Key Information - from the annual report In 2017- 18, a total of 1,126 public housing tenancies ended. Tenancies ended for a variety of reasons, including: 507 tenancies were transferred to other public housing properties; 401 tenancies moved to alternative accommodation; 17 tenancies were evicted for a breach of their tenancy; 71 tenancies ended their tenancy for reasons including properties sold to tenants and properties abandoned; and 130 tenancies ended because the tenant passed away. 67ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared a s complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Background Information - may not be suitable for public disclosure Of the 507 transfers that occurred in 2017 -18, there were 251 that were transfers out of properties being redeveloped through the Public Housing Renewal program.

The ACT boasts the largest public housing portfolio per capita in the nation. More than 7% of all homes in the ACT are social housing properties. Our portfolio was originally built for public servants and their larger famil y ho useholds . With the role of public housing changing over time we now s ee a greater number of smaller households in need of housing support. Dwelling underutilisat ion is said to occur when an occupied household has two or more bedrooms additional to what is need to satisfy the needs ofthe household. As households age, the number of spare bedrooms increases, which affects the utilisation rate. Often these dwellings are the homes our tenants have lived in for many years and have raised their children and grandchildren in. There can also be complex reasons a property may be deemed asunderutilised and Housing ACT works with these tenants to providesupport as needed. Support is also offered to tenants who wish to downsize when thatbecomes an appropriate step for them. Why has the vacancy rate in public housing continued to rise? At 30 June 2018, the public housing portfoli o was 11,903 properties. Of these, 651 were ca tegorised as vacant. This figure is higher than previous years and reflects the work and progressof the Public Housing Renewal Program. 69QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: These numbers are point in time figures and can fluctuate dependant on holdings and sales. 389 of these properties were in renewal sites that had not been formally handed over to the Suburban Land Agency and were still classified as Housing ACT properties. 114 properties were newly acquired by Housing ACT, either through thebusiness as usual Capital Delivery Program or a cquisition process (16), or were provided by the Public housing Renewal taskforce (98) and were not allocated to tenants at 30 June 2018. The remaining 148 properties were vacant due to evictions, property abandonment, and normal routine household movement s, either transfers within public housing, households leaving public housing, and tenants passing away. Ke y Information Underutilisation National performance information for 2017 -18 on underutilisation is not yet available. Public Housing In 2017, t he ACT has the second highest underutilisation rate for public housing dwellings at 17.4% (16.6% nationally). The ag eing profile of public housing tenants is one of the challenges for efficient dwelling utilisation. Ongoing programs encourage tenants to downsize in order to free up homes for families in need who are on the waiting list. Vacancies 651 properties were vacant as at 30 June 2018 ; 311 vacancies were due to internal transfers ; 187 vacancies wer e due to termination of tenancy; 39 vacancies were due to evictions or property abandonment ; and 114 were due to new properties coming on line . 70QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 53884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Table 1.

The application of the new market rents has been scheduled to commence from Sunday, 20 January 2019. This is due to the need to provide tenants with at least eight weeks of notice for rent increases and the looming festive season. A small number of properties (119) have been recommended for rent decreases between $5 and $30 per week. A further 89 properties recorded no change in the market rent. Market rents are to increase by an average of 3.5% across the rest of th e po rtfolio and 97% of the increase falls between $5 and $30 per we ek. Tenants in receipt of a rebate will generally not be affected by an increase or decrease in the market rent that applies to their property. As over 94% of tenants receive a rebate, the change in market rent will affect only a small number of tenants . The market rent assessment may have a more significant impact o n s ome Community Housing Providers (CHPs) who are required to pay a percentage (mostly 33.3%) of the market rent under their head leas e a greements. Background Information - suitable for public disclosure Section 22 of the Housing Assistance Act 2007 (the Act) requires the rent charged for each property covered by the Act to be set at market rent. Under section 23 of the Act, the Commissioner for Social Housing is required to undertake an annual review of the market rent that applies to each property in the housing portfolio. Under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997, where the rent is to be increased, tenants mus t r eceive notice of the increase in rent at least 8 weeks prior to the date of effect of th e i ncrease and rent cannot be increased within 12 months from the date of the last ren t in crease. Housing ACT also manages the Affordable Rental Scheme (ARS) and Narrabundah Long StayPark on behalf of the Directorate and CMTEDD respectively. These two programs are not covered by the Act and there is no legal requirement for an annual market rent assessment.However, it is good practice to regularly review rents and it has been the policy to includethese properties as part of the market rent assessment process.

Public housing tenant satisfaction has remained relatively steady over the last two years, with 7 3% of t enants reporting overall satisfaction i n 201 7-18 compared to 7 4% in 2016-17 . C ommunity housing tenant satisfaction dropped slightly to 70% in 2017- 18, down from 76% in 2016- 17 and 80% in 2015- 16. Tenant satisfaction results are known to vary considerably across organisations. So thes e r esults are likely to be impacted by changes in the sector, including th e cl osure of Capital Community Housing. Housing ACT and Lonergan Research have worked with community housing organisations to encourage participation of tenants fro m o rganisations that assist people with higher levels of vulnerability and/or manage shared accommodation. Detailed analysis of the satisfaction results is not currently available because the data is collected by Lonergan Research and analysed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Further results will not b e a vailable until November 2018. Key Information - from the Annual Report The 2018 Tenant Satisfaction Survey for ACT public housing was based on a total of 1,550 surveys mailed to Housing ACT tenants with 524 surveys returned, giving a response rate of 34 % and a satisfaction rating of 73 %. Allowing for the standard error associated with survey sampling, this result was consistent with the satisfactionrate in 2017 results. For the community housing component, 660 surveys were mailed to tenants with 177 survey responses received, giving a response rate of 27 % and a satisfaction rating of 70 %.

The ACT does not at this time have any banned dog breeds; however, should problems arise, Domestic Animal Services will assess each dog on a case -by-case basis. Housing ACT tenants are subject to the same pet ownership rul es as all other ACT residents. Housing ACT does not impose any additional restrictions on pet ownership although residents of multi -unit complexes are required to seek prior approval to have a pet from Housing ACT and/or the relevant Body Corporate. Whilst the incidence of dog attacks in public housing properties and complexes is very low, when Housing ACT is notified of a dog attack, i t w orks closely with Domestic Animal Services to identify the severity and circumstances of the attack. Where appropriate, Housing ACT may seek legal action against a tenanc y w here there is alleged to be a breach of the conditions of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 . T here has been a total of four serious dog attacks in Housing ACT properties since 2010. Following a fatal dog attack in October 2017 the AC T Government adopted stricter controls for dangerous dogs in December 2017 . Ho using ACT is continuing to work closely with Domestic Animal Services to ensure that, where applicable, these requirements are being met bypublic housing tenants. On Monday 13 August 2018 Justice Mossop of the Supreme Court handed down his decision in the matter of Daniel Meyers v Commissioner for Social Housing and the ACT. Mr Meyers was a tenant in a Housing ACT complex when he was attacked by two dogs owned by 82QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Services TRIM Ref: a friend of a nother tenant in March 2016. He sustained serious injuries as a result of the attack and sought compensation from Housing ACT and the ACT Government. Housing ACT and the ACT Government defended their actions. Justice Mossop dismissed the case against the Commis sioner and the ACT Government. He found that no duty of care was owed to Mr Meyers. Costs were awarded to the Commissioner and the ACT Government. This finding followed a similar outcome in the matter of Hartigan v Commissioner for Social Housing that was released in May 2017. On that occasion Justice Penfold also found that the Commissioner was notresponsible for the behaviour of pets in public housing. Both of these decisions attest to the ACT Government acting appropriately in the management of dangerous dogs. Of course, any attack is regrettable but it is the owner of these animals and not the government that is responsible for them. Key Information The first attack occurred on 7 October 2010 and involved a young six year old boy who was attacked by the tenant's dogs while visiting a Housing ACT property in Griffith. The second attack occurred in March 2016 when dogs belonging to an unauthorised occu pant of a Housing ACT complex allegedly attacked another tenant, Daniel Meyer. The third attack occurred on 25 October 2017 when a Housing ACT tenant, Tania Klemke, lost her life when she was attacked by her own dog. Another visitor was also injured. The incident remains under investigation by ACT Policing.

Housing ACT delivers an annual Capital Program to realign and renew the portfolio so that it better matches the needs of tenants and responds to the changing tenant profile using a 'salt and pepper' approach that sees public housing in most of Canberra's suburbs. The program is largely self -funded through property sales principally o n t he open market but also through the Sale to Tenant and Shared Equity schemes. New dwellings are delivered through construction, purchase of new dwellings on the private market and the purchase of land plus construction of new dwellings. All new properties are constructed to a 6 star ener gy rating making the m mo re energy efficient, so they are cheaper to run and maintain. As far as p ractical the dwellings are constructed to Adaptable Class C or Liveable Housing Design 'Gold level' which allows people to age in place, remaining in their established communities. The delivery of the Capital Program provides a significant contribution tothe local economy - through the use of local architects and builders The Public Housing Renewal Program has increased the rate of renewalof the public housing portfolio. Housing ACT is developing a long term asset management plan whi ch w ill focus on continuing to upgrade Canberra's ageing public housing stock, improve tenant outcomes and support the broader renewal of Canberra's city and urban areas. 1.

Examples of such projects include : oCommon Ground (Gungahlin) - a low-cost supportive housing initiative for people at risk or experiencing homelessness oProject Independence (Harrison and Latham) - a home ownershi p mo del for people with disability oKarinya House (Melba) - providing support for young mothers a nd t heir chi ldren, and oMura Gunya (Kambah) - a dedicated complex for Aboriginal an d T orres Strait Islander older persons . Housing ACT has also partnered with the Ricky Stuart Foundation todevelop Ricky Stuart House (Chifley) and Emma Ruby House (Cook). Emma Ruby House provides short -term accommodation (previously referred to as respite) and capacity -building programs for young people with disability. Emma Ruby House, which is named after Ricky Stuart's daughter, is located next to the Cook Community Hub and was officially opened i n Ju ne 2018, and The Disability Trust began operating it in July 2018. Housing ACT contributed $1.367 million to the construction of this project.

As part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan Initiative, Housing ACT directly constructed public housing properties, on a variety of sites but also assisted construct other dwellings for groups such as the Uniting Church (Hackett) and Salvation Army (Narrabundah). There are both direct and in -direct benefits to individuals and the broader community through the construction program that Housing ACT has undertaken. Key Information Most of this work was on community facility zoned land - in some instances , such as Karinya, the Uniting Church and the Salvation Army , use was made of under -utilised community facility land. In these three instances, Housing ACT was able to partner with a community organisation as the lessee to provide a development that delivered an outcome for the broader community. Housing ACT uses its existing properties to renew the public housing portfolio butwill from time to time consider using community facility land, subject to engagingthe community on the use of the land. Community Engagement Framework Effective enga gement with local communities and key stakeholders is critical to ensuring an efficient and successful asset management program and to providing anenvironment for positive integration of public housing tenants into the localneighbourhood. To this end, E lton Consulting was engaged by Housing ACT to develop a new engagement toolkit to support the delivery of the annual capitalprogram, and reframe the community perception and discourse around publichousing in the Territory. LIVE.CONNECT: A HACS Framewor k for Engaging with Canberra establishes a new listening and participating consultation architecture to facilitate meaningfulcommunity engagement. The intent of this work is to humanise the public housing experience, and in turnpromote goodwill and a sen se of community for tenants, and build stronger, more integrated and diverse neighbourhoods. It seeks to reprioritise communityconsultation as an integral part of the annual capital program so that Housing ACTcan understand and address community concerns during the project design phasesto streamline the development approval process. 100ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: 74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing ACT carries out pre -development community engagement on its construction projects.

Overall, there is good support for public housing and the redevelopment of older stock for housing that is of a higher quality and better meets th e ne eds of public housing tenants - however this view is not shared by all . Making community engagement an integral part of the development process provides an opportunity to draw more meaningful feedback from stakeholders, expose areas of concern and better align projects to the needs of the community . Rethinking how to engage with the community generates a moretransparent discussion and has the potential to streamline approvals processes. Key Info rmation Since April 2018 , Housing ACT has undertaken community engagement on eleven sites, including four ex -Mr Fluffy blocks in Flynn, Fraser, Giralang and Latham, and seven re-develop ment sites (Dickson, Florey, Turner , Fisher, Gowrie, Lyons and Watson ). During each community engagement period, pop -up stalls/information kiosks have been hosted in the community and information is posted on the YourSay website . The feedback has been considered in the development of each of the sites - in some instances no changes have been made but information on the issues raised, and how they have been responded to , is made available to people who provided comments and is also posted on the YourSay website . Engaging with the community provides an opportunity to shift perceptions of public housing and public housing tenants, to better explain the role of Housing ACT in the community and to 'humanise' the public housing experience . Housing ACT has developed a Community Engagement Framework matrix which outlines the appropriate level of engagement, depending upon the type of development . 104QUESTION TIME BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 18/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: 71514 Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Ba ckground Information Housing ACT has engaged the community about the development of four ex- Mr Fluffy blocks .

This has many benefits to tenants including privacy, improvements to the energy efficiency of properties, saving tenants money, as well as improving the look and feel of t he properties. Housing ACT has commenced discussions with the Public HousingRenewal Taskforce to fund the retrofit of the 337 dwellings that wer e de livered prior to the trial commencing. At 4 October 2018, Housing ACT has provided roller blind style win dow f urnishings to 60 newly constructed dwellings. The trial to provide window furnishings to new dwellings has bee n e xtended to dwellings being constructed by the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce (PHRT). Background Information In June 2017 Housing ACT c ommenced a trial of providing window furnishings to newly constructed public housing dwellings. Housing ACT and the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce had previously adopted a position to not provide window furnishings in newly constructed or existing public housing dwellings. This was due to the cost to install and maintain the furnishings. Housing ACT's 'salt and pepper' policy includes a principle that public housing have a 'lookand feel' which makes it indistinguishable from other housing in a neighborhood. Not havin g a ny window furnishings or the use of materials like bedsheets makes properties stand out and identifies them as public housing and can stigmatise the tenants. Correspondence has been received from members of the community raising concerns about the negative appearance of public housing dwellings that do not have window furnishings orwhere tenants have used materials such as bedsheets to cover windows. Roller blind style window furnishings provide modest energy efficiency improvements to n ew dwellings. More significant energy efficiency savings can be achieved with curtains that contain a \" backing material\", this style of window furnishing is expensive compared to roller blinds. 109ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: 74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing ACT proposes to work with its Total Facilities Main tenance (TFM) provider, Programmed Facility Maintenance to explore window furnishing that provides amenity, is durable, cost effective and delivers good energy efficiency outcomes. The trial to provide window furnishings to new dwellings has been extended to dwellings being constructed by the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce (PHRT). At 4 October 2018 , 482 dwellings ( 819 in total) have been constructed by the PHRT with window furnis hings. There are 337 dwellings which have been constructed by the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce that have not been fitted with window furnishings. The cost to retrofit windowfurnishings to these dwellings is estimated to cost in the order of $500,000 or about $150 0 p er unit. 110ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext: 74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: Housing & Suburban Development ISSUE: Capital Delivery for 2017 -18 Talking points: Revenue for the 2017 -18 capital program of $65.1m exceeded budget expectations largely as a result of additional sales revenues. Expenditure for the 2017 -18 capital program of $50.7m was slightly less than budget as a result of less than planned expenditure on the combined construction and purchase programs. A total of 68 dwellings and 1 block of land w ere sold in 2017- 18, on target with budget estimates of 69 sales. A total of 46 dwellings were constructed and 22 properties wer e pur chased (20 dwellings and 2 blocks of land). This was below budget expectations of 53 dwelling constructions and 35 dwelling purchases. Stock numbers at 30 June 2018 were 11,903 dwellings, an increase of 82 dwellings for the financial year. In addition to the $50.7m capital program expenditure reported in theannual report, the capital program also funded a $4.7m principal repayment on housing debt owed to the Commonwealth. Key Information Revenue - Sales Sales are t he major source of funds for the capital program. In 201 7-18 sales comprised 68 dwellings and 1 block of land. Of this, 56 dwellings and 1 block of land were s old at auction for $ 37.0m, 12 dwellings were sold outright to tenants for $5.5m and 2 dwellings were sold to tenants under shared equity arrangements for $0.8m . In addition $9.3m was received in prepayments on the sale of 33 units in Kaleen to the PHRT. Sales in 2017 -18 comprised 6 x 2 bedroom houses, 51 x 3 bedroom houses, 3 x 4 bedroom houses, 3 x 5 bedroom houses and 5 x 2 bedroom flats.

Revenue - Carried Over 2016 -17 Funds & Other Capital program funds carried over from 2016 -17 comprised $7.6m and $0.4m was received as insurance payouts for fire damaged properties. Expenditure - Construction Construction expenditure in 2017 -18 totalled $26.9m . Expenditure in 2017 -18 was higher than budget due to funds being redirected from the purchases program to theconstruction program as suitable redevelopment sites became available during theyear. In 2017- 18 46 dwellings were constructed (budget 53). The number of dwellings constructed was less than budget primaril y because of commencement delays at a 16 unit redevelopment site in Downer due to relocation of tenant issues and DAapproval issues. This reduction was partially offset by the construction of 11 additional units which were not in the budget as unutilised funds were redirected to new projects. Dwellings constructed comprised 4 x 2 bedroom houses, 8 x 3 bedroom houses, 1 x 4 bedroom house, 11 x 5 bedroom houses, 1 x 6 bedroom house, 3 x 1 bedroom flats,16 x 2 bedroom flats and 2 x 3 bedroom flats.

It provides a model of ho me ownership for people with disability. To support this model, the ACT Government provided land and funding for the construction of 20 accommodation places over two sites, i n H arrison and Latham. These developments were completed in 2016. The ACT Government also agreed to make land available for a thir d Pr oject Independence, with the construction to be financed by Project Independence Ltd through fundraising and philanthropy. A site in Phillip was iden tified as suitable for the third project. Housing ACT has worked with the Environment P lanning Sustainable Development Directorate to establish and register a Crown Lease over the previously unleased Territory land. Housing ACT continues to work with the Project Independence Board t o pr ogress the Phillip site. Key Information The ACT Government committed to contributing land and $3 million in funding to develop the Project Independence model across two sites, in Harrison and Latham, and land for a third s ite. Due to increased project costs, however, the overall ACT Government expendituretotalled $4.260m in construction and $1.7m in land value for the Harrison andLatham sites. The land in Phillip is valued at $1.8m, bringing the total ACT Government contribution to $7.76m. 114Org Pgrm Sub-Sector Service Provider Service Description Target Group 2017-18 Funding (excl.

OneL ink is a central intake service. This means that it assesses all requests for support (accommodation and services) and does not turn eligible people away. It then prioritises people accordin g to their needs and places them on a waiting list. On 1 July 2016, OneL ink combine d the previous homelessness gateway (Firstpoint) and the Child Youth and Family Services Gateway, as well as providing access to a range of mainstream services . How does it work ? People can access OneL ink through a 1800 number (1800 176 468), in person at Nature Conservation Hous e, or via the Onelink Website ( www.onelink.org.au/services ) through webchat. OneL ink does not provide support directly - it assesse s and records a person 's needs and connects them to the supports they require . When a person calls or visits OneLink, an intake officer assesses and prioritises the client's needs, provides information about options and, where appropriate, follow s up with clients to connect them to support. The intake officer will stay in touch with clients until they have all supports they need. At the end of the month One Link reports on the number of people still waiting to be connecte d to any service both accommodation and non- accommodation supports . Some people waiting at the end of the month may have had some service needs met while still waiting connection to others. Note : not all people waiting for accommodation are sleeping ro ugh.

The Roadhouse program is a free food and warm referral service. Th e pr ovision of free meals is used as an enable for social engagement wit h g uests and workers provide informat ion and support service referrals to people at risk of or experiencing homelessness. In 2017 -18, the ARC commenced work on a new social enterprise model to complement the RoadHouse program and as a means of supplementing revenue into the future . A fter a pilot in April 2018 and a feasibility study in June 2018, the ARC Board concluded that the social enterprise model was not profitable for the Roadhouse and would therefore not continue. The ARC is continuing to explore innovative options to support those accessing the Roadhouse who are at risk of or experiencing homelessness . Key Information The Road house has capacity to support up to 60 service users at any one time. During 2017 -18, the ARC recruited two new positions: a social enterprise lead and a projec t officer, to support development of a new social enterprise model to supplement funding for the Roadhouse. Market research was undertaken in July 2017 to scope the feasibility of a meal delivery service for Canberra. Initial findings indicated that this could be a viableoption and a pilot was undertaken in April 2018. To staff the pilot, two Roadhouse patrons were recruited to volunteer as Kitchenhands for training and work experience, and a volunteer carried out the delivery component of the pilot, charging $10 per meal. The ARC connected with the Social Enterprise Hub Initiative and the Mill HouseSocial Entrepreneurial Accelerator Program led by the University of Canberra (UC). 141ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Catherine Loft Ext:74592 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: These initiatives provide different types of support including mentoring, training, and networking to emerging social enterprises in the ACT. While developing the new model, Australian Red Cross continued to deliver services to clients at Griffin centre. A pilot of this social enterprise model was trialled for four weeks in April 2018. Themodel involved preparation and delivery of hot lunch meals to students and retirees. The pilot employed guests of the Roadh ouse, who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, to train and support them into positive employmentpathways. Following this pilot, the Road house undertook a feasibility study for continuation of this social enterprise. The feasibility study concluded that the proposed model was too expensive to implement in the ACT, and the social enterprise project was notapproved to continue by the ARC Board. The Social Enterprise Hub is funded by the CBR Innovation Development Fund (CBRIDF), Innovate Canberra, CMTEDD. The Mill House Social Entrepreneurial Accelerator Program is a collaboration between UC, CBR Innovation Network (CBRIN)and Service One Banking. Background Information - from the annual report During 2017 -18, the ACT Government funded the Australian Red Cross (ARC) to continue to deliver the Roadhouse program at the Griffin Centre while progressing a project to develop a new social enterprise model. The ARC tapped into social enterprise training, capacity b uilding, and networking support provided by Social Enterprise Hub and the Mill House Program. This opened an opportunity for the ARC to explore the development of a social enterprise component for the Roadhouse program, to supplement funding for the Roadho use program in the future.

In many areas of health and welfare the ACT is the principal service centre for the surrounding local government areas. During 2017- 18 around 320 people from interstate accessed specialis t ho melessness services in the ACT. The vast majority of these from NSW. Cross-border homelessness does cost the ACT Governmen t a pproximately $1.2 million every year, however, our homelessness service system o perates on the basis of not turning vulnerable people away.

Twelve men have been accommodated and 31 partners or ex -partners, with 56 accompanying children, have bee n s upported. Si nce the program began, not one woman has had to leave her home as a result of her participating partner's behaviour. Key Information In 2017- 18, the ACT Government allocated $1.04 million to Room4Change. This was for the ramp up phase of the program which increased the capacity of the program to support up to 12 men in s ix properties at any one time.

The Domestic Violence Crisis Service has a thorough assessment process in place to ensure readiness and commitment to Room4Change . The rigorous assessment process has contributed to a high retention rate in the program. It is too early to determine any long term outcomes for Room4Change . However, init ial fe edback from the Domestic Violence Crisis Service indicates the holistic, whole of family approach of the program is enabling an integrated and comprehensive response to family safety planning.

As part of this commitment, the government commenced a piloted grantprogram that provides practical hel p to intimate partners who ar e l eaving violence. The Safer Families Grant Program provides practical assistance by offering up to $2,000 for eligible persons to cover the costs related tothe establishment of a new private rental tenancy. Grant money can be used to pay up to four weeks rent, removal a nd s torage costs, the cost of connecting utilities and services, or to buy the things people need to get their new home established. The grant is available for low to moderate income earners who ar e l ookin g to access the private rental market and have received a rental bond loan from ACT Government. Grants are designed to complementthe bond loan scheme, which works by covering up to 90% of your private rental bond when you enter a new tenancy agreement. Key Information In 2016- 17, the Safer Families Package committed $21.42 million over four years to drive the next phase of government -backed responses to combat violence against women and children. Of this, a total of $315,000 was committed to provision of the Safer Families Grant Program. In 2016- 17, only two grants were administered. Housing ACT has worked to better promote the pilot program among services providers and service users. A total of 13 grants were administered in the 2017 -18 financial year with a combined value of $25,952.32. As of 3 October 2018, three grant s had been issued.

Which is really staff time and resources to increase the capacity of th e s ervice to support more people. One support placement could be one person for a month - or a family of si x f or three months. Some families will requ ire intensive support for a long time, other families may require less intensive support for a shorter period. Depending on family size and length of support this could be hundreds of individuals and families in a single year. For example while we currently have 900 placements across the sector a t a ny one time - in 2017- 18 the sector supported nearly 5,000 clients. How are support place numbers estimated ? The ACT Government provides over $20 million per year to 48 specialist homelessness services sector to deliver homelessness support. Within the funding provided to each organisation we determine thenumber of support places that can be resourced, taking into consideratio n th e type of service and service demand .

The $6.524 million in funding includes: o$100,000 per annum to specialist domestic violence services, Doris Womens' Refuge, Beryl Women Inc and Toora Women Inc; o$80,000 per annu m for Karinya House for Mothers and Babies Inc; o$1.8 million over four years for a new service to better suppor t a sylum seekers and other migrants with uncertain immigratio n s tatus who are in need of housing assistance. oOver $1.7 million over four years wi ll also go to establish support for older women who are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. o$586,000 over four years for OneLink to extend its operating hours and access brokerage funds, so that appropriate crisissupport can be provided at the time it's needed. How many beds does the additional funding provide? We have estimated that the new funding will provide an additional 36 places at any one time across all the funded programs . T his funding scales up over the four years - from $1.2 million in the first year up $2.05 million in the fourth year . T herefore, the number of placements also scale up from 28 in 2018 -19 to 45 in 2021 23. Key information In 2018- 19 Budget, $6.524 million over four years was allocated to provide further support to our frontline services and address these gaps. The funding for this budget initiative scales up over the four years (budget table below refers). Therefore, placements also scale up from 28 in 2018 -19 to 45 in 2021 -23. Based on this we have esti mated that the sector can employ additional staff time to undertake intensive case management for 36 individuals or families atany one time. The placements do not equate to beds. We are funding staff time and resources to increase the capacity of the service to support more people. One support placement could be one person for a month - or a family of six for three months, depending on 154ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 26/10/2018 Cleared by: Executive Director Ext: Contact Officer Name: Deb Foulcher Ext:73884 Lead Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: the level of support required.

In 2012 the Commonwealth, States and Territories signed the Inter - Governmental Agreement for a National Regulatory System fo r Co mmunity Housing Providers (the Agreement) to create the framewor k f or establishing and maintaining ongoing arrangements for NRSCH, including the application of the National Law. The NRSCH is designed to contribute to a well -governed, well -manage d a nd viable community housing sector and to reduce the regulatory burden for multi -jurisdictional community housing providers (CHPs). The implementation of the NRSCH in the ACT commenced o n 1 January 2014. As determined by the Agreement, a review of the operation and terms of both the National Law and the Agreement is to be undertaken after five years of the operation, to determine the effectiveness of th e N ational Regulatory System. The review will be conducted over the following three stages: oConsultation and the development of a discussion paperevaluating the effectiven ess and operation of, as well as current issues with, the operation of the NRSCH. oEvaluation of submissions and development of an options paper. oFinal report and recommendations.

This commitment was made to support the implementation of th e A CT Government Response to Family Violence . T he ACT Government Response to Family Violence included 41 separate commitments aimed at reducing the impact of domestic and family violence within the ACT. Together with the community sector, the Government has made considerable progress towards im plementing the commitments made in 2016. Progress is reported annually via the ACT Government Budg et Pa pers and th e Annual Safer Families Ministerial Statement. The ACT Government remains committed to long term change so that we may reach our goal of zero tolerance of domestic and family violence. The change we are seeking will only come about with a long term investment in service and system design that is developed i n pa rtnership with the community and is informed by children, wome n a nd men with an experience of domestic and family violence. Long ter m i nvestment is also required to shift attitudes in our community toward s v iolence against women and children. Key Information Funding from the Family Safety Levy has gone directly to specialist services designed to meet the needs of those experiencing domestic and family violence. Similarly, Levy funding has enabled the strengthening of criminal justice responses, forexample additional police officers to assist victims of domestic violence . Significant progress was made during 2017 -18 to establish the Family Safety Hub, which was officially launched on 11 May 2018 as a catalyst for change. The Family Safety Hub is bring ing people together in a collaborative network to drive system change through the use of a 'try, test and learn' approach. Implementationwill focus on building: a shared understanding across the service system so people get the right response wherever they seek help; capability to integrate services forclients; and alternative pathways to safety that meet diverse needs. 237ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 05/07/2018 Cleared by: Choose an item.

The Family Safety Hub was officially launched on 11 May 2018 as a ca talyst for change. The Family Safety Hub is not a service. The Family Safety Hub is a ne twork for collaboration and innovation. It brings the right people together to work through one problem at a time to see how we can provide better help, earlier. oThe Family Safety H ub fosters shared understanding, builds capability, delivers new or improved pathways to safety, a nd pr omotes system cohesion. The Family Safety Hub was co -designed with the 50 people in the community services sector and 20 people with lived experience domestic and family violence . The insights from the co -design told us that : oPeople are offered generic pathways tha t do not meet their needs or aspirations. oPower and control, particularly, is not recognised as violence by victims, perpetrators or the system. oPeople with lived experience disclose to people they trust, whoare often not domestic violence specialists . T he insights work told us that we didn't need a new service with a shiny front door in order to improve access. What we need is a broad range ofsystemic reforms requiring a new way of working. Co -design a nd co llaboration is needed to design and test solutions to systemi c pr oblems. These insights prompted the Government to think differently about therole for a Family Safety Hub in the ACT . 239ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 10/10/2018 Cleared by: Deputy Director Directorate: Community Services TRIM Ref: The Family Safety Hub will now bring the right people together to wor k th rough a series of 'challenge workshops', to help generate ideas o n ho w we can solve one problem at a time .

D epending on the outcomes of the pilot s, the Office of the Coordinator general for Family Saf ety will work with Directorates and community to terminate, extend or scale- up the idea. Other challenges will follow including a focus on access to financial support and private housing. The first Challenge The first Family Safety Hub challenge began on 1 0 May 2018. The Challenge focusses on early intervention opportunities for pregnant women and new parents experiencing or at risk of domestic and family violence \u2014as research indicates this is a high- risk period for violence to emerge or escalate. Over 40 p articipants from a range of sectors came together over two days to develop concepts to address the Challenge topic. Participants generated 57 ideas. Of those ideas, four ideas were selected for furtherco-design and testing with system users , which are: oeasy access to free legal information in health and community settings omarketing campaign to reduce stigma for people seeking help oinvolving Fathers , and ominimising reproductive c oercion . The Family Safety Hub is now actively working with the sector to deliver its first pilot , which w ill deliver a new service to provide free legal information to pregnant women and new parents in heath andcommunity settings. oThe pilo t service will commence in the last quarter o f 2018.

Talking points: Why is it important ? A focus on respectful relationships is important because gender inequality and gender -based violence continue to have a profound effect on outcomes for Australians. R espectful Relationships Education is a school based approach to primary prevention of Domestic and Family Violence . It aims to develop skills and attitudes early, that will stop Domestic and Family Violence from happening in the future. Respectful Relationships Education (RRE) programs have had increase d a ttention in recent years, with the link between this curriculum area a nd pr imary prevention of gender based violence becoming more widely understood. In all Australian jurisdictions, Education departments are working on developing resources and implementing curriculum in this area. T he D irectorate's approach has been informed by the work of Our Watch, a n i ndependent, not for profit organisation established under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010 -2022 (the National Plan). Our Watch work s closely with Australia's National Resear ch Or ganisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS). Implementation in ACT public schools Respectful Relationships Education is most effective when used as part of awhole school approach, which involves students experiencing the \" key messages \" in many different ways across the curriculum and in different areas of the school and community. This should involve the whole school community, including students, staff and the wider school community in the process of cultural change. At the universal level (all students) , schools teach RRE through the Australia n C urriculum (AC) supported by Social and Emotional approaches and specifi c R RE resources. This is supported through the Directorate's Safe and Supportive Schools Policy (2016), requiring all Canberra public schools to deliver Social and Emotional Learning programs, and the requirement for all ACT public schools to implement the AC. 253ANNUAL REPORT HEARING BRIEF Cleared as complete and accurate : 23/05/2018 Cleared by: Director Contact Officer Name: Sam Seton Ext: 57029 Lead Directorate: Education Schools are able to choose programs and resources that suit their particular conte xt and school community.

On 17 May , 2018 YWCA released their Leading the Change: Gender Equality Report , which provided recommendations based on YWCA's assessment of the ACT Government's progress on gender equality. The Education Direcotrate met with theYWCA on 11 May and provided a follow -up letter, providing information about their approach to RRE and clarified inaccuracies in the draft report. The YWCA has been promoting its Respect Ed suite of training and resources to ACT schools. There is a cost to schools to access training. The Directorate has supportedthe advertisement of the Respect Ed to schools. Background Information The ACT Education Directorate's (EDU) response to Family Violence aligns with both Australian and ACT government priorities and recognises the important role the education system plays as a setting for primary prevention. Young people benefit from education programs which assist them to recognise and question gender norms, and to critically examine the potentially negative or limiting impacts they may have. Research indicates that education programs that work on building positive gender relationships must commence from an early age, as children are well aware of gender norms and make efforts to fit within gendered expectations by the time they are in kindergarten. 1 Continuing social and emotional learning programs in schools to enhance the skills of children and young people to engage in respectful relationships forms part of the current Parliamentary Agreement between ACT Labor and ACT Greens. During the 2015 and 2016 the Directorate made Social and Emotional Learning grants available to schools (up to $5000/school) . 51 schools applied for a grant to assist implementation of SEL approaches in their school. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) forms a strong foundation for teaching about positive gender relationships. SEL programs provide a logical starting point from which to engage in more explicit work with students around gender norms, gender identity and respectful relationships. Social Emotional Learning (SEL) is the process through which students acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to: o understand and manage their emotions o understand and show empathy for others o establish and maintain positive respectful relationships 1 Victorian Department of Education and Training (2016).
