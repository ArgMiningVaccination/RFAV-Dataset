Begin your planning early (first year!), starting with the information below. There is no specific major that a student needs in order to continue on in a medical training program after graduation. The biochemistry major most closely tracks with the admission requirements for MD training programs; however, we routinely work with students that are majoring in other areas or double majoring. In addition to completing a major, students interested in MD training need: - Two semester-long courses in Biology with lab [BIOL 111, 121, 172, or 208; and BIOL 237, 256, 257, 260, or 289] - Two semester-long courses in Chemistry with lab [CHEM 117 and 220] - Two semester-long courses in Organic Chemistry with lab [CHEM 230 and 235] - Two semester-long courses in Physics with lab [PHYS 101 and 102] - Two semester-long courses in English with intensive writing - One semester-long course in Biochemistry [BIOL/CHEM 260 or 300] - One semester-long course in Math or Statistics The following are suggestions to more fully prepare for the MCAT and a future career as a physician: - One semester-long course in Psychology [PSYC 100] - One semester-long course in Sociology [SOCI 100] - As many chemistry and biology courses that fit into a schedule. - Learn a language that helps you serve diverse people and communities. The process for formally applying to MD training programs begins 18 months before you intend to start a training program.
