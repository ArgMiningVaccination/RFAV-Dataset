If you have a hard time sitting still, try a walking meditation, where you walk slowly and focus on the sensation of each foot touching the ground. If you prefer to be still, try meditation in a restorative yoga pose, letting thoughts and sensation float by in your mind without attaching to them. Mindfulness meditation brings your focus to your breath, following the gentle waves of inhalation and exhalation. You can also use the repetition of a mantra as the focus of your attention. For those who love technology, there are apps for your smartphone that provide you with guided meditations. Meditation According to data published by the Mayo Clinic, meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that benefits both your emotional well-being and your overall health. And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and can even improve certain medical conditions. When you meditate, you clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress. "}
