Our Technology Messenger RNA (mRNA) mRNA serves as intermediate molecule between DNA and proteins. It has the capacity to encode an extensive variety of protein(s) of interest, and hence are excellent tools for the transfer of broad spectrum of disease-specific antigens for prophylactic vaccination against many infectious disease or proteins via gene supplementation therapies for rare genetic disorders. The transient nature and cytosolic location of RNA improves its safety profile when employed for prophylactic vaccination or gene supplementation therapeutics. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) Over conventional mRNA, saRNA contains the replicating capability to amplify the copy number of coding sequences from a single transcript. saRNAs are able to carry larger sequences while generating more RNA. saRNAs are then expected to induce equal or higher required 'product' at a much lower dosage. Pipeline Ziphius aims to leverage the use of its self-amplifying RNA platform to create vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases and gene supplementation therapies for rare genetic disorders. Join our team Ziphius Vaccines' team consists of a well-balanced group of people with complementary skills and a background ranging from biology, virology, chemistry till pharmaceutical sciences. The team members are united by their common passion for science, health care, innovation and entrepreneurship.
