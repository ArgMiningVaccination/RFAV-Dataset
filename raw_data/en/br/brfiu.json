Considerable time and energy goes into making sure that our pets have healthy food, exercise and stimulation all throughout their lives. But all animals, even those who have lived healthy and vibrant lives, can experience significant physical changes as they age. A range of new health and behavior issues might show up in your pup that might seem out of character, but are completely normal. Be prepared to encounter new challenges as a cat approaches his or her 10th year. You may notice some or all of these new changes in your furry friend: - Eyes and Ears - It may seem like your cat is ignoring you or getting clumsy, but often hearing and sight both start to diminish as age goes on. - Anxiety - Your cat's ability to handle stress reduces with age, and this might show up in separation anxiety, neediness, phobias to new noises, or general agitation. - Cold - Staying warm becomes a little harder as aging pups find it harder to regulate their body temperature. - Joints - Arthritis and joint pain become any aging pet's reality, meaning that mobility and even touch can become more challenging. - Metabolism - Your aging cat will have the same appetite and love for food, but he or she may not be able to burn calories the same way anymore, becoming a greater risk of obesity. - Forgetfulness - Senior cats share to lose cognitive ability and with that they start to forget behaviors they have known well all through life. - Skin and Coat - Changes in skin, coat, and nails become more apparent as the years go by. Skin may become drier and thinner, coats coarser, and nails brittle. In general, energy, movement, and vitality may decline, either slightly or broadly. By supporting key body systems and decreasing general inflammation, your pet has a huge advantage to live life to the fullest. Start with a healthy lifestyle, a nutrient rich diet, strong cognitive play, and a natural supplement to help support these changing body systems. What is Old Friend? Old Friend is the ultimate daily herbal tonic for the senior cat. Designed by a holistic veterinarian, its formula specifically supports great health and maintains a high quality of life for your aging cat. Taken almost like a daily vitamin, it provides an additional boost, suited to the needs of cats in their golden years, and can be administered alone or added to an existing health regime. Old Friend can keep an aging body going strong! What is Old Friend used for? With youth comes the innate qualities of vigor, enthusiasm and spark. As our feline friends age, their energy and sharpness may lose the edge they used to have. The aging process can have a deteriorating effect on the connective tissue and joints, cardiovascular, adrenal, liver, pancreatic and brain function. If your cat could use support in these areas, consider this product for your old friend: - Better energy levels - Joint mobility, jumping & running - Strong immune system - Mental sharpness & good cognitive function - Stable blood sugar levels - Healthy liver "}
