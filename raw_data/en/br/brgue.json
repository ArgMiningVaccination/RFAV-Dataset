I am extremely excited to announce that Maeve's Almanac has been released! This supplement explores the environments of fantasy worlds and features five unique phenomena that can fit any 5E game. Aside from new rules and randomization tables that bring the environment to life, the book contains jotted notes written by the esteemed explorer Maeve from the world of Elanor. Maeve's renown as a master explorer is well-earned: from the spirit-haunted mist enclaves to the soul-draining doldrums, Maeve explored much of the known world and came back to tell the tale. Chapter 1, \"Ethereal Environments,\" features three types of supernatural regions: mist enclaves, memento etherealis, and doldrums. Chapter 2, \"Spiritual Hazards,\" presents two types of short-lived phenomena that can appear anywhere in the world: empathy snares and ethereal storms. The supplement is already available to our Buccaneer patrons. If you join in before the end of the month - you will get the PDF as well.
