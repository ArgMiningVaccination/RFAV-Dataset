Senate Bill 68, Eighty -sixth Legislature, 2019, form alized and expanded the SFR process and applied it to the agencies currently subject to Sunset Advisory Commission (SAC ) review, with an exception for agencies that are not subject to th e legislative appropriations process. As part of SFR, each agency submits pr ogrammatic and financial data that is ev aluated by Legislative Budget Board (LBB) staff. LBB staff also consider potential alternatives in fundin g, program structure, and servic e delivery, and the centrality of each program to an agency's mission and the agency's authority to carry out the activities of each program. The SFR process for each applicable agency began with the Sunset Self-evaluation Re port that the agency submitted to the SAC. LBB staff used the program structure identified by ag encies in those reports to co llect information on program funding, basis, implementation, and impa ct. These programs may not reconcile wi th the LBB's State Budget by Program due to differences in financial and pr ogrammatic tracking; LBB staff reviewed and considered agencies' distinctions. Agencies ranked programs to represent the agency's prioritization of each relative to the agency's overall goals and purpose and provided details on the population and needs met by va rious programs, demand for se rvices, and opportunities to improve operations. In addition to prog ram data, agencies submitted for review performance measures, previous audit reports, contract information, and financial data. The financial data included both appropriated funds from the Eighty-sixth Legislature 2020-21 Biennium, General Appropriations Act (GAA), and funds that ar e within the control of the agency, institution, oversight board, or commission but not included in the 2020-21 GAA. Agen cies also submitted data on funds ou tside the state Treasury that are not subject to appropriation by the Legislature. As required by Senate Bill 68, agency program descriptions evaluate the advers e effects of discontinuing a program and provide an account of expenditures requir ed to maintain the program at the minimum level of service and the expenditures for the current level of service. Due to the timing of SFR data collection, reviews do not cons ider actual operating expenses for the current biennium or unexpected reductions in appropriations and revenue due to external factors, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these developments are monitored and revi ewed as a part of the overall legislative appropriations process. MISSION CENTRALITY AND AUTHORITY Agency program descriptions include evalua tions of the program's mission centrality and authority, with the exception of programs concerning central or indirect administration. Missio n centrality is determined based on how directly connected a program is to the core mission and goals of the agency, as identified in statute, agency strategic plans, or other documents. The following criteria were used to assess a program's mission centrality: strong - central to agency's mission and clearly identi fied in agency's strategic plan or other planning documents; moderate - related to agency's mission and only indire ctly referenced in agency's strategic plan or other planning documents; and weak - weakly related or unrelated to agency's mission an d not clearly identified in agency's strategic plan or other planning documents. Authority is an assessment of how strong and explicit the le gal basis is for the existence of the program and the way in which the agency is administering it. The following cr iteria were used to examine a program's authority: INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 2 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 strong - constitutional or expl icit statutory authorization; moderate - implicit or general statutory authorization; and weak - program has no clear statutory basis, and authority derives, directly or indirectly, from the General Appropriations Act. COORDINATION WITH SUNSET ADVISORY COMMISSION Agencies undergoing Strategic Fiscal Revi ew are also undergoing Sunset review in accordance with Senate Bill 68; thus, LBB staff collaborated with SAC staff to avoid the duplication of agency information and data requests. With regard to approach, whereas SAC analyzes the continui ng public need for a state agency and its functions, the SFR process analyzes the justification, accountability, and suffici ency of agency funding. These approaches may result in different findings that should not be read as being in conflict, but rath er as informing the overall legislative process. Statute requires the LBB staff to submit th is report of SFR findings at a time that precedes the time by which the SAC is scheduled to complete its initial review of certain agencies discussed in this report, but SAC findings for agencies whose initial reviews are complete are no ted and discussed where applicable. Appearing in budget article order, the following agencies were evaluated during the 2020-21 biennial SFR process, alongside the Sunset Review Cycle: Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission; Teacher Retirement System of Texas; Texas Commission on Fire Protection; Texas Commission on Jail Standards; Texas Commission on Law Enforcement; Texas Department of Agriculture; Texas Animal Health Commission; Texas Parks and Wildlife Department; Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation; Texas Racing Commission; and State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 3 TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION The Texas Government Code, Chapter 449 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The mission of the Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission (THGC) is to bring awareness of the Holocaust and other genocides to Texas students, educators, and the general public by ensuring availability of resources, and in doing so imbue in individuals a sense of responsibility to uphold human value and inspire citizens in the prev ention of future atrocities. THGC was established and administratively attached to the Texas Historical Commission by Senate Bill 482, Eighty-first Legislature, Regular Session, 2009. Fundin g is designated in the Eighty-sixth Le gislature, General Appropriations Act (GAA), 2020-21 Biennium, Article I, Historical Commission , Rider 12, Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission. As shown in Figure 1 , 100.0 percent of THGC funding is provided through General Revenue Funds. Additional funds for educator awards, student poetry and visual arts contests, and other expenses are provided through the support of the nonprofit organization Friends of the Te xas Holocaust and Genocide Commission. FIGURE 1 TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION FUNDING SOURCE, 2020-21 BIENNIUM NOTE: Funds received from the Friends of the Texas Holocaust and Ge nocide Commission are not included. SOURCES : Texas Holocaust and Genocide Co mmission; Texas Historical Com mission. THGC is composed of 18 members. The Governor, Lieutena nt Governor, and Speaker of the House of Representatives each appoint five public memb ers, and the Commissioners of Education and Hi gher Education and the Executive Director of the Texas Veterans Commission are ex officio members. TH GC provides advice and assistance on the implementation of Holocaust and genocide studies, awareness programs, and events to public and private schools and organizations and institutions of higher education. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS Due to its administrative structure, THGC does not form ally report a strategic plan or performance measures. Due to its size, the agency does not classify expenses by program, but it identifi ed and ranked eight major activities that Legislative Budget Board staff will tr eat as programs for the purposes of this report. Before the 2018-19 biennium, THGC received 100.0 percent of the General Revenue Funds allocated within the GAA, Article I, Historical Commission, Rider 12, Strategy A.3.1, Evaluate/Interpret Resources. Beginning with the 2018-19 biennium, and continuing through the 2020-21 biennium, the Le gislature has allocated $41,000 each fiscal year from the GAA, Article I, Historical Commission, St rategy B.1.1, Central Administration, for the provision of central administration General Revenue Funds $1.3 (100.0%)(IN MILLIONS) TOTAL = $1.3TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 4 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 support to THGC. According to the Historical Commission, the cost of administering THGC is not identified separately within Strategy B.1.1. Figure 2 shows expended amounts for the 2018-19 biennium an d appropriated amounts for the 2020-21 biennium. The amounts shown do not include the $41,000 each fiscal year for central administration support. For the 2020-21 biennium, 50.0 percent of appropriations are budgeted for salaries and wages for 4.0 fu ll-time-equivalent (FTE) positions that develop the programs described in subsequent sections. The remaining appropriations are used for grants, supplies, and contracts with organizations developing program materials. Funds rece ived by the Friends nonprofit organization for additional awards also are not included. Figure 3 shows the increase in historical funding from the 2014-15 to the 2020-21 biennia.

STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 5 Due to the administrative structure of THGC, the agency has no reporting mechanism for a strategic plan or performance measures because the Texas Historical Commission does not track performance measures or program-level spending for THGC. THGC tracks internal metrics for exhibit visitors an d monitors grant recipients; bo th are potential performance measures that were discussed during the Strategic Fiscal Re view process. For the nonprofi t grant program, the agency proposed formally tracking the Number of Non-Profit Grants Distributed and th e Number of New Grant Recipients from the Previous Year, with the latter measure emphasizing awardi ng grants to recipients that support the THGC mission but have not received an award the previous year. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of st atutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be higher or lower than existing fundin g levels. Legislative Budget Board staff asked THGC to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amount s. Within its minimum fundin g scenario, THGC proposed adding 1.0 FTE position to address the growing number of commission projects, sp ecifically those focused on education. This addition would provide a more concentrated effort on ge nocide education as demand for statewide services increases. Figure 4 shows the proposed increase in funding for the additional FTE position. This increase in cludes $96,000 in salaries and wages, plus additional personnel costs.

NONPROFIT GRANTS The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(e) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission is authorized to provide matching grants to as sist in the implementation of the agency's goals and objectives. Grants are available to nonprofit organizations for Holocaust and genocide-related projects. This program enables THGC to provide resources to organizations, as outlined in the mission statement. The Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 9, Chapter 191, Se ction 191.8, outlines how funds can be used for the grant program, but statute is not explicit concer ning how THGC should administer grants. THGC posts grants through its website an d conducts related outreach at conferen ces, workshops, and public events. A scoring committee, including staff, commi ssioners, and Friends of the THGC, assigns scores to grant applications and presents the rankings to the entire commission for approval. Ad ministrative code outlines the selection criteria for this scoring, which includes relevance to the THGC mission, qualif ications of the applying orga nization, potential impact of the project, feasibility, cost, timetable, and geographic diversity . In practice, grants are awarded by THGC, then the Historic al Commission disburses the fund s on a reimbursement basis. Reimbursement requests are submitted to THGC for approval before they are sent to the Historical Commission to be TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 6 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 processed. Awards may be adjusted based on reimbursement requests, which are coordinated by THGC staff and the grant recipients. The agency reports seeking to diversify grant appl ications, but it does not have specific goals. Figure 5 shows grant recipients from fiscal years 2014 to 20 19, the amount of the award, the amount actually paid, and the difference, as applicable. Awards may be adjusted based on the actual reimbur sement request or if the recipient is unable to fulfill the grant obligations.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, the nonprofit gran ts enable organizations to carry out prog ramming that they may not be able to afford otherwise, meaning discontinuing th e program could decrease program offerings. HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE WEEK The Texas Education Code, Section 29.9072 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Senate Bill 1828, Eighty-sixth Legislatur e, 2019, amended the Texas Education Code to require the Office of the Governor to designate a week to be known as Holocaust Remembrance W eek in public schools, with age-appropriate instruction on the history of and lessons learned from the Holocaust. The legi slation required instruction to include the use of materials developed or approved by THGC. The legislation took effect beginning with school year 2019-20. With guidance from the agency, the Office of the Governor designated the w eek of January 27, 2020, as Holocaust Remembrance Week. The program is geared towards grades six to 12, which, accord ing to the agency, aligns with educational best practices. The agency is seeking feedback from school teachers and st udents to improve resources an d content for school year 2020- 21. This program is central to the agency's mission, and authority is delegated directly to the agency to approve and develop materials. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The agency will be allocating resources to help develop curriculum and resources for the program and states that discontinuing the program would elim inate the only governing body over seeing the program and process. EDUCATOR WORKSHOPS AND TALKS TO ORGANIZATIONS The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a)(1) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of this program is to provide resources develo ped and approved by THGC education staff to teachers and other organizations; this program is conducted alongside Holocaust Remembrance Week. According to the agency, the Holocaust Remembrance Week project has resulted in a higher demand for education staff to travel to various locations and provide presentations and work shops. The agency's addition in January 2019 of the Armenian Genocide to its list of recognized genocides also has resulted in higher demand for staff presentations. TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 8 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 This program is central to the agency's mission to raise awar eness among its target population . With regard to authority, statute is not explicit concerning how THGC should prov ide assistance to educators and talks to organizations. SIGNIFICANT FINDING THGC is unable to provide reimbursement to educators who n eed to travel to attend a workshop. Pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 9, Chapter 191, \u00a7191.8, Title 13, Part 9, Section 191.8, the purpose of the grant program is to provide funds for organizati ons and projects that support the mission. However, the rule stipulates that the payments of grant funds are made on a reimbursable basis upon the project's comp letion and acceptable proof of incurred allowable expenses. Additionally, grants may not fund food, beve rages, or transportation and tr avel for project participants or nongrant-funded personnel. According to the agency, these requirements can be cost-prohibitive for educators seeking to attend workshops throughout the state. These costs also ca n affect adversely smaller institutions that do not have the funds available in their budgets. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing this program would result in the loss of Ho locaust and genocide-related educational resources that are available to the public. ONLINE DIGITAL LIBRARY FOR EDUCATION The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a)(1) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of this program is to provide public and privat e school educators with supplemental resources that can be accessed online in the classroom setting, and it is intended to incorporate Texas connections when possible. The tool is free for educators, and they typically are informed of the re sources by THGC staff. The website is password-protected and available only to Texas educators upon the agency's approval. This program is central to the agency's mission and function by providing resources to educators, who are part of its target population. With regard to authority, stat ute is not explicit concerning how THGC should provide assistance to educators. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, the Online Digital Library for Ed ucation (ODLE) provides educators with free access to supplemental resources to utilize in the classroom, and di scontinuing the program would halt the current sharing of information and resources. TRAVELING EXHIBITS The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a)(2) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION THGC raises awareness of the Holocaust and genocides th rough traveling exhibits. These exhibits serve students, educators, and the public who may not have the chance to travel to museums. Exhibits are offered at no cost to the host site, and no admission is charged. Accord ing to the agency, interested locations can request to host exhibits through the THGC website. Participants are invited to provide feedback through evaluation forms provided at the hosting venue. The agency seeks opportunities to partner with museums, univer sities, and other organizations worldwide that focus on the Holocaust and genocides. This program delivers resources to the agency's target popula tion, as outlined by the mission statement. With regard to authority, statute is not explicit concerning how THGC should provide assistance and exhibits to educators and the public. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing the program would limit Holocaust and genocide exposure and education, particularly for communities with limited resources. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 9 TEXAS LIBERATOR PROJECT The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a)(2) Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of this program is to introduc e the public to the experiences of U.S. so ldiers who were witnesses to and actors in the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camps. Th e agency provides a software application, website, traveling exhibit, and books to public and private high schools. According to the agency, demand for the program is high, and it is difficult to meet all requests for exhibit displays and publ ic programming. The agency intends to continue evaluating additional funding for this project. Initially, Baylor University's Institute of Oral History was contracted to collect th e testimonies of 19 Texan liberators of the Nazi concentration camps. A subsequent contract with Te xas Tech University was developed to build on the Baylor project and included the development of the software appl ication and the publication of the book. This Interagency Contract with Texas Tech University was amended to include a traveling exhibit and a liberator honor roll. Although this program is related to the agency's mission and target educator population, it lacks formalized performance measures, and statute is not explicit concerning how THGC should provide assistance to educators and the public. SIGNIFICANT FINDING THGC does not receive revenue directly for works prod uced. Proceeds generated from the sale of the book, The Texas Liberators: Veteran Narratives from World War II, typically are from online sales and are directed to Texas Tech University. If the book is made available at THGC events, such as exhibit openings, the proceeds are provided to the nonprofit organization the Friends of th e THGC. The Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 9, Chapter 191, \u00a7191.6, authorizes the operation of the affiliated nonprofit or ganization, whose purpose is to raise funds to provide services or benefits to the agency. Currently, THGC does not have the authority to colle ct revenue. However, due to the support provided by the nonprofit organization, the agency did not iden tify this lack of authority as a barrier. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, this program provides services to a growing number of organiza tions, and discontinuing the program would eliminate existing and potential connections wi th the organizations that use the information provided by the project. MODERN GENOCIDE SURVIVORS PROJECT The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a) Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of this program is to record oral testimonies of survivors of modern genocides through a documentary and exhibit. THGC has been including more genocide educat ion in its programming and contracted with Texas Tech University for this purpose during fiscal year 2017. The cont ract's extension in February 2019 includes a payment increase for a photographer to travel and provide photos for the projec t. The project is scheduled to end in August 2020, and the exhibit piece is forthcoming. Although this program is related to the agency's mission and target educator population, it lacks formalized performance measures and has a peripheral presence in planning. Statute is not explicit concerning how THGC should provide assistance to educators and the public. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, this project is an electronic resource that can be used by various universities, high schools, and museums. Discontinuing the program would remove these educational opportunities. TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 10 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 AGENCY PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE TEXAS HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE COMMISSION The Texas Government Code, Section 449.052(a)(1) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The agency offers several additional programs that are funded by the nonprofit organization Friends of the Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission, including a student poetry and visual arts contest, annual educator grant, and annual educator award. Pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Pa rt 9, Chapter 191, \u00a7191.8, the agency specifies that grants may not fund food, beverages, awards, honoraria, prizes, or gi fts. Funds from the Friends of the THGC enable the agency to conduct annual student contests and to support and award educators that contribute to the THGC's mission. With regard to authority, statute does not explicitly direct how funds from the nonprofit organization are to be used on agency programs. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing Friends-funded programs would inhibi t outreach programs and would limit exposure to educational opportunities. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 11 TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS The Texas Constitution, Article 16, Section 67; the Texas Gover nment Code, Section 825.404 AGENCY DESCRIPTION Established in 1936, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas is the largest public retirement system in Texas, serving more than 1.5 million indi viduals. The agency's stated mission is to improv e the retirement security of Texas educators by investing and managing trust assets and delivering benefits that make a positive difference in members' lives. The objective of the Teacher Retirement System is to provide retirement benefits, including a fixed level of replacement income and certain healthcare benefits, to all public educatio n employees and certain higher education employees. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS The functions of the Teacher Retirement System (TRS) are constitutionally required; therefore, all of the agency's programs have strong authority and mission ce ntrality. The sole program that did not have strong authority and mission centrality, the 403(b) retirement savings plan program, was eliminated by the Eighty- sixth Legislature, 2019, following the agency's fiscal year 2019 Strategic Fiscal Review. In addition to constitutional authority, TRS has broad st atutory authority to act as th e fiduciary of trust funds. The Legislature has balanced this authority by providin g guidance and direction to the agency in the General Appropriations Act. Figure 6 shows 2020-21 biennial appropriations to TRS. FIGURE 6 TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS APPROPRIATIONS 2020-21 BIENNIUM NOTE: Data shown includes only amounts appropriated in the General Appropriations Act.

STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 13 EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Stra tegic Fiscal Review (SFR) requ irements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum leve l of statutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be greater than or less than existing funding levels. The agency was asked to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amounts. Un less otherwise indicated, the agency chose to maintain the current level of funding for this exercise, stating that Senate Bill 12, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, increased the percenta ge that the state contributes to the retirement fund each year, and that if the Legislature chooses to amend the statute to contribute fewer funds in the subsequent biennium, it would diminish the actuarial soundness of the fund. PUBLIC EDUCATION RETIREMENT The Texas Constitution, Article 16, Section 67; the Texas Gover nment Code, Section 825.404 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Public Education Retirement program consists of the st ate contribution for public education employee retirement. The Constitution provides that the state must contribute fr om 6.0 percent to 10.0 percent of aggregate payroll of the system, and that members must contribute at least 6.0 perc ent of their incomes to the plan. Exact contribution amounts are specified in statute. To achieve actuarial soundness in the pension system, Senate Bill 12, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, set new minimum contribution rates for the state, member s, and public education employers beginni ng in fiscal year 2020. For the 2020-21 biennium, the state rate is set at 7.5 percent in statute and the member rate is 7.7 percent. Pu rsuant to Senate Bill 12, these rates will increase gradually to 8.25 percent for the 2024-25 biennium. The objective of the TRS retirement program is to provide a fi xed level of replacement income during the retirement years for all public education employees and certain higher educat ion employees. The program also provides related death and disability benefits. The TRS retirement plan is a defined benefit plan, meaning th at service retirement benefits are determined by a formula based on service credit, final average salary , and a multiplier at the time of retire ment. The plan specifies the age at which a member becomes eligible for retirement. The TRS plan pays pension benefits in a fixed sum on a monthly basis for the life of a service retiree. TRS membership totaled more than 1.5 mi llion during fiscal year 2019. This am ount includes approximately 1.2 million current members and more than 434,000 retirement recipients . Of the current members, more than 800,000 are active contributing members. For fiscal year 2019, TRS paid pension benefit payments to retirees and their beneficiaries totaling $11.4 billion. These benefits were funded from a combinatio n of cumulative investment income, member contributions, and state and employer contributions. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS Senate Bill 12, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, made seve ral changes to the contribution rates from the state, employees, and employers to achieve actuarial soundness fo r the fund. Actuarial soundness is defined in statute as an amortization period of less than 31 years. As such, additional changes are no t recommended at this time. In an analysis performed by TRS's ac tuary during fiscal year 2018, TRS de termined that alternative plans (e.g., cash balance, optimized defined contri bution, or self-directed defined cont ribution) would be 30.0 percent to 124.0 percent more expensive than the current defined be nefit plan to provide the same level of benefit when an employee initially retires.

ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - PROVIDE A D EFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PROGRAM As an alternative to the current defined benefit program, the state could consider a defined contribution retirement program. TRS pension benefits currently replace approximately 69.0 perc ent of a career employee's pre-retirement income when the employee initially retires. In an analysis performed by TRS's actuary in 2018, TRS determined that alternative plans (e.g., cash balance, optimized defined contribution, or self-direc ted defined contribution) would be 30.0 percent to 124.0 percent more expensive than the current defined benefit plan to provide the same level of benefit when an employee initially retires. Additionally, existing pension liabilities would not be eliminat ed by moving new hires to an alternative plan. Using data from TRS's August 31, 2019, actuarial valuation, outstandin g employer-provided pension liabilities for current active members were estimated to be $74.9 billion. This amount includes $62.9 billion for benefits already earned and an assumption that current active member s will earn $12.0 billion in employer -provided benefits before retiring. According to TRS, closing the pension plan also would increa se current liabilities by approximately $16.2 billion due to lower expected investment earnings on plan assets, using th e same valuation data. Lower expected investment earnings would result from changing the pension 's asset allocation to meet cash flow needs as the plan winds down. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM State contributions to TRS's Public Education Retirement co ntributions are constitutionally required. Reduction in the statutory level of state expenditures to this program may result in the fund no longer being actuarially sound.

RETIREE HEALTH CARE (TRS-CARE) The Texas Insurance Code, Section 1575.202 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Retiree Health Care program consists of state contributions to healthcare coverage for retired employees and eligible dependents of public education entities (i .e., school districts, open enrollment ch arter schools, regional education service centers, or other educational districts). Funding represents the state contribution to th e TRS-Care Trust Fund. Other contributions to the fund include retiree contributions, active employee contributions, district contributions, investment income, and the federal Medicare Part D and Ea rly Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) subsidies. As of fiscal year 2019, the total covered population in TRS-Care was 225,297, including 181,409 retirees and 43,888 dependents. TRS-Care enrollment increased by approximatel y 40.0 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2017; however, enrollment decreased by 16.0 percent from calendar years 2 017 to 2019 due to plan changes that took effect during calendar year2018. TRS-Care continues to be the source of health benefits coverage for approximately half of retired public education employees. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, General Appropriations Act (GAA), 2020-21 Biennium, approp riated $236.3 million greater than the statutorily required 1.25 percent of public educat ion salaries and the 2020-21 GA A, Article III, TRS, Rider 19, Additional Funding for TRS-Care, directs TRS to \"maintain plan year 2019 premiums and benefit levels in the 2020-21 biennium.\" These amounts are found in the 2020-21 GAA, Articl e III, TRS, Strategy A.3.1. Al though titled supplemental, they are provided in the GAA rather than through a supplem ental appropriations bill. Historically, the Legislature has made supplemental appropriations within the GAA in addition to statutorily required amounts based on payroll to ensure that TRS-Care is able to main tain benefit and premium levels. According to TRS, the supplemental appropriation, in conjunction with substantial multiyear savings from a reprocurement effective January 1, 2021, the elimination of th e Health Insurer Fee, and cont inued decreases in enrollment substantially improved the sustainability an d fund balance of the program for at least the next several fiscal years. However, it is likely that the plan is not sustainable in the long term with only the statutorily required appropriations, and it will require additional appropriations in subsequent biennia. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS TRS-Care funding amounts are based on a percentage of public education payroll, which the agency estimates will grow approximately 2.0 percent in fiscal year 20 20 and each year thereafter. This growth is not representative of or tied to the growth in costs to the program as healthcare costs increase. The agency estimates medical costs to the program will increase at a rate of 7. 5 percent per year and that pharmacy costs will increase at a rate of 10.25 percent each year. Therefore, th e projected funding source may not keep pace with anticipated program costs. If the Legislature chooses to continue to maintain plan ye ar 2019 premiums and benefit levels, it is likely that additional appropriations greater than statutorily requir ed state contributions, similar to those provided by the Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, will be required in subseq uent sessions, although the agency does not anticipate receiving a supplemental appropriation during the 2020-21 biennium. TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 18 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 If the Legislature chooses to contribute only the requ ired 1.25 percent of public education salaries, then premiums would have to increase, benefits would have to decrease, or some combination of the two would have to occur.

General Revenue Funds $1,115.6 (100.0%)(IN MILLIONS) TOTAL=$1,115.6STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 19 State contributions to the Retiree Health Care Program are funded with General Revenue Funds and historically have consisted of the required 1.25 percent of payroll and a su pplemental appropriation made through the GAA to maintain benefit and premium levels while also maintaining the soundness of the fund. As shown in Figure 14 , the statutory contribution to TRS-Care has grown each recent biennium, in contrast to the supplemental appropriation, which has varied substantially among biennia. The supplemental strategy hi storically has been used to fill the gap between the desired level of premium/benefit combination and the statutorily provid ed funding level. Other contributions to the fund include retiree contributions, active employee contributions, district contributions, investment income, and Medicare Part D and ERRP subsidies. ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - PARTIALLY PREFUND RETIREE HEALTHCARE TO ALLOW FOR A LOWER STATUTORY CONTRIBUTION The Legislature could prefund a portion of other post-emplo yment benefit (OPEB) liability for TRS-Care rather than completely funding the program on a pay- as-you-go basis. This prefunding would enable the state to maintain health benefits with a lower statutory contribution rate. According to the agency, as a result of increased premiums, reprocur ement savings, the elimination of the health insurer fee, and decreases in enrollment, the TRS-Care Trust fund is pr ojected to have a balance that exceeds $3.0 billion by fiscal year 2025. For the long term, the expenses of TRS-Care using the current benefit structure is expected to be greater than projected revenues, even if retiree premiums increa se with medical cost growth. The differenc e between future expenses and revenues is highly uncertain considering the nature of healthcare inflation and public education payroll growth, as discussed previously. OPEB soundness is not statutorily required. Howeve r, TRS is required to disclo se an actuarially determined liability related to the long-term difference in expenses an d revenues. Using the definitions and guidelines of General Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Stat ement No. 74, this difference is known as the Net OPEB Liability, which was referred to as the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the pr evious accounting standard. As of the end of fiscal year 2019 this difference was $47.3 billion. The reprocurement savings and elimination of the health insure r fee were applied after fiscal year 2019, and, therefore, could not be represented in the original actuarial measurement. If these savings we re represented in the fiscal year 2019, actuarial measurement, the Net OPEB Liabilit y would have been $42.2 billion, a savings of 10.8 percent overall. To eliminate this $42.2 billion liabilit y incrementally across 20 years using current estimates, the state would need to increase its contribution rate from 1.25 percent of public education payroll to 4.62 percent. According to TRS, for the 2022-23 biennium, that rate would requir e an additional $2.69 billion in Gene ral Revenue Funds. If the period to eliminate the liability were expanded to 30 years, the cont ribution would increase from 1.25 percent of payroll to 3.72 percent and would require an additional $1.97 billion for the 2022-23 biennium. In addition to enhancing benefit security, prefunding the OPEB liability would provide long-term investment ea rnings that eventually would result in a contribution rate that is lower than the current pay-as-you-go approach. This analysis was based on the following key assumptions: a 7.25 percent assumed long-term rate of return for the hypothetical prefunding scenario, a 2.63 percent discount rate for the current liability, 3.0 percent payroll growth, census data provided for the retiree healthcare valuation for fiscal year 2019, and growth in retiree premiums and combined employer and state contributions equivalent to overall health care cost trends. Future benefit changes cannot be assumed under the accounting guidelines. Because retiree premiums in the long-term are a ssumed to increase in proportion to overall costs, the estimated savings from the re-procurement an d elimination of the Health In surer Fee under the Affordable Care Act resulted in lower assumed in creases to future retiree premiums. ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - PROVIDE INSULIN BENE FIT TO HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE TRS-CARE BENEFICIARIES WITH DIABETES Like other health plans, TRS-Care experiences rising healthcare prices due to a combination of factors, including increased utilization, increases in drug costs, and the impact of chronic conditions. Also li ke other plans, a small portion of TRS's plan participants account for a disproport ionate amount of healthcare spending. Pa rticipants with chronic diseases have TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 20 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 much higher rates of emergency room visits, more inpatient ad missions, longer hospital stays, and higher readmission rates than those without chronic diseases. Diab etes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases among the TRS Care High- Deductible plan participant population. TRS could provide an insulin benefit to high-deductible TRS-Ca re beneficiaries who have diabetes. Although retirees have several plan options, agency analysis shows that adherenc e to insulin prescriptions in TRS-Care Standard, the high- deductible option, is low among these beneficiaries. Fewer than half (45 .0 percent) of members prescribed insulin were considered to be optimally adhering to their pres criptions during the firs t nine months of 2018. Based on current plan structure, it is common for a member to have a cost-sharing obliga tion ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to fill a single prescription of in sulin before reaching the deductible. Duri ng calendar year 2018, cost sharing for one member for a single filled prescription was greater than $4,500, and cost sharin g for a single prescription could be up to $6,400. The volume of filled insuli n prescriptions increases throughout the year as members meet their deductible phase, after which cost sharing decreases for members. For ex ample, approximately two time s as many prescriptions were filled during September 2018 as during January 2018 when the de ductible reset at the beginning of the calendar year. This increase toward the end of the year indicates that many members struggle to afford insulin. According to the agency, since May 2019, at least 10 states have capped the cost sharing of insulin for members enrolled in commercial health plans. The cap ranges from $25 to $100 fo r a 30-day supply. Medicare also is piloting a program to limit insulin costs to $35 per month. TRS-Care Standard reported approximately 2,600 insulin us ers in 2019. These members collectively paid approximately $2.6 million in out-of-pocket costs for insulin before any fina ncial assistance provided by manufacturers. It is common for members to have a cost-sharing obligation from $2,000 to $4,000 to fill a single prescription of insulin before they reach their deductibles. Capping members' cost to $35 per 30-day supply of insulin would have decreased their out-of-pocket costs to approximately $1.1 million. TRS estimates that it would cost approximately $13.6 million pe r year in net prescription drug costs to waive all member cost sharing for insulin. However, the pl an also could experience medical cost savings resulting from increased insulin adherence. Based on the experiences of other plans, TRS's Pharmacy Benefits Ma nager expects medical savings that may be similar to the investment, resulting in a net neutral cost to the plan with potentially improved healthcare outcomes. This savings will vary based on actu al TRS medical utilization and prices. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The state is statutorily required to contribute 1.25 percent of public education salaries for the biennium. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, appropriated additi onal General Revenue Funds to maintain benefit and premium levels. Although making supplemental appropriations is not a statutory requirem ent, decreases in appropriatio ns would result in increased premiums or reduced benefits to retirees. Elimination of the program would end health insurance benefi t coverage for the enrolled TRS-Care participants. As of fiscal year 2019, the covered population was 225,297 , including 181,409 retir ees and 43,888 dependents. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, the current level of funding is required by the 2020-21 GAA, Article III, TRS, Rider 19, Additional Funding for TRS-Care, and th e Texas Insurance Code, Sections 1575.2 01(a) and 1575.202(b) to maintain the current level of funding.

Pension Benefit Services works directly with pension members, retirees, and employers. Benefit Services assists pension members, retirees and their beneficiaries by processing be nefits and delivering comprehensive information to help participants make better financial, retirement, and healthcare decisions related to the retirement process. Benefit Services also coordinates and administers online resources for reportin g employers to submit reports and to find information on topics such as eligibility, comp ensation, and legislative updates. The core functions of Benefit Services include three main ar eas. Benefit Counseling provid es direct member counseling regarding pension benefits by phone, in person, or by email. Benefit Processing handles back office processing for Service and Disability Retirement, Benefit Estimates, Service Cred it Purchase, Death Claim Processing, Refunds, and member account maintenance. Benefit Accounting, including Benefi t Disbursements, processes annuitant payroll, and the Employer Reporting team works direct ly with more than 1,300 public school systems on payroll reporting. EMAIL QUESTIONS TRS began accepting benefit questions via email in November 2016. During fiscal year 2018, TRS responded to more than 61,000 emails. During fiscal year 2019 , TRS responded to more than 28,000 emails. REMOTE COUNSELING TRS offers the option of meeting with a counselor in the co nvenience of a pension member's home or office through the internet. New technology enables counselors to meet with me mbers online to present the same documents they would see in a face-to-face meeting. TRS piloted remote counseling begi nning in August 2016 and launch ed the service officially in September 2016. During the pilot, Benefit Services conducte d 21 remote counseling sessions. Subsequently, the program conducted 129 remote counseling sessions during fiscal year 20 17, 75 sessions during fiscal year 2018, and 203 sessions during fiscal year 2019. SIGNIFICANT FINDING TRS has progressed in its outreach efforts to members, bu t some areas may improve further. For example, TRS could consider expanding regional counseling availability or re mote counseling efforts considering the COVID-19 pandemic.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. Since fiscal year 2018, TRS has experienced historic call volu mes and longer handling times in the Telephone Counseling Center (TCC). As a result of increased call volume and longer handling time s, TRS did not meet its service-level performance measure of answering 80.0 percent of calls within 3. 0 minutes during fiscal year 2018. The 2018 service level was 15.1 percent. TRS Other Funds $27.0 (100.0%)(IN MILLIONS) TOTAL=$27.0STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 23 typically receives from 2,200 to 4,700 calls per day. During fiscal year 2019, TRS received more than 656,000 calls, an increase of more than 5.0 percent compared to fiscal year 2018, when the agency received more than 621,000 calls. To address the service-level measure, Benefit Counseling was auth orized to hire an additional 31.0 counselor positions in 2018. Figure 17 shows the program's target and actual performance da ta for this measure for fiscal years 2016 to 2021. FIGURE 17 BENEFIT SERVICES PROGRAM PERFORMANCE MEASURE FISCAL YEARS 2016 TO 2021 SERVICE LEVEL PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ANSWERED IN SET TIIME 2016 2017 2018 : Teachers Retirement System Several factors have contributed to the increase in call volume s, including delays and technical difficulties relating to the full implementation of the business-and-te chnology focused TEAM program; implem entation of legislation affecting TRS- Care, including issuing notifications rega rding net pay changes due to new healthca re premiums; and several plan changes and premium increases for TRS-Care and TRS-ActiveCare. Thes e factors affected the number and complexity of calls received by the TCC. As calls become more complex, handling times have increased. The longer it takes for a counselor to address a member call, the longer all other calls will be on hold. In September 2018, TRS implemented new call center software to help better manage calls and emails. The software enables the TCC to have more phone lines open, increases its ability to offer a callback opti on, and includes a mechanism to avoid callers receiving a busy signal on high-volume days. In fiscal year 2019, with additi onal staff and more efficient workload management through the new call center software, TR S has achieved a service level of 54.6 percent, compared to 15.1 percent during fiscal year 2018. TRS expects to achieve closer to the target of 80.0 percent in fiscal year 2020 and achieve the target by fiscal year 2021, assumi ng that the TCC is fully staffed and trained.

ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - ESTABLISH A HIGHER LEVEL OF IN PERSON COUNSELING TO MEMBERS THROUGH REGIONAL OFFICES TRS data indicates there is additional, un met demand for in-person a ppointments outside of the Austin area. A review of members that used this service from Octo ber 2017 to January 2019 found that the majority are from the Austin, Houston, and San Antonio areas. The further the members resided from Austin, the less likely they were to use the service. Additionally, TRS projects that a signific ant number of members who are eligible to retire within five years will reside outside of the Austin and Houston areas. One alternative funding option would be to direct TRS to esta blish regional offices to assist more members in person. In fiscal year 2019, TRS began discussing the feasibility of openin g regional counseling offices in different areas of the state to expand the services to its members in areas outside of Austin. TRS is determining member interest, staffing needs, and possib le locations. The agency is considering locations for a pilot office for the 2022-23 biennium to serv e members better that are located remote ly from the headquarters in Austin. Preliminary options for locations include El Paso, the Panhandle, West Texas, or South Texas. If approved, TRS will STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 25 evaluate the success of this pilot during and after implementation. If data suggest s the pilot office is valuable to TRS members and operating costs are reasonable, the agency will cons ider bringing additional regional offices for legislative consideration for the 2024-25 biennium. The agency estimates the cost to start up operations in El Pa so, the Panhandle, or West Texas at $1.7 million for the first year and approximately $1.0 million for following fiscal years. TRS does not anticipate a regional office would reduce the traffic at the main headquarters in Austin. COVID-19 PANDEMIC As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, TR S reports significant decreases in the nu mber of in-person meetings requested. Overall, Benefits Services has experienced a decrease in de mand since March 2020. The follo wing data highlights member service activities from Ma rch 2020 to June 2020: 2,317 members met with counselors through teleservices or telephone, a 42.0 percent decrease in demand from the previous year; 401 appointments were scheduled from July to August, a significant decrease compared to 1,783 members served during that period the previous year; 126,415 members have been served through telephone co unseling, representing an unprecedented decrease in calls of 20.6 percent from March 2020 to August 2020; du ring this period of calendar year 2019, TRS served 159,244 members by phone; Benefit Processing experienced a decrea se in work items received from February 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019; and as of June 2020, TRS reports an approximate 13.6 pe rcent decrease in retirements for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, incl uding those already added to the annu ity payroll system and those pending for additional documentation. ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - ESTABLISH A HIGHER LEVEL OF IN PERSON COUNSELING TO MEMBERS THROUGH INCREASED EMPLOYEE TRAVEL Benefit Counseling employees travel acro ss Texas making presentations and field o ffice visits to members. To increase service to all regions of the state comparable to opportunitie s available at TRS headquarters, the agency reports that it would need to increase field visit appo intments from 500 appointments to 54,000 appointments per year. This estimation is based on the following factors: (1) the number of members in Austin, San Antonio, and Waco that meet with a counselor in Austin; and (2) the number of members eligible to retire now and within the next five years. Offering 54,000 counselor appointments would enable 25.0 percent of members eligible to retire to schedule an appointment. To provide this opportunity for members to meet with a counselor, the agency reports that it would require a team of 50 counselors that only would travel year-round. The agency assumes for this scen ario that it could recruit and retain staff that would be willing to travel 85.0 percent of work hours; but TRS indi cated that, due to COVID-19, su ch an approach might not be practical at this time. The total biennial cost for this team would be approximately $12.0 million, including $2.8 million for full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions and $9.0 million for travel costs. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The services provided by Benefit Services are statutorily re quired and essential to providing pension benefits to TRS members. Benefit Services is a core function of TRS as stated in the Texas Government Code, Sections 821.002, 821.008, and various other statutes outlining TRS Benefits. Benefit Serv ices provides member services for 1.6 million members and over 1,300 reporting employers. Eliminating the program could have a detrimental impact on members and employers. If some of the functions were conducted through outsourced services cont racts, TRS anticipates an additional co st to the Pension Trust Fund compared to current program costs, and the quality of services could be reduced due to a lower level of expertise in TRS benefits.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT DIVISION The Texas Constitution, Article 16, Section 67(a)(3); the Texas Government Code, Sections 825.103 and 825.301 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Investment Management Division (IMD) implements invest ment policies as directed by the TRS Board of Trustees, emphasizing long-term performance and maximizing investment returns. The IMD manages the Pension Trust Fund using an asset diversification framework approved by the board as part of the Investment Policy Statement. The framework is intended to achieve the Trust's objectives, which are to cont rol risk and achieve a long-term rate of return that exceeds the assumed actuarial rate of return adop ted by the board, inflation plus 5.0 perc ent, and the Trust's Policy Benchmark. Overall, as of fiscal year 2019 the Trust on a three-year annu alized basis has returned 8.6 percent, 65.0 basis points greater than its benchmark. Total TRS membership has grown to more than 1.5 million ac tive and retired members, a 26.0 percent increase during the past decade. Membership typically gr ows 2.0 percent to 3.0 percent per year. The value of the pension trust fund has grown to $158.0 billion as of fiscal year 2019, whic h is a 79.0 percent increase since fiscal year 2009. Initially, TRS invested only in high-quality, government -backed bonds. Subsequently, the fund has diversified significantly, increasing to investment in corp orate stocks and bonds an d limited partnerships. Beginning in fiscal year 2008 the Legislature authorized TR S to use derivatives and delegate investment discretion to external managers. These changes resulted in more efficient in ternal portfolio management and an increase in externally managed assets. The amendments limited external managers to 30.0 percent of the fund and limited hedge fund investments to 5.0 percent of the fund. Beginning in fiscal year 2012, the Legislature incr eased the hedge fund limit to 10.0 percent of the total fund. In fiscal year 2016, TRS opened a small London satellite o ffice called Teacher Retirement Investment Company of Texas Ltd., (TRICOT), a private limited compan y incorporated in the United Kingdo m. TRICOT's primary purpose is to increase the size and number of investment opportunities for the TRS portfolio, especially in private equity funds, real assets funds, and co-investments for either of those invest ment types. TRICOT helps support the sourcing and portfolio management of TRS's $12.0 billion in exposure to private in vestments in Europe through 90 investment vehicles and 32 manager relationships as of th e end of fiscal year 2019. In 2018, TRS embarked on a multiyear initiative to streng then the Trust's abilities to maintain total returns and a competitive advantage among peer funds. This initiative, Buildi ng the Fleet and Reducing Inve stment Fees, includes hiring 120 investor and operational support positions by 2023. The agency reported that it has filled 60.0 percent of the positions intended for the Build the Fleet initiative. For the 2022-23 biennium, TRS plans to request an additional 25.0 FTE positions for th e Investment Management Division for the Build the Fleet initiative. According to the agency, additional staff will reduce extern al management fees, preserve risk-appropriate returns, and ultimately allow TRS to increase returns on investments. According to TRS, increa sing internal investment capabilities and deploying additional capital to take advantage of opport unities created could lead to the potential savings of $1.4 billion in external management fees and carried interest during the next five years or more. TRS INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE The Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, amended the Texas Gove rnment Code, Section 825.301(a), to state that the term securities has the meaning defined in state and federal securities laws, and that a limited partnership interest is a security STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 27 without regard to the number of investors, or the control, access to information, or rights granted to or retained by the retirement system. In 2004, the TRS Board of Trustees added re al estate to its portfolio, and TRS began investing in real estate through private investment funds, primarily limited pa rtnerships. The real estate program was expanded in 2007, and currently the trust has a 15.0 percent target allocation, which represents approximately $21.9 billion as of the end of calendar year 2019. IMD employs approximately 17.0 FTE positi ons on the Real Estate Team and invests in real estate through private investment funds mana ged by 57 private fund sponsors. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, approp riated an additional 23.0 FTE positions totaling $8.4 million in Pension Trust Funds (Other Funds) for the 2020-21 bie nnium to support the Build the Fleet initiative. TRS expects the initiative to result in savings to the retirement fund by decreasing fees paid to external managers. TRS estimates that the continuation of the Build the Fleet initiative will necessitate an other 25.0 FTE positions for the 2022-23 biennium.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The Investment Management Division actively manages th e Pension Trust Fund using a broad asset diversification framework approved by the board as part of the Investment Policy Statement. The framework is intended to achieve the trust's objectives, which are to control risk and achieve a long -term rate of return that exceeds both the assumed actuarial rate of return adopted by the board, inflation plus 5.0 percent, and the trust's policy benchmark. Overall, as of fiscal year 2019, the trust has returned on a three-year annualized basis 8.6 percent, 65 basis points above its benchmark. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 29 Without the Investment Management Division, the Trust would be managed either passively or managed by an outsourced entity. If passively managed, TRS reports that the trust wo uld produce lower investment returns. If management was outsourced fully, TRS reports that manage ment fees would increase significantly and likely reduce investment returns. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, the current level of funding should be maintained for the Investment Management Division, citing that the Texas Government Code, Se ction 825.301, requires IMD to invest retirement system assets as directed by the board. Additionally, Section 825.512 requires TRS to report on its investment practices and performance. TRS-CARE ADMINISTRATION The Texas Insurance Code, Section 1575.051; the Texas Administr ative Code, Chapter 41 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This program manages the administration of TRS-Care bene fits, which provides coverage to retired public school employees. The funding for this program is deri ved entirely from the TRS-Care Trust Fund. As of fiscal year 2019, the total covered population in TRS-Care was 225,297, including 181,409 retirees and 43,888 dependents. TRS-Care enrollment increased by approximatel y 40.0 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2017; however, enrollment decreased by 16.0 percent from calendar years 2 017 to 2019 due to plan changes that took effect during calendar year 2018. TRS-Care continues to be the source of health benefits coverage that approximately half of retired public education employees rely upon. Since TRS-Care's inception, TRS staff has worked in concert wi th healthcare vendors that have handled administration of claims, clinical programs, and maintainin g plan materials. TRS staff have manage d eligibility and enrollment and answered calls related to enrollment, eligibilit y, and more complex service issues. The 2018 plan changes were accompanie d by high demand for customer support and education from health plan participants. An average of 35,000 calls per month were received during the transition to the new plan year. Because of the uncertainty of increasing healthcare prices and the current fu nding structure that has not kept pace, TRS-Care likely will undergo additional changes in the future, and will continue to require staff to oversee operations and implement and communicate the changes. In addition, th e Medicare plans have added complexity to the program, which require longer handling times to explain benefits to members. See the TRS-Care Program section for more information. According to the agency, when TRS health plans change, highly qualified staff is necessary to manage plan operations, communicate health benefit information including benefit an d premium changes, ensure in ternal and external systems represent updated benefits, and answer a higher volume of co mplex calls. The agency would make a significant effort to implement changes, which would require IT, customer service, financial, and communications staff. Implementing benefit changes on legacy IT infrastructure pose d challenges and required considerable manual effort. TRS is updating its IT platform for enrollment and eligibility, which should reduce the workload subsequently. Effectively communicating all changes to the entire membership also proves challenging with limited staff. Ensuring that members understand plan options, especially those related to Medicare, is a complex task that requires comprehensive training and additional staff. TRS-Care Administration is funded entirely with nonappr opriated trust funds outside the Treasury. The program is funded from the Retired School Em ployees Group Insurance Trust Fund.

Section 1575.158(e) directs TRS to provide \"assistance in the payment of preventive care, including generic preventive maintenance medi cations, in a manner that is consistent with federal law.\" As a result, TRS cannot eliminate cost sharing for telemedi cine before the deductible. However, due to COVID-19 preventive measures, the Centers for Medicare and Medica id Services recently issued guidance waiving member responsibility for copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance for all telehealth servic es delivered by participating in-network providers and accepting audio-only or tele phone and audio-video visits for reimbursement. As a result of this recent federal exception, TRS has waived cost sharing for tele medicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Medicare-Advantage plan, cost sharing for telemedici ne also has been waived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, cost sharing is $10 or less for different types of telemedicine. Effective January 1, 2021, telemedicine through United Healthcare's contracted telemedicine provider will have no member cost sharing. Co nsultations in certain settings with another provider through telemedicine in rural areas will have a copayment of $5. TRS has conducted outreach to educate TRS-Care participants about the availability of telemedicine benefits, including a text messaging campaign encouraging retir ees to register for telemedicine services . However, utilization of telemedicine among the retiree population remains low. Participants without Medicare in TRS-Care Standard, a high-deductible health plan, have the greatest incentive to utilize telemedicine. The cost of a consultation is $40, and members do not have to meet the $1,500 individual deductible to pay this amount. According to TRS, the percentage of non-Medica re enrollees that are registered for telemedicine services increased from 14.0 percent during fiscal year 2018 to 21.0 pe rcent during fiscal year 2019, but most of the population is not registered. Telemedicine registration rates among reti rees with Medicare are considerably lowe r\u2014less than 1.0 percent of all enrollees.

However, the low out-of-pocket costs for in- person primary care and specialist visits on the TRS-Care Medicare Advantage plan, potential preference for physicians TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 32 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 with whom members have established rela tionships, and technology barriers may co ntribute to lower adoption rates among those with Medicare. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, TRS anticipates grea ter adoption of telemedicine due to social distancing requirements, the temporary waiver of cost sharing for telemedi cine, and greater flexibility for physicians to be reimbursed for care provided remotely. TRS has sent member notification s about the availability of no -cost telemedicine during the pandemic and early utilization data points to an increase in utilization. During calendar year 2019, TRS-Care recorded an average of 15 telemedicine consultations per day. From late March 2020 to early April 2020, TRS-Care has recorded up to 26 telemedicine consultations per day. The Legislature could direct TRS to continue to build upon education and outreach efforts to encourage retirees to use telemedicine services. TRS also could work with its medical benefit administrator to educate healthcare providers about reimbursement opportunities for telemedicine. Retirees may be more likely to utilize telemedicine through providers with whom they have established relationships, such as their primary care provider. Increased utilization of telemedicine coul d generate net savings for TRS-Care. To the extent that telemedicine visits, which generally cost less than in-person office visits, do not result in duplicative in-person visits and promote better use of the healthcare system, such as reducing nonemergent emergency room use, TRS-Care could realize savings from increased utilization among the retiree population. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing administration of TRS-Ca re would eliminate the administrative functions of the TRS-Care program. Additionally, it would have no impact on the state's budget, because this program is funded with nonappropriated funds outside of the Treasury. The budget for administering the progra m is funded directly by revenues received for the program. If TRS-Care were discontinued, the total covered population in TRS-Care as of the end of fiscal year 2019 of 225,297 enrollees, including 181,409 retirees and 43 ,888 dependents, would be required to find alternative coverage outside TRS. Additionally, retirees would forfeit the contributions they made to TRS-Care while actively working. Many public education employees work in public educat ion for the duration of their careers an d made contributions to TRS-Care over many years anticipating that they would be eligible for he alth benefits in retirement. Discontinuing the program would mean these individuals would have paid into the prog ram but receive no benefits for their contributions. In addition, the agency reports that disc ontinuing the program means retirees are li kely to pay more for coverage outside TRS that offers the same level of benefits. TRS's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Rx prod ucts offer more comprehensive coverage than is typically available in the market. For example, participants face no coverage gap in their prescription drug coverage. Discontinuing the program would mean retired publ ic education employees would not have access to the same level of comprehensive health benefits available through the TRS-Care program. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, the current level of funding is required for the TRS-Care Administration Program. ACTIVECARE ADMINISTRATION The Texas Insurance Code, Section 1579.051; the Texas Administr ative Code, Title 34, Part 3, Chapter 41 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION TRS ActiveCare provides health insuranc e for public education employees throughout Texas. In fiscal year 2019, TRS- ActiveCare had an average monthly enrollment of 483,095, wh ich the agency estimates is a pproximately 45.0 percent of statewide public education employees. TRS-ActiveCare includes eligible full-time and part-tim e employees of participating districts, open enrollment charter schools, regional educ ation service centers, and other educational districts. In 2001, the Seventy-seventh Legislature mandated participat ion in TRS ActiveCare for districts with fewer than 500 employees and permitted larger districts to opt-in. The program later expanded to in clude larger districts, and an estimated STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 33 90.0 percent of all school districts curre ntly participate. Because many larger school districts do not participate in ActiveCare, participating entities serve an estimated two-thirds of Texas students in average daily attendance. However, once an entity elects to participate, th ere is no provision to opt out, which ma intains program stability and protects the program from adverse selection by dist ricts and other participating entities. TRS-ActiveCare offers three plan options: 1) TRS-ActiveCare 1-HD, a high deductib le health plan that is HSA-compliant; 2) TRS-ActiveCare 2, a preferred provider organization plan (closed to new participants); and 3) TRS-ActiveCare Select, an exclusive provider organization plan with in-network benefits only. The network of providers available with the TRS- ActiveCare Select plan is based upon the geographic area of residence. In addition, altern ative coverage through health maintenance organizations (HMO) is available in certain servic e areas of Texas to eligible TRS-ActiveCare participants. Approximately 11.7 percent of members are in an HMO, an d most employees in the plan are in the employee-only coverage option. TRS-ActiveCare is funded by premiums for the level of coverage selected. Each month, employers are required to remit the full ActiveCare premium for each employee to TRS, of wh ich at least $225 per employee is funded by the state and the employer. The employer is required to contribute at le ast $150 per month per employee and the state contributes $75 per month per employee. The state is statutorily required to contribute $75 per mont h, or $900 per state fiscal year, for each employee of participating school districts, charter sch ools, regional education service centers, and educational districts. In 2001, this amount per employee was entered into the school finance fo rmulas through an increase in the Foundation School Program's Basic Allotment, which is a fundamental driver of public education funding. The Basic Allotment is a per- student funding mechanism, and student gr owth is assumed to correspond approxim ately with public education employee growth. However, there is no distinct identifiable state cont ribution to ActiveCare in the Ge neral Appropriations Act, and since its establishment, the state's cont ribution per employee has never increased. School districts are statutorily required to contribute a mi nimum of $150 per employee per month or $1,800 per employee each state fiscal year and many contri bute additional amounts toward premiums . TRS reports that the employee share of premiums has more than doubled since the program's inception. In addition to premium increases, ther e have also been benefit reductions. Th e requirement by law to offer a plan comparable to HealthSelect of Texas, the plan offered to State of Texas employees, has been eliminated. That plan, TRS- ActiveCare 3, was closed to new enrollees for fiscal year 2014 and eliminated during fiscal year 2015. Each plan year, the TRS Board of Trustees has had to make plan changes and premium increases to sustain the program. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the board approved increases in premiums and plan structure chan ges. In addition, for fiscal year 2019, the board voted to close TRS-ActiveCare 2, the high est-cost plan level, to new enrollment due to rising costs and inability to price premiums. Currently, more than half of the TRS-ActiveCare populati on is covered by TRS-ActiveCare 1-HD, a high-deductible health plan with an in-network deductible of $2,750 for an individu al and $5,500 for a family. During fiscal year 2019, women made up 65.0 percent of the to tal TRS-ActiveCare population and 75.3 percent of TRS-covered employees; the average age of the covered population was 44.7. The plan reports a high utilization of maternity care and high demand for care from participants with chronic conditions. Statute requires that state funding for TRS-ActiveCare is distributed through the school finance formulas, which means that the state contributions to ActiveCare are appropriat ed to the Texas Education Ag ency. For TRS-ActiveCare, TRS receives state money transferred by school districts to TRS, which limits the agency's partic ipation in the budget process relating to state funding for public education employee healthca re costs. As a result, TRS has no direct control over how much money is available to ensure that employee premiums are affordable. Instead, TRS sets the total premiums to ensure adequate funding for benefits. School districts then determine how much they will contribute. School districts are required to contribute at least $225 per employee per month in additi on to the employee contribution. School districts use a combination of state and local funding to make this contribution to TRS. TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 34 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 When TRS-ActiveCare was established, $225 per employee was equivalent to 90.0 percent of the cost of the state employee health plan administered by the Employees Retirement System of Texas. To purchase the basic plan offered by TRS in 2003, it was anticipated that $225 would enable TRS to o ffer a $0 premium for employee-only coverage. However, this $225 minimum has not changed since the establishment of TRS- ActiveCare in 2003. As a result, employees currently pay for a greater share of the total premium and their medica l costs compared to when th e program was established. Most districts contribute more than th e $225 minimum, and this additional cont ribution reduces the employees' share of the total premium. However, based on data collected by TR S for the 2019-20 plan year, 20.0 percent of employees have a $0 employee contribution for employee-only coverage in the high-deductible plan. As a result, during fiscal year 2019, TRS estimates that employees paid for 46.2 percent of the tota l premium. After including cost sharing, employees paid for approximately 60.0 percent of their medical an d pharmacy costs during fiscal year 2019. Some districts that are statutorily required to participate in TRS-ActiveCare have sought legislation authorizing them to opt out of participation or offer competing coverage. Accordin g to TRS, authorizing employers to opt out of the program has the potential to destabilize the TRS-ActiveCare program, as healthier, lower-cost indi viduals may choose lower-cost coverage options, causing TRS-ActiveCare to become a high-risk pool. If TRS-Ac tiveCare becomes a high-risk pool, TRS likely would have to increase premiums or change pl an structure for members re maining in TRS-ActiveCare. TRS reports that ActiveCare participants benefit from the st ability and size of the plan, and the market leverage and expertise of TRS to gain access to market-leading pricing, en hanced member service offerings, and best-in-class contract terms and provisions. According to the agency, districts in major metropolitan areas that did not participate in TRS- ActiveCare must contribute more toward employee healthcare to offer a comparable and affordable healthcare benefit to their employees. TRS reports that for plan year 2019-20, dist ricts that did not participate in TRS-ActiveCare contributed an average of $407 per employee per month for employee-only co verage compared to $298 for districts that participated for comparable high-deductible plans. SIGNIFICANT FINDING The current funding structure of providing the state's contri bution to ActiveCare to districts through the Foundation School Program complicates the agency's ability to request addi tional state funding. The Legislature may choose to consider alternate methods of more directly subs idizing healthcare for active teachers. Figures 25 and 26 show current and historical appropriations for the ActiveCare Administration program.

TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 36 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - AMEND STATUTE TO PR OVIDE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO ACTIVECARE DIRECTLY TO TRS INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY'S FOUNDATION SCHOOL PROGRAM APPROPRIATION The Legislature could amend the Texas Insurance Code, Sectio n 1579.251, to make a direct appropriation to TRS for the state contribution to TRS-ActiveCare. This amendment would provide a clear process for TRS to make funding requests to the Legislature for TRS-ActiveCare. This action also would enable the Legislature to chan ge ActiveCare funding levels more easily and directly. To hold schools harmless for such a change, the Legislature wo uld need to amend statute to no longer require that the state contribution is provided through th e Foundation School Program, and to decr ease the amount that school districts would be required to provide to TRS by the same amount the state provides. ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - DIRECT TRS TO ADMI NISTER A HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT (HSA) PROGRAM ALLOWING ACTIVECARE HD-1 PARTICI PANTS TO SAVE PRE-TAX EARNINGS An HSA is a savings account established by federal law that enables participants to set aside pre-tax income to be used for qualified medical expenses. According to TRS, administrative costs of an HSA vary and typically range from approximately $2.50 to $4.50 per month per account. The new TRS-Active Care-HD plan, effective September 1, 2020, is the HSA- qualified plan available to TRS-ActiveCare participants. TRS expects that many participants will enroll in a new, lower- cost plan, TRS-ActiveCare-Primary. As a result, the number of employees that select a plan that can be paired with an HSA is anticipated to decrease compared to prior estimates, depending on the contribution amount provided by the state and local school districts. Assuming an administrative cost of $2.75 per employee per month and enrollment of approximately 132,468 employees starting on September 1, 2020, the annual admini strative cost to TRS of establishing an HSA would be approximately $4.4 million. Using a TRS HSA, the state could directly fund a contribution to employees' HSAs. TRS estimates a $45 per account per employee per month contribution by the state wo uld cost approximately $71.5 million per year. The total projected cost for the stated assumptions is $75.9 mi llion per year for both the ad ministration fee and a $45 per month state contribution to the HSA. Actual costs would depend on the number of employees enrolled in the TRS-ActiveCare-HD plan and the actual stat e contribution. Because TRS is switch ing its third-party administrator on September 1, 2020, and making a number of enhancements to benefits, this enro llment and HSA cost forecast contains a higher than normal degree of uncertainty. Absent TRS administration of an HSA, participating employers would retain the option of administering their own HSAs for employees in a TRS-ActiveCare qualifying health plan. In a calendar year 2016 survey, nearly half of school districts in TRS-ActiveCare administered an HSA that could be paired wi th the high-deductible plan; ho wever, 2.0 percent of those districts made direct contributions to employees' HSAs. TRS also is implementing a health reimbursement accoun t (HRA) program for the new Primary and Primary+ plans, effective September 1, 2020. Members may earn up to $250 for certain procedures when they shop for and purchase procedures at eligible providers. This money would be deposited into members' HRAs for use toward reimbursement of eligible expenses. ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - EXPAND OUTREACH TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS USING DATA ANALYTICS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF ACTIVECARE As many participating employers have struggled to increase employer contributions and maintain the affordability of TRS- ActiveCare for their employees, some have tried to shop for ch eaper sources of coverage. A small number of school districts also have used the TEA District of Innovation waiver proc ess to allow them to offer competing health coverage. These districts have explored offering lower-value health cove rage to their employees alongside TRS-ActiveCare plans. TRS reports that the agency has observed confusion among participating employers about how alternative coverage options compare to TRS-ActiveCare. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 37 To provide additional resources for partic ipating employers evaluating the value of TRS-ActiveCare relative to other plans, TRS has conducted extensive market resear ch and started sharing the results with employers. On February 5, 2020, TRS hosted a district summit and shared a list of key considerat ions for employers considering alternative coverage. TRS also highlighted differences in contributions. The Legislature could direct TRS to continue and expand initia tives to engage districts with the intention of increasing clear information to inform employer decisions. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM If the program were discontinued, the near ly 1,100 entities that currently particip ate in TRS-ActiveCare would be required to find alternative means to offer health coverage to their employees. Discontinuing the program would make districts more likely to ex perience greater healthcare cost growth than if they were part of TRS-ActiveCare. Since 2013, TRS- ActiveCare's annual per member costs have risen 7.0 percent overall compared to other large self-funded employers that have experienced a cu mulative increase of 24.0 percent during that same period. Discontinuing the program also would require districts that pr ovide health benefits to spend a higher portion of funding on expenses other than healthcare, such as higher administra tive costs from vendors, premiums for stop-loss coverage, and staff and consultants to run th eir health benefits program. The budget for administering the program is funded direct ly by revenues received for the program. Discontinuing administration of TRS-ActiveCare would have no separate impact on the state's budget. The discontinuation of the program would mean districts woul d pay costs to administer their own employee health benefit plans, and less of the state's contribution to employee health coverage would directly pay for healthcare. This could further erode the value of the state's contribution to districts for employee healthcare. According to TRS, 95.0 percent of every ActiveCare dollar received contributes to paying for healthcare. The remaining 5. 0 percent pays for TRS program staff and services provided by TRS's medical administrator and pharma cy benefit manager, including claims processing, provider and pharmacy contracting, anti-fraud activities, and customer service. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE The agency chose to maintain the current level of funding for the ActiveCare Administration Program. SUPPORT SERVICES The Texas Government Code, Sections 825.101 and 825.102; the Te xas Administrative Code, Title 34, Part 3, Chapter 51 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Support Services program consists of administrative operatio ns associated with the delivery of retirement benefits and the management of assets. Internal divisions within TRS suppo rt services include Finance, Information Technology (IT), Organizational Excellence (Human Resources), Legal and Co mpliance, Strategy Office, In ternal Audit, and others. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, total TRS membership has grown to more than 1.5 million active and retired members, which is a 26.0 percent increase in the past decade. Membership typically grows 2.0 percent to 3.0 percent per year. The work of Support Services and Administra tion enables the day-to-day operation of TRS and the execution of strategic projects. This program covers the administrative support operations ar eas of the agency. Since its inception, TRS has had a member services and investment function, bu t support operations have changed. SUPPORT OPERATIONS The Legal and Compliance function has grown in size and sc ope as the Investment Management Division has expanded and modernized the agency's investment function, and the Benefit Services and He alth Insurance teams have recorded an increase in TRS membership. During fiscal year 2013, th e General Counsel established the Chief Compliance Officer TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 38 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 (CCO) position within the Legal and Co mpliance department, and hired its cu rrent CCO in 2014 to assume primary responsibility for implementing and expa nding procedures and practices for policy, regulatory, and ethics compliance training, policy-making, and reporting. The TRS Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program forma lly began in 2008 and has evolved from the bottom-up and top-down risk assessment approaches. Facili tated risk assessments now include the iden tification of risk events along with the causes, consequences, and mitigations to prepare, prevent, or minimize the dama ge of those risk events. In April 2018, the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Trustees was repurposed and renamed the Strategic Planning Committee. Strategic plan and ERM operat ional risk information is reported to the Strategic Planning Committee. Investment risk management is reported to the board's Investment Management Committee. In 2013, TRS established the Project Management Office (PMO ) to centralize business analysis and project management services support for the TEAM Program, the implementation of which is discussed below. Since that time, the PMO has been focused primarily on TEAM implemen tation. In addition, the PMO supports the project governance processes other key TRS initiatives including the e-Records project, Remo te Counseling, 415(b) retirement calculations, business processing mapping to improve tech nology usage, and other efforts. To ensure that TRS was aligned with established state contract ing best practices, the agency's Internal Audit conducted an audit of TRS's vendor procurement business objectives as th ey are related to the Procurement and Contracts department. In response to the internal audit, TRS increased communica tions and training for TRS contract sponsors to enhance contract monitoring; increased communication and collaborati on with internal customers to streamline processes; increased governance by implementing a non-compliance and oversight program; developed tools for increased visibility of contracts for monitoring contract performance; develo ped an annual procurement pl an; and, enhanced internal processes for Procurement and Contracts. Senate Bill 65, Eighty-sixth Legislatur e, 2019, made changes to TRS's procur ement process. Contracts totaling $5.0 million or more during the life of the contract, including re newals, are required to be reviewed by the state's Contract Advisory Team and reported to TRS's executive management and the Board of Trustees for potential contract risks. Vendor performances are required to be reported to the State's Ve ndor Performance Tracking System for contracts and purchase orders (PO) that are $25,000 or more for the life of the co ntract. Enhanced contract monito ring and risk assessments are required, all contracts and POs that are $15,000 or more must be posted to TRS's external website, and TRS may not contract with a vendor or contractor if trustees, executive management, or the Di rector of Procurement and Contracts has a conflict of interest to the second degree of consanguinity. Future administrative needs will be driv en substantially by the growing complexi ty of member service requirements and the growth in membership. Changes to the retirement plan du ring the past decade have added five tiers of membership and the biggest changes to employer reporting in a generation, leading to the need for increased data systems security and additional accountability. TEAM IMPLEMENTATION The TEAM Program is a collection of projects intended to m eet the agency's business and technology objectives for the next 10 to 20 years. TEAM is a combined effort of Benefit Services, Health Insurance Benefits, and Shared Services. Although IT is the program's sponsor, TEAM is a leading prog ram in the agency with almost enterprisewide effects. When fully implemented, TEAM will improve TRS's ability to serve members by enabling the agency to be more responsive to member needs, mitigating risks associated with aging legacy systems, and provid ing greater flexibility to meet future technology and regulatory changes. Upon implementation of TEAM, TRS will have upgraded pens ion and health insurance admi nistration systems running on modern technology. This upgraded technology reduces agen cy risk by replacing aging legacy systems and implementing more modern and accurate data and system security. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 39 The first phase of the pension administration system went into production in October 2017. The remaining pension functionality, including retirement proces sing, death claims processing, annuity payr oll, tax reporting, member self-service, and the health insurance administration system, will be phased in across several years. TRS recently canceled a contract with Perspecta due to the agen cy's low confidence in the vendor's ability to complete the project. The agency is continuing with its system completion in-house, and according to the most recent Sunset Advisory Commission report, TRS contracted for 79.0 FTE positions to assist with the completion of the project. The agency is replacing outdated project code and seeks to close out the project and continue with two smaller phases. Board members are aware of this project's status, a ccording to the agency, and receive regular updates. TRS continues to update the state's Quality Assurance Team and will provide a final report as part of the project framework detailing the agency's plan to move forwar d. Actual costs are not known at this time, and TRS is not expected to increase the current estimated costs for the proj ect, currently set at $138.7 million. SIGNIFICANT FINDING Senate Bill 65, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, made improvem ents to the transparency of TRS's contracting practices. Howeve r, the perception persists that additional clarity is needed. The Legislature ma y consider instructing TRS to finalize and make public its procurement manual. Figures 28 and 29 show current and historical appropriat ions for the Support Services program.

ALTERNATIVE FUNDING OPTION - AUTOMATE CONTRACTING PROCUREMENT Although Senate Bill 65, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, ma de changes to TRS contracting practices, the agency may benefit from efforts to continue to improve its contracting tran sparency. The agency has stated that, to the greatest extent practicable, public procurement should be transparent in it s practices, processes, policies, and relationships with all stakeholders, but TRS also must balance the need to protect confidential information. As a result of Senate Bill 65, and to help provide the necessary transparency in contracting practices, TRS has been posting to its website a list of contracts that are valued at $15,000 or more since October 2019. The agency also posts its standard terms and conditions on its website, along with other contracting documents that are used regularly, such as Business Associate Agreement, Code of Ethics for Contractors, and Non-Disclosure Agreements. In addition, TRS is developing a solicita tion calendar that will provide brief desc riptions and estimated dates for upcoming solicitations. This will provide the vendor community enough time to plan for upcoming pr ocurements that will improve the quality and responsiveness of proposals. TRS currently uses the Centra lized Masters Bidder List found on the Comp troller of Public Accounts' website for contacting vendors about new solicitations. According to the agency, TRS also seeks to procure a contracting solution that will offer greater automation in the pr ocurement process. The solution will co ntain a vendor portal for submitting proposals and maintaining vendor contact information. This will ensure that when TRS contacts vendors about upcoming solicitations, the agency will have the most up to date co ntact information to ensure visibility of solicitations. TRS is updating its procurement manual, which the agency will post on its website. The manual will include a section on the agency's commitment to a robust code of ethics and its practi ce to ensure disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest . The TRS Board of Trustees delegates investment authority to the Investment Management Division (IMD) subject to written policies, transparency requirements , and risk constraints as outlined in the Investment Policy Statement (IPS). To provide helpful insight into its investment practices, TRS has been posting to its public website the IPS and TRS board bylaws. In addition, TRS posts information about IMD busine ss teams, along with its Investment Strategy, Beliefs, STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 41 Diversification Framework, Risk Manageme nt, and Making and Managing Investment s. TRS also posts live webcasts of its board meetings and archives the public meetings by agenda item, enabling view ers quick access of investment discussions while maintaining confidentiality in closed sessions if the bo ard finds that deliberating or conferring on the investment strategy in an open meeting would harm the position of the retirement system. TRS also provides fund performance reports monthly to th e board and quarterly during public board meetings. The investment fees and commissions paid by TRS are outlined ev ery year within the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report in the Investment Section. To improve transparency for its members, TRS will add an easy-to-understand graphical representation of alternative investments to the fiscal year 2020 financial report. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Support Services and Administration includes divisions that pr ovide essential services to TRS's core functions (i.e., Benefit Services, IMD, and Health and Insurance Benefits). These divisions include Executive Management, Finance, IT, HR, Legal and Compliance, Strategy Office, In ternal Audit, and others. Eliminating th ese divisions could prevent the agency from serving its members, achieving inve stment returns, and meeting legal requir ements. A few examples of the adverse impacts of eliminating certain Support Se rvices are discussed in this section. Legal and Compliance advises TRS management, trustees, and the core business units. It advises IMD in structuring investment deals, Benefit Services in reviewing legal orders and making benefit determinat ions, and Health and Insurance Benefits on plan structure questions. Broadly, Legal and Co mpliance ensures that the TRS business units and TRS itself are meeting state, federal, and internatio nal statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to open records and meetings, tax qualifications, ethics and conflicts of intere st, securities regulations, and the Health Insurance Portabilit y and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Eliminatin g this department could decrease return s for the trust fund, result in members not receiving benefits according to statutory requirements, resu lt in a risk that the pension and healthcare plans violate federal or state law, and increase potential for fr aud by eliminating oversight on ethical conduct. The Information Security department within the IT Division protects member data from cy bersecurity threats to ensure that TRS complies with state and federal regulations includin g federal HIPAA regulations, th e unauthorized disclosure or modification of confidential information (e.g., sensitive personal information as defined in the Texas Business and Commerce Code, Section 521.002(a)(2)), and violations of the Texas Penal Code, Chapters 33 and 33A, Computer Crimes and Telecommunications Crimes, re spectively. Eliminating this department may cause TRS to fail to protect sensitive information, and may result in financial penalties for the agency. The Finance Division facilitates and monitors TRS's financia l activity. This division also produces many statutorily required financial reports, including th e TRS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report required by the Texas Government Code, Section 825.108. Elimination of this division may hinder TRS's ability to ma nage its finances properly and comply with reporting requirements. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, the current level of funding for the Support Services Program is re quired, citing that the Texas Government Code, Sections 825.101, 825.103, and 825.113, au thorize the Support Services and Administration programs to align staff, processes, and technology to support TRS. TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF TEXAS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 42 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 43 TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION The Texas Government Code, Chapter 419 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The Seventy-second Legislature, Regular Session, 1991, establ ished the Texas Commission on Fire Protection (TCFP) as a state agency. The former Texas Commission on Fire Protecti on Personnel Standards and Education, established in 1969, was merged with the State Fire Marshal's Office and Key Rate Section, establishing TCFP. The Seventy-fifth Legislature, 1997, revised the agency's scope after Suns et review, returning the State Fire Marsha l's Office to the Texas Department of Insurance. Funding for TCFP's op erations previously had been almost entirely from taxes collected on insurance policies. The Eighty-second Legislature, 2011, de signated TCFP a self-funded agency wi th an appropriation from the state's General Fund. As such, the agency is expected to generate enough reve nue to cover all appropriated amounts and an additional amount set in a budget rider. The amount of th e rider requirement is currently $1.5 million for the 2020-21 biennium. If actual or projected revenue collections are insufficient to meet the costs identified in this provision, the Legislative Budget Board is authorized to direct the Comptrolle r of Public Accounts to decrea se the appropriation authority to be within the amount of revenue expected. The commission is governed by 13 members that are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate for staggered terms of six years. TCFP is one of several stat e and local agencies that make up the Texas fire protection community. Its role, as specified in statute, is to serve Te xas fire departments and the public by providing training guidelines and assistance to the fire service, and by establishi ng and enforcing statewide fire service standards to ensure tha t lives and property of the public and of the fire service are protected adequately from fires and related hazards. TCFP's stated mission is \"to aid in the protection of live s and property of Texas citizens through the development and enforcement of recognized professional stan dards for individuals and the fire service.\" SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS The agency is self-funded and is required to generate an additional $1.5 mill ion each biennium beyond appropriated amounts. The agency has exceeded this requirement each biennium, and current projections suggest it is on track to exceed its re quired amounts for the 2020-21 biennium. TCFP has a limited ability to communicate with the fire departments and training facilities that make up the Texas Fire Service because current technology syst ems do not support mass emails. The agency's FIDO software system enables the generation of certification renewal notices but not the distribution of mass emails relating to rule changes and meeting notifications. Currently, funds from license plate revenue collected by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles for the Texas State Firefighters Scholarship Fund pass through TCFP. The agency has no way to verify receipts, and this method provides no benefit compared to the funds being allocated to the scholarship fund directly. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of statut orily required service, which could be greater than or less than existing funding levels. The agency indicates that it co uld sustain a 30.0 percent decrease in consumable supplies, a 20.0 percent decrease in travel, and a 15.0 percent decrease in other operating expenses, although these decreases would have a negative effect on operations. These decreases wo uld result in cost savings of $76,364 across the agency. Figures 30 , 31, and 32 show current and historical levels of funding fo r TCFP by method of finance and by program.

COMPLIANCE The Texas Government Code, Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION TCFP conducts statewide compliance inspections on regulated fire departments, training facilities, and other entities. Statute requires the agency to inspect all regulated fire prot ection entities every two years. The Compliance program also investigates complaints regarding fire prot ection entities or individu als, and assists the State Fire Marshal in line-of-duty death investigations. According to the agency, the compliance o fficers are the face of TCFP, because they are the only staff in direct contact with fire protection personnel. Originally, TCFP's primary responsibility was to establish a certification program for fire protection personnel. The c o m p l i a n c e p r o c e s s i n c l u d e s a p h y s i c a l i n s p e c t i o n o f a s a m p l e o f a n e n t i t y ' s f i r e s a f e t y d e v i c e s p r o v i d e d t o a s s i g n e d personnel, reviewing the entity's departmental maintenance re cords, testing records for equi pment, and conducting certain standard operating procedures requ ired by statute or TCFP rules. In addition to the minimum inspections ev ery two years, TCFP is authorized to conduct risk-based inspections. Factors that indicate the need for a risk-based in spection include compliance history, filed complaints, the entity 's ability to inspec t and maintain equipment, and other factors that the agency d eems appropriate to assess the entity's risk. The Compliance program also has adopted a more active role in the inspection of training programs in progre ss, referred to as audits to differentiate them from statutorily mandat ed biennial inspections. Currently, TCFP employs six compliance officers that perform inspections in the state's seven regions, on e of which is unstaffed, according to the agency. Statute requires fire safety entities to develop and mainta in standard operating procedur es regarding the proper use, selection, care, and maintenance of all prot ective clothing and self-contained breath ing apparatus. The statute also requires entities to develop standard operating procedures relating to an incident management system, personnel accountability systems, and fire protection personnel operating at emergenc y incidents. These requirements comply with the National Fire Protection Association's standards. Figures 33, 34, and 35 show current and historical funding and perfor mance measure data for the Compliance program.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM If the Compliance program were discontinued, the state would ha ve no systematic way to ensure that mandated firefighter training, education, and safety measures are implemented and followed. The most profound effects would be on firefighter safety. CERTIFICATION The Texas Government Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Certification program was implemented in fiscal year 1969 an d oversees the issuance and renewal of credentials to fire service personnel based on attainment of applicable requirem ents. The program also ensures that individuals that are not associated with a fire protection entity complete continui ng education. The program reviews and processes applications for certifications or International Fire Service Accreditatio n Congress (IFSAC) seals, certificate holders' completion of professional development courses, medical training documentation required for specif ic certifications, and applications for certification submitted by training providers. TCFP initially offered certain basic certifications for fire sa fety personnel. According to the agency, it has increased its certification offerings to 14 disciplines (e.g., hazardous material , structure fire suppression) and 43 levels of certification within those disciplines (e.g., basic, intermediate, advanced, an d master in aircraft rescue). The agency also has increased the number of IFSAC credentials offered. Individuals who comp lete the applicable testing process may obtain IFSAC seals in 10 disciplines (e.g., plans examiner, fi re investigator), with 22 seals (e.g., Fi re Officer Level I, II, III) offered within those disciplines. Since fiscal year 2006, TCFP developed certifications that are based on Nation al Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. Individuals with the applicable NFPA seal can apply directly for state cert ification, provided they meet any other requirements that exist for the certification. Since fiscal ye ar 2014, TCFP has accepted reciprocity for certain National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualification credential s, known as Pro Board, issued by the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX). In granting the reciprocity, the agency approved a second testing process for issuing state certifications. About 10.0 percent of TC FP-generated certifications have been issued from IFSAC or TEEX Pro Board credentials. The certification program affects all paid fire protection perso nnel, fire protection organizati ons employing paid personnel, some volunteer fire departments, and individuals that ar e not associated with a fire d e p a r t m e n t b u t h a v e T C F P certifications. The agency mandates a core group of certificat ions, which must be earned by an individual assigned to TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 48 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 applicable duties with an organization , and several voluntary courses known as professional development certifications. General requirements for obtaining and ma intaining these certifications are similar to those of mandatory certifications. The agency's original scope was limited to certification of paid fire protection personnel employed by local fire protection entities. Amended statute enabled individuals that are not affi liated with fire departments to obtain and maintain their TCFP certifications, but it did not specify the requirements or process for their certification. TCFP rules define this process for nonaffiliated individuals. Figures 36, 37, and 38 show current and historical funding and performa nce measure data for the Certification program.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Certification program could benefit from amending the Te xas Government Code, Chapter 419, to clarify and solidify the rules applying to individual certificate holder s that are not affiliated with a fire department. The agency's original scope was limited to certification of paid fire protection personnel that are employed by local fire protection entities. An amendment in stat ute authorized individuals not affiliated with fire departments to obtain and maintain their commission certifications. Current TCFP rules outline how this proc ess works, but state statute does not address this process specifically. The certification program could benefit from amending the Texas Government Code, Chapter 419 to clarify the state requiremen ts for individual certificate holders. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuation of the Certification program would weaken the ag ency's ability to verify and en sure that standard training and education exists for Texas firefighters . Several cities and local governments would be unable to comply with the Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 143, which requires that fire fighters are certified. Fees collected for certification and annual recertification would cease, resultin g in a financial loss to the state. During fiscal year 2019, the program collected more than $3.2 million in fee revenue, whic h is more than the agency's appropriation. FIRE SAFETY INFORMATION AND OUTREACH The Texas Government Code, Sections 419.028, 419.030, 419.031, and 419.048 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Fire Safety Information and Outreach program supports th e commissioners, committees, agency staff, fire protection personnel, training programs, and the public by providing ed ucation and informational resources for training and research. TCFP maintains a library of training resources and research material in print and audiovis ual media. Training materials are available publicly in an online cata log. TCFP's Emerson Library provides a co llection of resources specific to fire protection and emergency services subjects. According to th e agency, the library coordinates with the Texas A&M Forest Service, the Texas Engineering Extension Service, and the NF PA Resource Learning Center regarding training resources and new materials. The program also facilitates the collection of data from local fi re protection entities and over sees research and analysis of fire personnel injuries. The agen cy manages the injury reporting program for fi re protection personnel, which was initiated by the Eighty-first Legislature, Regular Session, 2009, and publ ishes an annual report with findings and recommendations regarding fire protection perso nnel injuries. However, statute does not authorize TCFP to correct fire safety issues that are identified in the findings. The annual report may influence future curriculum development an d training. According to the agency, no other state requires local fire protection entiti es to report injury data to a centralized fire agency. TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 50 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The Texas Government Code, Section 419.048, requires the agency to develop and establish criteria to receive and analyze injury information pertaining to Texas fi refighter injuries. Currently the agency ca n gather information regarding injuries, but it has no involvement with investigations in determining whether safety violations may have occurred when a firefighter is killed in the line of duty. Involvement in the death invest igation process could enable the agency to identify areas in which it could assist a fire department in making improvemen ts that would prevent deaths. Additionally, the agency lacks the statutory authority to take action to correct identified problem areas. The agency reports that this program also could benefit fr om expanded technology systems to improve communications capability. These systems would enable the agency to bett er educate the Texas Fire Service when rule changes or certification requirements are occurring, thus enabling the regu lated fire service entities to attain compliance quickly and effectively.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS STATUTORY AUTHORITY Following the enactment of legislation in fiscal year 2009, the agency began collecting and analyzing injury information pertaining to Texas firefighters that were injured on the jo b. Although the program was deve loped to identify issues in firefighter safety, no reporting or investigative process is incl uded for cases in which a firefi ghter is killed in the line of duty and the statute does not authorize TCFP to take action to correct the issues identi fied through its analysis. COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES The agency reports that the Fire Safety Information and Outrea ch also could benefit from additional resources to expand technology systems. The ability to generate and distribute mass communications with Texas Fire Service would enable the regulated fire service entities to attain compliance quickly and effectively. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The discontinuation of this program would diminish the ability of Texas firefighters to access resources to maintain their training and education. With no systemat ic means to inform fire departments and training providers of state safety and training regulations, training providers could mi ss changes to regulations and training standards. TESTING The Texas Government Code, Sections 419.022, 419.029, 419.032, and 419.035 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Testing program reviews training materials and curriculu m and conducts state certification exams for fire safety personnel. The program also evaluates examinations and review s and audits exam questions. Any organization wishing to conduct training leading to state certification for its studen ts must receive prior approval from TCFP. When approving a new training provider, the agency issues a certificate indicating approval in the spec ific discipline for which the organizatio n is authorized to deliver training. A training provider must submit information to TCFP for prior approval of upcoming courses. Any individual pursuing state ce rtification in a discipline must have completed an approved training program before taking the state certification exam. TCFP offers 24 state examinations and an additional seven exams as components of certain exams. The agency's testing process for certain disciplines is accredited by the IFSAC, wh ich provides verification that testing meets the requirement of applicable NFPA standards. Every candidate for certificat ion is required to complete a skill component and a written component of the state certification exam. The written compon ent may be completed either onsite or online, although technological limitations prevent the program from administer ing more than about 30.0 perc ent of written exams online. According to the agency, other IFSAC-accredited entities em ploy various testing methods that may be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the agency's testing program. TC FP has committed to acceptin g these various processes and provides reciprocity to individuals hold ing the appropriate IFSAC credentials. The Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) also cond ucts state certification training and examination. TEEX is accredited by the National Board on Fire Service Profession al Qualification, referred to as Pro Board. TCFP accepts the TEEX Pro Board process as a valid training process toward stat e certifications. Individuals presenting Pro Board credentials TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 52 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 from other accredited entities, such as TEEX, may receive cr edit for approved training, but still must complete TCFP's testing process to qualify for certification.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS UPGRADE ONLINE TESTING The agency continues to address the issue of how to enable applicants to complete written tests for new certifications electronically. In addition to identifying more online testing facilities across the state, the agency should examine ways to upgrade the existing online exam. SKILL EXAMS All testing staff are located at TCFP's headquarters in Aust in and, in addition to perf orming their primary duties, compliance officers currently are charged with administering exams in their assigned regions, which may cause delays in compliance inspections. Although an increase in online testin g capacity would reduce the administration of written exams, skill exams still would have to be conducted in person and re quire the continued overlap of duties for compliance officers. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuation of funding for the Testing program would di minish the ability of this agency, local government, and educational institutions to test and certify personnel. This reduced capacity also could affect current firefighters whose salaries and benefits are correlated to certification levels. El imination of testing also would reduce state revenues. During fiscal year 2019, the testing program genera ted about $1.4 million in total revenue. CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT The Texas Government Code, Sections 419.022, 419.029, and 419.0 32 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Curriculum Development program develops and maintains curri cula and certification tests for the agency's core group of mandatory certifications, which are required for appointmen t to the applicable duty (e.g., arson investigator, marine firefighter). TCFP provides voluntary or professional deve lopment certifications, but the agency no longer develops curricula for these purposes. So me curricula for professional development ce rtifications are available on the agency's website, but these tools will be removed as applicable NFPA standards are updated. TCFP continues to develop curricula for certain mandatory certifications that comply with applicable NFPA standards. The agency also develops testing to meet the requirements of the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress. Figures 44 and 45 show current and historical funding data by method of finance for the Curriculum Development program.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The Curriculum Development program develops curricula for TC FP's core group of mandator y certifications, which are required for appointment to the applicab le fire service duty. The elimination of this program primarily would diminish the state's ability to maintain IFSAC accreditation for all TCFP certifications offered. It also would eliminate the agency's ability to review, rewrite, and develop 18 current firefighter certifications, whic h would render the agency incapable of expanding or revising firefighter safety and training requirements.

The agency has no involvement in the program other than passing funding through to the fund. The agency has no wa y of verifying what funds are available to be passed through. No changes have occurred since this practice was established in fiscal year 2009.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Authorizing DMV to collect license plate revenue funds and pass the funding directly to the Texas State Firefighters Emergency Relief and Scholarship Fund effe ctively would eliminate this program at TCFP and enable the affected entities to verify the revenues and funding levels internally. The agency reports that it receives no positive gain from this pass- through program. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM If the program were discontinued without arrangements for funding to be passed to the Texas State Association of Fire Fighters by another agency, the Texas State Firefighters Emergency Relief and Scholarship Fund would not receive designated funding. Revenues collected for this fund woul d sit idly in TCFP's unexpended balances if alternative arrangements were not made to pass the funding to the trade association. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Government Code, Section 419.009 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This program provides internal agency administrative su pport, including human resource s, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, property management, benefits , and information technology services.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The discontinuation of the Indirect Administration program wo uld affect the agency broadly. TCFP would not be able to maintain online testing processes across the state, nor its re cords management system. In addition, TCFP would lose the ability to manage and account for revenue, agency spending, and facility management. Technology capabilities also would be diminished across the agency, and human resources would not be funded. TEXAS COMMISSION ON FIRE PROTECTION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 58 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 59 TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS The Texas Government Code, Chapter 511 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS) was establishe d in 1975 as the regulatory agency responsible for all county jails and privately operated munici pal jails in the state. TCJS is respon sible for promulgating written rules and procedures and establishing mi nimum jail standards, inspection procedures , and enforcement policies. The agency also approves new jail construction and renovation plans, provides training and technical assistance to jail staff, and reviews offender grievances and complaints. The agency's mission is to empower local government to provide safe, secure, and suitable local jail facilities through proper rules and pr ocedures while promoting inno vative programs and ideas. Texas was one of the first states to establish an independent agency to oversee local jails. During the 1960s and 1970s, an increase in offender lawsuits and federa l interventions led to the development of the agency. The Sixty-fourth Legislature, 1975, established the TCJS, but allocated no funds to support its activities. After obtaining federal grant funding for its operations, the agency adopted the first minimum jail standards in 1976. The Sixt y-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 1983, placed municipal jails op erated under vendor contract under the agency 's purview. The Seventy-second Legislature, Regular Session, 1991, required the agency to colle ct population reports fr om all county jails. The commission consists of nine members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. The members must include a sheriff of a county with a population of more than 35,000, a sheriff of a county with a population of 35,000 or less, a county judge, a county commissioner, and a practitioner of medicine licensed by the Texas Medical Board. The remaining four members must be representatives of the public, with at least one from a county with a population of 35 ,000 or less. Appropriations for the agency total $2.9 million in All Funds for the 2020-21 biennium. During the 2018-19 biennium, appropriations also included in General Reve nue-Dedicated Funds. The Eigh ty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, established the General Revenue-Dedicated Acco unt No. 5172, Prisoner Safety. In addition, the agency collects a small amount of fee revenue from the sale of mi nimum jail standards manuals, fees for public information requests, and administrative fees for certai n inspections. TCJS is authorized to co llect fees for the following inspections: (1) the inspection of jail facili ties with 100 or more beds that house an offe nder population of which 30.0 percent or more were sentenced outside of Texas; (2) re-i nspections; and (3) occupancy inspections. Figures 50, 51, and 52 show current and historical levels of funding for TCJS by method of finance and by program.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Staff retention presents one of the greatest challenges to th e agency, as the loss of continuity and institutional knowledge can have a detrimental effect on efficient agency operatio ns. TCJS employs 23.0 full-ti me-equivalent (FTE) positions across six programs. Three programs, Constr uction Plan Review, Audit and Population Reports, and Prisoner Safety Fund STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 61 Grants, each have 2.0 or fewer FTE positions allocated. Turnov er in these smaller programs can increase the workload of the remaining program staff or require staff from other programs to take on additional respon sibilities while new staff are trained. Staff in other program areas, su ch as Inspection and Construction Plan Review, often receive employment offers from county governments that seek candidates with in-d epth knowledge of minimum jail standards. The Indirect Administration program also is affected directly by staff turnover, because the program is responsible for recruitment, payroll, and human resources. Furthermore, as Indirect Admi nistration staff are responsible for a wide range of duties, larger state agencies may consider TCJS staff as strong candid ates when hiring. From fiscal years 2016 to 2018, two of the program's five staff left the agency. According to the State Auditor's Office's Legislative Workforce Summary Report , 2018, the agency turnover rate, excluding interagency transfers, was 33.7 percent, which is substantially higher than the statewide tu rnover rate of 19.3 percent during fiscal year 2018. The turnover ra te, including agency transfers, was 48.2 percent during fiscal year 2018, which included eight voluntary separations, one retirement, and on e involuntary separation. Retention efforts have included flexible work schedules and targeted salary increases, which may have contributed to decreased turnover during fiscal year 2019. INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT The Texas Government Code, Sections 351.10 3, 351.184, and 361.062 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Pursuant to statute, TCJS is required to inspect and report on the conditions of each county jail and privately operated jail annually, in accordance with minimum jail standards. Inspectors also conduct spec ial inspections of facilities considered high-risk or noncompliant. Inspections in clude a walk-through of the correctional facility and offender housing areas and reviews of jail logs, fire safety, medical and recreation record s, intake documents, mental he alth screening forms, and other documents related to facility operations and offender welfar e. The program also reviews offender and family grievances, critical incidents, and death-in-custody reports to dete rmine if any violation of mi nimum standards occurred or contributed to the incident. Texas Minimum Jail Standards are codified in the Texas Administ rative Code, Title 37, Part 9, Chapters 251 to 301. TCJS sets and collects fees for inspections and re-inspections of facilities with 100 or more beds that house an offender population of which 30.0 percent or mo re were sentenced outside of Texas, and failed re-inspections and occupancy inspections in facilities of any size. The program affects the 239 regulated facilities, including seven privately operated county jail s and four privately operated facilities that are within the ag ency's purview, representing 93,7 04 beds in Texas. TCJS works closely with county officials, including the sheriff that is responsible for jail operations, the commissioner's court, which is responsible for funding it, and county judges. As a result, local issues and decisi ons can directly affect the program's effectiveness. The Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session , 2017, appropriated funding for one crit ical incident inspector, who conducts in-depth administrative reviews into all inmate escapes and deaths in custody. The critical incident inspector also is responsible for acquiring and compiling the Serious Incident Report from all facili ties within TCJS's purview to include the following incidents: suicides, attempted suicides, deaths, es capes, assaults, sexual assaults, and uses of force resulting in injury. Senate Bill 1849, also known as th e Sandra Bland Act, requires the sheriff or jail operator to report all serious incidents occurring in the jail monthly. Additional funding for inspector travel has enabled the program's four inspecto rs to spend more time in the field conducting special inspections, providing technical assistan ce, and following up on noncompliant jails. Issues of noncompliance can be resolved onsite with out issuing an order of noncompliance. TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 62 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 In an audit report published June 20 19, the State Auditor's Office found th at TCJS had implemented processes and controls that ensured the agency conducted inspections and enforced standards in co mpliance with applicable requirements. The audit recommended stre ngthening data management processes fo r user access and data review. TCJS recently has implemented a virtual private network (VPN) servic e to enable program staff to access electronic files in the field. The agency is developing a web-based po rtal for critical incident report submission.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Jail Standards. SIGNIFICANT FINDING TCJS reports program challenges that may result from occasional issues at the local level, including varying levels of staff turnover and responsiveness to agency requests. However, the volume of comp laints submitted for review increasingly has become difficult for the program's single Complaint Inspector to manage effectiv ely. According to the TCJS, the number of offender complaints has increased from 1,942 during fiscal year 2017 to 2,311 during fiscal year 2019. The number of complaints submitted by family members or the public was 512 during fiscal year 2017 and 651 during fiscal year 2018. According to TCJS, an additional 1.0 FTE position would ensure that complaints and grievances are reviewed and investigated in a timely manner. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Effective jail standards require continuous work to ensure compliance with state and federal laws. Absent proper oversight and inspections, jail facilities that are not safe and secure may become a liabil ity for counties and result in unsafe conditio ns for staff and offenders. The effectiveness of the local jail sy stem is diminished when a local jail is operated poorly. According to TCJS, a significant number of jails likely would violate the minimum jail standards without regular inspections, technical assistance, and enforcement. MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTATION The Texas Government Code, Sections 511.009(a)(4),(6),(10),(16) ,(18),(20),(22),(23),(24); 511.016(b); and 511.018 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Management and Consultation program helps counties achieve and maintain comp liance with minimum jail standards by reviewing and approving oper ational plans, conducting staffing anal yses, and providing technical assistance and mental health training. Jail operational plans include in mate classification, health services, sanitation, discipline, grievance procedures, exercise, education, and inmate services. Types of assistance include regional workshops, conferences, correspondence, and onsite visits. Compliance is verified by TC JS inspectors during an annual inspection. Staffing analyses are conducted to ensure that jail facilities comply with mi nimum jail standards and operate safe and secure facilities. During fiscal year 1999, using existing re sources, TCJS established a research spec ialist position to perform detailed and specialized research projects affecting county jails. Research project topics include suicide prevention, mental health, inmate voting, duty to accept, and cost of inmate health care. The position also tracks legislation and assists with legislative TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 64 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 inquiries. The most significant change to the program occurre d during fiscal year 2017, wi th the addition of three FTE positions to provide mental health training to all facilities under the agency's purview. Senate Bill 1849, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, amended the Texas Occupa tions Code to require the county jailer training course to include at least 8.0 hours of mental health training approved by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) and TCJS. New county jailers hire d after August 31, 2017, receive the approved mental health training as part of the preparatory training course. Pr eviously, licensed jailers were required to complete a TCOLE course, Mental Health Training for Jailers, by August 31, 2021. The Eighty-fifth Legislature appropriated $371,712.0 in General Revenue Funds for 3.0 FTE positions to provide the re quired training at no cost to counties. During the 2018- 19 biennium, 4,784 licensed jailers from 125 counti es received mental health training from TCJS.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The goal of the TCJS mental health course is to help county jailers identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness that commonly are encountered in a jail setting and teach staff effe ctive communication with indivi duals experiencing a mental health crisis. During fiscal year 2019, TCJS trainers develope d a new course to address suicide prevention that is offered statewide. In addition to courses on mental health, the trai ners could instruct other TCOLE certified classes, including Classification,\" \"What to Expect During an Inspection,\" \"The Basics of Minimum Jail Standards,\" and \"TCJS Required Reporting.\" Factors affecting the program duties and effectiveness originat e at the local level. According to TCJS, the program could offer more training opportunities if a ttendance increased. High turnover rate s and staff shortages due to vacancies contribute to the lack of demand from some coun ty jails; however, this trend varies by county. TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 66 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCJS, discontinuing the progra m would decrease the availability of trai ning and technical assistance provided to local jails. This decreased service could result in more ja ils falling out of compliance and increasing the number of re- inspections conducted by Inspection and Enforcement program staff. CONSTRUCTION PLAN REVIEW The Texas Government Code, Sections 511.009(a)(7) and 511.017 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Construction Plan Review program reviews construction documents to ensure that new jail construction and renovation meets minimum standards. The process includes a formal plan review with ar chitects, engineers, design professionals, county officials, and sheriffs. This process co nsists of three phases: schematic design, design development, and construction documents. Program staff also develop comprehensive facility needs analys es for county jails to help determine incarceration needs. The analysis includes a review of current jail conditions, capa city and population projections, and hist orical incarceration data. Recommendations are based on projec ted capacity data and a 1:48 staff-to-offe nder ratio. The program is intended to ensure that counties understand st andard requirements, and it provides co unties with resources for planning and constructing effective, safe, an d economical jail facilities. TCJS sets and collects fees to recover the cost of performing construction plan reviews an d facility needs analyses for facilities that have 100 or more beds and house an offender population of which 30.0 percent or more were sentenced outside of Texas. The program was established in 1978, when TCJS hired the first Construction Plan Review staff after determining that it was not equipped to review and approve county jail constructi on projects. From the early 19 80s to fiscal year 2020, the number of county jail beds has increased from 19,000 to 93 ,704, and each project has been reviewed by the Construction Plan Review program and approved by the agency. Beginning in fiscal year 1994, the Office of the Attorney General, Public Finance Division, requires TCJS to issue a letter of approval for any proposed jail construction or renovation project that a county intends to finance by issuing debt. Figures 59 , 60, and 61 show current and historical funding and perfor mance measure data for the Construction Plan Review program.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS QUALIFICATIONS FOR LOCAL ARCHITECTS According to TCJS, program challenges include county contract s with architects and engineers that are inexperienced with jail facility design or are not familiar with construction mi nimum standards. Although architects must be certified by the Texas Board of Architectural Examiners, no prerequisites or formal training ar e established for designing correctional facilities that meet minimum jail standard s. Architects that have experience design ing correctional facilities in other states may not be familiar with Texas' standards. As a result, program staff often act as both educator and regulator. CONFLICTING REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS State, local, and federal regulations require that correctiona l facilities conform to the appropriate building, safety, and health requirements. Texas jails must conform to the Texas Accessibility Standards, which are overseen by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations (TDLR) and federal Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility guidelines. According to TCJS, conflicts between minimum jail standards and TDLR's accessibility standards have resulted in many projects either applying for variances from the agency or requesting a ruling from TDLR. Such regulatory actions may result in costly delays to projects. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCJS, discontinuing the Cons truction Plan Review program would plac e the burden on architects and local officials to ensure that the constructions plans adhere to mi nimum jail standards. Jails that do not meet construction requirements require additional work fo r the Inspection and Enforcement progra m and risk corrective action from the agency. Without the program's oversight and regulation, counties could fund construction projects that do not meet construction minimum standards, which could result in costly renovations. Fa cility design that does not account properly for population projections and occupancy levels co uld result in overcrowding and re gulatory action from the agency. AUDITING AND POPULATION REPORTS The Texas Government Code, Section 511.0101 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Auditing and Population Reports program collects, analyz es, and disseminates data on inmate populations, felony backlogs, immigration, pregnant inmates, licensed jailer turnover, and jail operat ional costs. Staff assists counties with submitting jail population reports and prov ides statistical data on incarceration tren ds at the state and local levels. Program staff also analyze the jail population re ports and commissary audits to assess jail program costs and develop daily average cost estimates. State agencies, such as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), advocacy groups, and other stakeholders rely upon the inform ation provided by the program. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 69 Each county jail facility is statutorily required to submit monthly jail population reports. The reports include information regarding the total number of individuals incarcerated, jail ca pacity, pretrial misdemeanor and felony offenders, convicted misdemeanor and felony offenders, and those detained on bench warrants, parole violations, federal detainment, immigration detainment, and those awaiting transfer to TDCJ . County jails also must submit information regarding the number of female offenders, pregnant offenders, and jail operational costs. TCJS also is statutorily required to collect information regarding licensed jailer turnover from each jail within the agency's purview. According to TCJS, the number of FTE po sitions assigned to the program has decreased from a high of 5.1 positions to 1.0 position for the current program. Before fiscal year 1995, the agency served as a clearinghouse for funds paid to counties operating jail facilities that received TDCJ-transferred inmates. The agency us ed county jail population reports to determine the amounts to be paid to those counties. This prog ram responsibility required several auditors to review the reports for accuracy. By September 1, 1995, the state met its duty to accept offenders, and all felony backlogs were transferred from county jails to TDCJ. House Bill 3440, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, directed TCJS to establish an electronic system for counties to submit required reports and data, and authorized the agency to collect a fee to cover the cost of processing non-electronic submissions. On June 4, 20 20, the agency approved a $50 fee for this purpose. Figures 62 , 63, and 64 show current and historical funding and pe rformance measure data for the Auditing and Population Reports program.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Counties are statutorily required to submit monthly jail population reports to TCJS. Each county traditionally has submitted the reports in multiple formats, which has required the program staff to perform basic data entry. Recently, TCJS recommended that counties submit the required info rmation in Microsoft Excel format, which enables TCJS to import data into a single database. House Bill 3440, Eighty-s ixth Legislature, 2019, authorized TCJS to develop a web- based portal to streamline further the submission and analys is of monthly population reports. According to TCJS, the portal is scheduled to be operational by the end of fiscal ye ar 2020, after which TCJS will charge counties a $50 fee per month for jail population report s not submitted electronically. According to TCJS, additional program challenges include dela yed population reports and inco mplete or inac curate data. Program staff publish instructions online and offer free traini ng and technical assistance to help counties compile and submit the report. TCJS estimates that approximately 10.0 percent of the reports submitted each month require correction. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The Auditing and Population Reports progra m collects counties' statutorily required data, which is posted online monthly. According to TCJS, the agency is the only entity that compiles population and operational cost data for Texas county jails and privately operated jails pursuant to the Texas Government Code, Section 511.0101. If th e program were discontinued, county jail population data would become less reliable, less accurate, and more difficult to obtain. Stakeholders would not have access to this information and would have difficulty obta ining similar statewide data from each county. Stakeholders also would have difficulty assessing the delivery of servic es or evaluating population or operational costs trends. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 71 PRISONER SAFETY FUND GRANTS The Texas Government Code, Section 511.019 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Prisoner Safety Fund Grants program was established in fiscal year 2017 and administers grants from General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 5172 for ca pital improvement projects to county jail facilities that have a maximum capacity of 288 beds. Senate Bill 1849, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, requir ed TCJS to establish rules and procedures related to the access to a mental health profe ssional through a telehealth se rvice and the installation of automated electronic sensors or cameras in certain cells. The projects are limited to purcha sing telehealth equipment and providing electronic cell-check systems or camera systems to monitor cells designated for ho using at-risk offenders. The electronic systems are intended to ensure and verify that observation checks are occu rring at regular intervals, pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code, Title 37, Part 9. All county ja ils are required to comply with these rules by September 1, 2020. House Bill 4468, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded the eligibility requirements to include county facilities that have 288 beds or less, which included 68 additional facilities. Previously, only counties with a capacity of 96 beds or fewer were eligible for grants. The legislation also amended the tele health requirements established by Senate Bill 1849, Eighty- fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017 , authorizing counties to provide mental health services through in-person treatment, 24-hour telehealth treatment, or by transferring offenders to another location for treatment by a mental health professional within a reasonable amount of time. The grant program was funded with General Revenue Funds fo r 1.0 FTE position and associated operating expenses, and a onetime General Revenue-Dedicated Funds appropriation in fisc al year 2018 of $1.0 million. At the end of fiscal year 2020, this amount lapses. As of July 2020, the program pr ovided 69 counties with $320 ,990, including $134,797 for cameras, $46,822 for electronic sens ors, and $139,371 for telehealth eq uipment for mental health services.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Jail Standards. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS COUNTY RESPONSE According to TCJS, some eligible counties were slow to appl y for grants, provided inaccurate purchase information, or requested items that were outside of the grant program's limited scope. Additiona lly, some counties were concerned about ongoing costs, such as the telehealth visits, outside of the initial capital project grant. PRISONER SAFETY FUND The Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, establishe d the Prisoner Safety Fund Grant Program to help certain jails comply with new jail standards relating to the provis ion of mental health services and cell observation checks. Senate Bill 1849, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, requires all county jails to provide 24-hour access to a mental health professional through a telehealth mental health service if onsite access is not available, and to install STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 73 automated electronic sensors or cameras to ensure accurate and on -time checks in cells housing high-risk individuals. County jails are required to comply with these standards by September 1, 2020. According to TCJS, staff is in discussions with the Offi ce of the Governor and the Texas Veterans Commission to determine whether additional programs and opportunities are av ailable to expand the Prisoner Safety Fund Grant program. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Prisoner Safety Fund program would have mi nimal adverse effects. All eligible counties either have received grant funding or reimbursement or have certif ied that they are in compliance with the standards. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Government Code, Sections 511.0061, 511.008, 511.009, and 511.018 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Indirect Administration program responsi bilities include public information requests, information resource technology, security, and financial and administrative services, such as accounting, purchasing, mail, and other support services. The program also analyzes legislation, promulgates new jail standards, and recommends the adoption of new or revised minimum jail standards to TCJS. Indirect Administration also coordinates with th e U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and other entities to provide assistance with jail operational plans and train jail administrators to help eligible offenders apply for federal benefits. Currently, TCJS operates with part-time, off-site informatio n technology support. According to TCJS, the agency is collaborating with the Texas Department of Information Reso urces and contracted information technology (IT) staff to develop a five-year IT plan, which likely will requir e cybersecurity updates and computer replacements. The program has expanded its responsibilities to include Ce ntralized Accounting and Payroll/Personnel System (CAPPS) transition, filing sales tax returns for the sale of jail standa rds manuals, and implementing a dditional staff training and a new personnel file system. Recently, TCJS upgraded its website to enable easier site updates, ease of use, and additional agency data and reports. House Bill 3116, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, established a ta sk force to conduct a comprehensive study on best practice standards for the detention of individuals with intellectual an d developmental disabilities. TCJS's Indirect Administration program has contributed staff time and travel expenses to assist in developing report recommendations. Figures 68 and 69 show current and historical funding data by method of finance for the Indirect Administration program.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING During the 2018-19 biennium, the Indirect Administration pr ogram guided the agency through the required transition from the Uniform Statewide Accounting System to CAPPS Fina ncials. However, with the lack of additional support for its expanded responsibilities, the agency struggled to meet required deadlines. Program staff contributed hours to CAPPS transitioning in addition to performi ng their normal duties.

Staff still would be required to perf orm duties such as responding to public information requests, purchasing, human resources, accounting , travel reimbursements, information technology, governmental reporting, and executive administration for the agency to operate efficiently. The result would be an additional demand on other program staff to perform these tasks. TEXAS COMMISSION ON JAIL STANDARDS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 76 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 77 TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1701.051 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) is a regula tory agency whose mission is to screen, develop, and monitor resources for the continuing education of law enforcem ent officers, and to set standards for behavior. The agency also develops, maintains, and enforces minimum qualifications for the selectio n, training, and certification of law enforcement personnel, county correct ional officers, and telecommunicators. TCOLE, formerly known as the Texas Commission on La w Enforcement Officer Stan dards and Education, was established by the Fifty-ninth Legislature, Regular Session, 19 65, to study and recommend to the Office of the Governor and the Legislature standards for training, education, and certification to improve law enforcement performance. The Legislature initially did not appropriate an y funds for the operations of the agency. The Sixtieth Legislature, 1967, included TCOLE in the General Appropriations Act and funded an executive director and three staff members. Funding was provided from private foundations and federal grants. Current funding includes a combination of General Revenu e Funds, General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, Appropriated Receipts (Other Funds), donations, and state and federa l grants. General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 116, Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education (Account No. 116), funds the majority of TCOLE's expenditures and benefits. Consolidated court costs and professional fees provide revenue sources for Account No. 116. TCOLE is governed by nine commissioners appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. To represent the regulated population, TCOLE is required statutorily to include the following representatives: three chief administrators of law enforcement agenci es, which include sheriffs, constables, and chiefs of police; three individuals licensed by the agency, two of whom must be peace officers in nonsupervisory positions with a law enforcement agency when appointed by the Governor; and three private citizens that have no direct connection with the field of law enforcement. SIGNIFICANT FINDING A revenue-to-expenditure disparity analys is projects that General Revenue-Dedi cated Account No. 116 will be depleted by the end of fiscal year 2024. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures needed to maintain the minimum level of statut orily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be higher or lower than existing fundin g levels. The agency was asked to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amounts. The agency chose to maintain the curre nt level of funding for this exercise, stating that the \"Discontinuance of this program would result in the inability to comply with current law and rule\" regarding all agency programs. Figures 70, 71, and 72 show current and historical funding for TC OLE by method of finance and by program.

FUND DEPLETION Since 2004, TCOLE has funded most of its activities usin g General Revenue-Dedicated Funds from Account No. 116, which is composed of consolidated court fees collected pu rsuant to the Texas Local Government Code, Section 133.102. Currently, multiple agencies spend funds from Account No. 11 6, including TCOLE, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, and the Department of Public Safety. In addition, employee benefits are paid from this fund. The amount of revenue collected has been decreasing for at leas t the past 15 fiscal years, shown in Figures 75 and 76.

Senate Bill 346, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, addressed some of these issues, but it is unclear how these adjustments will impact revenues that are deposited into Account No. 116. House Bill 3389, Eighty-first Legislature, Regular Session, 2009 , TCOLE's Sunset bill, established the Civil Justice Data Repository Fund, which would have collected revenue of $0.1 0 per moving violation. The collections were not deposited into the fund, which resulted in approx imately $273,000 being deposited into Ge neral Revenue Funds each fiscal year. Senate Bill 346, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, abolished the statute related to the fee and fund. FUNDING OPTIONS TO CONSIDER Fund Indirect Administration in the 2022-23 biennium with General Revenue Funds, and gradually move funding for additional programs in a similar manner in future biennia. TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 82 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Establish a new General Revenue-Dedicated Fund similar to the Civil Justice Data Repository Fund, collect receipts on every moving violation, and fund the TCOLE Standards Development program with the newly established dedicated account. Alternative options: o Consider expanding the allowable uses of Ge neral Revenue-Dedicated Funds Account No. 116 and providing additional revenue sources. o Consider reducing, eliminating, or providing a method-of-finance swap for CPA local grants in the 2022-23 biennium to reduce the draw on Acco unt No. 116 and extend its capacity to support TCOLE appropriations in subsequent biennia. LICENSING The Texas Occupations Code, 1701.260, 1701.151, 1701.251, 1701.3071 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Commission on Law Enforcement is authorized to pr ovide licensing and certification to Texas peace officers, county jailers, telecommunicators, school marshals, and law enforcement agencies, en suring that only qualified applicants obtain a TCOLE license. The growth of th e licensed population tends to correlate with the overall population in Texas. The Licensing program includes the Credenti aling Division, whose main objective is to ensure that licenses, certificates, and identification cards are issued only to individuals who meet the minimum el igibility requirements. The credentialing staff receive the applications, ensure that required training has been completed and that the applicant has met all other minimum standards, process any fees associated with the ap plication, enter the data into the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Data Distribution System (TCLEDDS), and issu e the appropriate documents or notifications of denial. The most recent change to Licensing was th e fiscal year 2013 addition of the school marshal program. In fiscal year 2018, TCOLE temporarily diverted agency resources to meet the Govern or's priority of increasing the number of school marshals beginning in school year 2018-19. Grants of $114,585 in fiscal year 2018 throug h the Office of the Governor, Criminal Justice Division, enabled TCOLE to conduct four classes with an average of 20 students. In fiscal year 2019, this grant was renewed in the amount of $191,221 for TCOLE to continue facilitating the training of in dividuals licensed as school marshals. Figures 77, 78, and 79 show current and historical levels of fundin g and performance measure data for the Licensing program.

Number Certificat ions Issued is not a key measur e. SOURCE : Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS LICENSE EXPIRATION DATES The school marshal program could benefi t from amending the Texas Occupation s Code, Section 1701.260(g), to align the license expiration date with the end of the continuing education period for the rest of the TCOLE licensees. The expiration date currently is dependent on the individual's birthday, making it diffi cult for the agency to track expirations and to organize renewal classes. MANUAL FORM SUBMISSIONS TCOLE's most recent Sunset bill added a provision to require the agency to collect forms and reports submitted by law enforcement agencies in an electronic format. A $35 fee ha s been charged for all paper forms submitted by agencies following the effective date of the Sunset bill. However, th e same requirement was not put into place for forms submitted to the agency by individual licensees, nor does the agency's current online services platform support the ability to collect the data needed for all of the 35 indivi dual licensee forms that individuals may download from the agency's website and submit by mail. The agency estimates that, currently, direct staff time valued at approximately $35,000 per fiscal year is dedicated to processing paper forms in the Credentialin g Division. According to the agency, the st aff time required to process the forms could be used on other tasks and to process other documents that need Commission review more quickly prior to approval. The agency states that developing an on line system for licensees to submit indi vidual forms electronically would enable TCOLE to speed up delivery of proficiency certificates and im prove the speed of other form processing, some by half or more. This system also would reduce error by agency staff duri ng data entry and enable the current platform to collect the data needed for all of the 35 individual licensee forms. Licensee s would be fully responsible for ensuring that data submitted was correct, and automation would reduce data entry errors and expand the agency's business window from normal business hours to a 24/7 cycle. The agency's cost estimate, based on previous bids received for the online system and costs for coding, would be $0.2 million. This amount would include the components of an en crypted system to upload back ground documents to protect sensitive information, and an application page for each cert ificate type with form fields to collect the information electronically that currently is input onto a paper application. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCOLE, discontinuing the agency's Licensing prog ram would result in the possible operation of unlicensed or unqualified law enforcement personnel in Texas. This program ensures that only properly trained and qualified individuals serve in that capacity, and its discontinuance likely would increase subsequent agency enforcement actions when officers are found unfit for service. This function also includes the processing of applications for proficiency and specialty verifications and documenting experience for licensees. The capital items of Distance Learni ng and the agency's informatio n technology infrastructure also would be removed. Licensing revenue is the source of 59.0 pe rcent of the agency's Appropriated Receip ts, which is necessary to ongoing efforts to provide online training and services to the licensees. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 85 STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT The Texas Occupations Code, Chapt er 1701, Subchapter F, Section s 1701.151(2) and 1701.153(a)(1), and Subchapter J Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Commission on Law Enforcement's Standards Developm ent program includes the hiri ng and training standards for all TCOLE licensees, and for the law enforcement agencies employing them and the training providers operating TCOLE's delegated authority. Since the program's implementati on, new courses are added each legislative session to the minimum curriculum requirements and co ntinuing education. Standards Develo pment ensures that law enforcement agencies are complying with state and fe deral laws and will have the needed educ ation and training to adhere to state policies. TCOLE develops legislatively established course material thro ugh a committee process, with input from stakeholders across the state. This process ensures a statewide view of the newl y mandated training. The same committee process is used when TCOLE is updating any mandated training. The committees incl ude a group of volunteers from small, midsize, and large agencies from geographically diverse parts of the state. Subject matter experts and sp ecial interest groups for specific topics are used, if needed. The Standards Development program also manages and evaluate s contracted training provid ers in the state. TCOLE is mandated to provide training in the state and uses this prog ram to execute the training and oversight entities under the agency's delegated authority. Unlike similar agencies in many states, TCOLE does not operate its own statewide enforcement academy to deliver training in Texas. TCOLE delegates that auth ority to 114 law enforcement agencies, colleges, and councils of government arou nd the state to serve the basic training needs in those regions. These training providers include law enforcement agencies, institutions of high er education, councils of government, and private entities. Continuing education is offered by 199 addi tional entities across the state that hold a training contract. This contract sets the expectations and reporting requirements necessary to uphold legislative and TCOLE standards. All legislatively required training must be taught by an academy or contract training provider. Any addition al elective training can be taught by individual departments. TCOLE has two Academy and Contract Evaluators (ACE) that co nduct onsite evaluations of all the training providers' facilities, records of training, and advisory board requirements . When all requirements and expe ctations are met, the Special Services Division executes the contracts. Special Services re views and refers complaints on exam sites to the Enforcement Division, if necessary.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. TRAINING CONSTRAINTS Many of the licensees report difficulty in completing training requirements due to geograph ic and budgetary constraints. In remote areas of the state, the nearest training provider ma y be hours away. Travel costs may be difficult to absorb by smaller budgeted law enforcement agencies, especially for mu ltiday courses. In addition, agencies may experience difficulties providing time for staff to be away from daily responsibilities. AGENCY STAFFING The Eighty-second Legislative Session, Regular Session, 2011, decreased the staff allocated for the Standards Development strategy from 6.0 FTE positions during fiscal year 2011 to 1. 6 positions during fiscal year 2012. As a result, agency staff developed a process to meet the Legislature's expectations on course development. New courses are developed by a committee of stakeholders formed from an intentionally divers e representation of the law en forcement profession across the state, including individuals from agencies of different ty pes and sizes and different geographic parts of the state, and subject matter experts for specific topics when necessary. Although this inclusion provides a broader range of perspectiv es when developing new courses, the agency states that the committee process takes a great deal of work and coordination for the sole curriculum coordina tor. The time dedicated to developing new courses has left several of the existing courses added during previous legislative sessions in serious need of review and updating. Some older, advanced-level courses have been surpassed by newer, ba sic-level courses. The agency should establish a regular review schedule for existing courses and potentially convert some of them to online versions that can be offered for free through TCOLE's online services. In fiscal year 2019, the agency received a $239,737 grant through the Office of the Governor, Criminal Justice Division, for 3.0 FTE positions. At that time, the funds that were available were through a federal Violence Against Women Act grant. These staff positions were used to update relevant cour se material and to develop a new training related to sexual assault investigations. During the Eighty-sixth Legislature, 201 9, the agency requested to co ntinue these positions through an exceptional item request, but the fu nding was not granted. In fiscal year 2020, the agency was awarded a $321,391 grant through the Governor's Justice Assistance Grant Progra m. TCOLE will seek to achieve the goal of reviewing and updating its course catalog by using contract services funded by grants and partnering with institutions of higher education that have the background and skill set to develop law enforcement curriculum. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM This program enables the agency to establish legislatively required courses and to oversee training standards for law enforcement personnel across the state. If discontinued, the staff dedicated to overseeing the curriculum, development, TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 88 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 and review of these courses would be eliminated, and the agen cy would rely entirely on volunteers to develop and update course materials. Additionally, law enforcement training is conducted primaril y through a network of training providers operating under the agency's delegated authority through contractual agreements . Unlike similar entities in some states, TCOLE does not operate its own statewide enforcement academy to deliver trai ning in Texas. Discontinuing the program would eliminate the legal operations of law enforcement ac ademies, academic providers, and traini ng contractors, and the implementation of any training mandates from the Legislature. Finally, the agency provides access to online training that is free to licensees to help meet their continuing education requirements through the licensees' accoun ts on the agency's website. Without th is service, many more licensees would have difficulty maintaining comp liance with their legislatively mandated tr aining, which would impact the Enforcement Division due to an increase in investigating cases regarding continuing education compliance. The Standards Development program generates a significant amou nt of revenue from Appropriated Receipts, constituting 21.0 percent of total agency revenue per year. ENFORCEMENT The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1701, Subchapter K Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Enforcement program investigates any administrative or criminal violations of the Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1701, or TCOLE rules by a licensee and takes the necessary disciplinary action. The Enfo rcement Division within the program receives jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional complain ts and reports of licensee a rrest or indictment, which are submitted on TCOLE form E-1. TCOLE rule requires the arre sting agency, the appointing agency, and the arrested or indicted licensee to submit the E-1 form. When miscondu ct has been determined, TCOLE resolves cases through an agreed order for disciplinary action rath er than utilizing the State Office of Ad ministrative Hearings (SOAH) process. TCOLE follows all E-1 cases through their court proceedings to final disposition and, depending on the outcome, takes the appropriate actions against the lice nsees. This process benefits the licensees and enables TCOLE staff to better understand the circumstances surrounding the case. The En forcement program's General Counsel collaborates with executive staff to direct and provide legal services regardin g agency daily functions. The Legal Division areas include administrative law, litigation, employment, personnel, agen cy policy, and compliance ma tters. Additionally, the Legal Division maintains the caseload and record s of administrative appeals, and drafts and reviews laws, rules, and regulations affecting agency operations and administra tion. When a Texas peace officer, jailer , or telecommunicator separates from an employing law enforcement agency, the agen cy must submit an F-5 Report of Sepa ration to TCOLE. The purpose of the F-5 Reports is to protect the public from individuals with disreputable employment histories, and the reports often are used by potential employing agencies to determine a law enforcement applicant's fitness for employment. The report characterizes the nature of separation as honorable, general, or dishonorable. The Enforcement Division conducts a comprehensive review of th e criminal history of applican ts for a licensing course at an academy that is not affiliated with a law enforcement agency. The Enforcemen t Division also maintains the agency's two website portals to receive sensitive law enforcement inform ation in compliance with all requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigations' (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Servic es Division, which are standards that are managed at the state level by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Aside from compliance with training requirements, TCOLE's enforcement efforts are dependent on complaints received. Some controls are in place through the FBI's Civil Rap Back program in the criminal history reporting system, which notifies the agency when the licensee's criminal history reco rds a change. The Eighty-first Le gislature, Regular Session, 2009, clarified that the agency is to act solely as the referring entity after receiving a licensee's timely appeal and should not be party to F-5 disputes or a contested case hearing at SOAH. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 89 According to the agency, the program's effectiveness coul d be improved by amending courses added to the Texas Occupations Code, Section 1701.253, with a mandate that trai ning requirements are met within a certain grace period \"by the end of the next full continuing education period following licensure.\" Figures 83, 84, and 85 show current and historical levels of funding and performance measure data for the Enforcement program.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS APPEALS PROCESS Laws regarding F-5 Reports, the categories of discharge included in those reports, and the appeals process for categories of discharge have evolved. The Eighty-first Legislature, Regular Session , 2009, amended statute to clarify that TCOLE is not a party to F-5 disputes or contested case hearings at SOAH, wi th TCOLE acting solely as the referring entity after receiving a licensee's timely appeal. Despite the change, TCOLE still ex pends significant staff time and resources related to the process, with 1.0 FTE position dedicated entirely to an admi nistrative appeals process. Additionally, the categories of discharge in F-5 Reports are used by hi ring agencies as a shortcut to determ ine whether an application should be considered. According to TCOLE, whether the separation docume nt status is honorable, dishonorable, or general, hiring agencies should not use it as a substitute for a complete and thorough ba ckground investigation. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE Issues or challenges for modernizing th e agency's legacy case management syst em could arise from not updating the information technology infrastructure, such as the potential loss of case history or undetected repeat violations by a licensee , and could cause redundant work due to the inability to search historical files. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCOLE, the discontinuance of the Enforcement role would enable the continued operation of licensees that violate TCOLE rules or laws or engage in misconduct. Discontinuing th is function could eliminate the agency's option to impose administrative penalties on licensees that commit violat ions. This option is critical to upholding the integrity of the law enforcement profession. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 91 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE The Texas Occupations Code, Sections 1701.162 and 1701.163 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The agency's Technical Assistance program includes the auditi ng of law enforcement agencies for hiring standards, the establishment of new agencies, and general help regardin g compliance with statutes and administrative rules. The establishment of a new agency begins with an initia l phone interview and request for application. When TCOLE receives the application and required documentation, it sche dules an onsite visit of the potential agency, during which TCOLE checks the viability of facilities, including evidence storage and communications. The goal is to ensure that the entity has the resources needed to be successful. TCOLE strives to complete the agency approval within 30 days of receipt of all required documents. TCOLE charges a $1,000 fee for the agency application process to offset staff time and travel costs. The program serves the population and needs of existing and prospective Texas law enfo rcement agencies. Since the program's implementation in 2006, the Fiel d Services Program has been well-received , and staff levels have increased from 4.0 FTE positions to 9.0 FTE positions. Currently, TCOLE field service agents have a goal to audit agen cies more often than the statutorily required five years; however, geography and the varying size of agencies make it difficult to meet this goal. TCOLE staff serve eight technical assistance regions. The number of new agenci es depends on the number of applications. Figures 86, 87, and 88 show current and historical le vels of funding and performance measure data for the Technical Assistance program.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. SIGNIFICANT FINDING The agency encounters difficulties with providing better customer service to larg er travel areas. During TCOLE's most recent Sunset evaluation, the agency was charged with auditing law enforcement agencies at least once every five years for compliance with hiring requirements and to ensure that poli cies and resources that any law enforcement agency needs to serve its community are in place. These audits are widely s een as a risk management tool by law enforcement agencies, particularly incoming chief administrators. Field service agents that conduct these au dits are directed to convey a customer service attitude and make every attempt to collaborate with law enforcement agencies towa rd voluntary compliance. If repeated deficiencies are noted, or if false information is pr ovided, then the matter is referred to the Enforcement Division. In addition to conducting routine audits , field service agents provide technical assistance to law en forcement agencies, STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 93 answering questions about statute and administrative rule, partic ularly as they pertain to trai ning requirements and hiring standards. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCOLE, this program prev ents violations by communicating with the agency's regulated population. TCOLE field service agents and Academy and Contract Evaluato rs, are charged with agency audits pursuant to the Texas Occupations Code, Section 1701.162. Special Services sta ff ensure the minimum standa rds for new law enforcement agencies, and Academy and Contract Evaluators monitor comp liance with TCOLE training provider agreements. Without funding for the program, the agency expect s an increase in Enforcement cases for vi olations that are not prevented through these efforts. TCOLE also holds an annual conference to provide legislativ ely mandated training. If the program were discontinued, the agency would not be able to hold the confer ence or collect any fee-associated revenue. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Government Code, Chapters 552 and 3105; the Texas Occ upations Code, Section 1701.161 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The agency's Indirect Administration pr ogram includes the following Divisions: Open Records, the flag program for the families of deceased officers, the Texas Peace Officers' Memorial Monument, Finance, and Government Relations. The Finance Division provides multiple operational func tions in areas such as Human Resources, Budgeting and Accounting, Financial Reporting, Purchasing and Contract Management, and Grant Administration. The Government Relations Division reviews and approves th e nominations for inclusion on the Texas Peace Officers' Memorial Monument, and collaborates wi th the Texas Peace Officers' Memorial Ceremony Committee to plan an annual ceremony at the Texas Capitol. Since its implementation, the standards of eligibility for the monument were changed to include deaths recognized by the Employees Retirement Syst em (ERS) in 2017. One factor that affects the population honored is that TCOLE does not always receive notification of officer deaths or application for a flag. According to TCOLE, some clarity on statutory eligibility for the Texas Peace Officers' Memorial Monu ment may provide assistance. The current law states \"killed in the line of duty,\" but not all situations are clear. In particular, deaths as a result of med ical issues from work as a law enforcemen t officer are difficult to determine. Because the separation report handled with the Enforcement Di vision is confidential by statute for public information purposes, TCOLE open records staff spends additional time whenever an employee termination report is requested, sending a request to the Office of the Attorney General for an opinion, and explaining to requestors that the document is confidential. According to the agency, it would be ideal to clarify in statute (the Te xas Occupations Code, Section 1701.454) whether information in the F-5 is public or not subject to the Public Information Act.

SOURCE : Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to TCOLE, the discontinuance of the Indirect Ad ministration program would result in a major deficit in government transparency and would elim inate human resources, accounting, fina ncial reporting, purchasing, travel reimbursement, accounts payable, accounts re ceivable, and state/federal grant functions. Discontinuing the program also would eliminate all funding for required agency meetings and would result in an increase in legal costs related to Public Information Act lawsuits . The flag program and the Texas Peace Officers' Memorial Monument are funded through gifts, grants, and donations. Both areas are statutory re sponsibilities, without which deceased officers would be honored only through mone tary compensation if dete rmined eligible by ERS. TEXAS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 96 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 97 TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The Texas Agriculture Code, Title 2 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The Texas Department of Agriculture's stated mission is to pa rtner with all Texans to make Texas the nation's leader in agriculture, grow its economy through interstate and international trade, em power rural communities, promote healthy lifestyles, and cultivate winning strategi es for agriculture-dependent businesses in Texas through exceptional service and the common threads of agriculture in daily life. The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) was established in 1907 to obtain and publish agricultural information and to promote advanced farming methods and practices as led by a statewide elected commissioner. Subsequently, the agency has gained additional regulatory and ma rketing responsibilities to oversee an d promote Texas agriculture. In 2011, additional responsibilities were added fo r rural communities and affairs when the ag ency absorbed the responsibilities of the former Texas Department of Rural Affairs and the Texas St ate Office of Rural Health. Th e agency currently operates 30 active programs. During the past five years, the following programs have ended or were transferred to other agencies: Zebra Chip Research Grants - This program funded resear ch to minimize the effects of the zebra chip disease on Texas potato production and proce ssing industries through research an d extension activities. This program was last appropriated funding for the 2016-17 biennium; Fuel Quality - This program tested motor fuel for nation al quality standards at locations where motor fuel was kept, transferred, sold, or offered for sale. The progra m was transferred to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation at the beginning of the 2020-21 biennium; and Feral Hog Abatement - This program fu nded feral hog abatement activities and the development of a viable toxicant to reduce the feral hog population. The program was transferred to the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension. The agency maintains a headquarters in Au stin and five regional offices in Dalla s, Houston, Lubbock, San Antonio, and San Juan. In addition, the agency mainta ins three laboratories, including a seed lab and a metrology lab in Giddings, and a pesticide lab in College Station, and fi ve livestock export pens located in Brow nsville, Del Rio, El Paso, Houston, and Laredo to inspect livestock and genetic material being transported across international borders. Twelve of the agency's programs are required to recover th e cost of their operations primarily through fee-generated revenues. Many of the programs are statutorily required to re cover costs; others either have fees set in statute or are authorized or required to assess fees according to rules establ ished by the agency. Except for activities specifically exempted by the General Appropriations Act (GAA), the Texas Agricultur e Code, Section 12.0144, requires TDA to adopt a schedule by rule for all fees set by the agency pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code so that the fees, when feasible, would offset the direct and indirect state costs of administering the agency 's regulatory activities. The Ei ghty-sixth Legislature, GAA, 2020-21 Biennium, Article VI, Texas Department of Agri culture, Rider 24, Appropriations Limited to Revenue Collections: Cost Recovery Programs, governs appropriations fo r all of the cost-recovery programs and requires generated revenues to cover direct program appropriations in TDA's bill pattern and appropriations made elsewhere in the GAA identified as being other direct and indirect costs. Figure 92 shows each cost-recovery program and the amounts collected and anticipated to be collected by prog ram. In addition, the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 12.0145, requires TDA to include, as part of each request for legislative appropriations submitted to the Legislative Bu dget Board (LBB), a proposed fee schedule that would recover all direct costs of administ ering each regulatory program, except a program exempted because increased cost recovery would be contrary to its purpose. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 98 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 FIGURE 92 TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ACTIVE COST-RECOVERY PROGRAMS, FISCAL YEARS 2017 TO 2021 (IN MILLIONS) 2017 2018 2019 2020 BUDGETED 2021 ESTIMATED PROGRAM Agricultural Pesticide Burn Program Less than Less than $0.1 Less than $0.1 Less than $0.1 Less than and Domestic $26.8 S OURCE : Texas Department of Agriculture. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS Not all costs are recovered by fee-generated revenue due to variations in statutory language governing the level of required fee assessments. Although the Texas Agri culture Code, Section 12.0144, requires TDA to adopt fees to offset the direct and indirect state costs of admi nistering the agency's regulatory activities, not all fees assessed by the agency are for regulatory purposes. For example, yardage fees for export pens are statutorily limited for direct program costs. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 99 TDA does not submit a proposed cost-recovery fee sche dule pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 12.0145, as part of each legislative appropriations requ est submitted to the LBB. In addition, the statute does not require a fee schedule for this purpose to include other direct and indirect costs for requested funding. The 2020-21 GAA directs TDA by rider to use any approp riations available in its bill pattern to provide a grant program to reduce wait times for agricultural insp ections of vehicles at ports of entry along the Texas- Mexico border, pursuant to House Bill 2155, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019. However, the agency reports that no General Revenue Funds appropriations or other fund ing for gifts, grants, or donations are available for implementing the legislation. TDA staff are limited in the operation of road station ch eckpoints intended to stop shipments of pest-infested plants into the state because the initiative is largely dependent on Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officer availability. DPS officers, who are authorized to stop trucks along surveilled routes, staff these road stations through a $129,000 Interagency Contract with TDA. However, according to TDA, funding is not the main issue. The Wine Marketing, Research, and Education program ha s not received funding from taxes on winery sales and other wine-related revenues due to statutory fundin g allocations and the Comptroller of Public Accounts' inability to distinguish between wine excise tax revenues derived from in-state payers and out-of-state payers. As a result of these complications, revenues from thes e sources have not been deposited to the credit of the General Revenue-Dedicated Fund established to fund the program. The number of Grain Warehouse Lice nses, Permits, and Registrations is sued by TDA has been decreasing while those issued by the U.S. Department of Agricult ure (USDA) has been increasi ng due to reduced market demand for storage facilities, an increase in state pr ogram fees, and greater efficiencies in the national transportation network, which en ables faster grain processing. TDA staff are not required to inform Animal Heal th Commission staff when animals inspected at TDA- operated export facilities are rejected for poor health. Statute does not require this reporting, and the agencies do not have a formal agreement to share information regarding rejected animals. As a result, the rejected animals may be released and remain in Texa s without further examination and testing. TDA reports that it has not been able to access revenu es collected pursuant to the Texas Transportation Code, Section 504.625, from GO TEXAN license plate sales si nce a prior version of the program was suspended and the account closed; however, revenues continue to be re ceived with TDA having no authorization to use these funds. TDA is not able to renew GO TEXAN memberships automa tically, and the result is that many businesses are not aware that their memberships have expired. These fa ilures to renew memberships, in turn, may result in decreased program revenue. Fewer warehouses are interested in contracting with TDA to serve as repositories for USDA commodities because providing this service has become less profitable due to increases in the direct delivery of USDA foods to distributors and in using USDA foods funding for the Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. This decrease in contracted warehouses could increase costs for the Child Nutrition-School Nutrition Program or require TDA to store and transport these commo dities in regional areas that are not serviced by contracted warehouses. TDA reports significant overlap between the regulating statutes regarding the licensing requirements for the certification of pesticide applications in the lawn and or namental and weed pest control categories in the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 76.102(a)(3), and the Texas Occupations Code, Section 1951.053, which results in some applicators needing two licenses. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 100 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Each egg processor licensed through the Egg Quality Regu lation program must pay an inspection fee of $0.40 per case and remit payment to TDA monthly. These fees are self-reported, which, according to the agency, is challenging to reconcile. The agency also reports that an online self-reporting system would increase efficiencies in reconciling reports and fees paid and would reduce the burden on small operations. In addition, the agency indicates that additional and updated equipment such as candlers and scales would improve the quality, scope, and range of inspections, thereby increasing consumer protection. The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 146.021, authorizes TDA to establish and collect reasonable fees for maintenance, feed, medical care, facility use, and othe r necessary expenses within the Livestock Export Pens program. This authorization includes fees for water, pe n space, labor for conducting export inspections, and feeding the livestock. During the 2018-19 biennium, program expenditures totaled $2.3 million in General Revenue Funds; however, TDA collected $0.5 million from the assessment of processing fees to recover costs associated with the processing of exported or imported animals, or about $1.7 million less than total program expenditures. The agency reports challenges with identifying unli censed commercial businesses to enforce regulatory requirements within the Structural Pest Control prog ram. Another challenge concerns overlap of licensing requirements between the Texas Agriculture Code, Ch apter 76, and the Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1951, which address mosquito control methods used by landscape maintenance and vegetation management applicators. This overlap has caused confusion within the regulated community regarding which license is required. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of stat utorily required service. Minimum level of service estimates for some activities are noted in the relevant individual program summaries. Figures 93 , 94, and 95 show current and historical levels of funding for TDA by method of finance and by program.

CHILD NUTRITION - SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAM The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 12.0025; U.S. Code of Feder al Regulations, Title 7, Parts 210, 215, 220, 235, 250, and 252 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The School Nutrition Program, established in calendar year 19 46, consists of several progra ms whose collective purpose is to safeguard the health and well-being of children by prov iding nutritional meals and snac ks each school day. These programs have the following criteria for participation: the National School Lunch Program provides lunches to more than 3.1 million Texas children daily during the school year in public and nonprofit private schools and residential childcar e institutions (RCCI). Lunches must meet federal nutrition guidelines and are re imbursable based on number of meals served; the School Breakfast Program provides breakfasts to mo re than 1.8 million Texas children daily during the school year in public, private nonprofit, or live-in pu blic or private nonprofit RCCIs. Breakfasts must meet federal nutrition guidelines and ar e reimbursable based on number of meals served. The Texas Education Code, Section 33.901 requires that a school participate in the School Breakfast Program if at least 10.0 percent of students are eligible to re ceive free or reduced-price meals; the Food Distribution Program for Child Nutrition Prog rams provides USDA-purchased food to nutrition programs in public schools, charter an d private schools, and RCCIs. All sch ools that participate in the National School Lunch Program are eligible to receive USDA commodities, which add value and offset the costs of providing meals. TDA contracts with warehouses to stor e these resources before they are shipped to school districts; the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides fresh fruit and vegetables to st udents in participating elementary schools during the school year; and the Special Milk Program provides cash assistance to nonprofit childcare institutions, summer camps, or nonprofit schools that do not participate in a federal ch ild nutritional meal service program to defray the cost of providing milk and to encourag e milk consumption by children. TDA provides administrative and program oversight for the Sc hool Nutrition Program, and a significant portion of these funds are transferred to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). State appropriations to TEA for these programs support public school districts and charter schools. TEA serves as the payment processor for those entities, and TDA provides a payment file containing information necessary for TEA to submit payment to public an d charter schools through the state's accounting system. TEA uses federal funding passe d through TDA to maintain and support the information technology system for the program. TDA processes claims for payment from eligible private schools and RCCIs. The agency maintains a memorandum of un derstanding with the Health and Hu man Services Commission to receive household eligibility information used by school district s to identify students' eligibility for program benefits. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 104 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The federal Healthy and Hunger-free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 , a reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act, provides funding for school meal and child nutrition programs, increa ses access to healthy food, and promotes student wellness. Figure 96 shows the percentage of the eligible population receivin g school lunches and breakfasts from fiscal years 2012 to 2019.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING According to TDA, fewer warehouses are interested in contra cting with the agency to serve as a repository for USDA commodities. The agency attributes this reduced interest to th e diminished profitability for providing this service stemming from two causes: an increase in the amount of USDA foods deli vered directly by distributors rather than processed through a vendor; and increased interest in using USDA foods fund ing for the U.S, Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. For example, a former warehouse contractor communicated to TDA that lower warehouse pricing influenced the decision not to renew its contract. The agency replaced that contractor with one whose prices were 55.0 percent greater. If the TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 106 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 agency is unable to secure contracted third parties to prov ide these storage services, TDA would be required to store and transport these commodities in regional areas that are not serviced by a contracted warehouse. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM HHFKA provides funding for school meal and child nutritio n programs, increases access to healthy food, and promotes student wellness. The USDA-FNS and TDA have entered into a federal-state agr eement to administer the nutrition and food distribution programs. If the program were discon tinued at TDA, USDA could award the funding to TEA. CHILD NUTRITION - COMMUNITY NUTRITION PROGRAM The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 12.0025; the U.S. Code of F ederal Regulations, Title 7, Parts 225, 226, 235, 240, 247, 248 .4, 248.9, 250, and 251 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Community Nutrition Program includes the following prog rams that collectively provide funding reimbursement for meals and snacks to qualifying individuals: the Child and Adult Care Food Program provides meals to childcare centers, adult da y-care centers, day-care homes, and afterschool at-risk programs. The total nu mber of meals provided through this program has increased 138.0 percent from fiscal years 2011 to 2019 (see Figure 100 ); the Summer Feeding Programs provide access to no-cost meals to students age 18 or younger during summer months when schools are not in session. Eligible organi zations include schools, food banks, private nonprofit organizations, religious networks , and local government entities; the Farmers Market Nutrition Program provides assistance to qualified pa rticipants to buy fresh fruits and vegetables using program vouchers from pa rticipating farmers' market associations; the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Pr ogram assists low-income seniors, age 60 and older, to buy fresh fruits and vegetables using program vouchers from participating farmers' market associations; the Emergency Food Assistance Program distributes a po rtion of excess agricultural abundance to low-income people and households. These USDA commodities are dist ributed to emergency feeding organizations such as food pantries, soup kitchens, and housing authorities; the Commodity Supplemental Food Program provides food commodities that are supplied for home consumption or distributed through food banks to low-income seniors, age 60 and older; and the Food Assistance Disaster Relief program makes USDA foods available to disaster relief organizations for mass feeding or household distribution. These resour ces are available upon a disaster declaration.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Elimination of this program would result in a significant loss of Federal Funds provided to the state for community nutrition. Its constituent programs suppor t the expansion of agricultural markets, provide nutrition safety-net programs for underserved or underemployed citizens, and sustain the stat e's food banks. Elimination would affect the state's economy negatively, reduce the state's readiness to respond to crisis an d natural disasters, remove a safety net for underserved citize ns, and eliminate the 178,000 lunches served daily in Texas childc are centers. According to the agency, the economic impact to Texas would be a decrease of more than $7.0 billion. INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TRADE The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapters 12 and 46; the federal Sma ll Business Act as amended by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 109 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The International and Domestic Trade pr ogram supports Texas agriculture throug h activities, such as the GO TEXAN program, to promote Texas agriculture an d increase awareness of Texas-made an d Texas-raised products, culture, and communities. The GO TEXAN program is an optional certification progra m for producers of Texas agriculture or products that members use to label their products as Texas-made. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $1.0 million per fiscal year in cost recovery generated from this program. These re venues came primarily from two sources: $0.2 million from the processing of GO TEXAN certifications and renewals, an d $0.4 million from revenues generated from conference, seminar, training registration fees, and GO TEXAN license plate revenue. Since its inception in 1999, the GO TE XAN program operates as a broad-based, strategic marketing campaign that promotes all Texas agricultural products with one trademark domestically and in ternationally. The program provides Texas producers with opportunities for joint advertising, event particip ation and partnerships with retailers. In fiscal year 2011, marketing activities changed from receiving appropriated Ge neral Revenue Funds to a cost-recovery model that requires the agency to collect fees to recover the costs of administ ering the program. Currently, th e program authorizes online applications and payments, which the agency reports has incr eased membership due to an easier application process and has streamlined the agency's review process, result ing in approvals requiring days instead of months. A GO TEXAN member survey conducted by the agency in fisc al year 2020 identified the following program benefits: among survey respondents, 61.0 percen t said that their sales increased duri ng the last year, and 36.0 percent attributed at least a portion of the in crease to their GO TEXAN membership; based on sales data reported by survey respondents, $11. 1 million in direct sales increases were attributable to the GO TEXAN program; estimated gross sales for all GO TEXAN members totaled $671.0 million in the past fiscal year; the estimated economic impact totaled $1.1 billion; among respondents, 72.0 percent id entified the use of the GO TEXAN mark as the top program feature; second was participation in trade shows and festiv als, followed by GO TEXAN social media mentions, participation in the State Fair GO TEXAN Pavili on, and inclusion on the GO TEXAN website; and respondents reported the top benefits of GO TEXAN me mbership as increased brand awareness and improved marketing opportunities.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING According to the agency, one challenge in operating the pr ogram is the inability to renew memberships automatically, which has led to many businesses believing they are enrolle d in the GO TEXAN program when they have not renewed for the year. Many businesses are not aware that their membersh ip had expired when contacted by the agency. TDA also has reported that cost-recovery funding through assessing fees an d private industry have not been able to provide TDA with the resources necessary to expand global market opportunit ies for Texas agriculture and bring business to rural Texas. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing this program would eliminat e the primary means by which state funding is used to market domestically and internationally the products that are grown, produced, pr ocessed, or manufactured in Texas. In addition, the GO TEXAN brand, which consumers have come to associate with Texas producers' goods for 21 years, would be retired. RURAL HEALTH The Texas Government Code, Chapter 487; the federal Medicare Ru ral Hospital Flexibility Grant; the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 , Section 4201; the Small Hospital Improvement Grant, the U.S. So cial Security Act, Section 1820(g )(3); the Social Security Act, Section 711, State Office of Rural Health Funding; the U.S. Cod e, Title 42, Section 912, as amended, Public Law 108-173 Mission Centrality - Weak; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION TDA's State Office of Rural Health (SOR H) manages the Rural Health program. This program works with local healthcare providers, rural health facilities including clinics and hospit als, and multiple stakeholders to support access to quality healthcare for rural Texans. The program administers programs and technical assistance to approximately 150 rural hospitals, recruits and retains trained medical professionals to rural areas, and awards grants to rural health facilities to acquire, construct, or improve facili ties, equipment, or real property. The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recognizes TDA as the designated state agency for these responsibilities and allocates Federal Funds to TDA to co ver program expenses at a 3: 1 match in state funding. SORH originated as the Office of Rural Community Affairs (O RCA), which was established in fiscal year 2001 to assist rural communities by administering rural health programs, am ong other activities. The Sevent y-seventh Legislature, 2001, established ORCA by consolidating the Center for Rural Heal th Initiatives programs, transferred from the former Texas Department of Health, with the Community Development Bl ock Grant (CDBG) program, transferred from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs. The Legislat ure directed ORCA to coordinate more closely with TDA in 2007 by requiring cross-training of ORCA employees with TDA employees on programs administered by each agency TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 112 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 that relate to rural communities. ORCA's name changed to the Texas Department of Rural Affairs (TDRA) in 2009, and subsequently the program was transferred to TDA in 2011. The newly established Office of Rural Affairs within TDA oversees the CDBG Program, SORH, the Texas Agri cultural Finance Authority, and other programs. The agency maintains a list of working rural hospitals to ca rry out its program responsibili ties. SORH maintains only an informal list of rural hospital closures, because it does not ha ve statutory authority to collect that information. Accordingly , hospitals facing closure are not required to report that inform ation to the agency. SORH's informal list does not identify when certain facilities close and subseque ntly reopen under different ownership. The Rural Health program consists of several activities. The State Office of Rural Health Grant Program uses Federal Funds with matching state fund ing to identify and address issues that affect rural hospitals and healthcare providers by providing technical assistance, training opportunities, and information to rural health stakeholders. The Rural Health Facility Capital Improvement Program provides grants of up to $75,000 to rural public and nonprofit hospitals for construction, capital impr ovements, or capital equipment purchase s. Funding for the program comes from the Permanent Fund for Rural Health Facility Capital Improvem ent, which utilizes interest from an endowment of $50.0 million resulting from state's tobacco settlements. The Small Rural Hospital Improvement Prog ram provides funding of approximately $10,000 to each rural hospital with 49 or fewer beds. Services include funding for equipment or training; aiding hospitals in joining or becoming accountable care organizations or developing shared savings programs; and funding for health information technology, equipment, or training to comply with meaningful-use electronic health re cord provisions, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems standard s, payment bundling, or care transitions. The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program provides ince ntives to rural health providers to achieve Critical Access Hospital (CAH) status. To qualify as a CAH, the facility must be a limited-service hospital that has 25 beds or fewer, is located outside of a metropolitan statistical area, and is lo cated 35 or more miles from another hospital. For CAHs, the program provides support for strategic planning, training an d development, and quality improvement and data reporting services. These activities are intended to encourage the develo pment of a statewide rural health plan, development of rural health networks associated with CAH facilities, integratio n and strengthening of rural emergency medical systems, and improvement in the quality of healthcare services for rural populations. The Rural Communities Health Care In vestment Program (RCHIP) helps rural communities in medically underserved areas attract and retain healthcare professionals by providing an incentive of up to $10,000 to any eligible non-physician healthcare professional that agrees to practice there for one year. The St. David's Foundation Loan Repayment Program is a gr ant funded by the foundation and administered by SORH. This program previously was administered by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB); however, program administration transferred to TDA in January 2018, along with funding from THECB to cover the cost of 1.0 full-time-equivalent (FTE) support position . This grant funding helps eligible heal thcare facilities in the foundation's Central Texas service area attract and retain healthcare professi onals by providing loan repaymen t assistance to participants Figures 107 and 108 show current and historical levels of fund ing for this program by method of finance.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing this program would eliminat e state funding appropriated to the agen cy for these services. According to the National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health, while a ll 50 states have rural health offices, they vary in size, organization, and location. Some states house these programs within state health departments, universities, or nonprofit organizations. If this program were di scontinued at TDA, another managing en tity could receive federal funding to establish an office or program in its place. AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDE REGULATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 76; the Federal Insecticide , Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Agricultural Pesticide Regulation prog ram provides regulatory oversight of pest icide laws, certification of applicators, registration of pesticides, and protection and education of pesticide workers and handlers. This oversight includes investigation of complaints and provides for labo ratory analysis of pesticide residue samples. USDA designated TDA as the State Lead Agency for Pestic ide Regulation in 1976. The program contains three main components: Pesticide Evaluation and Regi stration involves the registration of persons and entities wishing to market, distribute, or apply a pesticide product in the state. The Agricultural Pesticide Certification and Compliance Program regulates the licensing of pesticide applicators and provides continuing education courses fo r applicator recertification. Figure 110 shows the number of inspections conducted from fisc al years 2016 to 2021. The program's third component is the Pesticide Laboratory, which provides pesticide residue an alysis to support the agency's enforcement actions involving the misuse of pesticide. Certification and compliance is pe rformed mostly on agricultural , landscape maintenance, and vegetation management pest control services. TDA anticipate s issuing 16,850 licenses and certificates to pesticide applicators and registering 9,750 pesticides each year of the 2020-21 biennium.

SOURCE : Texas Department of Agriculture. The Agricultural Pesticide Regulation program is required to assess and collect fees in an amount necessary to recover the costs of administering and enforcing the program. For th e 2020-21 biennium, application and renewal fees for an agricultural pesticide applicators range from $60 to $240 depend ing on the applicator type. Pesticide registration fees are $600 per produce every two years. The most recent adjustment to these rates occurred in fisc al year 2016. These fees are authorized pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 12. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $8.2 million in cost recovery generated from this program. The three-year average collections from fiscal years 2017 to 2019 from the two primary sources of program revenue are: $2.7 million from the processing of lice nse applications and license renewals; and $4.8 million from the annual registra tion and renewal of pesticide brands. Both the Agricultural Pesticide Regulation program and the St ructural Pest Control Service program follow regulations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticid e Act and the Texas Occupa tions Code, Chapter 1951.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING TDA identified significant overlap between the regulating statutes concerning lice nsing requirements for the certification of pesticide applications in the lawn and ornamental and weed pest control categories. Requirements in the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 76.102(a)(3), and the Texas Occupa tions Code, Section 1951.053, overlap, which results in some applicators requiring two licenses to conduct these applications. Strategic Fiscal Review analysis concurs that statutory changes would improve program implementation an d would not have a negative fiscal effect. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Federal law requires states to operate regulatory programs to pr otect the public against misuse of pesticides. If this program were discontinued, then the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would assume enfo rcement and licensing of all pesticide applicators and use, and EPA would administer distri bution of pesticides. In addi tion, discontinuing the program would decrease the state's ability to request special pesticide registrations for emergency pest problems and for local needs. WEIGHTS, MEASURES, AND METROLOGY The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 13 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Weights, Measures, and Metrology pr ogram inspects weighing and measuring devices to ensure performance within acceptable tolerances, inspects packaging to enforce net cont ent and labeling regulations, and measures mass and volume standards supported by national and international standards. TDA inspects various devices ranging from bulk meters used at airports for fueling airplanes to scales at grocery stores. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) meters used to fill small tanks for backyard grills and those used to fill storage tanks at businesses or homes also are inspected. In addition, the agency weighs or measures packaging ranging from cereal boxes to packaged polyethylene sheeting to determine whether the cont ents meet or exceed the quantity stated on the label. Figure 114 shows the number of weights and measure device inspections conducted each fiscal year. A significant decrease in the number of inspections from the 2016-17 to 2018-19 biennium is attributed to enactment of House Bill 2174, Eighty- fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, which privatized certai n inspection and registration ac tivities previously performed by TDA. The agency also monitors whether the prices displa yed on the shelf for consumer products are the same prices consumers pay at the checkout counter.

The program licenses 30,153 establishmen ts that use commercial weighing and measuring devices, 205 companies that install, service, or calibrate weighing or measuring devices in commercial use, and 1,584 registered technicians who place devices into service or remove out-of-order tags issued by TDA and perform inspections of LPG meters and ranch scales. All field standard calibrations for weighing and measuring de vices in Texas must be performed annually by a recognized laboratory to ensure accuracy recognition for interstate comme rce. The TDA metrology laborato ry in Giddings is traceable to the International System of Units through the National In stitute of Standards and Technology by compliance to the ISO 17025 standard. The Texas Agriculture Code, Sections 13 .115 and 13.1151, authorize the agency to assess fees for inspections and device registration . The program is funded through co st-recovery General Revenue Funds. For the 2020-21 biennium, the Weights and Measures program was merged with the Metrology program to establish the Weights, Measures, and Metrology progra m. The combined program was funded through cost-recovery General Revenue Funds, which requires the collection of fees to recover the co sts of administering and enforc ing the program. Historically, the Metrology program had not generated sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs; however, the Weights and Measures program typically generated more than it required. To address this issu e, the Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, combined the revenues of the two programs so that the genera ted amount would be sufficient to cover the costs of the new Weights, Measures, and Metrology program without increasing fees. Senate Bill 2119, Eighty-Sixth Legislat ure, 2019, transferred the inspection , registration, and complaint process responsibilities for fuel-metering devices and regulations regarding the sale, delive ry, quality, and testing of motor fuel from TDA to the Texas Department of Licensing and Re gulation (TDLR). As a result, General Revenue Funds appropriations for the program were decrease d by $6.1 million and 35.9 FTE positions. The Weights, Measures, and Metrology program cost-recovery historical data combines amounts from the independent Weights and Measure and Metrology programs. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $13.0 million in cost recovery generated from these programs. The following three-ye ar average collections from fiscal years 2017 to 2019 from each of the sources of program revenues are: - 40,000 80,000 120,000 160,000 200,000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (1) 2021 (1)STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 119 $12.3 million from inspection fees; $0.6 million from the assessment of administrative pena lties pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 13.007, which requires TDA to deposit all civil penalt y revenue collected to the General Revenue Fund and provides for the agency's recovery of reasonable expe nses incurred in obtaining injunctive relief and civil penalties; $0.1 million from weight and measure device inspector license fees; and $0.1 million in miscellaneous revenue, fees, and third-party reimbursements. TDA estimates it will receive $6.9 million in fee revenue for fi scal year 2020 and $6.3 mill ion for fiscal year 2021. The decrease is due to the transfer of the re gulation of motor fuel metering and qualit y from TDA to TDLR pursuant to Senate Bill 2119.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program may diminish consumer protection because the accura cy of weights and measuring devices used in commercial transactions would not be tested to me et national and international standards. Consumers may be exploited in commercial transactions, such as grocery store tr ansactions, and may not receive what they pay for if devices are not tested regularly for accuracy and compliance. The de mand for consumer protection may require that the duties and responsibilities of the program are transferred to another agency. PLANT HEALTH The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapters 19, 61, 62, 64, 71 to 74, and 80; the U.S. Plant Protection Act, enacted through the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 7, Parts 300 to 399; Federal Seed Act, the U.S. Code, Title 7, Sections 1151 to 1611 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Plant Health program regulates the licensing of nurseries and florists, provides phytosanitary inspection, ensures that consumers receive the quality and type of seed for which th ey pay, and makes available a quality source of seeds and vegetative propagative materials. The Plant Health program was implemented in 1919 and is one of the oldest in the agency. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 121 The program works in partnership with USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv ice - Plant Protection and Quarantine and with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. It is administered through TDA's headquarters in Austin and five regional offices. Regional field staff are assigned to specific geographic areas and are equipped to operate remotely. The program enforces quarantine restrictions that prevent the spread of destructive pests and plant diseases that affect nursery and floral products to other areas of Texas. For exampl e, the agency is coordinating with USDA to prevent damage to citrus trees by eradicating the Mexican fruit fly in certain quaranti ned counties in South Texas. The total cost for this multi-year work is approximately $4.6 million, of which TDA is required to contribute $0.1 million for hiring trappers and to sterilize the Mexican fruit fly population. The program also administers road stations at strategic locati ons along the international and interstate borders to conduct inspections, scheduled for periods of 72 hours, which are intend ed to stop shipments of pest-infested plants from entering the state. Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officers ar e contracted with TDA to staff these road stations and have the authority to stop trucks along surveilled routes. For fisc al year 2019, TDA anticipated recording 9,100 staff hours to inspect plant shipments for this program. The Plant Health program is funded with General Revenue Fu nds and Federal Funds granted from the USDA. In addition to $0.1 million necessary to match Federal Funds provided fo r the eradication of the Mexican fruit fly, General Revenue Funds appropriations require the collection of fees to recove r the costs of administering an d enforcing the program. Any individual or business that grows or distributes plant material in the state is required to be licensed. TDA provides five types of licenses depending primarily on the location and size of the business or seller. As of June 2020, TDA licensed 16,307 entities for these purposes. The agency charges fees of varying amount s for initial certification and annual rene wal of florists, nurseries, gardens, and other businesses that sell a florist or nurs ery product. In addition, persons engage d in the development, maintenance, or production of seeds or plants for which standards of genetic pu rity and identify have been established, or persons selling or otherwise distributing for sale vegetable seed for plan ting purposes, also require certification by the agency. The agency also assesses fees for inspections that are requir ed once every three years pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 71.044, for all entities that sell, lease, or offe r for sale or lease a nursery or florist item to check for the presence of plants that are diseased or pest-infected. Approximately 85.0 pe rcent of program revenues come from inspection fees each year, with total annu al collections from all sources of revenue averaging $5.1 million from fiscal years 2017 to 2019. Figures 118 and 119 show current and historical levels of funding fo r the Plant Health program by method of finance.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS REDUCE WAIT TIMES FOR AGRICULTURAL INSPECTIONS The 2020-21 GAA directs TDA by rider to use any appropriations available in its bill pattern to provide a grant program to reduce wait times for agricultural inspections of vehicles at ports of entry along the Texas-Mexico border, pursuant to House Bill 2155, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019. Howeve r, the agency reports that no General Revenue Funds appropriations or other funding for gifts, grants, or donations, are available in it s budget for implementing the legislation. The legislation provides this authority until Septem ber 1, 2021, unless the Legislature reauthorizes it. To address this issue, the Legislature could consider continuing the same authority in statute as of September 1, 2021, and providing funding to authorize TDA to awar d a grant to reduce wait times for agri cultural inspections of vehicles along the border. STAFFING CHECKPOINTS The use of road station checkpoints to intercept shipments of pe st-infested plants into the state is limited due to a cap on how much time agency staff can dedicate to this work. TDA do es not have commissioned officers authorized to stop trucks along surveilled routes; therefore, the agency relies on DPS to fulfill these responsibilities through a $129,000 Interagency Contract. In effect, this contract establishes an artificial ca p on how much time agency staff can dedicate to this work because it is dependent on DPS officers' availability. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM This program is the primary means by which the state protects the plant industry against plant and disease infestations. Discontinuing this program would signific antly reduce enforcement of the Texas Ag riculture Code provisions concerning oversight of seed health and quality and the regulation of pl ant breeders and would delegate qu arantine responsibilities to local governments and local agricultural markets. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 124 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1951; the Federal Insectici de, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Structural Pest Control program provides for the licensing and regulation of all businesses and persons engaged in the business of structural pest control by pe rforming inspections to ensure compliance with state and federal pesticide laws and regulations, investigating complaints, and monitoring the use of pesticides. An advisory committee, whose membership is defined in the Texas Occupations Code, Section 1951.101, oversees the program. The committee members include pe sticide applicators, staff of various state agencies and public education institutions, and public representatives, all appointed by the TDA commissioner. The program's responsibilities include initial certification, licensing, and recert ification of pesticide applic ators, approval and review of recertification courses, and inspections of licensed businesses. In fiscal year 2018, TDA reported 35,738 individuals or businesses regulated through this program. The program originated as the independen t Texas Structural Pest Control Board in 1971 to ensure that individuals that perform pest control activities in buildings, homes, and other structures are qualified and comp etent, and that they adhere to established professional standards. The board's obligations, positions, and duties were transferred to TDA in 2007 in response to concerns about ongoin g board management and leadership. TDA inspects each licensed pest control business within its firs t year of operation and at least every four years subsequently. Independent school districts also are inspected at least every five years. Noncommercial entiti es are inspected in response to a complaint. The Structural Pest Control program is required to collect f ees to recover its costs of administration and enforcement. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $4.1 million in revenue generated annually from this program. This revenue is almost entirely from license applications and license renewals with $0.1 million in additional revenue from administrative penalties. License fees vary from $12 to $240 depending on whether the applicant is a dealer, private applicator, noncommercial political applicator, noncommercial applicator, or commercial a pplicator. License fees for an original and renewal business license are $300, and examination fees are $64 per exam in each category. The seven license categories include pest control, termite and wood-destroying insect control, lawn and orna mental, weed control, struct ural fumigation, commodity fumigation, and wood preservation. Figures 121 and 122 show current and historical levels of funding for the Structural Pe st Control program by method of finance.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The agency has identified challenges with identifying unlicensed commercial busine sses to enforce regulatory requirements. Another challenge concerns overlap of licensing requirements between the Texa s Agriculture Code, Chapter 76, and the Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1951, regarding mosquito control methods used by landscape maintenance and vegetation management applicators. This overlap has caused confusion within the regulated community regarding which license is required. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would increase homeowner risk of unlicensed individuals without background checks performing pesticide applications at residences. In addition , industry standards that are supported through the licensing process would be diminished. This diminished support would result in a loss of consumer protection. PRODUCE SAFETY The Texas Agriculture Code, Sections 12.020 and 91.009; the fed eral Food Safety Modernization Act, U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Standards for Growing, Harvesting, Packing, an d Holding of Produce, Produce Safety Rule Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Produce Safety program operates through the Texas Office of Produce Safety (TOPS). Its purpose is to implement the federal Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) in partne rship with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FSMA, enacted in 2011, chan ges food safety regulations from a system focused on responding to contamination to one focused on prevention, to encourage the safest producti on of fresh produce and to promote compliance with FDA's Standards for Growing Harvesting Packin g and Holding of Produce Safety Rule, commonly known as the Produce Safety Rule. PRODUCE SAFETY RULE Enactment of the FSMA established science-based minimum st andards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of fruits and vegetables for human consumption. The FSMA includes the Produce Safety Rule, which contains six components: biological soil amendments; domesticated and wild animals; worker training and health/hygiene; equipment, tools, and buildings; agricultural water an d testing; and specific protocols for gr owers of sprouts. In addition, the law includes enforcement actions designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with preventive safety standards. House Bill 3227, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, designated TDA as the state's lead agency for administration, implementation, enforc ement, training, and education relate d to the Produce Safety Rule. The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) also has FSMA regulatory obligations. TDA's regulatory responsibilities cover produce safety inspections at the farm level, and DSHS's responsibilities cover food safety for all produce that is processed or has added value. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 127 The Produce Safety Rule has a staggered compliance schedule , with the largest and most profitable farms required to comply first. Criteria broaden each year to include more farms, with the smallest required to comply by 2024. TDA estimates that approximately 1,00 0 farmers are growing produce covered by the Produce Safety Rule. TEXAS OFFICE OF PRODUCE SAFETY The Texas Office of Produce Safety (TOPS) was established in fiscal year 2016 following application for and reception of a FDA grant. Its responsibilities include providing education and traini ng to producers, establishing an inventory of farms that are or will be subject to the FSMA, and conduc ting farm inspections on fruits and vegetables. TOPS initially was allocated 6.4 FTE positi ons with $0.2 million in Federal Funds, but that number has increased to 10.3 FTE positions with $2.2 million in Federal Funds for the 2020-21 biennium in response to the office's growing responsibilities. Five Produce Safety Fiel d Outreach Specialists are assigned to regions of the state to promote on-farm outreach and training on the Produce Safe ty Rule, which is intended to prepare farms for eventual Produce Safety Rule compliance. The office coordinates with other TDA programs in performing the regulatory aspects of the FSMA. To reduce the number of agency visits at each farm, TDA perfor ms farm inspections to assess FSMA compliance in conjunction with other agency programs that require on-site assessment. As implementation of the Produce Safety Rule continues and the staggered compliance schedule broadens the number of farms subject to the rule through fiscal year 2024, TOPS gradually will change its focus from education and outreach targeting producers and consumers to a more regulatory and enforcement role. Figures 124 and 125 show current and historical levels of funding for the Produce Safety program by method of finance.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing this program would result in TDA being unable to fulfill its statutory responsibilities as the lead agency for FSMA implementation. The Legislature could designate these obli gations to another state agency for the state to continue receiving the associated Federal Funds through the FDA grant. DS HS is the other agency that has existing responsibilities for FSMA implementation. HEMP The Texas Agriculture Code, Subtitle F; the federal Agricultura l Improvement Act of 2014 and 2018 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Hemp program monitors and regulates the cultivation, pr oduction, and transportation of industrial hemp in Texas and approves hemp varieties to be grown. The federal Ag riculture Improvement Act of 2018 legalized the commercial production of hemp. House Bill 1325, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, established the state program. Pursuant to the enacted legislation, TDA monitors and regulates all aspects of hemp production. This regulation includes certifying the seeds and plants grown by farmers, administerin g licenses for growing and handling hemp and hemp products commercially, registering independent testing laboratories or institutions of higher education to test hemp products to ensure that they do not exceed statutorily required tetrah ydrocannabinol levels, and certif ying the transportation and shipping of hemp. The agency was approp riated 9.2 FTE positions each fiscal ye ar to administer the program for the 2020-21 biennium. The Hemp program is required to collect fees to recover its costs of administration and en forcement. These revenues are obtained through licensure, lot crop permits, and facility and laboratory regi stration and may be modified by the agency to meet program costs. Fees collected by this program are deposited into the General Revenue-Dedicated Funds Account No. 5178, State Hemp Production. For the 2020-21 biennium, the agency estimates it will receive approximately $750,000 in fee revenue from cost-recovery sources, which is less than the $1.3 million appropriated for the program. In STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 129 addition, the agency is authorized to collect penalties asse ssed from state law violations . The program began accepting licensing applications in March 2020. Shippers of hemp in Texas are required to obtain a shipping certificate from TDA if the hemp was produced in Texas or to carry specific documentation if the hemp was produced el sewhere. An individual who sh ips hemp without the proper certification or documents may be charged with a misdemeano r and assessed civil penalties. These civil penalties are deposited to the Hemp Transportation Account, which the agency administers for the enforcement of hemp shipping requirements. This administration includes transferring funds from this account to the Department of Public Safety for the inspection of vehicles transpor ting hemp and for laboratory testing of hemp taken from vehicles. As of June 2020, TDA has received 872 applications to grow hemp in Texas. Fees for most of these licenses, license renewals, and registrations are $100, and lab registration fees are $250. Figures 126 and 127 show current and historical levels of fundin g for the Hemp program by method of finance.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing th is program would remove the oversight of hemp production in Texas, which involves a product subject to strict guidelines in state and fede ral law. It also would result in a loss in state revenue obtai ned through fees collected from application and license fees. State appropriations an d FTE positions would be decreased to coincide with the loss of state revenue. RURAL COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The Texas Government Code, Chapter 487; the Texas Agriculture C ode, Chapters 12, 44, and 58; the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 24, Sections 570.480 to 570.497; Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (the U.S. Code, Title 42, Section 5301, et seq,) Mission Centrality - Weak; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Rural Community and Economic Develo pment program is a collection of activi ties designed to encourage economic development. The program was established in 1983 and has thr ee main components. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is intended to develop viable communities by providing suitable housing and living environments and expanding economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons. An eligible city must have a population of less than 50,000, an eligible county's nonmetropolitan population must be less than 200,000, and neither may be eligible to receive funding directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. CDBG provides funding for various purposes, including public facili ties and infrastruc ture improvements, downtown revitalization projects, planning and capacity building initiatives, an d for colonia communities, which are rural communities located within 150 miles of the international border that meet certain criteria of economic distress. According to the agency, it uses state funding appr opriated to the program to increase th e number of communities that receive a planning grant or to suppl ement existing projects. The Texas Economic Development Fund (TEDF) was established in fiscal year 2013 and wa s funded with $46.4 million in Federal Funds during the subsequent three years pursuant to the State Small Business Credit Initiative Act of 2010. The TEDF receives all interest, income, and re venue of the activities of the fund, which support venture capital initiatives and investments to promote economic developmen t, with a focus on projects in rural Te xas. Pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 12.0273, grant recipients may receive a maximu m of $1.0 million, and each recipient must provide 25.0 percent matching funds. House Bill 2004 , Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Sessi on, 2017, required TDA to maintain a minimum balance in the TEDF of $2.2 million. Figure 128 shows the revenues, expenditures, and ending balances of the fund from fiscal years 2013 to 2019.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing this program would remove the alternat ive financing options for agricultural operations provided through TAFA that these producers ma y not be able to get through traditional lending. The discontinuation of state matching funds to meet match requ irements for the CDBG would result in the loss of $60.0 million in federal grants to rural communities. These communi ties would be required to find other sources of funding for projects currently funded through this block grant. EGG QUALITY REGULATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 132 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Egg Quality Regulation program enfo rces standards of egg quality by lice nsing egg packers, wholesalers, and distributors. The program works to ensure that eggs sold to Texas consumers meet quality standards for the proper size and grade of eggs being marketed. Establ ished in fiscal year 1957, the program processes license applications for egg packers, wholesalers, processors , brokers, and distributors to buy and sell eggs in Texas for the purpose of resale; collects fee revenue; conducts routine inspections to verify compliance; and processes violat ions for administrative penalties. The TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 134 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 program historically has been allocated a pproximately 6.5 FTE positions each fiscal year. As of June 2020, 456 entities held egg certification licenses in the state. Inspectors forward findings of noncompliance to the prog ram division for review, and violations are sent to the enforcement division for possible administrative penalt ies. TDA inspectors conduct follow-up inspections when noncompliance is found. Penalties, stop sales, and licens e revocation may result due to noncompliance and repeat violations. The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 132.004, requir es egg quality standards for in spection and regulation in Texas be at least equal to those adopted by the USDA and FDA. In fiscal year 2019, th e agency conducted 2,093 egg packer, dealer, wholesaler, and retailer inspections. Figure 132 shows the top 10 states in egg production, of which Texas ranks fifth according to the USDA. FIGURE 132 TOP 10 STATES IN EGG PRODUCTION CALENDAR YEAR 2019 SOURCE : U.S. Department of Agriculture ; National Agriculture Statisti cs Service. Egg production in Texas does not meet total market demand, which requires the state to im port eggs from out-of-state packers. Inspectors are not able to insp ect eggs from out-of-state packers and mu st instead inspect nonregistered retail locations. TDA staff perform only record audits at USDA -inspected packers to preven t duplication of services. The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has regulato ry oversight of all food-handling establishments, including those where TDA conducts egg inspections. TDA has entere d into a memorandum of understanding with DSHS that specifies each agency's inspecti on responsibilities to avoid duplication of effo rts. The two agencies have agreed that DSHS will enforce temperature requirements at retail establishm ents, and TDA will enforce temperature requirements at egg packer and egg distributor establishments. The Egg Quality Regulation program is required to collect fe es to recover its costs of administration and enforcement. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $1.1 million annually in cost recovery generated from this program. Program revenues came from three sources. The three-year av erage collections from fiscal years 2017 to 2019 from each of these sources are: $0.2 million from the processing of li cense applications and license renewals; 1. IOWA 17,083.8 2.

All penalty reve nue is deposited to the General Revenue Fund and cannot be utilized by the agency. For the 2020-21 biennium, an egg license fee for dealers and wholesalers ranges from $100 to $2,700 depending on average estimated weekly volume (Class 1=less than 30 cases to Class 12=more than 10,000 cases). The license fee for a processor ranges from $100 to $450 based on estimated volume (Class 1=less than 250 cases per week to Class 4=more than 1,500 cases). Brokers pay a flat $500 license fee. All licenses are valid for on e year. Each processor licensed through the program must pay an inspection fee of $0.40 per case and remit payment to the agency monthly.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Each processor licensed through the progra m must pay an inspection fee of $0.40 pe r case and remit payment to the agency monthly. These fees are self-reported and are challenging to re concile, according to the agency . The agency states that an online self-reporting system for processors would increase effi ciencies in reconciling reports and fees paid while reducing the burden on small operations. The agency also indicates that additional and updated equipment, such as candlers and scales, would improve the quality, scope, and range of insp ections, thereby increasing protection for the consumer. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would diminish th e agency's ability to ensure that eggs produced in Texas or imported from other states meet standard guidelines fo r size, grade, and quality. Discontinuation would result i n a loss of cons umer protection against fraudulent trade practice s and would increase the likelihood of p oor-quality products entering the state's food supply chain. It also would result in the loss of state revenue collected from certification and inspection fees. TDA's appropriations and FTE positions would be decrease d to coincide with the loss of state revenue. HANDLING AND MARKETING OF PERISHABLE COMMODITIES The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 101 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Handling and Marketing of Perishable Commodities (HMPC) program ensures that producers of Texas-grown perishable commodities receive timely compensation for commodi ties they sell. The program requires an individual that buy s Texas-grown perishable commodities o n credit for res ale to be lice ns ed by TDA . T he prod ucer or seller is then authorized to recover a portion of the damages resulting from when a commercial purchaser or contractor refuses or is unable to pay for these commodities from the Produce Recove ry Fund, a special account funded with a portion of the license fees paid. TDA processes these claims and hold s hearings to determine if the claim merits payment. The HMPC program is required to collect fees to recover its costs of administration and en forcement. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged approximately $80,000 annually in cost recovery generated from this program deposited to STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 137 the credit of the General Revenue Fund. For the 2020-21 bien nium, HMPC fees range from $30 for a buying/transporting agency identification card, to $50 for a clai m filing fee, to $150 for a general license. In addition, the Produce Recovery Fund, which is administer ed by TDA without appropriation for the payment of claims against perishable commodities handler license holders, is financ ed by additional fees on each license holder and collections from claim respondents. These revenues can be used by TDA on ly to repay the fund for payments made to the claimants. According to the agency, the HMPC prog ram has paid approximately $275,000 si nce fiscal year 2017 from the Produce Recovery Fund to producers and other dealers whose claims me rited payment. Balances in the fund at the end of fiscal year 2019 totaled approximately $1.8 million. Figures 136 and 137 show current and historical levels of fundin g for the HMPC program by method of finance.

WINE MARKETING, RESEARCH, AND EDUCATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapters 12 and 50B; the Texas Alco holic Beverage Code, Section 205.3 ; the Texas Administrative Code, Title 4, Part 1, Chapter 1, Subchapter E, Section 1.209; the Eighty-sixth Legislature, G eneral Appropriations Act, 2020- 21 Biennium, Article VI, Texas Departm ent of Agriculture, Rider 23 Mission Centrality - Weak; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Wine Marketing, Research, and Education program assists the Texas wine industry in promoting and marketing Texas wines and educating the public about the Te xas wine industry. This program, implem ented during fiscal year 2003 as the Texas Wine Marketing Assistance Program, supports the $13.1 billion Texas wine industry, which employs 104,000 workers within 5,000 acres of production. Texas is the fifth-la rgest wine producing state in the U.S., with more than 400 growers and almost 500 wineries. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, Section 5.56, establis hes the program and requires the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission to transfer $250,000 each fiscal year to TDA to administer this program. The 2020-21 GAA, Article VI, TDA, Rider 23, Texas Wine Marketin g Assistance Program, alloca tes the Interagency Contract funds across three strategies. The rider specifies annual allocations of $221,014 for Economic Development, which represents the biennial amount of $0.4 million allocated to direct costs for the program; $15,371 to Central Administration; $8,929 to Information Resour ces; and $4,686 to Other Support Services. The program works in partnership with grape-growing and wine associations th rough the Wine Industry Development Advisory Committee, whose members include producers, such as grape growers, winery representatives, and other stakeholders. Program activities include promotional activities for wine produced in Texas, wine delivery to consumers, public education and publicity about Texas wine and wineries , and managing a database of Texas wineries and package stores. TDA allocated 0.8 FTE position for the program for the 2020-21 biennium. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 139 Another funding source is the General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 5165, Wine Industry Development, through which the agency funds projects related to developing the Texas wine industry, developing the viticulture and enology- related education programs, and eradicating pests that harm the production of grapes and wine. The Seventy-ninth Legislature, Regular Session, 2005, established a new source of revenue for deposit to the Wine Industry Development Account based on annual growth in state wine tax revenues. For each fiscal year, a complex formula calculated the amount of wine tax revenue collected in excess of collections during fiscal year 2004, and the legislation allocated this revenue to fund wine-related and grape-related resear ch and education at certain institutions of higher education up to an amount determined by statute. The allocation al so provided funding of up to $300,000 per year to the Wine Industry Development Account for TDA's use if revenue exceeded covering the amount for these institutions. Senate Bill 881, Eighty-fourth Legislature, 2015, subsequently changed the formula by allocating the amount of wine tax revenue collected in excess of 2014 collections for the same pu rposes, with increased amounts fo r the institutions of higher education. The allocation continued to provide funding of up to $300,000 per year to th e Wine Industry Development Account for use by TDA if revenue exceeded the amount dedica ted to higher education. The legislation also expanded the uses for amounts deposited to the Wine Industry Developm ent Account to include the development of technologies, strategies, and practices for mitigating or eliminating the e ffects of frost, pestilence, or infestation on grapevines. Figures 139 and 140 show current and historical le vels of funding for the Wine Marketing, Research, and Education program by method of finance.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. SIGNIFICANT FINDING Following the enactment of Senate Bill 88 1 during fiscal year 2015 , the Comptroller of Public Accounts reported being unable to distinguish between tax revenues paid by in-state payers and out-of-state payers of the wine excise tax, nor to distinguish between taxes on winery sales and other wine-rel ated revenue, which are the revenue sources directed to institutions of higher education and th e Wine Industry Development Account. In addition, the allocation for higher education was not exempt ed from the Legislature's funds consolidation bill, resulting in the allocation being funded from undedicated General Reve nue Funds; however, the alloca tion to the Wine Industry Development Account was exempted from the funds consolidatio n bill. As a result, the institutions of higher education have been funded from General Revenue Funds at maximum a llocation levels set in statute, but TDA has not received funding. During the 2016-17 biennium, TDA was approp riated $600,000 from the Wine Industry Development Account, but appropriation authority laps ed due to the inability to measure the relevant revenue growth, which resulted in no revenue being deposited to the fund. A statutory change amending the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, Section 205.03, would pr ovide clarity regarding the allocation of wine excise tax revenues to the Wine Indu stry Development Account for TDA to use. Conversely, the Legislature may determine that eliminating the unused Wine Industry Development Account would be preferable to amending statute. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuing this program would prevent wineries that cannot afford to participate in local or statewide winery associations from marketing their products to consumers through TDA's website, social media, and print publications. GRAIN WAREHOUSE The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 14 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 141 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Grain Warehouse Program protects the producers or other de positors of grain stored in public grain warehouses. The program was established in 1969 with enactment of the Te xas Grain Warehouse Act. The agency has allocated 5.1 FTE positions to this program for the 2020-21 biennium. Public grain warehouses must be licensed pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 14.021. A warehouse operator must obtain a license from either TDA or USDA and must post a security to protect grain depositors. The program processes license applications, assesses and collects fee revenue, and determines whether the ap plicant qualifies for licensure . Inspections are required for all TDA lice nsed grain warehouses each fiscal ye ar for program licensing renewal. TDA inspectors monitor grain inventories, moni tor warehouse accounting practices, and id entify risks associated with potential company insolvency. Inspectors also conduct investigations to measure grain in storage; veri fy accuracy of accounts for grain depositors, sellers, and buyers; and analyze storage, handli ng, and financial records to ensure that warehouse operators comply with state public grain warehouse laws and regulations. The program receives and evaluates complaints, conducts in vestigations, and processes violations for administrative penalties. In addition, the program assesse penalties specif ied in the Texas Agriculture Code. TDA can suspend warehouse operations when it identifies potential violations involving th e storage and handling of grain or the possible insolvency of a public grain warehouse. The Grain Warehouse program is required to collect fees to recover its costs of administra tion and enforcement. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $0.6 million annually in cost-recovery revenues gene rated from three sources, as follows: $179,955 from processing license applications and license renewals; $448,021 from performing grain warehouse inspections; and $4,900 from assessing administrative penalties associated with license violations. The agency is not authorized to spend collected penalties. Instead, these revenues are deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund. For the 2020-21 biennium, application and renewal fees for a gr ain warehouse license are $5,000 for either a single license or a combination license, which includes $500 for the headquarte rs and $300 for each addition al facility within statutory limits. The most recent adjustment to these rates occurred in fiscal year 2016. The five-year average annual cost to TDA for a warehouse inspection is $1,122 from fiscal year s 2014 to 2018, with slight variation among years. Figures 141 and 142 show current and historical levels of funding for the Grain Warehouse program by method of finance.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing this program would require all Texas grain warehouses to seek li censing through the USDA certification program pursuant to the Texas Agricultur e Code, Section 14.021. This requirement would diminish state revenue obtained through fees collected from these licenses , from grain warehouse inspection fees, an d from assessed administrative penalties. LIVESTOCK EXPORT PENS The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 146, Subchapter B Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Livestock Export Pens program facilitates the inspection and export of livestock and genetic material from Texas to Mexico or other international destinations through agency fa cilities located and maintained in Brownsville, Del Rio, El Paso, Houston, and Laredo. These facilities serve as holding sites where exporters must meet all inspections and import requirements before transport is approved. The program coordinates with USDA and the Mexican Minist ry of Agriculture to negotiate and change exporting protocols; export livestock; and report possible violations of USDA laws and regulations, anim al health issues, and livestock export numbers. The program also coordinates with the Te xas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) regarding suspected animal disease detection and tick collection. Livestock that are rejected at an export facility for poor health often remain in Texas. TAHC reports that captured livestock and horses along the Texas-Mexico border often are diagnosed as diseased or carrying cattle fever ticks. TDA staff inform TAHC when an animal has been rejected, but the agencies have no formal requirement or agreement to report this information. TDA owns the structures and has long-term ground leases for th e livestock facilities along the Texas-Mexico border, except for the Del Rio facility, where TDA was gifted land in Val Ve rde County. Each livestock facility is leased from a local government entity, except the Laredo site, where TDA leases the land from a family trust. 050100150200250 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (1)STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 145 The Livestock Export Pens program is required to collect fees to recover part of its costs of administration and enforcement. The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 146.021, authorizes TDA to establish and collect reasonable fees for maintenance, feed, medical care, facility use, and other necessary expenses . The program assesses fees to recover costs associated with processing exported or imported animals, including water, pe n space, labor for conducting ex port inspections, and feeding livestock. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $0.2 million annually in cost recovery generated from this program. Program revenues came from two sources. The three-year aver age annual collections from fiscal years 2017 to 2019 from each of these sources are: $0.2 million from livestock impo rt/export processing fees; and $1,956 from the sale of publications. For the 2020-21 biennium, the fee for stalls at the Texas-Mexico border facilities is $20 per head for each 24-hour period. Pen fees vary by species but are structured similarly, with a fee of $1 to $5 per he ad for the first 24 hours and $1 to $8 per head for each additional 24 hours. The fee for stalls at the Houston facility is $40 per head for each 24-hour period. Pen fees range from $2.50 to $10 per head for the first 24 hours and for each additional 24 hours depending on the species. The current fee structure has been in place since fiscal year 2003.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATION Animal disease eradication along the Texas-Mexico border poses a significant challenge to TAHC and USDA animal health programs despite continual testing an d disease prevention efforts. Livestock that are rejected at an export facility for poor health often are released and remain in Texas. According to the Sunset Advisory Commission's 2020 TAHC Staff Report, TDA staff inform TAHC when an animal has been re jected, but the agencies have no formal requirement or agreement. Although no direct correlation has been reported be tween the rejection of livestock at an export facility and an increase in animal disease proliferation, requiring TDA staff to inform TAHC inspectors when an animal is rejected so it can be examined and tested would increase the effectiveness of state and federal animal disease traceability programs at minimal cost. FEE AUTHORITY The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 146.021, authorizes TDA to establish and collect reasonable fees for maintenance, feed, medical care, facility use, and other necessary expenses . This authorization includes water, pen space, labor for conducting export inspections, and feed ing the livestock. During the 2018-19 biennium, program expenditures totaled $2.3 million in General Revenue Funds. However, TDA collected $0.5 million from processing fees to recover costs associated with the processing of exported or imported animals, or $1.7 million less than total program expenditures. The Legislature may consider expanding the fee authority to includ e the cost of administering the program and the direct costs included in current statutory language. This option could reduce the draw on the General Revenue Fund. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would result in closing the five expo rt facilities and would limit options for Texas ranchers and exporters to export livestock and genetic material legally. It would increase the risk of anim al disease spreading into and out of Texas and reduce animal disease traceability efforts, be cause livestock would not be evaluated or tested for diseases before entering or leaving the state. It also would result in a loss in state revenue obtained through fees collected from processing livestock through the facilities. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 147 BOLL WEEVIL ERADICATION The Texas Agriculture Code, the Eighty-sixth Legisl ature, General Appropriations Act, 2020-21 Rider 12 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority -Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Boll Weevil Eradication program provides funding to assist in the control and eradication of the boll weevil in Texas. This insect caused significant damage to the U.S. cotton indu stry during the 1920s, prompting a response from the federal and state governments in partnership with the industry to er adicate this insect. In 1920, enactment of the state Pink Bollworm Act instituted a quarantine zone along the Texas-Mexico border and provided for the inspection and destruction of infested cotton and cotton crops. The Texas Legislature took th is action to avoid a federal quarantine of all Texas cotton. The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation (TBWEF) is the nonprofit organization established by the Legislature in 1993 to eradicate and suppress the boll weevil and pink bollworm from Texas cotton fields. The Commissioner of Agriculture also sets the assessments paid by participating cotton growers that are the primary source of funding for the foundation's eradication efforts. All co tton-growing states participate in a boll weevil eradication program, and most programs have a structure similar to Texas' program. Funding for boll weevil eradication is a cooperative effort between growers and the state and federal governments. The foundation's total revenue during fiscal year 2018 was $27.7 million. Of this amount, $16.2 million came from grower assessment and maintenance fees, $5.0 million from USDA in direct Federal Funds, $5.6 million from state appropriations, and the remainder from miscellaneous sources.

Texas' eradication efforts have been successful with the Foun dation reporting that 97.0 percent of the state's cotton areas have been cleared. Nationally, USDA declared the pink bollworm eradicated in 2018. Currently, 15 of the state's 16 cotton-producing zones have achieved eradication or functi onal eradication status.

TBWEF's fiscal year 2015 work plan divides Texas into 16 zone s. As the zones are declared functionally eradicated, they are classified as maintenance areas. As of November 2016, the foundation has divide d the state into three regions: the West Texas Maintenance Area, which was declared functionally eradicated in January 2016; the East Texas Maintenance Area, which was declared functionally eradicat ed in November 2016; and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, where eradication efforts continue. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Texas is the largest cotton producing state in the nation. According to the agency, te rmination of this program could affect the state's cotton industry and harm efforts to ma intain successful boll weevil eradication efforts. TEXAS COOPERATIVE INSPECTION PROGRAM The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 91; the federal Agricultura l Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (the U.S. Code, Title 7, Section 1621 et seq.); Public Law 108-7, Division A, Title VII, Section 713 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Cooperative Inspection Program (TCIP) is a join t effort between TDA and the USDA that provides for the voluntary inspection of fruits, vegetables , tree nuts, and peanuts grown in Texas or imported into the U.S. through Texas. The program originated in 1917 in the Rio Grande Valley and transitioned into its current form through a 1992 agreement between TDA and USDA. The TCIP program is administered by an independent, qu asi-governmental organization of the same name, which performs the voluntary inspections but is not an official department within TD A. TDA entered into an agreement with the TCIP organization in 1992 pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Sect ion 91.005, which authorizes the agency to enter into cooperative agreements with the USDA or with any Texas firm, corporation, or association to carry out shipping point and receiving market inspections purs uant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (the U.S. Code, Title 7, Section 1621, et seq.). TDA administratively supports the work of th e TCIP organization by appointing its executive director, who is a TDA employee, and providing information technology and indirect administration se rvices, for which the agency is reimbursed fully by the organization . These reimbursements are authorized pu rsuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 91.0051, and appear in the TDA's budget as Appropri ated Receipts. Apart from the executive director, none of the TCIP organization's other staff, numb ering approximately 100, are TDA staff. TCIP's inspections benefit the citrus, vegetable, tree nut, an d peanut industries of the state by ensuring that USDA standards are met, thereby enhancing the marketability of commodities for producers and shippers and providing consumers with consistent, quality products . As part of this joint effort, USDA li censes the organization's inspectors for each commodity. TCIP's operations are funded entirely throug h inspection fees tied to th e production, importation, and shipping of agricultural commodities, wi th funds maintained in a federal trust. TCIP has adopted electronic inspection software for peanuts and some vegetables , increasing the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the inspection process. In fiscal year 2019, TCIP inspected 3.86 billion pounds of fruits, vegetables, peanuts, and nuts. Although TDA has not identified any barriers impeding program performance, the agency does suggest that further improvements and additions to electronic inspection capabilities ma y enhance the cost effectiveness of the inspection program. Figures 151 and 152 show current and historical fundin g for TCIP by method of finance.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the agency program would result in the TCIP organization having to ta ke on the responsibilities of executive leadership, some administrative responsibilities, and inform ation technology services. TDA's costs for providing these services are covered through transfer of inspection fee reve nue from the TCIP organization. Therefore, the state fiscal impact would be minimal. However, such action would remove the state's role in supporting this regulatory effort, and it is unknown if the TCIP organization could perform these re sponsibilities at costs lower than it pays for by TDA's assumption of the obligations. ORGANIC CERTIFICATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 18; the U.S. Code of Federa l Regulations, Title 7, Subchapter B, Chapter I, Subchapter M, Part 205; the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Marke ting Service National Organic Program Handbook Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Organic Certification program promotes the integrity of organic agriculture pr oducts produced and manufactured in Texas by providing certification services and regulation of approximately 200 Texas producers and agribusinesses. TDA is accredited as a certifying agent through the USDA Nation al Organic Program (NOP). The program has operated since 1990. Agricultural producers that produce organic crops and livestock and want their products to be labeled as certified organic must participate in an organic certificat ion program sanctioned by USDA. Participat ion in the state program is voluntary. Private organic certifiers, also accredited by the USDA, are av ailable to producers but none are located in Texas. Some out- of-state agents require that facilities located in Texas be part of a larger entity headquartered in another state or country, or be close business partners with such an entity. The state program requires that a producer or handler submit an application, which is reviewed by an organic certification specialist. After the application is approved , a regional specialist is sent out in th e field to conduct an initial inspection. After receiving final approval by a second organic certificatio n specialist, a certificate of compliance is awarded to the producer or handler and is valid for one year from the date of issuance. The time required to issue a new completed organic certificate is approximately 90 days. Sites also receive an an nual onsite inspection as part of certification renewal. In 2019, the agency took steps to enha nce electronic fee payments, which previo usly had been unavailable to program participants. The Eighty-sixth Legislatur e, 2019, appropriated $0.6 million in General Revenue Funds to the program to purchase software required to participate in the federal organi c certification program, which helps staff with the processing, review, and inspection of program participants. The Organic Certification program is required to collect fees to recover its costs of administration and enforcement. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, TDA averaged $0.4 million per year in cost recovery generated for this program from three sources, with revenues obtained primarily through fees associat ed with the processing of license applications and renewals. Program fees are based on the type of certification requested and, for producers, the size and scope of the operation. For TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 152 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 the 2020-21 biennium, the new application fee for a producer is $400 and $1,900 for a handler. Fees are added based on the number of acres in operation and the number of organic products produced or handled.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Organic Certification program uses a paper-based system to review documentation submitted by program participants to substantiate their claims of organic practices in their op erations. This review process frequently requires significant correspondence with new and renewing participants, which incr eases the amount of paperwork. The agency reports that a web-based system could enable greater program efficiency as program participants submit required documentation and plans electronically. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would result in the state no long er certifying organic products, which would force producers to hire private certifying agents at higher costs, could jeopar dize a producer's ability to label premium products as organic, could reduce customer confidence in products with the organic certification, and may result in increased prices for organic products. It also would result in a loss in state revenue obta ined through fees collected from certification and inspection fees. SPECIALTY CROP BLOCK GRANT The Texas Agriculture Code, Sections 12.002 and 12.007; the Spe cialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 (the U.S. Code, Title 7, Section 1621 note), Section 101, amended by Public Law 113-79, Section 10010, the Agricultural Act of 2014, amended by Public Law 115-334, Section 10107, the Agri cultural Improvement Act of 2018 Mission Centrality - Weak; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Specialty Crop (SC) Block Grant prog ram is a federal program to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops that began in 2008. Specialty crops are defined as fruits and tree nuts, vegetables, culinary herbs and spices, medicinal plants, as well as nursery, floriculture, and hort iculture crops. In Texas, the program has supported industry in research and development of citrus, melons, water co nservation, pecans, wine grapes, tomato es and other commodities. Efforts have focused on issues pertaining to food safety, marketin g, nutrition, plant health, and industry development. Federal funding available for the block grant program depends on acreage and sales of Texas specialty crops, which requires the producer to report this information. The program help s develop a competitive future for Texas specialty crops by providing funding to researchers developing new disease-resi stant, drought-tolerant, high-nutrient content varieties. Grant applications are accepted from Texas state agencies, un iversities, institutions, and pr oducer, industry, or community- based organizations that are involved with or promote specialty crops. Projects must demonstrate that they enhance the competiveness of the Texas specialty crop industry by leveragi ng efforts to promote these crops, assist with research and development, expand access to specialty crops, and address lo cal, regional, and national ch allenges that producers have. The projects must be intended to benefit more than one in dividual, institution, or organization. The agency typically grants from 11 to 14 grants each year, as shown in Figure 157 . TDA reported an increase in applications received after TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 154 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 the 2018 reauthorization of the federal Agricultural Improvemen t Act, referred to as the Farm Bill, which extended funding levels for the block grant program through federal fiscal year 2023.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would result in the loss of federal funding used by the state to enhance the competitiveness of the specialty crop industry in Texas. A loss of funding for this purpose would reduce resear ch and development efforts for these crops, which also could affect crop yields. PESTICIDE DISPOSAL The Texas Agriculture Code, Sections 76.132, 76.044(c), and 76. 009; the Federal Rodenticide Act Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Pesticide Disposal program organizes pesticide waste an d pesticide container collection activities statewide in coordination with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and Te xas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. The program serves agricultural pesticide applicators and rural land owners by properly disp osing of waste pesticides and containers that no longer are needed or have been ba nned by the U.S, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). House Bill 191, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, established the program and authorized TDA to coordinate with TCEQ and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Services to contract for the se rvices of contractors licensed in the disposal of hazardous waste, pesticide waste, and pesticide containers. The legislatio n also established the Pesticide Disposal Fund in the state Treasury outside of the General Revenue Fund (Other Funds) ; the fund consists of revenue from annual transfers of pesticide fees determined by TDA as nece ssary to administer the pr ogram. The balance of the fund cannot exceed $400,000 annually, and TDA is prohibited from raising fees to fund the program. The program was appropriated $0.9 milli on in All Funds, including $0.8 million in Other Funds from the Pesticide Disposal Fund, $0.1 million in General Revenue Funds, and 1.0 FTE position.

This disruption primarily would affe ct agricultural pesticide applicators and rural land owners that seek to dispose properly of waste pesticides and containers that no longer are needed or have been banned by the EPA. COMMODITY BOARDS The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 41 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Commodity Boards program provides oversight of 12 commod ity boards that collect prod ucer assessments voluntarily for use in research, marketing, and education. These producer assessments are used for research, disease and insect control, predator control, education, and promotio n designed to encourage the production, marketing, and use of an agricultural commodity. TDA supports these boards through facilitating meetings and ensuring compliance with statutory requirements, which includes review and a pproval of annual budgets and board memb er election plans for each board. For the 2020-21 biennium, responsibilities for this program require the work obli gations of 0.5 FTE position, which has remained constant since at least the 2014-15 biennium. Commodity boards are organized around specific commodities, such as beef or peanuts, and are supported financially through producers' voluntary contribution based on production levels pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 41. Each board is composed of agricultural producers that vo lunteer to serve in this capacity. Board members are elected by industry members and serve six-year terms. Commodity boar ds monitor their own share of the agricultural market and are the primary means by which these industries maintain coordination with TDA re garding agriculture policy, compliance, and enforcement issues. Many boards are long-standing and have direct connections with a national industry council counterpart. Figure 162 shows the 12 commodity boards that are part of this program.

PRESCRIBED BURN The Texas Natural Resources Code, Chapter 153 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Prescribed Burn program regulates Ce rtified and Insured Prescribed Burn Mana gers that use prescribed burns as a safe land management and conservation tool for agricultural , forestry, and conservation pu rposes. The program establishes standards for prescribed burning and certification, training curriculum, minimum education, and professional requirements for instructors. The Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, established this program to limit the liability for landowners using prescribed burning as a management tool . The program is overseen by a board with membership composed pursuant to the Texas Natura l Resources Code, Section 153.041, that establishes standards for prescribed burning and certification, training curriculum, minimum educ ation and professional requirements for instructors. The program is not allocated any FTE positions by the agency, an d board members perform the work on behalf of the agency. As of June 2020, approximately 100 licensed pr escribed burn managers operated in Texas. The Prescribed Burn program is required to collect fees to re cover its costs of administration and enforcement. This revenue is generated through certification and renewal fees of $500 pe r applicant for the program's various licenses. Annual average revenue collections from this source from fiscal years 2017 to 2019 was $18,917; however, fewer applicants are anticipated for the 2020-21 biennium, with associated, estimated decreases in revenue to $10,000 for fiscal year 2020 and $12,000 for fiscal year 2021.

Governmental and nonprofit agencies are eligible for this grant program, which was established in 2007. TDA works with at least 142 organization s in 161 counties through this program. Counties make qualifying grants to meal providers as a condition for TDA gran t funding. The county grant amount targ et is based on the number of seniors reported in the most recent census. According to the agency , grantees delivered approximately 14.6 million meals during fiscal year 2018, and state funding covered approximately 20.0 percent of that total. Figure 168 shows the number of Home-Delivered Meal Grant awards by county during fiscal year 2018.

TEXANS FEEDING TEXANS SURPLUS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS GRANT The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 21; the Texas Administrativ e Code, Title 4, Part 1, Chapter 1, Subchapter M Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texans Feeding Texans Surplus Agricu ltural Products Grant program was establ ished in fiscal year 2002 to provide surplus agricultural products to food banks and other charitab le organizations that serve need y or low-income individuals. The agency awards grant funding to nonprofit organization s to help offset the costs of harvesting, gleaning, and transporting Texas products to 21 food banks across the state. Eligibility for the Surplus Agricultural Pr oduct Grant Program grants is limited to nonprofit organizations that have at least five years of experience coordinating a statewide network of food banks and charitable or ganizations that service each of the 254 counties pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 21. According to the agency, one organization, Feeding Texas, traditionally has received grant funding. During the 2018-19 bie nnium, the grant amount of $8.8 million was awarded to Feeding Texas through a competitive request for application process to solicit surplus products, harvesting, packaging, and transporti ng to the food banks. TDA reports that, during the 2018-19 biennium, Feeding Te xas distributed approximately 65.1 million pounds of produce from a maximum of 57 suppliers per quarter to Texas food banks, as shown in Figure 171 .

S . f o o d s u p p l y , w i t h a n e m p h a s i s on those commodities commonly consumed by infants and children. The program originated in 1991 as a cooperative grant agreement with US DA. Its goal is to protect and benefit producers, consumers, food processors, and pesticide producers and applicators. Samples of agricultural products are collected by inspectors at food distribution centers and sent to the agency's Pesticide Laboratory located in College Station to test for pesticide re sidue. Pesticide residue levels from samples are compared to tolerances established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that pesticide residues in food remain at safe levels. Ten states, including Texas, test food for pesticide residue for this purpose. An EPA Market Protection and Promotion grant, Catalog of Federal Domestic As sistance No. 10.163, fully funds this program. This grant funding includes salaries and benefits for 9.5 FTE positions, including 8.5 laboratory staff positions and 1.0 inspector position. The work of these lab staff includes Pesticide Data Program responsibilities and residue analysis to support TDA in enforcement actions invo lving the misuse of pesticide. The agency anticipates that this funding source will continue because data generated by the program supports th e EPA's ability to establish resi due tolerance levels pursuant to the federal Food Quality Protection Act.

Nonprofit organizations that benefit from specialty license plates include the Go Texan program, American Quarter Horse Association, Masonic Grand Lodge of Te xas, and Order of the Eastern Star. The program generates revenues for the agency from the sale of specialized license plates. As a nominating state agency, TDA receives $22 of the $30 fee collected for every set of specia lty plates sold. From fiscal years 2017 to 2019, the program averaged $56,000 in collect ions from these sales.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Texas Transportation Code, Section 504.625, directs TDA to expend license plate revenues from sales of GO TEXAN license plates on the GO TEXAN Partner Program, but the Le gislature has discontinued funding for the partner program. As a result, revenues from the sale of specialty license plates continue to be deposited to the License Plate Trust Fund and are appropriated to the agency through the GAA, Article IX. Section 8.13, Appropriation of Specialty License Plate Receipts.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Terminating funding for this program would not have an advers e effect on TDA. The participating nonprofit organizations would need to find a new sponsoring agency. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 11 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indirect Administration program pr ovides the administrative support for TDA operations. This support includes executive management, internal audit, legal, human resour ces (HR), accounting, budget, purchasing, facilities, fleet services, communications, external affair s, and information technology (IT) infr astructure support. The program can be organized broadly into central administrati on, information resources, and other support services. Within this capacity, this program affects all of TDA's other programs. Agency operations have evolved to meet needs as they arise. For example, the agency implemented the statewide Centralized Accounting and Payroll/Personnel System (CAPPS) financial module in September 2019 after a year of training and testing; TDA anticipates implementing the CAPPS HR module in September 2020. In addition, the agency is modernizing its legacy IT systems, for which it was appropriated $1.0 million for the 2020-21 biennium. The agency is beginning to implement this effort, which includes ou tside consultation followed by development efforts for 25 applications, some of which have been in use for 18 years. The indirect cost amounts in the 2020-21 GAA, Article VI, TDA, Rider 24, Appropriations Limited to Revenue Collections, Cost Recovery Programs, were updated for the bie nnium to align with the agency's indirect cost allocation. The allocations were updated in response to recommendations included in the August 2017 State Auditor's Report, Fees at the Texas Department of Agriculture , Report No. 17-049. The new rider allocati ons consider the number of FTE positions in each strategy and in each cost recovery program with no net changes across all methods of finance.

EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 2119, Eighty-sixth Legislatur e, 2019, transferred fuel program respon sibilities to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR). Associated with this tr ansfer, TDA funding decreased by $6.1 million in General Revenue Funds and 35.9 FTE positions. Of these appropriatio ns and positions, $0.4 million and 4.0 FTE positions were allocated for central administration, $0.2 million and 2.0 po sitions were allocated for Information Resources, and $0.1 million was allocated for other support serv ices. According to the agency, the decrea se was necessary to cover the costs and program responsibilities associated with the transferred progra m; however, this funding and these positions previously also provided for and performed additional resp onsibilities associated with other programs. TDA has realized a lack of resources from the transfer that affects how the agen cy conducts other types of inspections at gas station facilities and license service companies. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program funding would limit the agency's ability meet its st atutory requirements. The agency would be unable to hire, manage acco unts receivable and payable, process payroll, ma nage all staff, and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. If the program were discontinued and funding retained, then the funding would be redistributed among the direct program costs based on the established allocation. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 173 TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION The Texas Agriculture Code, Title 6, Subtitle C, Chapters 161 t o 168 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) was establishe d in 1959 as the successor to the Livestock Sanitary Commission of Texas, which was established by the Legislature in 1893 to respond to the proliferation of cattle fever ticks in portions of Texas and 12 other states. The agency's mission is to protect and miti gate Texas' animal industry from the e ffects of domestic, foreign, and emerging diseases; promote animal health and productivity; protect huma n health from animal diseases and conditions transmissible to people; and prepare for and respond to emergencies invo lving animals. TAHC accomplishes its mission through the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, control, and eradication of diseases and parasites that affect livestock, exotic livestock , domestic fowl, and exotic fowl throughout Texas. AGENCY GOVERNANCE The agency is governed by 13 commissioners, who are appoin ted by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate to serve staggered six-year terms. Commissioners re present the public and various livestock industries and professions. The commission typically meets three times per year . The agency is headquartered in Austin with six regional offices located in Amarillo, Beeville, Laredo, Rockda le, Stephenville, and Sulphur Springs, as shown in Figure 185 . Each regional office is headed by a veterina rian that serves as the director. TAHC's executive director is also the State Veterinarian of Texas, which is a position considered to be a national and international le ader in the field of animal agriculture.

TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 174 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 During the 2018-19 biennium, the agency conducted 25 programs aligned with diseases within the agency's purview and various cooperative agreements with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). During the 2020-21 biennium, the agency's funding and resources were real igned into 14 programs organized to a ddress the types of animals within the agency's jurisdiction instead of specific diseases. FEE REVENUE The agency collects a limited amount of fee revenue pursuant to the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.060, to fund its work supporting the livestock and poultry industries. Currently, the agency assesses fees to recover costs associated with inspecting the farmed and captive cervid industry, issuing cert ifications of veterinary inspection, and registering certain fowl distributors and transporters. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, General Approp riations Act, 2020-21 Biennium, Article VI, Texas Animal Health Commission, Rider 7, Contingency A ppropriation: Cost Recovery for Animal Health Programs, identifies approximately $0.5 million in General Revenue Funds appropriated each fi scal year that is contingent on the agency collecting sufficient revenue. The Eighty-second Legislature, Regular Se ssion, 2011, expanded TAHC's fee author ity to collect fees for a service for which the agency incurred a cost, and to bring TAHC's budget in line with similar regulatory agencies across the state. The Eighty-second Legislature also made 57.5 full-time-equival ent (FTE) positions and $9.9 mi llion (out of $22.3 million) in appropriations contingent on collectin g additional fee revenue. Despite expandin g the agency's fee authority, actual fee revenue collections for the 2012-13 biennium totaled $0.5 milli on, which resulted in a redu ction of $9.4 million in General Revenue Funds and 57.5 FTE positions during the 2012-13 biennium due to lapsed (unused) appropriation authority. TAHC's expanded fee authority expired September 1, 2015, and was not reauthorized by the Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017. Figure 186 shows the fees that TAHC assesses, revenue collections for the 2018-19 biennium, and estimated collections for the 2020-21 biennium.

Currently, registration and inspection se rvice fees charged to the industry account for $1.0 million of TAHC's $30.8 million biennial budget, or 3.4 percent. For TAHC, the option of increasing fee generation to 10.0 percent of its budget would reduce the draw on General Revenue Funds by $2.0 million per biennium. The agency and its commissioners have expr essed concerns about the negative impact of cost recovery mechanisms on animal disease surveillance programs. TAHC previously has not approved fee proposals, and the agency continues to provide services without assessing fees that it is authorized to collect, which are shown in Figure 187 . STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 175 An informal review of the approach of other Western states to funding their state animal heal th functions indicates that a majority \u2014at least 12 of 16\u2014collect inspection and other servic e fees from the industry to support a sizable share of their regulatory costs. In several of these states, fee revenue support s appropriations at a rate of 50.0 percent or greater. For example, 55.5 percent of the Wyoming Li vestock Board's budget is covered by revenue generated from its brand recording and inspection activities.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.060, authorizes TA HC to assess fees for inspections conducted in the livestock and poultry industries. If TAHC began assessi ng such fees, the revenues could fund inspections, additional outreach efforts, information resource techno logy upgrades, or expanded animal disease traceability activities. TAHC's efforts to detect and mitigate trends in an imal diseases that may be transmissible to humans may qualify as an exemption pursuant to the Texa s Government Code, Section 2001.0045, which would enable the agency to increase inspection fees for cost recovery without a required corresponding decrease in revenue. TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 178 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Continued evidence of the eradication of bovine brucello sis has resulted in decreased funding for testing, which has caused a significant reduction in sampling and sample testing performed by TAHC's State-Federal Laboratory. All surveillance testing for the agency co uld be performed by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) through an Interagenc y Contract, reducing overall costs including those from non-fee-generated revenue and the number of labora tory facilities capable of performing the same test. Amending statute to require, not merely authorize, an imal identification of live stock within the agency's purview would increase the effectiveness of the Animal Disease Traceability program to track the movements of a diseased animal, and those of other nearby animals, to determine the source and potential spread of the disease for the purpose of responding to it and stopping it as soon as possible. Establishing this requirement, however, might increase costs to livestock producers. Although the Texas Division of Emergency Manageme nt considers TAHC to be the lead state agency authorized to coordinate responses for the needs of comp anion, service, and assistance animals during natural disasters and emergencies, statute currently does not address this role. The agency's statutory authority specifically relates to livestock and poultry. TAHC reported positive short-term improvements in turnover rates among livest ock and poultry inspector after receiving additional appropriations from the Eighty -sixth Legislature, 2019, to address competitive salary issues. TAHC reports difficulties in complying with statutes th at contain outdated specific treatments for animal diseases that conflict with modern medical approaches. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of st atutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be greater than or less than existing funding levels. The agency was asked to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amounts. Unless otherwis e indicated, the agency chose to maintain the current level of funding for this exercise, basing its estimates on projected needs in General Revenue Funds, after the receipt of projected Federal Funds, in administering the duties of the program in question. ANIMAL DISEASE TRACEABILITY The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.056; Federal Register, Volume 78, No. 6, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Servic e; the U.S. Code of Federal Regul ations, Title 9, Parts 71, 77, 78, 86, et al. Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Animal Disease Traceability program implements and acce lerates the process of premises registration to advance animal disease traceability by promoting the use of electronic identification and electronic movement documents. Premises registration is the process through which applicators and owners are assigned a nati onally unique number that is provided to tag distributors. The program works in cooperation with the USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to serve all animal agriculture populations by tracing the movements of a diseased animal, and those of other nearby animals, to determine the source and po tential spread of the disease. APHIS incorporates technology for livestock identification, including electronic identifi cation devices, to facilitate identificati on and tracking of animals. The program enhances the capacity to determine where diseased and at-ris k animals are or have been, wh ich reduces TAHC's response time, the number of animals affected, and the econ omic effects on owners and affected communities. TAHC's Field Operations Administration program admini sters the FTE positions related to the Animal Disease Traceability program. These positions are generalist inspec tors that perform functions for several programs daily. Figures 191 and 192 show current and historical levels of funding for the Animal Diseas e Traceability program by method of finance.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.056, authorizes but does not require identificati on of livestock within the agency's purview, including cattle and biso n, sheep and goats, and swine. The stat ute authorizes the agency to implement an animal identification program that is more stringent than a federal animal id entification program, but only for the control of a specific disease or emergency management, and on ly after approval by a two-thirds vote by the commission.

TAHC participated in developing the registration increase, and the agency's performance exceeded the target for the percenta ge increase in participation in animal disease traceability programs. The number of premises registered each ye ar has increased at a slower rate because the number of unregistered premises is decreasing, as shown in Figure 193 . When premises are registered with TAHC or the USDA, that location is registered permanently unless the owner requests to be removed from registration. FIGURE 193 PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NUMBER OF PREMISES REGISTERED IN FEDERAL AND TEXAS ANIMAL DISEASE TRACEABILITY PROGRAMS, FISCAL YEARS 2014 TO 2021 SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. Expanding the requirement that all included livestock are iden tified with an ear tag or ra dio frequency identification (RFID) device and that all premises are registered may increa se the effectiveness of the program. However, the expansion also may prove burdensome to livestock producers without additi onal funding to subsidize the purchase of identification devices. Before livestock producers can order an offi cial identification device, they must ob tain a nationally unique number at no cost from USDA APHIS or TAHC. The most commonly used devices are USDA National Uniform Eartagging System (NUES) metal tags or AIN 840 RFID tags . USDA NUES tags are available at no cost, but supplies typically are limited and disbursed quickly. The producer must purchase AIN 840 RFID tags. The average cost for an agency-approved electronic identification device is $2.50. However, the cost to producers and the ec onomic benefit from the ability to trace and prevent the spread of disease quickl y among livestock cannot be determined. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit signif icantly the state's ability to perform th e following responsibilities: detect and survey rapidly for reportable, foreign, and emerging disease tr ends and threats affecting cattle; respond to disease outbreaks; provide timely and accurate information; develop disease co ntrol and eradication plans; and advise on management of disease trends, potential threats, and mitigation strategies ba sed on information provided by the agency. Discontinuing the program also could affect federal cooperative funding and in demnity and prohibit the movement of Texas livestock to other states entirely or without addition al requirements and associated costs. 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%100.0%120.0%140.0% 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Projected ActualSTRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 181 EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, it needs an additional $131,000 fo r maintenance and data storage costs for the Animal Health Tracking System. During fiscal year 2019, the agency received approval from the Legislative Budget Board and the Office of the Governor, Budget Division, to exceed capital budget au thority by $269,000 to purchase business initiative software for agency modernization. Additional funding would permit the agency to allocate existing General Revenue Funds appropriations for the program toward sala ries, travel, consumables, and other operat ing expenses that have been decreased to fund increased maintenance and storage costs. As of July 2020, the agency reported that the Animal He alth Tracking System had been developed but not fully implemented.

The program serves the owners of cow and calf operations and the producers of beef cattle, da iry cattle, feeder and stocker cattle, and rodeo and exhibition cattle. The program has existed since 1893 when the Texas Livest ock Sanitary Commission was established and charged with protecting domestic animals from contagio us and infectious diseases, particularly bovine babesiosis transmitted by cattle fever ticks. The focus of the program has changed with the em ergence of other diseases affecting cattle such as bovine tuberculosis, anthrax, bovine brucellosis, malignant catarrhal fever, scabies, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, bovine trichomoniasis, cattle fever, and others. The agency began conducting area herd tests for bovine brucellosis by county during the 1950s, primarily through slaughter testing and voluntary testing at livestock market s. During the 1980s, mandat ory surveillance testing was instituted at livestock markets and at change of ownership. The USDA recognized Texas as having no occurrences of cattle brucellosis in calendar year 1998, but market testing continue d until 2011. Threats of brucellosis recurrence still exist, primarily from movement of cattle originating from the Grea ter Yellowstone Area, where elk and bison serve as a disease reservoir, and from Mexico, where cattle stra y across the border or enter Texas illegally. Federal funding for brucellosis surveillance and eradication has been de creasing due to the recording of fewer instances of the disease. Previously, TAHC used Federal Funds to pay slaugh ter plants and veterinarians at livestock markets to collect samples for testing at the State-Federal Laboratory in Austin. Texas has participated continuously in the national bovine tuberculosis (TB) eradication program since its inception in 1917. The agency conducts disease investigations and manage s affected herds through slaughter surveillance, movement testing, and case investigations. Due to the herd sizes and movement among single-owner dairy complexes, TB has been increasingly difficult to detect, trace, and eliminate. From 1985 to 2003, the agen cy responded to recurring outbreaks of TB in dairy cattle in the El Paso area. As a result of contin uous testing, herd depopulation, and the restriction of dairy permits in the area, Texas was recognized as having no outbreak s of bovine TB in 2005, despite the detection of the disease in beef and dairy herds since. This status is contingent on TAHC conducting thorough disease investigations and developing herd plans that eliminate the risk of disease tran smission. The agency investigates , on average, five cases of bovine TB annually. Currently, two dairy complexes and on e beef herd are under quaran tine. The USDA's National TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 182 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Agricultural Statistics Service reported an increase in the total inventory of dairy cows in Texas from 350,000 cattle in 2000 to 580,000 cattle as of January 1, 2020. The cattle fever tick is a significant threat to the cattle indu stry. It carries the Babesia bovis parasite, which causes a dis ease commonly known as bovine piroplasmosis, or cattle fever, that can kill up to 90.0 percent of exposed cattle. Animals that are not susceptible to cattle fever, such as horses, deer, and nilgai antelope, can carry cattle fever ticks. Texas shares its 1,248-mile border with four Mexican states and imports more live animals than any other state. Cattle and horse imports and animal activity along the Texas-Mexico border in the historic fever tick quarantine zone and in West Texas pose a significant challenge to TAHC and US DA animal health programs. Texas imports approximately 1.0 million cattle annually from Mexico and approximately 2.5 million cattle from other U.S. states. TAHC and USDA staff routinely assist U.S. Border Patrol agents with the capture of livestock and horses that cross from Mexico, which often are diagnosed as diseased or carrying cattle fever ticks. Figure 194 shows TAHC's cattle and fever tick quarantines and pr ogram expenditures from fi scal years 2014 to 2019.

As shown in Figure 195 , TAHC and USDA's - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service maintain a Permanent Quarantine Zone along the Rio Grande River in South Texas to separate area s endemic with fever ticks from the rest of the U.S. The Permanent Quarantine Zone consists of more th an 0.5 million acres in eight South Texas counties: Cameron, Hidalgo, Kinney, Maverick, Starr, Val Verde, Webb, and Zapata . Inspectors regularly inspect livestock in the quarantine zone, and animals must receive TAHC approval for movement before being shipped outside the area. In addition, TAHC has established temporary quarantine zones, Control Purp ose Quarantine Area (CPQA) and Temporary Preventative Quarantine Area (TPQA), outside of the permanent zone prim arily in South Texas. Inspectors also perform surveillance at sale barns and receiving pens to prevent the spread of ticks. $0.2$1.6 $1.1$2.8$3.9 $3.5 $0.0$0.5$1.0$1.5$2.0$2.5$3.0$3.5$4.0$4.5 2014 2015 End of Fiscal Year ExpendituresQUARANTINES (IN MILLIONS)STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 183 FIGURE 195 TEXAS FEVER TICK QUARANTINE AREAS FISCAL YEAR 2020 Surveillance Area Infested Premises Permanent Quarantine Zone SOURCE : Texas Animal Health Commission.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.060 (a), authorizes TAHC to assess fees for dairy calf health and inspection reports, livestock market inspections, and slaughter plant inspections. The ag ency has expressed concerns about the negative impact of cost recovery mechanisms on animal disease surveillance programs. TAHC previously has not approved fee proposals, and the agency continues to provide these servic es without assessing fees that it is authorized to collect. Pursuant to current statutory authority, the agency could be gin assessing inspection fees and using the fee revenues for inspector retention, additional outreach efforts, information resource technology upgrades, or expanded animal disease traceability activities. Additionally, it could use fee revenues to replace non-fee-generated General Revenue appropriations. The Texas Government Code, Section 2001.0045, requires that any increase in fees is offset by an equal or greater decrease in costs to the industry served but provides an exemption if the cost is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Texas residents. TAHC's efforts to detect and mitigate tren ds in animal diseases that may be transmissible to humans may meet the exemption threshold and enable the agency to increase inspection fees for cost recovery without a corresponding decrease in revenue. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit signif icantly the state's ability to perform th e following responsibilities: detect and survey rapidly for reportable, foreign, and emerging disease tr ends and threats affecting cattle; respond to disease outbreaks; provide timely and accurate information; develop disease co ntrol and eradication plans; and advise on management of disease trends, potential threats, and mitigation strategies, based on information provided by the agency. Discontinuing the program also could affect federal cooperative funding an d indemnity and prohibit the movement of Texas cattle to other states entirely or without additional requirements and associated costs. Texas is the largest producer of cattle in the U.S., and a disease outbreak that affects the marketability of cattle inventory could harm the state's economy and tax revenue collections.

The Si xty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 1977, established the pullorum-t yphoid eradication program and required TAHC to partner with TVMDL to implement and enforce the program. Texas has experienced ot her avian disease outbreaks, including highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza, exotic Newcastle di sease, psittacosis, and infectious laryngotracheitis. The agency's task to protect avian livestock health is cha llenged primarily by diseases carried by migratory fowl and backyard flocks in close proximity to commercial poul try producers. Commercial producers have surveillance and biosecurity measures to protect their fl ocks, whereas backyard flocks do not and are potential ca rriers of disease.

The program serves swine producers, including commercial and private operators, protecting the health and marketability of the swine population in Texas. The US DA's National Agricultural Statistics Se rvice reported the inventory of all hogs and pigs in Texas to be approximately 1.1 million head, or 1.4 percent of the national to tals as of March 1, 2020. The program was implemented in 1911 and in 1942 began pe rforming stockyard inspecti ons for hog cholera, which eventually was eradicated. TAHC continues to conduct survei llance for swine brucellosis, pseudorabies, classical swine fever, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. Duri ng fiscal year 2007, the agency began regulating the movement of live feral swine, which are known to be carriers of pseudorabies and bruc ellosis. Texas is recognized as having no occurrences of swine brucellosis and pseudorabies in commercial swine. According to the agency, protecting the health of swine livest ock is challenged by the presence of feral swine throughout the state. Figure 202 shows that, as of calendar year 2018, feral swine popu late all counties in Texas except El Paso County. Feral swine can carry diseases that pose threats to domestic sw ine, cattle, humans, and other sp ecies. These diseases can be spread easily when domestic and feral swine intermingle. Historic al test data indicate that ab out 10.0 percent of feral swine are infected with swine brucellosis, a disease that affects cattle and occasionally humans. Approximately 20.0 percent of feral swine may be infected with pseudorabies, unrelated to rabi es, which causes illness in hogs and affects marketability of domestic swine.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Legal and Compliance program provides legal counsel and re presentation in internal oper ations, open meetings, public information requests, state and federal programs, contracts, rule making, and enforcement of animal agriculture health laws and regulations. The program serves livestock produc ers and consumers by supportin g the agency's internal and external operations and promoting, inve stigating, and enforcing an imal health requirements. Program staff includes a general counsel, legal assistant, compliance director, and two field investigators that operate in collaboration with field operations inspectors, other state an d federal agencies, and the public. The program employs two investigators and relies on the field inspectors to perform regulato ry and compliance activities. When field inspectors observe noncomplia nce, they either may educate the offender or refer the violation to Legal and Compliance program staff. After a case is referred, progra m staff evaluates the violatio n and may open a compliance investigation to gather more information. Figure 205 shows that the program completed 1,412 compliance actions during fiscal year 2019. TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 192 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 FIGURE 205 LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ACTIONS FISCAL YEARS 2014 TO 2021 SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. Initiated in 2014, the Texas Authorized Personnel Program (T APP) educates and certifies all Texas veterinarians that engage in state or federal disease control or eradication prog ram activities. The program also applies to all veterinarians issuing certificates of veterinary inspection for livestock, ex otic livestock, fowl, and exotic fowl, interstate and intrastate . TAPP is updated with industry needs and technological adva nces. For example, in 2015, Chronic Wasting Disease post- mortem certification was added when the Cervid Health progra m implemented live testing, and training is provided via webinar. Responding to emerging disease threats and ensuring compliance with interstate and intrastate regulations is a substantial challenge for the program. Advanced compliance and document ation training for field inspectors, who are often the first contact with the regulated community following a diseas e event or noncompliance, would benefit the agency.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit th e agency's ability to provide legal co unsel and representation in internal operations, state and federal programs, personnel matters, contracts, and rule making. Without compliance staff monitoring and enforcing interstate an d intrastate animal health requirem ents, including quarantine movement restrictions, disease containment will be affected. Additiona lly, for cooperative programs, TAHC must apply to USDA for the state to receive a designated status to authorize the mo vement of Texas livestock and poultry in intrastate commerce without additional requirements and associat ed costs. Texas likely would not qualify for these designated statuses for certain disease programs without the authority and resources n eeded to monitor and enforce cooperative requirements. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.0416 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION TAHC plans, collaborates, and coordinates with the USDA, the state's animal-health related agencies, agricultural industries, and other related parties regarding emergency pr eparation and response at the state and local levels. The Emergency Management program conducts pl anning to prevent or mitigate the effe cts of disease outbreaks and assists in planning, coordination, evaluation, transp ortation, sheltering, and care of larg e and small animals during natural and disease disasters. Currently, staff from other programs would be reallocated for the agency's response effort to address a disaster. The program was implemented in fiscal year 2002 to coordinate with industry partners and local jurisdictions to establish and plan preparedness programs for animal disease outbreaks and infestations, emergency response coordination during a natural disaster, and provide educatio n and training on animal diseases. TAHC has been designated by the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) as the lead agency to provide plans for the humane evacuation, transpor t, and temporary sheltering of all an imals, including companion and service animals, during a natural or human-caused disaster. Throug h the program, the agency assists with animal ownership identification, livestock restraint and capt ure, carcass disposal, consulting on anim al health and public health concerns, and chemical and biological terrorism issues. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 195 The agency's previous experience with requesting and rece iving funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for emergency response or disaster recovery has been favorable. However, FEMA reimbursement is available only for federally declared disasters; TAHC indicates that its need for disaster recovery funds also includes responses to disease outbreaks. A high-consequence disease or pest outbreak could exceed the agency's operating budget capacity quickly if the agency were required to provide diseas e response, mitigation, and indemnity for any herds or flocks that would require euthanization as part of disease mitigation. Figure 209 shows the agency's actual and pr ojected response hours for animal disease and disasters from fiscal years 2 017 to 2021. The agency's previous expe rience accessing funds for emergency and disease responses is shown in Figures 210 and 211.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The Texas Government Code, Section 418.043, and the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.0416, clarify the agency's role in planning and responding to disasters related to livest ock and poultry. However, statutes do not address the agency's role related to companion animals. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would hinder th e agency's ability to provide planning and coordination for the evaluation, transportation, sheltering, and care of large and small anim als during natural disasters and animal agriculture disease outbreaks. FIELD OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Field Operations Administration program performs the admi nistrative aspect of providing local services to livestock and poultry producers in the state; regulating veterinarians that are authorized to perform func tions involved in the agency's programs; and all animal health and epidem iology functions that are not connected to a specific species or emergency. This work supports the health of animal agriculture in Texas as a whole and includes field work and general paperwork, leave accounting, vehicle maintenance, meetings , and other administrative functions. TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 198 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Program staffing for the 2020-21 biennium consists of 79.2 perc ent of the total agency positi ons, or 174.5 FTE positions, as shown in Figure 215 . These positions include all animal health program inspectors and animal disease traceability staff. Staffing levels have increased from 109.0 FTE positions since fiscal year 2015 due to the outbreak of cattle fever ticks. The agency does not anticipate any changes that would affect the populations it serves or increase or decrease the demand for its services. FIGURE 215 FIELD OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION PR OGRAM FULL-TIME-EQUIVALENT POSITIONS 2020-21 BIENNIUM SOURCE : Texas Animal Health Commission. TAHC has experienced difficulties retaining livestock and poultr y inspectors because the annual salary for a state inspector position historically has been less than a comparable fede ral position. The agency rece ived funding for the 2020-21 biennium to provide salary increases of $3,600 annually to its 106.5 FTE inspec tor positions in the program to improve recruitment and retention. Consequently, the agency reported positive short-term effects on inspector turnover rates.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS INSPECTION FEES The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.060 (a), authorizes TAHC to assess fees for dairy calf health and inspection reports, livestock market inspections, sl aughter plant inspections, feedlot inspections, piroplasmosis inspections, tick inspections, livestock shipment inspections, and slaughter pl an inspections. The agency has expressed concerns about the negative impact of cost recovery mechanisms on animal disease surveillance programs. TAHC previously has not approved fee proposals, and the agency continues to provide these servic es without assessing fees that it is authorized to collect. Pursuant to current statutory authority, th e agency could assess fees for its inspecti on services and use the fee revenues for inspector retention, additional outreach efforts, information technology upgrades, or expanded animal disease traceability activities. Additionally, the agency could use fee revenu es to replace non-fee-generated General Revenue Funds appropriations. The Texas Government Code, Section 2001.0045, requires that any increase in fees is offset by an equal or greater decrease in costs to the industry served but provides an exemption if the cost is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Texas residents. TAHC's efforts to detect and mitigate tren ds in animal diseases that may be transmissible to humans may meet the exemption threshold and enable the agency to increase inspection fees for cost recovery without a corresponding decrease in revenue. SALARIES Agency study findings indicated that inspector salaries were less than those of comparable positions in Texas and federal government employment. Subsequently, TAHC received funding for the 2020-21 biennium to provide annual salary increases of $3,600 to its 106.5 FTE inspectors to improve recruitment and retention. In addition to $0.4 million in General Revenue Funds appropriations for th is purpose, the agency utilized $0.4 mi llion in existing appropriations from the Cattle Health program to provide a salary increase totaling $0.8 million for the biennium . The agency reports that the salary increase initially helped to decrease the turnover ra te for inspectors, boosted insp ector morale, and strengthened relationships among inspectors and prod ucers, which led to improved communica tion, compliance, and better customer service. For comparison, inspector turnover decreased from 31.8 percent during fisc al year 2019 to 11.8 percent for early fiscal year 2020. However, TAHC raised concerns that the re cent loss of three agency-trained employees to the USDA's Cattle Fever Tick program may indicate that the benefi cial effect of the increase has been short-lived. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 201 OUTDATED MEDICAL TREATMENTS TAHC reports difficulty complying with statutes that contain outd ated specific treatments for an imal diseases that conflict with modern medical approaches. For example, the Texas Agriculture Code, Section 167 .058, Treatment Intervals, specifies a 13-day treatment interval for animals with fever tick s, which conflicts with current best practices in treatment that call for a seven-day treatment interval. Removing specif ic animal disease treatments from statute and authorizing TAHC to establish appropriate treatments by rule would increa se the effectiveness of the program at no additional cost. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit signif icantly the state's ability to perform th e following responsibilities: detect and survey rapidly for reportable, foreign, and emerging disease trends and threats affecting livestock; respond to disease outbreaks; provide timely and accurate information; deve lop disease control and eradication plans; and advise on management of disease trends, potential threats, and mitigati on strategies based on information provided by the agency. Discontinuing the program also could affect federal cooper ative funding and indemnity and prohibit the movement of Texas livestock to other states entirely or without additional requirements and associat ed costs. The agency states that it is not possible to eliminate this program without eliminating all animal health programs, which would harm the state's animal agriculture industry and food supply. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE According to the agency, an additional $242,000, including $200,000 for fleet fu el and maintenance expenses and $42,000 for rent and utility expenses for the Rockdale regional offi ce, is necessary for the program to provide the minimum level of service. The agency reports utilizing 100.0 percent of its fee-generate d revenue for fleet fuel and ma intenance costs, the revenues from which are insufficient to cover the total projected costs for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. TAHC estimates that fuel costs will increase from 20.0 percent to 25.0 percent greater than fiscal year 201 9 expenditures, and maintenance expenses will increase commensurably. TAHC's current lease for the Rockdale region al office expires in fiscal year 2021, an d staff anticipate an increase in rent and utilities whether they decide to rema in in the current location or relocate.

The program responds to disease outbreaks; provides timely and accurate information; develops disease control and eradication plans; and advises on management of disease trends, potential threats and mitigation strategies. Initially, the program checked documentation only of equine in fectious anemia (Coggins) tests in locations where animals were being moved or congregated. Currently, it serves the owne rs of equines (horses, donkeys, and zebras), including those involved in breeding, racetracks, rodeos, and other exhibition s, by checking documentation of Coggins testing, equine Health Inspec tion Service/Veterinary Service (APHIS /VS) and Texas Racing Commission staff in carrying out these responsibilities. TAHC 's equine health work increases the abil ity for equine owners to participate in races, rodeos, and exhibitions, which ge nerates tourism revenue for the state. Figure 219 shows trends in equine diseases reported in Texas from calendar years 2012 to 2019.

SOURCE : U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspe ction Service. Texas shares a 1,248-mile border with four Mexican states and imports more live animals than any other U.S. state. Border security issues affect the legal importation of cattle and horses into Texas in the historic fever tick quarantine zone and in West Texas. TAHC and USDA personnel and U.S. Border Patrol agents often have captured livestock and horses entering Texas illegally from Mexico that have been diagnosed as dise ased or being infested with cattle fever ticks. Horses are included in the cattle fever tick eradication effort in South Texas because they are capable ho sts and carriers of the ticks. TAHC has coordinated with the USDA, local county entities, and veterinarians to respond to an outbreak of VSV that initially presented in a horse in El Paso County on April 23 , 2020. The virus was confirmed in horses and cattle in Starr County and in cattle in Zapata County on May 8, and subseq uently in horses and cattle in Hudspeth, Kerr, and McMullen counties on May 22. Infected animals remain quarantined until 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on each premises. As of May 22, 10 affect ed premises were confirmed, and animals in El Paso, Starr, and Zapata counties were released from quarantine. VSV typically is not lethal to affected animals, but it can result in economic losses for livestock producers by preventing the movement of animals and affecting international trade. Additionally, other countries may stop imports of certain animals and their products when cases are reported in the U.S. TAHC's Field Operations Administration program administers FTE positions rela ted to the Equine Health program.

SHEEP AND GOAT HEALTH The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.041; Animal Welfare Act , as amended, the U.S. Code, Title 7, Chapter 54, Sections 2131 to 2155; the federal Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, Public Law 107-171, Subtitle E, Sections 10401 to 10418; the federal Plant Protection Act, P ublic Law 106-224, the U.S. Code , Title 7, Chapter 104, Sections 7701 to 7772 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Sheep and Goat Health program rapidly detects, surveys, and responds to emerging disease trends, threats, and outbreaks affecting sheep and goats. The program also provides timely and accurate informat ion, develops disease control and eradication plans, and advises management of diseas e trends, potential threats, and mitigation strategies. The program serves sheep and goat producers in Texas by protec ting the health of these anim al populations from diseases including scabies and scrapie. As shown in Figure 222 , Texas is the largest U.S. produc er of sheep and lambs. Sheep and goat populations are increasing rapidly throughout the state, and the program's efforts affect the marketability of the animals and the economic conditions of the producers. TAHC staff coordinate with staff at USDA subsidiary branches, including the Animal and Plan t Health Inspection Service/Veterinary Service (APHIS/VS) regarding the scrapie certification program, the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to conduct re search, and Animal Care (APHIS/AC) regarding emergency management.

TAHC inspectors began inspecti ng sheep after scabies was identified in Texa s sheep in 1927. In 2001, the USDA initiated the National Scrapie Eradication Progra m (NSEP), which decreased the prevalence of scrapie by 85.0 percent. TAHC continues to participate in this effort by enforcing tagging requirements, collecting survei llance samples, and conducting disease investigations. The federal program has been successful ov erall, and no new cases of scrapie have been detected in Texas during the past three years. The agency states that diseases affecting small ruminants are de creasing and industry growth is increasing. In addition, new USDA identification and record keeping requirements for goats have increased to be equivalent with those for sheep. This trend will increase the demand for services as marketability and economic conditions improve for Texas producers. Texas has more goats than any other state, and al though the prevalence of scrapie appears to be low in Texas, it is present. The new requirements of the federal program will affect the agency and require cooperation and a strong working relationship with the goat industry in Texas.

CERVID HEALTH The Texas Agriculture Code, Sections 161.041 and 161.0541, and Chapter 167; the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part 55 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Cervid Health program works to further surveillance of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in native and exotic CWD- susceptible species, reduce the risk of introduction of CW D, and provide early disease detection. The program serves landowners, producers, and other stakeholders involved with na tive and exotic cervids. TAHC staff coordinate with USDA subsidiary agencies Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Nati onal CWD Herd Certification Program (HCP) for cervid disease survei llance and animal health, the Agricultural Rese arch Service (ARS), an d the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to place deer feeders loaded with ivermectin-t reated corn on refuge land. Additionally, TAHC must report the status and activities of enrolled herds and any action s taken by TAHC concerning program compliance and CWD detection to the APHIS/HCP. After CWD was discovered in Colorado during calendar year 1967, a voluntary CWD Status Program was established in compliance with national standards to perform disease surveillance and provide a means for producers to qualify their animals for interstate and international movement. The prog ram changed in 2012 when CWD was discovered in native mule deer in West Texas, and again in 2015 when it was foun d in a white-tailed deer breeder herd. In 2016, the first free- ranging exotic species case was found in el k. As of February 29, 2020, 170 cervid have tested positive in Texas since the first case in 2012. Native deer species (white-tailed deer and mule deer) are de fined in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 63.001, as game animals and not livestock. As such, they are owned by the state and are under the jurisdiction of the Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). Nonnative cerv id species such as elk, sika, red deer , nilgai antelope, and moose are defined as exotic livestock. The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 16 1.041 authorizes TAHC to act to eradicate or control any disease affecting exotic livestock, including situations when th e transmitting agent is an anim al species that is not within the agency's jurisdiction. TAHC's efforts to mitigate disease among exotic cervids protects the health and marketability of exotic and native cervid species . The program also collaborates with white-tailed deer and mule deer breeder permit holders and release-site managers to mitigate the risk of CW D transmission to susceptible exotic cervid species. TAHC and TPWD co-chair the CWD Task Force, which collabo rates with public and private stakeholders to develop rules and monitor and manage CWD-related issues. TPWD provid es biological information and statistics for native and TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 208 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 nonnative cervid species, and TAHC provides epidemiological expertise, certifies post-mortem tissue collectors, provides training in proper sample collection and submission, and ce rtifies veterinarians as ante-mortem tissue collectors. Both agencies approve herd plans, which are requirements for di sease testing and management established for deer-breeding facilities that have CWD-positive animal s. Both agencies coordinate to develop containment and surveillance zones in and around areas that have CWD and train agency staff and othe rs to collect samples for disease testing. The number of breeders under the voluntary herd certification program has gr own significantly from 238 herds in May 2016 to 318 herds in September 2018. Figure 225 shows the CWD zones established by TAHC and TPWD for disease detection, control, and eradication in high-risk areas. FIGURE 225 TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE ZONES, FEBRUARY 2017 Surveillance Zones Containment Zones SOURCE : Texas Animal Health Commission. On December 20, 2019, in response to th e confirmation of CWD in a free-ranging white-tailed deer in Val Verde County, TAHC established a fourth CWD High Risk Area Containm ent Zone encompassing the area between the U.S.-Mexico border, the city of Del Rio, and the International Amistad Reservoir. According to TAHC, the biological characteristics of CWD pose a challenge. The only official test is conducted post mortem, and the incubation period averages two years. Addition ally, the existence of infectious agents (prions) linger in the environment after a host leaves the location. CWD has no vaccine or treatment and eventually is fatal to a host. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 209 The agency reports that additional sta ff and funding would improve the program by enabling the agency to educate land owners and cervid breeders on signs of the disease and the risk associated with its proliferation; more effectively manage the CWD herd certification program, which is growing significantly ; and conduct detailed and complex disease investigations when CWD is detected in exotic or native cervids. Other notable diseases that affect cervids include tubercul osis, brucellosis, and cattle fever ticks. The state entry requirements established to protect agains t the incursion of tuberculosis and brucellosis in cervids remain relatively the same since their inception. Both native and exotic cervids are capable of serving as hosts of cattle fever ticks, perpetuating and spreading these pests to new areas. Cervid species have been included in cattle fever tick eradication efforts for decades, especially in recent years as they increasingly have become a significant focus of the tick eradication program. TAHC works cooperatively with USDA in the Cattle Fever Tick Eradic ation Program (CFTEP). The USDA conducts primary CFTEP activities in the permanent qu arantine zone, which serves as a buffer preven ting the movement of ticks from Mexico, and conducts primary CFTEP activities outside of the zone. The two agencies share resources, including staff resources, equipment, and supplies, as needed to address outbreaks and changes in CFTEP work demands. TAHC's Field Operations Administration program administers FTE positions rela ted to the Cervid Health program. These positions are generalist inspectors that perform daily functions for several programs.

SURVEILLANCE TESTING The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161; Animal Welfare Act, as amended, the U.S. Code, Title 7, Chapter 54, Sections 2131 to 2155; the federal Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 200 2, Public Law 107-171, Subtitle E, Sections 10401 to 10418; the federal Plant Protection Act, P ublic Law 106-224, the U.S. Code , Title 7, Chapter 104, Sections 7701 to 7772 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Surveillance Testing program conducts the administrative aspect of services performed by the State-Federal Laboratory, including surveillance testing of samples for diseases affecting the li vestock industry, the identification of parasite specimens, and other functions that are not associated with a specific species or emergencies. The Austin-based State-Federal Laboratory has operated since calendar year 1939. By the 1970s, multiple mobile and fixed labs were located around the state as a result of widespread bovine bruce llosis surveillance testing. After decreased sampling needs, increased commercial courier services, and incr eased testing efficiencies, the mobile and satellite labs were closed, and surveillance testing was consolid ated within the State-Federal Laboratory. The lab performs cattle and swine disease testing for private li vestock markets and small, private slaughterhouses. It also provides disease testing and identification for the USDA and all livestock brucellosis confirmation testing for TVMDL, an independent agency administered through the Texas A&M Un iversity System. The State-Federal Laboratory's clients consist mainly of TAHC veterinarians and inspectors and certain in-state private ve terinarians that requ est screening tests for movement qualification of livestock. Unlike TVMDL, the St ate-Federal Laboratory is not a full-service diagnostic lab. TAHC's authorization to collect fees for lab services pursua nt to the Texas Agriculture Co de, Section 161.060(b), expired at the end of fiscal year 2015. TAHC does not have any clear authority to collect fees for lab services. TVMDL and TAHC have an agreement not to compete and to coordinate as members of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) to assure the availability of su fficient laboratory competencies, capacities, and resiliencies to support nationally targeted surveilla nce for key, high-consequen ce endemic, emerging, and foreign livestock diseases. TAHC is required to report to the Legislature annually regarding its lab tests and explain how testing performed at its facility is more cost effective than using TVMDL.

Due to the significant decrease in bovine brucellosis sample testing, all surveilla nce testing could be performed by TVMDL through an Interagency Contract, decreasing duplicative effo rts and facilities. TVMDL is a full diagnostic lab and has achieved NAHLN Level 1 status. The April 2020 Sunset review for TAHC recommended closing the State-Federal Laboratory and designating TVMDL as the state's re gulatory animal health laboratory in statute. Transferring the laboratory to TVMDL could result in co nsolidated services and additional fee revenue. TAHC's authorization to collect fees for lab services expired at the en d of fiscal year 2015. Pursuant to the Texas Education Code, Section 88.707, TVMDL is authorized to collect fees for goods and services that its laboratories provide. Typically, TVMDL maintains low fees for agricultural livestock testing. TAHC estimates it could collect approximately $150,000 e a c h f i s c a l y e a r i f a u t h o r i z e d t o c o l l e c t f e e s f o r l a b s e r v i c e s , a n d T V M D L l i k e l y w o u l d c o l l e c t t h e s a m e a m o u n t i f i t performed the lab services. A transfer also could result in slower response times for regu latory testing. The State-Federal Laboratory is dedicated to regulatory testing and sample id entification. Laboratory staff provide expedited testing and identification services to TAHC field personnel, including inspectors, epid emiologists, and veterinarians. Additiona lly, transferring the capabilities of the State-Federal Laboratory to TVMDL would result in the TV MDL labs performing brucellosis confirmation testing on their own samples or paying additional costs to send th ese samples to other labs. USDA and NAHLN have certain guidelines related to confirmation testing, but it is unclea r if restrictions apply to TVMDL's conducting of brucellosis confirmation testing. FEE COLLECTION The Texas Agriculture Code, Section 161.060(a), which authorizes TAHC to assess inspection fees, could be amended to authorize the agency to collect fees for sample collectio n and surveillance for the livestock and poultry industries. Increasing fee revenue collections from laboratory services (e.g ., disease diagnosis, parasite identification) could result in a decreased reliance on non-fee-generated General Revenue Fu nds and Federal Funds for the Diagnostic Administration program. The agency estimates that it has foregone approxim ately $150,000 in fee revenue for services performed each fiscal year from 2016 to 2018. The Texas Government Code, Section 2001.0045, requires that any increase in fees is offset by an equal or greater decrease in costs to the industry served but provides an exemption if the cost is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Texas residents. TAHC's efforts to detect and mitigate tren ds in animal diseases that may be transmissible to humans may meet the exemption threshold and enable the agency to increase inspections fees for cost recovery without a corresponding decrease in revenue. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit the agency's ability to pe rform the administrative aspect of laboratory services that are not associated with a specific specie s or emergency. Eliminating the laboratory would affect the priority and timeliness of results for animal health programs. According to the agency , outsourcing tests would require associated costs, but these costs likely would be less than the cost of operating the lab considering the recent significant decrease in the number of specimens processed. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Central Administration program consists of gene ral administration, including commissioners, executive administration, internal audit expenses, human resources, financial services, publ ic information for employee and producer education, and government-industry relations. The program provid es direction, supervision, and support to the rest of the agency. TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 214 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The program began in calendar year 1893, when the commi ssioners and an executive director managed the agency. Currently, 13 commissioners, who represent all segments of th e livestock industry and the public, oversee and guide the agency's activities, including approving agency rules pursuant to the Texas Admi nistrative Code, Title 4, Part 2. The executive director oversees all key functions performed by th e agency in carrying out its core mission for all direct and indirect strategies. The executive director also serves as the State Veterinarian, a leader in animal agriculture issues at national and international levels.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit the agency's ability m eet its statutory requirements. The agency would be unable to hire, manage accounts receivable/pay able, process payroll, manage all employees, and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE The agency reports requiring an additional $18,000 for increases in rent and leases required to provide the minimum level of service. The additional funding would enable the agency to utilize existing General Revenue Funds appropriations for the program toward salaries, travel, consumables, and other oper ating expenses that have been decreased to fund increases in rent and leases. INFORMATION RESOURCES The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Information Resources program serves the agency by pr oviding online services, comp uter and phone support, and security for all agency electronic services , including servers, laptop computers, spec ialized laptop computers to support field inspectors, voice over Internet protocol phones, wireless phones, global positioning system technology, and handheld electronic devices.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING The agency's costs for technology support and maintenance in crease as technology advances and equipment ages. Older hardware often cannot run newer operating systems and presents support and security risks to the agency and the state. TAHC could replace and upgrade its information technology (IT) infrastructure and increase the program's efficiency if it implemented an IT life cycle replacement policy. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the program would limit th e agency's ability to communicate, repo rt, respond, and analyze disease and potential threats to the livestock industries of Texas due to the lack of IT and resources support. The agency states that it still would need to complete the same functions if the Inform ation Resources program were not funded, and it likely would place the IT employees and other expenses under Cent ral Administration, which would offset any savings. OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES The Texas Agriculture Code, Chapter 161 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Other Support Services program consists of indirect admi nistration services such as fleet management, fleet support, and records retention. The agency has a fleet of 109 vehicles, pr imarily light-duty trucks that are utilized by field inspector s, veterinarians, and epidemiologist to conduct field inspections. The program first centralized these operations in calendar year 1973. In fiscal year 1999, the agency was granted budget authority to purchase a fleet of light truc ks to serve the needs of field staff. The vehicle fleet has increased from 62 vehicl es in fiscal year 2015 to 109 vehicles in fiscal year 2020. SIGNIFICANT FINDING Currently, the agency does not have a fleet large enough to pr ovide each field inspector, veterinarian, and epidemiologist that works in the field with a vehicle. From December 2019 to February 2020, TA HC had 49 staff that were not assigned state vehicles and consequently were paid either mileage for pers onal vehicles or fuel for rental vehicles. The agency reports STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 217 needing an additional 33 vehicles to provide one each for inspectors, veterinarians, and epidemiologists working in the field. Although the agency has a goal to provide each field staff with a vehicle, TAHC also has indicated that staff struggles to track records for the agency's current fleet size. Therefore, additional staff would be required to address the more complex record-keeping responsibilities a ssociated with a larger fleet.

STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 221 TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 11 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The mission of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPW D) is to manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas and to provide hunting, fishing, and ou tdoor recreation opportunities for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. TPWD was established in 1963 when the State Parks Board and the Texas Game and Fish Commission were merged. The agency is governed by a nine-member commission appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate for staggered six-year terms. All commissi on members represent the public, and statute directs the Governor to attempt to include people with expertise in areas such as outdoor recreation, conservation, and historic preservation. TPWD fulfills its mission of conserving natural and cultural resources of the st ate and providing hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation opportunities through 28 active programs. The General Land Office's Interagency Contract for Coastal Erosion program was ended by the Eighty-fourth Legislature, 2015. For fiscal year 2020, the agency's full-time-equivalent position cap is 3,162.3 positions. SPORTING GOODS SALES TAX A significant source of General Revenue Funds and Genera l Revenue-Dedicated Funds for TPWD is from the Sporting Goods Sales Tax (SGST). SGST is not a separate tax, but rather is the estimated portion of state tax revenue collected from the sale of sporting goods. Senate Join t Resolution 24, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, approved by voters in November 2019, amended the Texas Constitu tion to automatically appropriate the net reve nue received each fiscal year from SGST to TPWD and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The amendment will take effect Se ptember 1, 2021, and will apply only to state tax revenue collected on or after that date. The amendment prohibits the appropriated SGST from being available for certification by the Comptroller of Public Accounts (CPA). The stated inte nt of the legislation was to provide a stable base of funding for Texas parks and historical sites. Despite the constitutional appropriation authority, state law requires the General Appropriations Act (GAA) to determine through which of the established SGST accounts the appropriations will be made. Pursuant to the Texas Tax Code, Section 151.801, 93.0 perc ent of the estimated amount of SGST may be appropriated to TPWD, with the remaining 7.0 percent available for approp riation to THC. House Bill 1422, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, the percentage from 94.0 percent avai lable for TPWD and 6.0 pe rcent available for THC. The Legislature first appropriated the proceeds from SGST to TPWD in the 1996-97 biennium, and from then until fiscal year 2008, the maximum amount of SGST that could be appropriated was limited to $64.0 million per biennium. Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the entire portion of SGST was available for appropriation. Although the Legislature has had the authority to appropriate the full am ount of SGST since fiscal year 2008, it has not always done so. For the 2020- 21 biennium, the Legislature appropriated $342.1 million to TPWD and THC, 100.0 percent of SGST estimated to be available, including $66.7 million for employee benefits and debt service payments. Figure 238 shows SGST funding for the 2018-19 and 2020-21 biennia.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 9, Game, Fish, and Wa ter Safety (Account No. 9), is used for various purposes, including funding for game wardens not specifically dedicated to border security activities, administration of hunting and fishing license sales, wildlife and fisher ies management, and capital projects relate d to wildlife and fisheries infrastructure . Revenue sources for Account No. 9 include the sales of licenses , stamps, fees, permits, and fines regarding game and fish; boat titling and registration fees; sales of marl, sand, shell, gravel, and mudshell; sales of property purchased with Account No. 9 funds; and others. Although Account No. 9 is a dedi cated account in the General Revenue Fund in the state Treasury, certain revenues deposited to the account have statut orily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. For example, as a condition of receiving federa l wildlife and sportfish restor ation funding, federal rules pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 50, Part 80, require all states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing licens e fees for purposes other than administra tion of the state's fish and wildlife Operations $227.0 (26.7%)(IN MILLIONS) TOTAL=$342.1STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 223 agency. This requirement is set in the Texas Parks and Wildli fe Code, Section 11.033, which specifies that the agency may only use the funds in Account No. 9 to manage fish and wild life resources of the state. Each program that includes appropriations from Account No. 9 includ es an overview of the fund's uses. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and to comply with laws an d conditions established in 50 CFR, Part 80. Appendix TPWD-A shows these subaccounts, their allowable uses, an d the 2020-21 biennial appropriated am ounts. Some revenues deposited into Account No. 9 are appropriated as Other Funds and allocated as Appropriated Receip ts and Other Funds. In the Biennial Revenue Estimate and Cost-out of the General Appropriatio ns Bills, CPA does not delineate the subaccounts but makes estimates for the entire account as a whole. This method can mask the actual amounts of funds available for general spending due to individual revenue restrictions for the su baccounts. However, TPWD monitors revenues deposited to, balances of, and expenditures from these subaccounts closely through its internal accounting system. TPWD has proposed several options to increase unrestricted revenue, including raising hunt ing and fishing license fees. House Bill 1896, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, removed a requir ement that the agency couple any increase in license fees with an equal or greater decrease in costs to hunters and anglers pursuant to House Bill 1290, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017. In addition, House Bill 448, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regu lar Session, 2017, made the transfer of up to 15.0 percent of boat titling and license fees from Account No. 9 to General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 64, State Parks (Account No. 64), an item of discretion for TPWD, and it has opted to retain th e revenue in Account No. 9. NEW PARKS T P W D o w n s f i v e t r a c t s o f l a n d t h a t a r e i n t e n d e d f o r f u ture parks and state natural areas, one of which is under construction. State parks are not self-suppo rting and require an appropriation from the Legislature. The state park system has seen increased utilization and has gene rated substantial revenue, but not enough to support the whole system. As work begins on new parks, funding for the system must be stretc hed further, requiring the agency to prioritize its limited resources. Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, located in Strawn, approximately 75 miles west of Fort Worth, is a 4,400-acre tract of land currently being developed for use as a state park. TPWD first purchased land for the park in 2011, and the City of Strawn donated additional land in 2014 . With an appropriation of $12.5 million in the 2020-21 General Appropriations Act, construction has begun on the park . TPWD does not yet have a specific da te by which the park will be complete. Bighorn Ranch, located in Calhoun County along the Gulf Coas t, is a 17,351-acre tract of land. A portion of this land will be developed in a wildlife management area, and the rema ining area into a state park. TPWD has begun developing a public plan, but no date has been set for the opening of the park. The Chinati Mountains State Natural Area, located in the Big Bend region, is a 38,137-acre tract that was donated to TPWD in 1996. TPWD has begun the public-use plan for the park, but no opening date has been set. The Albert and Bessie Kronkosky State Natural Area is loca ted in the Hill Country in Pipecreek. TPWD accepted the donation of 3,814 acres of land in 2011. No open ing date has been set for this state natural area. Davis Hill State Park, located in Liberty County near Houston, is a 1,700-acre tr act TPWD acquired in 1983. No opening date has been set for this park. PROGRAM ORGANIZATION TPWD has 28 active programs divided into five operational areas: Law Enforcement, Conser vation and Licensing, State Parks and Grants, Capital Improvements, and Administration and Other. The prog rams discussed in this chapter are ordered by program area and listed within the ar ea according to the agency's program rankings. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS The State Park Business System (SPBS) contract vendor payment agreement requires the vendor to receive 4.0 percent of net revenue collected through the SPBS. An is sue could arise if required payments exceeded amounts budgeted for this purpose. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 224 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The Parks Support program is subsidized with the use of volunteer labor, which was valued at $9.3 million in fiscal year 2019. There are currently more than 30 state park sites withou t designated interpretive staff positions to explain the meaning and significance of natural an d cultural resources at parks, which reduces the capacity for outreach, education, and awareness. Additional funding for exhibits, support spec ialist staff, and equipment could increase State Parks Visitor Services program effe ctiveness and support visitors with disabilities. No specific appropriations have been made to fund the statutory directive to promote recreational water safety in the state. Game wardens are responsible for investigat ing and reporting all reportable boating accidents in a federal database to remain compliant with federal regula tions, but local jurisdictions that investigate sometimes do not report to TPWD in a timely manner, causing dela ys in reporting in the federal database. These delays could result in the agency losing a portion of its fe deral grant from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). Amending sections of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 31 , to specify that all fatal and serious bodily injury boating accidents must be investigated by Texas game wa rdens would expedite reporting in the federal database and avoid this potential loss of revenue. Fees charged for boater education currently are deposi ted into the General Revenue Fund, rather than the General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 9, and are not ap propriated to the agency. As of January 1, 2020, online boater education course vendors are now required to send a $10 fee per student to the state. TPWD estimates that this fee will generate $255,000 in fiscal year 2021. In addition, requir ing paddlecraft operators to take boater education could generate $4.7 million, re ducing boating fatalities and game warden search-and- rescue operation hours. Among taxes collected for boat and boat motor sales and us e, 5.0 percent is deposited to the credit of Account No. 9 for use by TPWD. The remainder is deposited to the General Revenue Fund. Payments to license agents, tax assessor collectors, an d license vendors have consistently exceeded amounts estimated by the agency each fiscal year in the License and Boat Revenue program. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, amended the Texa s Government Code, Section 2001.0045, to remove a requirement that the agency couple any increase in licens e fees with an equal or greater decrease in costs to hunters and anglers and to authorize TPWD to charge a fee for participation in the Managed Lands Deer Program. Appropriated revenues and unexpended balances (UB) from oyster shell recovery and cultch replacement receipts are not being spent for the pu rpose for which they are collected each biennium due to the second fiscal year ending before the funds can be encumbered. TPWD does not have the same statutory specialty li cense plate design authority as the private vendor contracted by the state. Providing the same authority would increase the agency's opportunity to generate additional license plate revenue. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.027 1 and 11.0272, which were last updated in 1997, authorize the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to charge Public Huntin g, Fishing, and Other Participation Fees up to the statutory cap of $25 to cover the cost of operating public drawings. Amending statute to increase the cap would allow the agency to ge nerate additional revenues for the Hunting and Wildlife Recreation program. The maximum amount for criminal penalties assessed after conviction of a criminal offense in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code has not been updated in more than 20 years. TPWD is evaluating the effects of merging the law enfo rcement functions of the State Parks Division with the Law Enforcement Division, of which the Enforcement program is one component. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 225 According to the agency, low park police officer salaries and salary inequities with other state law enforcement officers directly affect the agency's ability to recr uit and retain a diverse team of qualified officers. New rider language in the GAA for the 2020-21 biennium could increase flexibility for the agency in spending SGST funds by: (1) enabling the agency to seek approval to reallocate and reprioritize SGST appropriations in TPWD's budget during a biennium to authorize the agency to acquire strategic tracts of land that become available for purchase under unique opportunities; (2) prioritizing the allocation of any additional SGST funding received during the 2022-23 biennium greater than amounts appropriated for routine, cyclical, and preventive maintenance at facilities in state parks; and (3) providing UB authorit y from any remaining SGST funding not expected to be available at the end of th e 2020-21 biennium to be used for the purposes of recreation grant funding so that fund s would be carried forward into the 2022-23 biennium instead of lapsing back to the Treasury. The agency experienced a lack of UB authority for General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds across biennia, resulting in a shorter period to deci de either to accept a project contract bid at a higher price than planned or budgeted or to divert available funding to smaller pr ojects to establish contracts within appropriation timelines. Amending statute to increase the minimum contract le vel from $100,000 to $150,000 before a performance bond is required prior to awarding a public award cont ract could attract more bidde rs, increasing competition and possibly resulting in cost savings to the state. The agency has not incorporated life-cycle methods of re pair, replacement, and preventive maintenance into its facility management practices. TPWD should implemen t a practice of using strategic investments or best practice replacements in repairing and maintaining its facilities, which could reduce overall costs and improve park conditions. The agency estimates that an additional $41.9 million each fiscal year would be needed to manage Texas' most problematic aquatic invasive species. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.035, could be amended to authorize the expenditure of funds from Account No. 64 for Aquatic Vegetati on and Invasive Species Management program purposes. The Legislature could consider lowering the matching requirement for the Small Communities Park Grant from 50.0 percent to 25.0 percent. According to TP WD, many small local communities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants would favor the opportunity to participate in the program. The Legislature could consider amending the Texas Pa rks and Wildlife Code, Sections 24.009 and 24.059, regarding reporting requirements related to recreation al grants. According to TPWD, staff and operational resources are consumed unnecessarily for both TPWD and affected local governments in meeting this requirement. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of st atutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be greater than or less than existing fu nding levels. The agency chose to maintain the current level of funding for this exercise for all programs. Figure 240 shows the sources of TPWD fu nding for the 2020-21 biennium.

TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 230 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 ENFORCEMENT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.0181, 11.019 to 11.0201, 12.101 to 12.119, Chapter 31, Chapter 91; provisions o f the Texas Penal Code; the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Art icle 2.12(10); the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 701, 703 to 71 2, 742, 757a to g, 1531 to 1544, 1801 to 5207, and 6 901 to 6992k; the U.S Code, Title 33, Sections 1251 to 1387 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Enforcement program enforces game and fish laws through public education, pr eventive patrols, and apprehension of violators. TPWD maintains 29 law enforcem ent offices throughout the state. These offices provide services to the public such as sale of licenses, boat registrati on and titling, and education. The program also includes wildlife theft and poaching, marine theft, covert and environmental crimes initiati ves, disaster response, and Homeland Security efforts. The program serves hunters, anglers, boaters, commercial fi shermen, private landowners, and the public. It provides resource users with information and educational programs rega rding rules, regulations, seas ons, and bag limits, and it provides aggressive education efforts and stringent enfo rcement of hunter and boater education requirements. Subsequently, the Enforcement program has added natural disaster response and bord er security to its concentration areas. For fiscal year 2020, TPWD has budgeted for 557.5 game warden full-time-equivalent (F TE) positions. Game wardens serve many essential purposes. They maintain a presence on th e Texas-Mexico border to deter and detect criminal activity, including the illegal taking of wildlife, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and transpor t and commerce in wildlife and endangered species and plants. For the 2020-21 biennium, 90 game wardens, or 16.1 percent of all budgeted game wardens, are assigned to conduct law enfo rcement activities in border counties, in cluding those sharing a land border with Mexico and counties on the Gulf Coast; an additional 49 game wardens will be de dicated to the area for enhanced border security activities. During disasters, the game wardens also pl ay an important role in public safety and rescue operations. During Hurricane Harvey, for example, game wardens pe rformed more than 12,000 rescues and welfare checks. Figure 244 shows border security appropriatio ns for fiscal years 2010 to 2021.

According to the agency, game wardens are la cking in the latest technologies, such as computer-aided dispatch, global positioning system, in-c ar automation, and unmanned aerial ve hicles. The agency asserts that these technologies are essential for officer safety and real-time situ ational awareness. Senate Bill 500, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, provided $5.0 million in Other Fund s from the Economic Stabilization Fund to purchase radios capable of statewide interoperability.

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS CRIMINAL PENALTIES A revenue source generated by the Enforcement Program is Co mptroller revenue object code 3449, Game and Fish, Water Safety, and Parks Violations. These criminal penalties are collec ted from those convicted of a criminal offense in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code. The maximum amounts for penaltie s have not been updated since 1997 for misdemeanors and 2009 for felonies. Total revenue during the 2018-19 biennium from this revenue source was $3.7 million, of which $3.5 million is attributable to the Enforcemen t program. Increasing the maximum penaltie s could result in greater revenues for TPWD and, if so appropriated, to the Enforcement program specifically. POTENTIAL MERGER OF LAW ENFORCEM ENT FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE AGENCY Game wardens focus on enforcin g g a m e a n d f i s h l a w s t h r o u g h o u t t h e s t a t e ; h o w e v e r , s t a t e p a r k p o l i c e p r o v i d e l a w enforcement services specifically to 89 stat e parks, consisting of more than 630,000 acres of park land. Additionally, state park police provide law enforcement and public safety se rvices in local communities when called upon and provide emergency and disaster response assistance across the state. TPWD recently has begun to consider merging the law enforc ement functions of the State Parks Division with the Law Enforcement Division. Consideration has been limited to ex amining whether a unified command structure would result in efficiencies, enhancements, and added value to the agen cy mission and has not included examination of budgetary impacts. Additional study will be required by the agency to address the more complex questions of funding mechanisms, budget structure, and hu man resource impacts. TIMELY REPORTING OF BOATING ACCIDENTS Game wardens are responsible for investigat ing and reporting all fatal and serious bodi ly injury boating accidents to remain compliant with federal regulations. TPWD is the only agency in the state with access to the USCG Boating Accident Reporting Database (BARD) for reporting of marine casualti es. However, in cases where local jurisdictions investigate accidents and do not notify TPWD, the local jurisdiction mu st generate and submit a report to TPWD for entry into BARD by TPWD administrative support staff. This process decr eases the timeliness of reporting and often requires follow- up discussions with the investigators. TPWD receives appr oximately $3.8 million annually from the USCG, which grades TPWD on the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of repo rting marine casualties in BARD. Should TPWD receive a subpar score in reporting, USCG could withhold up to 25.0 percent of the annual award. While USCG has not previously withheld any portion of TPWD's annual award, it recently has issued updated instructions for review of these awards that emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely reporting. The agency asserts that this problem could be avoided by amending sections of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chap ter 31, to specify that all fatal and serious bodily injury boating accidents must be investigated by Texas game wardens, which would allow fo r more accurate and timely reporting. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 234 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM If the Enforcement program were disconti nued, TPWD reports that natural resour ces would go unprotected from overuse and misuse throughout the entire state and waterways, includ ing 200 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Game wardens no longer would have the ability to ensure compliance of permits and license holders throughout the state. Additionally, the agency asserts that public safety would be diminished throughout the entire state because game wardens serve a vital role in this effort, especially in the areas of water safety, homeland security, and emergency management. Loss of game wardens for education, prevention, and enforcement of water safety laws could result in increases in boating- related fatalities, injuries, and property damage, which the enforcement program works to decrease. Because game wardens play an important role in disaster search -and-rescue operations throughout the entire state, in both small-scale and large-scale responses, the eradication of the pr ogram could increase the possibility of loss of life and proper ty during natural or huma n-caused emergencies. LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.019-11.0201, Sec tions 12.101 to 12.119, 12.201 to 12.206, and Chapter 31; provisions of the Texas Penal Cod e; the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 2.12(10); the U.S. Code, Title 16, Section 7 42, Section 757a-g, Sections 1531 to 1544; Section 701, Sections 70 3 to 712, Sections 1801 to 1882, Sections 5201 to 5207, and Sections 6901 to 6992k; the U.S. Code, Title 33, Sections 1251 to 1387 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Law Enforcement Support program includes overall manage ment of the law enforcement division, including regional operations, budget and administrative support, and development, coordinati on and implementation of policies, procedures, and programs. Major oversigh t programs include Wildlife Enforcemen t, Fisheries Enforcement, and Marine Safety Enforcement. In providing these support services, the program serves hunt ers, anglers, boaters, nonconsumptive users, commercial fishermen, private landowners, visitors, and all Texans. Program staff work closely with federal and state agencies, as well as local entities. This includes the U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Federa l Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Depart ment of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Texas Department of Pu blic Safety, Texas Office of the Attorney General, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, Texas Division of Emergency Ma nagement, and all local police and sheriff's departments. The agency reports that the only major ch ange to the program since its inception ha s been increased use of technology to enable better communication, planning, and follow-through, all of which contributes to better oversight and guidance for agency personnel. Internal and external factors affecting th is program include an increased demand fo r coordination with other agencies on homeland security, border operations, and disaster relief ac tivities, and with other divisions and field offices regarding statutory interpretation and enforcement policies, while maintaining oversight on norm al operational activities.

In the event of a shortage in eligible revenu es, additional funding would need to come from other sources such as Unclaimed Refunds of Motorboat Fu el Tax (URMFT) or General Revenue Funds. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates gene rated in fall 2019, the unrestricted subaccount for Account No. 9 is estimated to receive $240.1 milli on in revenues during the 2020-21 bie nnium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 mi llion. In addition, the agency reports in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using th ese revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD- B. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to the agency, discontinuation of the Law Enfo rcement Support program would render the Law Enforcement division incapable of meeting its mission. This could result in depletion of the state's natu ral resources and could pose a significant risk to public safety.

The training center offers continuing education training to game wardens and training to outside law enforcement entities. By prov iding training to game wardens, this program ultimately serves hunters, anglers, boaters, noncon sumptive users, commercial fish ermen, private landowners, and the public, all of whom benefit from law enforcement activiti es. Beginning in fiscal year 2015, new parks peace officers also began training through this program. The training center is operating at ma ximum capacity to replace game wardens and park police officers. The Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) conducts evaluations, audits, and inspections for compliance with TCOLE training, hiring, and retention rules. The most rece nt evaluation was conducted in August 2019 with no negative findings. The National Association of State Boating Law Administra tors (NASBLA) conducts a triennial training program compliance review of TPWD accreditation under its Boat Oper ations and Training Program to confirm that all policies and procedures are in place and being followed. NASBLA had no findings on TPWD's review that took place in late fiscal year 2015 and TPWD was re-accredited for fiscal years 2016 to 2019.

GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY The primary source of funding for the program is from unre stricted revenues deposited in Account No. 9. The account contains several subaccounts to ensure ex penditures are made from allowable source s and comply with laws and conditions, such as federal rules in 50 CFR, Part 80. The program relies primarily on revenu e from the unrestricted subaccount for Account No. 9. In the event of a shortage in eligible revenu es, additional funding would need to be provided from other sources such as Unclaimed Refunds of Motorboa t Fuel Tax (URMFT) or General Revenue Funds. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates gene rated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $240.1 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 million. In addition , the agency reports in its Stra tegic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using these revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD-B . ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Game Warden Training program would result in TPWD being unable to provide game wardens with a high degree of training in communities throughout Texas. If the facility and its staff were discontinued, the agency would need to pay outside training agencies to pr ovide a similar degree of specialized training.

Park police officers are distinct from game wa rdens in the law enforcement program area, although they also are trained at the Game Warden Academy. State park police pr ovide law enforcement services to 89 state parks, consisting of more than 630,000 acres of park la nd, and more than 8.6 million visitors per year. Additionally, they provide law enforcement and public safety services in local communities when called upon and provide emergency and disaster response assistance across the state. Populations served include park users, hunters, angler s, boaters, and the public. In the past, law enforcement staffing at state parks was minimal and positions had dual-function law enforcement and management and/or maintenance job duties. The number of officers reached a high of 188.0 FTE positions in fiscal year 2015 because of the growing number of pa rk visitors and the increasing need fo r immediate law enforcement services. The decrease in officers since then to the current level of 143.0 positions is due primarily to an agency decision in fiscal year 2015 to no longer hire dual-function officers (i.e., park su perintendents and assistant superintendents). As a result, there has been a subsequent decrease in the existing dual-function posi tions through natural attrition. In 2014, newly hired state park police officers began atte nding and completing law enforcement training at the Texas Game Warden Academy. The Eighty-fourth Legislature, 2015, provided specific funding directed at reorganizing the supervision and operational structure of the State Park - Law Enforcement - Public Safety program. The new operational structure consists of dedicated state park police position s and supervisory staff that ar e tasked with providing law enforcement services to state parks, local communities, and the state. For fiscal year 2020, 142.0 state park police officers positions are budgeted, and for fiscal ye ar 2021, 143.0 positions are budgeted. State park police officer workload increases with growing stat e park visitation. Various public safety challenges to TPWD sites require qualified, trained, and effective state park police officers to carry out the department's mission.

STATE PARK POLICE OFFICER SALARIES According to the agency, low police officer salaries and salary inequities with other state law enforcement officers diminish the program's ability to recruit and retain a diverse team of qu alified officers. State park police officers currently are paid under the Salary Schedule B classification, while other state law enforcement officers are paid higher salaries under a Schedule C classification. POTENTIAL MERGER OF LAW ENFORCEM ENT FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE AGENCY TPWD is considering the effects of merging the law enforc ement functions of the Law En forcement Division with the State Parks Division, of which the State Park - Law En forcement - Public Safety program is one component. Consideration has been limited to examining whether a un ified command structure would result in efficiencies, enhancements, and added value to the agency mission and has not included examination of budgetary impacts. Additional study will be required by the agency to address the more co mplex questions of funding mech anisms, budget structure, and human resource impacts. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 241 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the State Park - Law Enforcem ent - Public Safety program could have negative effects in several areas. The presence of dedicated law enforcement officers in parks serves as a deterrent to unlawful behavior and minimizes the effects o f s u c h b e h a v i o r w h e n i t d o e s o c c u r . I f t h e p r o g r a m w e re discontinued, state parks wo uld be reliant on local law enforcement departments for public safety. With the majority of state parks located in rural areas, an additional burden would be placed on county sheriff departments or TWPD game wardens that would have difficulty responding to incidents in a timely manner. With a lack of onsite law enforcement, it is possible that un lawful visitor behavior could increase, with adverse impacts to both natural and cultural resources of the parks, such as the destruction of histor ic resources or looting of archeological sites. In addition, without the assurance of proper law enforc ement, public perception of state parks as a safe place for family recreation could be diminished, whic h could result in reduced park visitation. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.0181, Sections 12 .001 and 12.013, Chapters 43, 44, 45, 49, 61, 62, 64, 65, 67, 6 8, 71, 81, and 83; the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 669 to 669i, Sections 703 to 712, Sections 718 to 718j, Sections 753a to 753 b, Sections 1531 to 1544, Section 1600, and Sections 4601 to 4611; the U.S. Code, Title 33, Sections 1251 to 1387 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Wildlife Conservation program provides for the regu lation and management of game and nongame species and protection of endangered, threatened, and rare species. The program is responsible for the management and operation of Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) established to perform research on wildlife populations and habitat, provide education on resource management, and provide outdoor re creation opportunities to the public. The program also conducts wildlife and harvest surveys, faci litates collaboration with universities to conduct research, issues permits to take and hold captive wildlife, develops wetlands and other habitats , and assesses the effects of human activities on wildlife. The Wildlife Conservation program was founded in 1946 and initially focused on regulatory and law enforcement-related issues. Since then, the program has focuse d more on science and cons ervation-based efforts and incorporated research and adaptive management as a fundamental basis for decision making. TPWD promot es the conservation of some 40,000 species of nongame and rare wildlife, including more than 200 federally or state-listed endangered, threatened, or candidate species from Texas, as well as providing co nservation assistance to people interested in these species. The program is affected by population growth, land fragmentation, wildlife diseas e management, and invasive species, all of which present challenges for native wildlife species and require adaptations in how program staff manage wildlife. TPWD establishes WMAs corresponding to habitats and wildlife populations representative of each ecological region of Texas. One of the most significant aspects of WMAs is the demonstration of practical management techniques to private landowners, who control more than 95.0 percent of the st ate's habitat. TPWD manages 50 WMAs, 49 of which are currently open to the public. According to the agency, the remaining WMA will open after necessary infrastructure has been constructed. TPWD also reports that new infrastructu re (e.g., bunkhouses, check stations, fencing) and general maintenance and repair projects are needed on WMAs. TPWD includes white-tailed deer, mule d eer, pronghorns, desert bighorn sheep, javeli nas, and alligators in its efforts to research and manage big game species in Texas through its Big Game Program. Restoration efforts for desert bighorn sheep, pronghorns, and mule deer have been especially active since calendar year 2010, and successfully have reintroduced those species to unoccupied habitat or boosted the number of animals in the po pulation for sustainability. The agency offers various permits affording landowners and managers more flexibility to meet their management needs. TPWD manages both migratory game birds and upland game birds and their habitats through its Small Game Program. Migratory game birds such as ducks, geese, cranes, and dove s are managed and regulated by international treaties among the United States, Canada, Mexico, Russia, and Japan. For upla nd game birds, the agency focuses management initiatives TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 242 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 on resident upland game birds to maximize recreational oppo rtunity and to conserve the diversity of ecological resources within the state. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a degenerative neurological di sease affecting deer, elk, and other cervids. The disease is similar to bovine spongiform en cephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle or scra pie in sheep, but is transmissible only to other cervid species. According to data maintained by TPWD, as of February 29, 2020, 170 deer have tested positive for CWD in Texas. The first captive deer to test positive for CWD in a postmortem test was from a facility in Medina County in June 2015. This positive test led the Animal Health Commission (TAHC) an d TWPD to develop a revision of deer breeder permitting rules and movement restrictions that took effect in August 2016. Native deer species are defined as game animals and not livestock in the Texas Parks and Wildli fe Code, Section 63.001; therefore, TAHC is involved in CWD response in multiple ways. Nonnative cervid species such as elk, sika deer, red deer, nilgai antelope, and moose are classified as exotic livestock, and the Texas Agriculture Code , Section 161.041, authorizes TAHC to act to eradicate or control any disease affecting exotic livestock, including when th e agent of transmission is an animal species outside of the agency's jurisdiction, such as a native mule deer or whit e-tailed deer. TAHC and TPWD co-chair the CWD Task Force, which works with public and private stakeholders in develo ping rules and monitoring and managing CWD-related issues. TPWD provides biological information and statistics for native and nonnative cervid species, and TAHC provides epidemiological expertise. Both agencies approve herd plans, which are requirements for disease testing and management established for deer-breeding facilities that have CWD-posi tive animals. Both agencies also coordinate to develop containment and surveillance zones in and around areas that have CWD and to train agency staff and others to collect samples for disease testing.

The agency is the sole source of this information. The Wildlife Conservation program is funded in part with appropriations from unrestri cted Account No. 9 revenues. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates gene rated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $240.1 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 million. In addition , the agency reports in its Stra tegic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using these revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD-B . ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Because the Wildlife Conservation program has so many component programs and activities, the repercussions of discontinuing the program would be far-reaching and would incl ude: elimination of all wildli fe-related research, closure of all WMAs, elimination of the capacity to manage both big game populations and small game populations (including migratory and upland game birds), elimination of population rest oration efforts leading to an increase in the possibility of extinction for certain species, failure to fulfill the agency's statutory mandate to conduct scientific surveys and make management recommendations regarding vari ous plants and wildlife, and a reduced ab ility to prevent and control emerging novel pathogens, including rabbit hemorrhagic disease and white nose syndrome. Additionally, the agency no longer would be able to fulfi ll its statutory mandate to provide recommendations to protect fish and wildlife resources to local, stat e, and federal agencies that approve, pe rmit, license, or construct developmental projects. The agency conducts more than 1,200 such reviews per year. Failure to conduct these environmental reviews would prevent federal and state agencies, including the Rail road Commission of Texas and the Texas Water Development Board, from fulfilling federal obligations. COASTAL FISHERIES RESOURCE MANAGEMENT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 12.001, 12.0011, 12 .015, and 12.024; Chapters 47, 61, 66, 76, 77, 78, 79, and 83; Sport Fish Restoration Act, als o known as Dingell-Johnson Act o f 1950, the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 777-777m Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Coastal Fisheries Resource Management program includes three field offices that conduct resource and harvest monitoring to provide for status assessments of finfish, shri mp, crab, and oyster populations and environmental conditions within marine waters. The program also provides manageme nt and oversight of the Coastal Fisheries Division. The program acts on behalf of all Texans, spec ifically the state's 1.2 million saltwater an glers, to protect, restore, and enhance state coastal fisheries and habitat resources. Since its inception, several changes have affected the progra m. TPWD has expanded geographic monitoring to include all eight major bay systems, expanded oyster resource sampling to determine area openings an d closings, and incorporated vertical and bottom longline sampling in stat e and federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Numerous factors affect the program, including sea-level rise, whic h can result in loss of habitat; a national increase in the number of people who fish; and natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey.

REVENUES FROM OYSTER SHELL RECOVERY AND CULTCH REPLACEMENT Appropriated revenues and unexpended bala nces (UB) from oyster shell recovery and cultch replacement receipts are not being spent for the purpose for which they are collected each biennium due to the second fiscal year ending before the funds can be encumbered. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, GAA, 2020-21 Biennium, Article VI, Parks and Wildlife Department, Rider 27, Appropriation of Oyster Shell Recovery and Cultch Replacement Receipts, authorizes the use of receipts from the sale of oyster shell recovery tags and oyster cultch replacement fees for the recovery and enhancement of public oyster reefs. Although the rider authorizes any UB at the end of fiscal year 2020 to be appr opriated for the same purpose for fiscal year 2021, it does not authorize TPWD to us e receipts that accumulated during the previous biennium. The agency reports that, due to the nature of oyster cultch placement activities, which often necessit ate accumulation of a sufficient balance before initiating activities, the current two-year cycle limits the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. 0102030405060708090100 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Projected ActualSTRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 249 The Legislature typically does not provide authority to transf er UB across biennia due to the additional costs realized during the subsequent biennium. The agency reports that mo difying the rider language to authorize access to UB across biennia would enable more effective programmatic decisions an d ensure that TPWD is able to use the funds consistent with legislative intent and expectations of the commercial enti ties that are paying the fees. Alternatively, the Legislature could choose to include either all or a part of the amount laps ed in the subsequent year's starting appropriations if it decided against excluding the lapsed amount. GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements.

Saltwater Sportfishing Stamp revenues are accounted for in on e of the separate subaccounts maintained and monitored by TPWD within Account No. 9. TPWD supp orts maintaining this dedicated and re liable source of funding to provide program stability and flexibility to respond to long-term need s. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in the fall of 2019, this suba ccount is estimated to receive $18.6 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $7.2 million. In addition, the agency reported in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 bie nnium that it anticipates usin g these revenues to fund the following programs: (1) Coastal Fisheries Resource Management; (2) Coastal Fisher ies Science and Policy Resources; and (3) Coastal Hatcheries Operations. The program is funded in part with appropriations from unrestricted Account No. 9 revenues.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Coastal Fisheries Resour ce Management program would result in TPWD losing the ability to manage the state's marine resources, as required by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 12 .001 and 12.015, and Chapters 61, 66, 76, 77, and 83. Additionally, the agency would no longer collect 7,100 annual population samples, more than 1,000 recreational and commercial harvest surveys, or biologic al fishery data from more than 300 seafood dealers. The state would also no longer be in compliance with federal la w regarding Fish Restoration Projects and Commercial Fisheries Research. The agency reports that discontinuing the program could also jeopardize the sustainability of the $2.0 billion saltwater recreational fishery and the $1.1 bi llion saltwater commercial fishery. FRESHWATER FISHERIES CONSERVATION The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.0181; Sections 12 .0011, 12.010, and 12.015; and Chapters 47, 61, and 66 Mission Centrality -Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Freshwater Fisheries Conservation pr ogram conducts surveys of fish populati ons, habitats, and anglers; develops fisheries management and stocking plans; conducts fish ha bitat enhancements; performs applied research; and performs public outreach on the state's freshwater fisheries resources. The program operates in all public bodies of water in Texas. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 250 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The program operates under state authorit y, with financial support provided by numerous federally authorized grant programs administered by the U.S. Department of Interior. The program manages freshwater fisheries re sources in 1,200 public reservoirs and in all major river systems statewide. Its primary goal is maintaining public fishing opportunities th rough surveys, planning, and applied fisheries management actions that protect or enhance Texas fisheries resources. It su pports quality of life for all Texas citizens, as fishing is important for outdoor recreation and food, and to loca l and statewide economies. According to the agency, fisheries m a n a g e m e n t ac t i v i t i e s h e l p t o s us t a i n r e c r e a t i o n a l f i s h e r i e s i n T e x a s t h a t r e s ul t i n a t l e a s t $9 6 0. 0 m i l l i o n i n t r i p a n d equipment expenditures annually. Availability of federal funding and new re servoir construction across Texas led to growth in this program during the late 1960s. As the Texas population continues to grow, additional emphasis has been placed on managing fisheries in urban areas of the state to include smaller reservoirs and rivers. The program is affected by population growth, increased water demands, degr adation and loss of fish habitats, and introduction and expansion of invasive species, all of whic h contribute to an increasing need for applied fisheries management activities that sustain freshwater fisheries resources and fishing opportunities.

GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY State funding for the Freshwater Fisheries Conservation program operations is provid ed through General Revenue- Dedicated Game, Fish, and Water Safety Account No. 9. One of the subaccounts in Account No. 9 is the Freshwater Fish Stamp, and TPWD has allocated revenues from that subacco unt to two programs: (1) Capi tal Construction and Project Delivery, and (2) Inland Hatcheries Operations. According to th e agency, the Freshwater Fish Stamp includes eligible uses and revenues that could be invested in the Freshwater Fi sheries Conservation program to further enhance freshwater fisheries resources through such measures as access im provements, habitat enhancements, and fish stocking. Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and comply with laws and conditions established in 50 CFR, Part 80. As a condition of receiving federal wildlife and sportfish restoration funding, these rules require a ll states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing licen se fees for purposes other than administration of the state's fish and wildlife agency.

TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 252 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Freshwater Fisheries Conservation program would result in elimination of science-based fisheries management and conservation activities performed on Texas' pu blic waters, including fish po pulation and harvest surveys, habitat surveys, public access surveys, re search studies, public outreach programs , fish habitat improvements, fish harvest regulations, fish stocking, and related communications with the public and agency partners on these matters. Additional impacts could include reduced fishing quality, degradation of aquatic habitat, reduced ecolog ical function, reduced public access, loss of recreational opportunities, expansion of aquatic invasive species, an d negative consequences to state and local economies. TECHNICAL GUIDANCE The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.0181, Section 12. 025, and Chapter 81; Agricultural Act of 2014; Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (U.S. C ode, Title 16, Sections 669 to 669i); Endangered Species Act (U.S . Code, Title 16, Sections 15 31 to 1544) Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Technical Guidance program provides assistance and in formation to private landowners and the public regarding programs such as the Private Lands and Public Hunting program and the Managed Lands Deer Program (MLDP). The Private Lands and Public Hunting program supports landowne rs engaging in voluntary habitat conservation practices through a written wildlife management plan. The MLDP suppo rts sound management and stewardship of native wildlife and wildlife habitats on private lands. Landowners enrolled in either the MLDP Harvest Option or Conservation Option may take advantage of extended season leng ths and liberalized harvest opportunities. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, implemented two recomme ndations regarding the MLDP that were presented in the agency's 2019 Strategic Fiscal Review. Senate Bill 733 auth orized the Parks and Wildlife Commission to establish and collect a fee for participation in the MLDP. Revenues collected from the fee are deposited to the credit of Account No. 9. The amounts projected to be collected from participatin g landowners are appropriated to TPWD. House Bill 1896 exempted TPWD from the Texas Governme nt Code, Section 2001.0045, which requires that any increase in fees be coupled with an equal or greater decrease in costs to user s. TPWD has estimated that the new MLDP fee will generate $1.3 million each fiscal year that will be credited to Account No. 9. Additionally, the Technical Guidance program provides certain cost-share assistance, primarily utilizing federal funding, through the Landowner Incentive Program. According to the agency, more than 8,000 landowners operating almost 32.0 million acres in the state have received these services from TPWD. The agency currently supports 7,224 wildlife management plans on 31.4 million acres across the state. According to the agency, economic conditions can affect a landowner's ability to implement technical guidance. The Urban Technical Guidance Program's recommendations re duce municipal maintenance costs and improve local economies. Technical guidance has been an integral part of TPWD's operations since the agency's inception. The Urban Technical Guidance Program began in 1993 and agency issued the first Lone Star Land St eward award started in 1995. During fiscal year 2018, the Wildlife Division moved to an electronic record-keeping system called the Land Management Assistance application to allow more detailed re cord keeping of the technical guidance provided. The agency reports that population growth and land fragme ntation within the state continue to increase demand for services. Land fragmentation increases the number of requ ests for plans on smaller tr acts. Urbanization, absentee landowners, and changing land uses and landowner demographics continue to alter the nature of service requests, resulting in challenges in funding, personnel, and training.

S OURCE : Parks and Wildlife Department. MANAGED LANDS DEER PROGRAM Senate Bill 733, Eighty-sixth Legislatur e, 2019, amended the Texas Parks and Wild life Code, as recommended in TPWD's 2019 Strategic Fiscal Review, to authorize the Parks and Wi ldlife Commission to establish and provide for the collection of a fee for participation in the MLDP. The legislation did not set fee amounts, but it authorized, though did not require, the Parks and Wildlife Commission to establish the fee and dire cted any revenues to be deposited to Account No. 9. The agency reported that in 2019, there were 1,707 participan ts in the Harvest Option an d 8,989 participants in the Conservation Option, of which 4,521 were in wildlife management associations or cooperatives. The agency reported that it anticipated assessing fees of $30 fo r the Harvest Option, $250 for the Conser vation Option, and $40 for members of wildlife management associations or cooperatives in the Cons ervation Option, generating $1 .3 million annually. Based on this estimate, the Legislature appropriated $1.3 million an nually from Account No. 9 to operate the MLDP during the 2020-21 biennium. AGENCY EXEMPTION FROM HOUSE BILL 1290 House Bill 1290, Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, prohibited state agencies from adopting any rule that imposes a cost on regulated persons without first amending or repealing another rule to offset the cost. House Bill 1896, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, exempted TPWD from the provisions of House Bill 1290, as recommended in TPWD's 2019 Strategic Fiscal Review. The legislation authorized TP WD to assess a fee for MLDP pursuant to Senate Bill 733 without requiring the agency to couple the increase in fees with an equal or greater decr ease in costs to its users. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM TPWD is the agency with the primary responsibility for managi ng the wildlife resources of Texas. Because more than 95.0 percent of land in Texas is privately owned, the majority of wildlife resources exist on private land, and the agency reports that technical guidance to private landow ners on wildlife habitat enhancement te chniques is of the utmost importance. Without funding for this program, this direct technical guidance would no longer be available. Discontinuing the Technical Guidance program would eliminate technical guidance and biologist assistance on private lands, which could lead to increased habitat fragmentation, further spread of invasive species, and land ma nagement practices that are detrimental to wildlife populations. Additionally, without Wildlife Management Plans, or biologis ts to set Resource Management Unit-specific harvest rates, the MLDP would be eliminated, resulting in loss of associated revenue. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 255 LICENSE AND BOAT REVENUE The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.032, Sections 12. 701-12.707, and Chapters 31, 42,43,46,47 and 50; and the Texas Tax Code, Ch. 160; Code of Feder al Regulations, Title 33, Part 174; Code of Federal Regulations, Title 50, Part 80 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The License and Boat Revenue program oversees the sale of recreational and commercial hunt ing and fishing licenses and boat registration and titling. Hunting an d fishing licenses can be purchased in person from a licensing agent or TPWD office, with a mail-in application, by te lephone, or online. Boat registration an d titling can be conducted in person at TPWD's 29 law enforcement offices, incl uding TPWD headquarters, and participatin g county tax assessor-collectors, or with a mail-in application; registration renewals may be completed online. Revenue from license sales and titling is deposited in the General Revenue-Dedicated Funds Accoun t No. 9 and is used for various conservation and law enforcement purposes. Fiscal year 2019 revenue from recreational an d commercial hunting and fishing licenses totaled approximately $104.6 million. In addition to helping fund this program, this revenu e funds programs agencywide. The use of collected revenues is limited depending on the spec ific revenue source. For example, revenue from the migratory game bird stamp, a federally required licensing tool, may be appropriated only for purposes related to management and research of migratory game birds and their habitats. The modernization of record-keeping from paper-based to el ectronic databases and computer information systems has reduced customer transaction time, provided higher quality data, and accelerated the transfer of revenue from sales agents to the Treasury. Consumer purchases of hunting and fishing licenses and of boat registration and titling can be affected by weather, the economy, population migration and agin g, demand on consumers' limited free time, urbanization, and less consumer connection to nature and the outdoors. Any of these factors can affect the program's performance. Additionally, TPWD reports that the program is affected adversely by having an in adequate number of staff to provide timely support to license agents, to provide timely delivery of documents ordered by customers (tags and licenses), to answer questions, and to properly account for the prompt collection of all funds due.

The budgeted amount in th e rider has remained fairly co nstant during the past few biennia due to the agency's approved General Revenue Fu nds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds appropriations limit. The agency has not requested an in crease in the amounts contained in the ri der because it would affect the amount of funding available from these methods of finance for other programs. The agency must therefore use the rider authority to access funding in excess of the appropri ated amounts. Increasing the amounts incl uded in the rider to better reflect the payments to license agents and tax assesso r collectors would avoid this situation. BOAT AND BOAT MOTOR SALES TAX Pursuant to the Texas Tax Code, Chapter 160, a tax is assessed on the sale and use of boats and boat motors (Comptroller revenue object code 3111). Section 160.121 directs TPWD to deposit 5.0 percent of the amount collected to Account No. 9, with the remainder being deposited to the General Revenue Fund. CPA's Biennial Revenue Estimate for the 2020- 21 biennium estimated that this tax would generate $163.7 million for deposit to the Ge neral Revenue Fund and $7.2 million for deposit to Account No. 9. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the License and Boat Revenue program would remove TPWD staff and resources necessary to issue and fulfill recreational and commercial hunt ing and fishing licenses through any of its current channels, including TPWD offices, mail-in applications, phone reques ts, and internet sales. Additionally, the point-of-sale system contract would be discontinued because staff would not be available to manage it, meaning recreational and commercial hunting and fishing licenses would no longer be sold or issued through law enforc ement offices, state parks, or license agents across the state. In addition to helping fund this program, revenues collected from recreational and commercial hunting and fishing licenses support programs agencywide. Reducing or eliminating these amounts collected would reduce program funding for many other areas of TPWD operations, including Wi ldlife, Fisheries, and Enforcement programs. If the program were discontinued, TPWD would no longer co llect boat registrations, vessel and boat motor titles, and boat and boat motor sales and use taxes, and this lack of revenue would have farther-reaching effects. TPWD would no longer have the staff or resources to support the application pe rforming boat/marine transactions (titles, registrations, sales tax, and marine dealer licenses), including online transactio ns, and to process inquiries/transactions, including customer phone banks, mail-in, in-person transact ions, and transactions with a shared lo gistical apparatus with TPWD, CPA, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and county tax assessor-collector offices. TPWD no longer would have sufficient staff to ensure that all transactions are accounted for and reconciled properly. The agency would lo se approximately $20.0 million in revenue from boat registration and ti tling and $3.8 million in bo at and boat motor sales and use tax revenue. Because 95.0 percent of TPWD-collected boat sales-and-use tax reve nue goes to the General Revenue Fund, the state also would lose $72.0 million. The inability to issue hunting and fishing licenses would affect eligibility for Federal Funds pursuant to the Sportfish and Wildlife Restoration acts. Funding for each state from these so urces is based on a formula that weighs population and the number of licenses sold. Reductions in license sales counts would affect federal apportionm ent calculations. Additionally, loss of license revenue would result in less funding available to serve as the state match. Together, these federal funding sources total approximately $55.0 million. INLAND HATCHERIES OPERATIONS The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.0181, Section 12. 001, and Chapter 81 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Inland Hatcheries Operations program stocks freshwater fisheries to supplement natu ral fish populations and to enhance the trophy potential of fish populations. Hatcheries also perform public outreach and education. Five freshwater STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 259 fish hatcheries are located throughout the state. The prog ram operates under state authority, with financial support provided by numerous federally authorized grant progra ms administered by the U.S. Department of Interior. Hatchery-stocked fish are utilized as one of several essent ial tools to protect, manage, and enhance statewide fisheries resources benefiting the citizens of Texas. Hatchery-stocked fish are used to es tablish initial-year classes in new or renovate d reservoirs, supplement natural recruitment, and increase angl er opportunities. Additionally, stocked fish are used to increase species diversity, to restore fish populations that have been decimated or reduced due to natural or manmade influences, and to provide immediate recrea tional and educational opportunities by stocking catchable-size fish in or near urban areas. Since 1925, 19 freshwater fish hatcheries have been built in response to fish st ocking needs in Texas. Since 1989, only 44.0 percent of production space (down from 656 acres to 2 90) remains as a result of hatchery closures. Many of the closures were part of a plan to develop from five to six modern, more efficient hatcheries through new construction or renovation. Currently, the hatchery program meets approximately 65.0 percent of the request for hatchery-reared fingerlings in public water. The size and scope of the hatchery stocking program is limited by available production space, staff, and operational funding. Increasing population, declining fish ha bitats, and increasing angling pressure are expected to increase demand for hatchery-reared fish to maintain fishing opportunities.

GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and comply with laws and conditions established in 50 CFR, Part 80. As a condition of receiving federal wildlife and sportfish restoration funding, these rules require a ll states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing licen se fees for purposes other than administration of the state's fish and wildlife agency. This requirement is set forth in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.033, which specifies that TPWD may use the funds in Account No. 9 only to manage the state's fish and wildlife resources. Freshwater Fish Stamp revenues are accounted for in one of the separate subaccounts within Account No. 9. TPWD supports maintaining this dedicated and re liable source of funding to provide prog ram stability and flexibility to respond to long-term needs. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $13.2 milli on in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and to have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $33.7 million. In addition, the agency reports in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates us ing these revenues to fund the following programs: (1) Capital Construction and Project Delivery; and (2) Inland Hatcheries Operations. The program also is funded in part with appropriations from unrestricted Account No. 9 revenues. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $240.1 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 million. In addition, the agency report s in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using these revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD-B . ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING THE PROGRAM Discontinuing the Inland Hatcheries prog ram would result in an annual loss ranging from 13.0 million to 14.0 million fingerling sport fish stocked in more th an 400 waterbodies to suppor t recreational fisheries stat ewide, including community fishing lakes that depend on stocked fish to develop and maintain highly utilized recreational resources in urban areas.

Discontinuation would eliminate activities routinely performe d in support of ongoing gene tic monitoring, routine fish health inspection, disease diagnosis and treatm ent, program evaluation, and focused research. The program is supported with a federa l grant from the Sport Fish Restoratio n Program. Discontinuing the Inland Hatcheries program would result in the reversion of approx imately $2.8 million annually in federal funding that would have otherwise been available to the state. COASTAL HATCHERIES OPERATIONS The Texas Parks and Wildlife C ode, Section 11.0181, Section 12. 001, and Sections 81.101 to 81.200; Sport Fish Restoration Act, also known as Dingell-Johnson Act of 1950, the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 777-777m Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Coastal Hatcheries Operations program stocks fish for recreational fishing. Ha tcheries maintain and enhance existing fish stocks in selected marine habitats and evaluate the impact of fish stocking on resident populations and fishing success. Marine fish hatcheries are located in Corpus Christi, Lake Jackson, and Palacios. The pr ogram protects, restores, and enhances state coastal fisheries and habitat resources. Since the program's inception, the hatchery in Palacios has expanded to include pond production capabilities, the Lake Jackson hatchery began production, and the program has expanded species propagation to include spotted seatrout and southern flounder while conducting research on several other species. During the 2020-21 biennium, TPWD plans to prioritize expanding flounder production at Sea Center Texas and the Marine Development Center to reach its stocking goals and en hance the decreasing flounder populations. This decision will reduce the agency's abilities to stock red drum and spo tted seatrout during the spring-fall season and to complete equipment maintenance during the winter months. Factors that affect the program include sea- level rise, resulting in loss or conversion of habitat; national increase in fishin g participation; and natural disast ers, including Hurricane Harvey.

The program manages public hunting permit s to enable walk-in huntin g on TPWD-owned and TPWD- leased land, public hunting drawings for limited numbers of supervised or guided hunting opportunities on certain state- owned land or state-leased private property, youth hunting programs, and wildlife and paddling trails. As technology and modern business practices have advanced, procedures for expanding opportunities and improving access have enabled hunters to be more engage d. In 1987, a statewide hunting access pe rmit, the Annual Public Hunting Permit, sold through the agency's license system replaced or supplemen ted onsite permit issuance or self-registration processes. Hunts by reservation, known as drawn hunts, transitioned fr om the dated, inefficient paper application process in the 1950s to an online-only draw system in 2014. This chan ge enabled more hunter-directed opportunities and a more equitable distribution of participation. The Annual Public Hunting Permit, also known a walk-in, prov ides nearly year-round hunting on nearly one million acres of land. It authorizes hunting white-tailed deer, feral hogs, do ves, quail, turkeys, waterfowl, rabbits, squirrels and more on more than 190 hunting areas, including wildlife management areas, state parks, and approximately 124 dove and small game areas leased from private landowners. A regular permit is available for certain small game and waterfowl hunts. Regular permits are issued at the hunt area on a first-come, first-served basis. The Public Hunt Drawing System provides opportunities to apply for various supervised, drawn hunts, in cluding special drawings for adults and youth hunters. The Big Time Texas Hunts drawing raises funds for wildlife cons ervation by offering the public chances to win one of 10 premium hunt packages for a nominal fee. All proceeds are ea rmarked to fund conservation efforts and public hunting opportunities. The agency reports that, although the numb er of hunters in Texas has remained re latively constant, hunters are becoming a smaller portion of the overall population. The revenue gene rated by hunters and anglers through license and equipment purchases are a major source for wildlife conservation efforts in the state. To address the decreasing proportion of the population involved in hunting, TPWD has developed tools to broaden the base of individu als interested in hunting. These tools include youth-only statewide hunting seas ons and mentored hunting workshops at state parks. Figure 285 shows public hunting permit revenue from the 2012-13 to the 2018-19 biennia.

HUNTING AND FISHING FEES Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and comply with laws and conditions established in federal rules in 50 CFR, Part 80. As a condition of receiving federal wildlife and sportfish restoration funding, these ru les require all states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing license fees for purposes other than administration of the state's fish and wi ldlife agency. This requirement is set in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sectio n 11.033, which specifies th at TPWD may use the funds in Account No. 9 only to manage the state's fish and wildlife resources. One of the sources of revenue deposited to Account No. 9 is generated by the Hunting and Wildlife Recreation program through Public Hunting/Fishing/Other Part icipation Fees (Comptroller revenue object code 3437), which include fees of up to $25 for public drawings for certain public hunting an d fishing opportunities, including Big Time Texas Hunts. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.0271 and 11.0272, which authorize TPWD to charge a fee of up to $25 to cover the cost of operating public drawings , have not been updated for more than 20 years. This fee generated $3.5 million in revenue in the 2018-19 biennium. If the statute were am ended to raise the maximum am ount and to allow TPWD to charge a fee in excess of the amount necessary cover costs, the additional revenue generated would be available for appropriation to the Hunting and Wildlife Recreation program. House Bill 1896, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, removed a requir ement that the agency couple any increase in license fees with an equal or greater decrease in costs to hunters and angl ers previously established pursuant to House Bill 1290, Eighty- fifth Legislature, Regular Session, 2017. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Hunting and Wildlife Recreation program would result in the elimination of public hunting opportunities in a state where more than 95.0 percent of land is owned privately. It also could lead to a decrease in license and permit revenue due to lack of hunting opportunities on public land and private land leases. Private land leases include 40,000 acres of small game leases and 99,700 acres of private land drawn hunts. During fiscal year 2020, the Annual Public Hunting permit hunts generated permit revenues of appr oximately $2.0 million and Big Time Texas Hunts generated permit revenues of approximately $1.0 million.

The program acts on behalf of all Texans and 1.2 million salt water anglers to protect, restore, and enhance state coastal fisheries, habitat resources, and water public trust resources. It monitors the supply and econ omic value of saltwater finfish and shellfish in Texas coastal waters, and factors that affect their supply; reviews proposals that may affect water quality and fisheries' associated habitat; and prov ides technical guidance to avoid, minimi ze, or mitigate economic impacts. Since its implementation, the program has established the Habitat Assessment Team and the Outreach and Education Program. Factors that affect the program include sea- level rise, resulting in loss or conversion of habitat; national increase in fishin g participation; and natural disast ers, including Hurricane Harvey. The agency reports that challenges to the program include st affing limitations, especially during catastrophic events; incidental encounters with federally pr otected species (e.g., sea turtles and do lphins) requiring federal permitting and reporting and jeopardizing federal funding for routine monitoring; and aging infrastructure.

GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY State funding for the Coastal Fisheries Science and Policy Resources program operations is provided through General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 9 dedicated funds gene rated by the Saltwater Sportfishing Stamp revenues. Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and comply with laws and conditions established in 50 CFR, Part 80. As a condition of receiving federal wildlife and sportfish restoration funding, these rules require a ll states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing licen se fees for purposes other than administration of the state's fish and wildlife agency. This requirement is set forth in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.033, which specifies that TPWD may use the funds in Account No. 9 only to manage the state's fish and wildlife resources. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 271 Saltwater Sportfishing Stamp revenues are accounted for in on e of the separate subaccounts maintained and monitored by TPWD within Account No. 9. TPWD supp orts maintaining this dedicated and re liable source of funding to provide program stability and flexibility to respond to long-term need s. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in the fall of 2019, this suba ccount is estimated to receive $18.6 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $7.2 million. In addition, the agency reports in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 bie nnium that it anticipates usin g these revenues to fund the following programs: (1) Coastal Fisheries Resource Management; (2) Coastal Fisher ies Science and Policy Resources; and (3) Coastal Hatcheries Operations. The program also is funded in part with appropriations from unrestricted Account No. 9 revenues. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $240.1 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 million. In addition, the agency report s in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using these revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD-B . ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Coastal Fisheries Scie nce and Policy Resources program woul d prevent the agency from reviewing approximately 300 project proposals annually that may affect wa ter resources and fisheries' associated habitat and providing technical guidance to avoid, minimize or mitigate for those im pacts; responding to spills and pollution incidents that can kill fish and wildlife, or pursuing civil restitution for the valu e of the fish or wildlife damaged and overseeing restitution projects conducted by the responsible part y; and performing inventory and assessme nt of coastal habitats and identifying and quantifying the impacts of habitat chan ges on natural resources and ecosystems. Without funding, the program could no longer receive and mana ge restitution funds originating from kills and spills and natural resource damage assessment cases. Restitution funds are intended for restorat ion activities to offset environmental damages associated with pollution events, such as Deepwater Horizon and Texas City oil spills. Additionally, the state's eligibility for Federal Funds could be jeopardized if reduced state funding did not meet federal match requirements. INLAND HABITAT CONSERVATION The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.081 to 11.086; S ections and Section 90.004 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Inland Habitat Conservation progra m develops and implements conservation plans for 185 species of freshwater fishes, conducts fish habitat restoration projects, consults with othe r agencies regarding regulato ry actions affecting fish habitats, and improves river access for anglers and paddlers. Other functions include pollutio n response and restoration, stream-flow studies, implementation of species recovery plans, and permitting for the sale of marl, sand, gravel, and shells taken from Texas bodies of water. The program operates un der state authority, with financial support provided by numerous federally authorized grant programs administered by the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The federal Sport Fish Restoration Act (Dingell-Johnson Act (1954) and the Wallop-Breaux Amendment (1984)) provided significant funding to conserve habitats for sport fishes and other aquatic species. These efforts historically consisted of studies to understand the habitat needs of sport fishes. Thos e studies continue to be the basis for technical guidance provided to other agencies and organizations to inform co nsideration of fish habitat needs in water management and watershed management decisions. During recent years, additi onal federal funding available through programs such as the National Fish Habitat Partnership has enabled the program to conduct large-scale fish habita t restoration and enhancement projects. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 272 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 River access areas and fish habitat re storation and improvement projects are supported primarily through competitive grants, private donations, and other project-based sources of funding. According to the agency, a dedicated, consistent source of funding would enhance the ability of the program to more effectively plan, design , and deliver large-scale fish habitat restoration projects and be more strategic in de velopment and implementation of a long-term strategy for improving recreational access and use of Texas rivers. The program is affected by continued population growth, co ncomitant land use changes, and increased water demands, all of which increasingly affect fish habitats, resulting in th e continued and increasing need for efforts to restore, enhance, and preserve fish habitats.

GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED ACCOUNT NO . 9, GAME, FISH, AND WATER SAFETY State funding for the Inland Habitat Co nservation program operations is prov ided through General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 9 dedicated funds generated primarily by revenues re lated to recreational hunting and fishing licenses, wildlife management permits, and public hunt ing/fishing/other participation fees. Although Account No. 9 is a dedicated account in the Genera l Revenue Fund in the Treasury , certain revenues deposited to the account have statutorily dedicated use restrictions pursuant to state and federal requirements. TPWD maintains subaccounts for all revenues deposited into Account No. 9 to ensure expenditures are made from allowable sources and comply with laws and conditions established in 50 CFR, Part 80. As a condition of receiving federal wildlife and sportfish restoration funding, these rules require a ll states to adopt legislation prohibiting the diversion of hunting and fishing licen se fees for purposes other than administration of the state's fish and wildlife agency. This requirement is set forth in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.033, which specifies that TPWD may use the funds in Account No. 9 only to manage the state's fish and wildlife resources. TPWD monitors and maintains revenue, expe nditure, and available balance data for subaccounts used to fund the different operations of the program. This includes funding changes ma de for all programs funded from the same revenue sources. The agency is the sole source of this information. The program is funded in part with appropriations from unrestricted Account No. 9 revenues. Based on agency expenditure data and revenue estimates generated in fall 2019, this subaccount is estimated to receive $240.1 million in revenues during the 2020-21 biennium and have an available balance at the end of the biennium totaling $35.3 million. In addition, the agency report s in its Strategic Fiscal Review submissions for the 2020-21 biennium that it anticipates using these revenues to fund 19 other programs shown in Appendix TPWD-B . ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Inland Habitat Conser vation program would eliminate the agen cy's capacity to maintain statewide freshwater fish species and habitat conservation initiatives. TPWD would lose the capacity to conserve mussels and the more than 185 species of Texas freshwater fishes found in the state, which would weaken the state's control over species conservation, further contribute to species imperilment, and in crease the likelihood of species listings under the federal Endangered Species Act. Additionally, the agency would lose th e ability to operate Inland Fisheries regulatory permitting programs that conserve freshwater species and habitats. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 274 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The program is supported partially through federal grants from the federal Sport Fish Restoration Program, State Wildlife Grant Program, and Voluntary Public Acce ss and Habitat Incentive Program, the majo rity of which require a non-federal, state match. The state's ability to receive Federal Funds for th is program would be eliminated, resulting in the reversion or loss of approximately $0.4 million annually to the state for ri ver access initiatives, $0.8 million annually for species conservation, and $1.3 million annua lly for fish habitat conservation. AQUATIC VEGETATION AND INVA SIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, 11.081 to 11.086; S Biennium, Article VI, Parks and Wildlife Departmen t, Rider 29, Statewide Aquatic Vegetation and Invasive Species Management Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Aquatic Vegetation and Invasive Species Management prog ram manages aquatic invasive sp ecies, including vegetation (e.g., giant salvinia, water hyacinth, Arundo , saltcedar), exotic crustaceans (e.g., ze bra mussels), and exotic fishes (e.g., g rass carp, tilapia, lionfish) through public awareness, prevention, rapid response, treatment, and monitoring. The program operates under state authority, with financial support provided by numerous federally authorized grant programs administered by the U.S. Department of Interior. In Texas, aquatic invasive species threaten water infrastruc ture, municipal and agricultural water supplies, waterfront property values, boating and other water-based recreation, fish and wildlife, and related fishing and hunting opportunities. In managing aquatic invasive species, the pr ogram benefits all citizens of the state. According to the agency, zebra mussels, lion fish, and giant salvinia currently present the greatest invasive species threats in Texas. Zebra mussels can produce up to 1.0 million larvae each and are currently found in la kes Austin, Belton, Bridgeport, Canyon, Dunlap, Eagle Mountain, Georgetown, Granger, Grapev ine, Lady Bird, Ray Roberts, Richland Chambers, Stillhouse Hollow, Texoma, Travis, Waco, Walter E. Long, Worth, and three small lakes in Dallas and Grayson counties. Lionfish entered the Gulf of Mexico in 2011. In addition to their venomous toxicity, the fish can devastate reef communities due to their aggressive feeding habits and their prolific breedin g. Female lionfish can lay tw o million eggs annually. Giant salvinia, which has been spotted in several East Texas lake s, damages aquatic ecosystems by outgrowing and replacing native plants that provide food and habita t for native animals and waterfowl. An in festation can double its size each week. The program was initiated in 1987 to mana ge aquatic invasive vegetation in Texas waterways. As additional species (e.g., zebra mussels, lionfish, giant salvinia) have been introduced to the state's waters, the scope and scale of efforts to manage current infestations and prevent new infestations have continue d to increase. The program continually adapts to utilize the best available science and tools to effici ently and effectively control and prevent th e spread of aquatic invasive species. Numerous aquatic invasive species yet to appear in Texas now grow in surrounding states, with a high risk of spreading into Texas waters. The agency reports that the ability to resp ond to new threats is hampered by resources already committed to existing infestations.

ESTIMATED COST TO FULLY MANAGE AQUA TIC INVASIVE SPECIES IN TEXAS The agency reports species it would require additional staff and operational resources to e ffectively minimize the damage caused by the state's most problematic aquatic invasive spec ies. According to the agency, increased funding would have a scalable effect on aquatic vegetation and invasive species management. ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF FINANCE The program is funded primarily with appropriations fr om Unclaimed Refunds of Motorboat Fuel Tax (URMFT). Seventy-five percent of URMFT is deposited to the Genera l Revenue Fund. Although TPWD may withdraw these funds to use for any lawful purpose, it is using the funds for aqua tic invasive species management and border security. Providing additional methods of finance for this program could allow the agency to expand its efforts. For example, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.035, could be amended to au thorize the expenditure of funds from Account No. 64 on program activities at state parks. Account No. 64 is not dedica ted for specific uses according to CPA's Manual of Accounts. However, the Legislature has established the practice of a ppropriating these funds for the maintenance and improvement of state parks. 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Projected ActualSTRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 277 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Aquatic Vegetation an d Invasive Species Management program would eliminate the agency's capacity to manage nuisance aquatic vegetation, exot ic crustaceans, and exotic fishes on la kes and rivers statewide. The agency no longer would be able to conduct public awareness and prev ention campaigns (e.g., Protec t the Lakes You Love, Clean, Drain, Dry), rapid response and containment of new infestations , control of existing infestations, and monitoring of high- risk waterbodies. In Texas, aquatic invasive species threaten water infrastruc ture, municipal and agricultural water supplies, waterfront property values, boating and other water-based recreation, fish and wildlife, and related fishing and hunting opportunities. As such, the discontinuation of th is program would negatively affect all citizens of the state. The program is supported partially through federal grants th at require a nonfederal stat e match, and eliminating the program would lead to the loss of all Fe deral Funds associated with the program. ARTIFICIAL REEF The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 89; the U.S. Code, T itle 33, Section 2101; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Artific ial Reef Plan, 1985, revised 20 07; U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Servic e, Policy 2000-073 and Addendum, Report 31, December 2009; Nationa l Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984; federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Interim Policy Document No: 2013 -07 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Artificial Reef program oversees the development and main tenance of artificial reefs off the Texas coast and evaluates the use of artificial reefs by marine spec ies and humans. The program repurposes struct ures such as boats, oil rig platforms, deconstructed bridges, and large power poles to assemble the r eefs. It acts on behalf of a ll Texans, 1.2 million saltwater anglers, and recreational scuba divers to protect, restor e, and enhance state coastal fisheries and habitat resources. The initial program, implemented in 1990, was developed around rigs located beyond 9.0 nautical miles from the coastline. Since implementation, the program has expanded to include development of artificial reefs using other materials and providing nearshore reefs in state waters in the Gulf of Mexi co. In addition, it has expanded to support the development and outreach to nonprofit Friends of Reefs groups that suppo rt nearshore reefing efforts, investigate and acquire reef materials of opportunity, secure materials storage areas, an d pursue funding opportunities through local governments and communities. TPWD reports that the program suffers from decreasing fund ing due to decreases in oil and gas platform donations; increasing costs of materials and reef de ployments; lack of qualified contractors for buoy maintenance and reef construction and deployment; and limited research capabilities due to incr eased costs of contracting research projects and monitoring. Approximately 233 standing oil and gas plat forms remain in Texas waters of the Gu lf of Mexico. The average capture rate for the program is 27.0 percent and is dependent on water de pth. The program may reef a projected 50 remaining platforms before all platforms in federal waters are removed, si gnificantly affecting the program's main funding source.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Artificial Reef program would result in loss of recreational fishing and diving opportunities and the loss of artificial reef habitats that enhance fish habitat and fish populations. The oil and gas industry would see increased costs of platform removal if TPWD were no longer operating the program. Additionally, if the program were discontinued TPWD would no longer receive oil and gas structures and donations to build artificial reefs, which during the past 10 year s have amounted to 93 structures and $21.0 million. STATE PARK OPERATIONS The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.0181, and Chapter s 13, 21, and 22; the Texas Tax Code, Section 151.801 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The State Parks Operations program operates and maintains 89 state parks, state hi storic sites, and state natural areas, conserving the natural and cultural resources on these lands fo r current and future use, provid ing public education on these resources, and offering recreational opportunities for the pu blic using sound business and conservation principles. State Parks offer recreational opportunities for al l Texans and visitors to the state. Serv ices are not restricted by residency or demographic factors. The state park system has grown from a handful of sites in 1923 to 89 parks, covering more than 630,000 acres and recording more than 8.6 million visits in fiscal year 2019. The demands and types of recreational use have evolved during that period, requiring investment in in frastructure, programming, and services. According to a 2018 Texas A&M study, Texas' state parks generated an $891.0 million economic impact and established nearly 6,081 jobs that year. Quality parks increasingly factor in business relocation decisions, as compan ies seek to recruit and retain a mobile, professional workforce. Population growth and increased popularity of outdoor recreation have led to increased park use, resulting in a need for additional visitor services and resource protection, and increase d wear on park facilities has led to additional repair and TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 280 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 maintenance needs. Demographic shifts also have prompted th e reevaluation of existing facilities and other services provided. An example is increased demand for group facili ties to accommodate extended family and social groups. The recently enacted constitutional dedication of the proc eeds from the Sporting Goods Sales Tax (SGST) revenues to parks will continue a stable funding source. The Legislature previously appropriated 100.0 percent of the available SGST during the 2016-17 and 2018-19 biennia. These funds will be used to address facility maintenance needs, while increasing operational funding to provide needed co nservation initiatives, interpretive programming and customer service needs. State parks must ensure resource protection while granting access to the public and generating revenue to support operations. Parks are affected regularly by natural disasters th at disrupt visitor services and damage facilities. The agency reports that remote locations, complexity of operations, and co mpensation levels that are lowe r than average for comparable state agency positions make it difficult to recruit and retain skilled staff.

The firs t three are in the process of opening; once opened, each park will increase the total appropriations necessary to operate the park system. In addition, closed or nonoperating state parks that are not collecting revenues also will continue to incur expenses required to pay for limited staff and utilities, at a minimum. STATE PARK BUSINESS SYSTEM The State Park Business System (SPBS) is the reservation, re venue, visitation, accounting, and reporting system for all Texas state parks. TPWD contracts with an outside vendor for the service and it has been fully operational since February 2019. Revenues from state park fees (Comptroller revenue object code 3461) are deposited in the General Revenue- Dedicated State Parks Account No. 64. These were 14.0 percent greater during the 12-month period following implementation of the system compared to the 12-month peri od preceding it. The contract requires for the vendor to receive 4.0 percent of net revenue collected through SPBS. TP WD pays the vendor through its regular appropriations, but an issue could arise if the 4.0 percent TPWD ow es to the vendor exceeds what was budgeted. Instead of making the payment to the vendor after the revenues are received in the Treasury, TPWD could consider having the required 4.0 percent amount extracted from payments an d remitted to the vendor before a deposit is made to the Treasury. The agency could continue reporting to CPA and th e Legislature regarding the revenues collected and paid to the vendor. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the State Park Oper ations program would lead to the closure of a ll 89 state parks, state historic sites, and state natural areas. These closures could ca use be detrimental to public health, as Texans' use of state parks is extensive, and many depend on these spaces for outdoor recreation oppo rtunities that enhance their ph ysical and mental wellness. During fiscal year 2019, state parks re corded more than 8.6 million visits. Additionally, revenue would be lost related to these closures . State park fees generated $53.3 million in revenue during fiscal year 2019. PARKS SUPPORT The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.081, and Chapters 13 and 22; National Environmental Policy Act; National Histori c Preservation Act; Native Americ an Graves Preservation and Repat riation Act; Endangered Species Ac t; Americans with Disabilitie s Act Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Parks Support program provides management of the func tions and programs in the St ate Parks Division, including direct support for state park operations, visitor services, and public safety. These functions include management of natural and cultural resources, interpretive serv ices, management of exhibits, management of state parks law enforcement officers, and management of business activities such as visitor reservations and entrance fee collection. State Parks offer recreational opportunities for all Texans and visitors to the state. Services are not restricted by residency or demographic factors. The state park syst em has grown from a handful of sites in 1923 to 89 parks today, covering more than 630,000 acres, and recordin g more than 8.6 million visits in fiscal year 2019. The dema nds and types of recreational use have evolved during this period, requiring invest ment in infrastructure, programming, and services. As regulations governing natural and cultural resources have become more stringent and complex, providing technical expertise and oversight for field staff has become increasing ly important to ensure compli ance with state and federal STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 287 regulations. Population growth and increase d popularity of outdoor recreation have led to increased park use, resulting in greater need for expertise to ensure re source protection and legal compliance. The agency reports that cultural resource needs include im proving remote access to archeological records necessary for cultural resources management; conducting archeological su rveys on unsurveyed property ; and updating and improving historic interiors for improved visitor experience. Natura l resource needs include enhancing Geographic Information Systems and data subscriptions, acquiring high-resolution el evation data, and obtaining floodplain studies for each site.

USE OF VOLUNTEER LABOR TPWD utilizes the assistance of volunteers as a supplement to paid staff. The agency also has developed partnerships with state and county jails that allow selected inmates to perform se rvices in parks. In addition, the program receives material and service donations from individuals and businesses that suppo rt the agency's missi on and goals. For fiscal year 2019, the value of volunteer labor was $9.3 million. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the State Park Support progra m could increase the likelihood of parks violating state and federal regulations, including the Texas Antiquities Code, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regula tions, and the Endangered Species Act. Removing guidance and supp ort for field staff could lead to the loss of irreplaceable natural and cultural resources under the stewardship of state parks, while public educational programs and other operational functions would $0.0$2.0$4.0$6.0$8.0$10.0$12.0$14.0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Projected Actual(IN MILLIONS)STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 289 be negatively impacted. The cumulative effect of this loss of support could be a decrease in the attractiveness of state parks to the visiting public, which ultimately could diminish pa rk revenue. Additionally, di scontinuing the program would hinder compliance with state purchasing procedures and budgetary processes. PARKS MINOR REPAIR The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapters 13 and 22 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Parks Minor Repair program provides fo r routine, cyclical, and preventive main tenance of facilities at state parks. These maintenance projects are intended to keep state parks functioning in a clean and safe manner, reduce the need for major repairs, and contribute to increa sing revenues. Examples of minor repair projects include plumbing, electrical, painting, and minor roofing. Since the program's inception, the funding source for maintenance and repair activi ties has transitioned from operational funding to capital construction funding. This has ensured that maintenance activiti es are less affected by operational budget constraints. The agency's 2020-21 approp riations include $8.6 million in capita l budget project funding for the program. Park visitation continues to in crease, resulting in increased wear on facilities and requiring expenditures to replace facility components and major systems. TPWD reports that increasi ngly stringent environmental regulations require enhanced systems and competition to hire and retain skilled operating staff.

LIFE-CYCLE METHODS OF REPAIR According to the agency, life-cycle meth ods of repair and replacement would prev ent system failures that result in emergency purchase procedures an d options that are not optimal in cost and qu ality. For example, roofs could be replaced when they are at the end of their lives, but before they le ak and damage the structure. HVAC systems could be replaced before complete failure, enabling the design and specificatio n of more efficient and servicea ble equipment. Pumps and lift stations could be addressed before they fail, preventing park closure and potential environmental effects. Current funding, however, covers only emergency repairs, leaving known issues in deferred status, which increases damage and degradation. This cycle causes additional preventable damage, which requir es more expensive repair when issues reach emergency or failure status. PRIORITIZING SGST FOR MAINTENANCE Constitutional dedication of SGST funds to state parks by the Eighty-sixth Legisl ature, 2019, will provide a more reliable basis of funding for maintenance needs. A new rider in the 2022-23 GAA specifically dire cting funds toward routine, cyclical, and preventive maintenance would enable TPWD pr oactively to address deferred maintenance needs that cause facilities to degrade; would reduce the cost of repairs th rough appropriate preventive ma intenance programs; and would support the parks' ability to provide safe, operable fa cilities that are open and accessible to the public. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE Park system facilities and properties have ongoing deferred maintenance issues that lead to more costly repairs than would have been required if the program were able to implement appropriate preventive maintena nce. Implementing a practice of using strategic investments or best practice replacements in repairing and maintaining park facilities could reduce overall costs and improve park conditions. Installi ng long-lasting, low-energy exterior ligh ting to reduce operating utility costs and maintenance and repair costs is an ex ample of such an approach reported by the agency. Although significant progress recently has been made in addressing parks' capital repair needs, a signific ant backlog of repair needs remains. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Minor Repair Program would increase long-ter m capital repair costs for park facilities. The agency uses minor repair funding to address facility maintenance in a timely manner and exec ute emergency repairs to key facility components. Neglecting these needs would lead to a deterioratio n of park facilities and a loss of state assets. Neglecting smaller repairs until they become major re pairs can mean longer timeframes to comp lete projects, which can result in fewer visitors and lost revenue. 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0% 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Projected ActualTEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 292 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STATE PARKS VISITOR SERVICES The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 11.0181, and Chapter s 13, 21, and 22; the Texas Tax Code, Section 151.801; Americans with Disabilities Act Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The State Parks Visitor Services program provides interpretive services to explain the meanin g and significance of natural and cultural resources at parks. It also performs certain admini strative functions. Interpretive services include guided tours and camping workshops. Administrative functions include op erating the reservation center, managing concessions and concessionaires, managing sales, managing exhibit shops, and performing community outreach. The program operates the Buffalo Soldiers and Texas Outdoor Family programs. The progra m provides orientation, interpretation, and guest services to all state park visitors, as well as outreach services to audiences underrepresented among park system visitors. Orientation, outreach, and interpretation serve to educate an d enrich park visitors, while encouraging park use by new groups. With the population of Texas beco ming increasingly urban and ethnically di verse, these programs help to engage new users in outdoor recreation and ed ucate them on the importance of cons ervation in mainta ining the natural environment. The program began in 1923. Since then, it has expanded its ed ucation services by offering an increasingly professional program delivery and adapting to accommodate an increasing ly diverse state. Today, audiences engage through social media using advanced technology, and the agency is adapting its core services, programs, and business services to meet customer needs and to respond to Texas' changing patterns of outdoor recreation, in addition to its increasingly diverse population. The agency reports a need for more information, training, an d reservation support for privat e-service providers in parks and additional research to identify trends, demographics, an d economic impacts. The agency suggests that it could reach a broader population base, including children, if there were st atutory or other changes to incentivize schools to use state park sites as learning environments.

INTERPRETIVE POSITIONS The state currently has more than 30 park sites without design ated interpretive positions, which reduces the capacity for outreach, education, and awareness. Additional exhibits, supp ort specialist staff, and equi pment could increase program effectiveness and support visitors with disabilities. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the State Park Visitor Serv ices program would eliminate a primary fu nction of state parks and could have long-term effects on their use. It could reduce parks as an attr action for visitors and reduce long-term growth in visitation as current user demographics become a smaller part of th e overall population. Disconti nuing the program also could negatively affect the tourism industry in Texas. RECREATION GRANTS ASSISTANCE The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapters 13, 24, 28, 29, and Section 31.141; Wildlife Restor lean Vessel Act; Sport Fishing and Boating Safety Act; Gulf of M exico Energy Security Act; Fi xing America's Surface Transportat ion (FAST) Act; John D. Dingell, J r., Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Through the Recreation Grants Assistance program, TPWD provides grants to local units of government and other entities to promote outdoor recreation opportunities and enjoymen t of natural and cultural resources managed by local governments or private organizations. The agency primarily pr ovides 50.0 percent matching grants to local governments and other entities, or direct assistance grants to provide the requisite matching funds to qualify for grants from the federal government or other sources. The program serves all populations by providing a variety of acquisition and development grants to increase access to public parks and indoor and outdoor recreation facilities. In addition, the Community Ou tdoor Outreach program funds outdoor experiences and environmental education opportunit ies specifically for underserved populations in Texas. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 294 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The Recreation Grants program began as the Local Park Grant program.

UNEXPENDED BALANCE AUTHORITY FOR SGST RELATED TO RECREATION GRANTS The Legislature could consider adding a rider to the agency's bill pattern to provide unexpended balance (UB) authority from any remaining SGST funding not expected to be availabl e at the end of the 2020-21 bi ennium used for the purposes of recreation grant funding so that funds would be carried forward into the 2022-23 biennium instead of lapsing back to the Treasury. These constitutionally appropriated funds re quire appropriation bill direction and do not count toward certification. This authority would provide an opportunity for the funds to be used for the purposes originally intended by the Legislature. The agency reports experiencing funding losses through the lapsing of SGST funding allocated to the General Revenue- Dedicated Accounts No. 467, Te xas Recreation and Parks, and No. 5150, Larg e County and Municipality Recreation and Parks, due to late cancellations outside the biennium in which the award was grante d. If a grantee cancels its grant, TPWD is unable to reallocate funds from these accounts to anothe r grantee if the cancellation oc curs outside the biennium in which the award was granted. The agency would require UB au thority across biennia to regr ant the funds. SGST funding will not count toward certification beginning in fiscal year 2022 and will be appropriated automatically pursuant to the Texas Constitution, Article 8, Section 7-d, but will require GAA direction. LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT The Legislature could consider lowering the matching requ irement for the Small Communities Park Grant from 50.0 percent to 25.0 percent. Acco rding to TPWD, many small local communities wi th fewer than 20,000 have requested such a change as they would be better positioned to participat e in the program with a lower financial threshold for entry. The agency reports that many smaller local communities are un able to meet the statutory 50.0 percent match required in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 24.005 for Sma ll Communities Park Grants. TP WD notes that a statutory change lowering the matching requiremen t to 25.0 percent would enable more sm all communities to participate in the program. POST-COMPLETION INSPECTIONS The annual reporting requirements in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 24.009 and 24.059, charge grant recipients with conducting annu al inspections of the project for five years af ter the grant is made.

If the statutory requirements were changed, these resource s could be directed toward other duties. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Recreation Grants Assist ance program would reduce the ability to acquire much needed public parkland in a state where 95.0 percent land of is owned privately, with only 2.5 percent dedicated for public recreation and conservation. It would reduce the ability to provide for ne w state and local park development to accommodate changing community needs and to renovate aging ex isting state and local park facilities and infrastructure. If the program were eliminated, TPWD would be unable to meet legal obligations to approximately 400 active grant projects across the state, of which roughly 84.0 percent are multi-year construction projects. Additionally, TPWD estimates an annual loss of more than $20 .0 million in Federal Funds for state and local park capital and acquisition projects if the program were discontinued. TEXAS FARM AND RANCHLANDS The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 84 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Farm and Ranchlands program provides pass-thro ugh grants for qualified easement holders to acquire conservation easements for long-term protection of privately owned working lands that have high values for water, fish, wildlife, and agriculture production and that are at risk for development. The program partners with and leverages funds provided by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Funds are provided through the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) and administered by NRCS staff. Funds are paid directly to the landowner. TPWD receives no funding from NRCS. The program serves the general public and private landowners by protecting viewshed s, open spaces, wildlife habitat, water quality, and watersheds for future generations. The program he lps to ensure that Texas continues to produce crops, cattle, timber, and fiber in a manner protecti ve of associated natural resources. The program was implemented in 2005 at the General Land O ffice and transferred to TPWD in 2016 pursuant to House Bill 1925, Eighty-fourth Legislature, 2015. To date, appropri ated funds have been leveraged approximately $1-to-$8 with other grants and in-kind contributions. Si nce fiscal year 2016, 13 projects coveri ng roughly 24,600 conserved acres, out of 29 applications, have been approved for funding. In fi scal year 2017, the program hired a full-time coordinator.

Acqu isitions are focused on expanding existing sites and on conservation of habitats. Agreements and easements aim to minimize harm to resources and protect public use. The program serves the public by acquiring, en hancing, and protecting state parks, state historic sites, state natural areas, wildl ife management areas, and coastal management areas held in the pu blic trust to meet the outdoor recreation needs of hunters, anglers, boaters, and nonconsumptive users, including day-user s and overnight users. It also seeks to conserve permanently critical habitat for fish and wildlife, including species in decl ine and Species of Greatest Conservation Need identified by TPWD. The most significant program changes since the program's incept ion include assuming primary responsibility for protecting agency lands by enforcing the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code , Chapter 26, negotiating stringent easements and surface use agreements, mapping owned properties and resolving boundary conflicts, and organi zing land-related records from an 80- year period. According to the agency, the demand for access to outdoor re creation opportunities has incr eased far more rapidly than the increase in actual opportunities. Changing demographics and recreation tr ends are driving the demand for TPWD facilities within day-use access of urban centers. Agency-managed lands serve as a refuge for plants and animals across the state, and those lands have increased in importance as the nu mber of plants and animals desi gnated as being of Greatest Conservation Need has increased. The prolif eration of infrastructure, such as pipeli nes and utilities, ma kes it increasingly challenging to minimize impacts to exis ting conservation lands and open space. The ability to acquire inholdings and strategic tracts of land for expansion of recreation opportunities and protection of aesthetic, operational, and resource values of TPWD sites is limited by funding and the lack of authority to acquire land using state funds.

SOURCE : Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. ALTERNATIVES TO AUTHORIZE INCREASED LAND ACQUISITION Increasing land fragmentation and soaring land prices, especially near urban centers, make it ch allenging to meet demand for access to open space and outdoor recr eation opportunities. Program staff freq uently receives information regarding strategic tracts of land available from willing sellers. Thes e tracts may be small but prov ide significant operational, management, or recreational advantages. TPWD reports that opportunities to acquire these tracts frequently are lost because of lack of resources. A GAA rider that authorizes th e agency to request the use of available SGST revenue in its budget during a biennium for acquiring newly available land could address this issue. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Land Conservation program would compromise TPWD's mission to protect resources and provide outdoor recreation opportunities for present and future generati ons. It would result in a net negative impact to resources and recreational opportunities on land TPWD holds in the pu blic's trust. Without the prog ram, enforcement of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 26, woul d not occur. This enforcement includes the agency's primary responsibility for protecting agency lands, negotiating stringent easements and surface use agreements, ma pping owned properties and resolving boundary conflicts, and organizing land-related records from an 80-year period. Without this program, addition of land s to the TPWD system essentially would cease. Access would suffer as the carrying capacity of existing parks was exceeded in the absence of a dditional space for outdoor recrea tion. Increasing demands from the public for access to state parks and wi ldlife management areas for outdoor recrea tion make critical the enlargement of many of these areas to accommodate increased usage to preven t significant impacts to resources bases and deterioration of the recreation experience for visitors. This includes the steady need to acquire inholdings an d tracts of land that would facilitate efficient site operation and management. CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION AND PROJECT DELIVERY The Texas Constitution, Art. 3, Sections 49-e and 50-f; the Tex as Parks and Wildlife Code, Title 2, Section 11.043; Title 2, S ections 13.002 and 13.0045; Title 3, Chapter 22; Title 5, Sections 81.1 01 to 81.102; provisions of the Texas Government Code and the Texas Occupations Code Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Capital Construction and Project Delivery program carries out capital improvements and major repairs to facilities and sites throughout the agency. The program includes arch itectural design, engineering design, project management, a memorandum of understanding agreement between TPWD and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), and other related activities. The agency is responsible for maintaining and developi ng more than 144 different locations throughout the state. Building structures do not account fo r all the utility and road systems, which include wastewater treatment plants, water distribution syst ems, bridges, dams, and boat ramps. TP WD's portfolio includes more than 3,000 buildings statewide, more than 1,300 miles of roads, more than 30 bridges, and hundreds of boat ramps. The program serves state park, historic site, and state natural area visitors , as well as hunters, anglers, boaters, and nonconsumptive use rs. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 302 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Although the program previously relied heavily on internal TPWD design staff, the current model places external architects and engineers under the management of TP WD design staff. This change was driven by an increase in the number of projects, project values, and project complexity. Because of the increasing use of park faci lities by visitors, TPWD reports that th e quality of its built infrastructure has eroded. Natural disasters also present ongoing challenges to TPWD's built in frastructure. Emergency and critical restorative repairs ultimately deplete funding allocated to scheduled deferred maintenance projects. In the absence of contingency funds, the agency defers other construction priori ties to address urgent issues. As a result, the backlog of deferred maintenance continues to grow.

The agency experienced a lack of UB authority for Genera l Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds across biennia, resulting in a shorter period to decide either to accept a project co ntract bid at a higher price than planned or budgeted or to divert available funding to smaller projects to establish contracts within appr opriation timelines Subsequent contract cancelations can result in lapses when the funds th at are not covered through UB authority have been encumbered. Additionally, the agency identified a lack of flexibility to respond to disasters, re sulting in additional unforeseen or critic al repairs. The 2018-19 and 2020-21 GAAs, Article VI, TP WD, Rider 4, Appropriation: Unexpended Balance for Construction Projects, provides UB authority across bienni a for Federal Funds and Other Funds without limitation, and for General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Fund s with a 45-day notification to the Legislative Budget Board and the Office of the Governor. Before enactmen t of the 2018-19 GAA, General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds amounts were incl uded specifically in the rider. Alth ough the rider included the same UB language governing these funds across mu ltiple biennia, it applied only to the General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds specified in the rider while that spec ification was made. With the removal of the specification, the authority expanded to any General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds appropriated for construction projects. A constant limitation on UB authorit y for these funds prohibits them from being carried forward into a biennium if they originally were appropriated four ye ars or more previously. Addition ally, the agency also received specific UB authority to carry forward SGST appropriations, which are a type of General Revenue Funds, from the 2018- 19 biennium into the 2020-21 biennium through Rider 32, Appropriation: Unexpended Balances for Deferred Maintenance. Senate Joint Resolution 24, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, approved by voters in November 2019, amended the Texas Constitution to automatically appropriate the net revenue rece ived each fiscal year from SGST to TPWD and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The amendment will take effect September 1, 2021. In accordance with the resolution, SGST no longer will count toward budget certification beginning in fiscal year 2022; however, all other General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds sources of fundin g, including Account No. 9, continue to count toward certification. The GAA's direction is required regardin g through which SGST account the funds are appropriated. Several options are available to the Le gislature regarding the UB authority for non-SGST General Revenue Funds and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds. These op tions include: (1) continuing the existi ng authority; (2) increasing the UB authority for the funds and accepting the additional cost for the estimated amount to be carried forward into the next biennium; or (3) establishing a new fund outside the Ge neral Revenue Fund in the Treasury to receive amounts appropriated each biennium for capital construction, repair, and maintenance proj ects so the full cost would be realized in the biennium of appropriation and funds could be carried forward with UB authority between biennia without an additional cost each legislative session. The third option also would establish additional criteria similar to the current methodology used in the 2020-21 GAA, Article VI, TPWD, Rider 4, Appropriation: Unexpended Balance for Construction Projects, for limiting the amount of time funds could be carried forward without being returned to their fund of origin to prohibit carrying funds forward in perp etuity without spending them for purposes intended by the Legislature. STATE PARK ROAD REPAIRS State park road repairs and construction are funded each biennium through a $20.0 million State Highway Fund No. 6 (SHF) appropriation made in a rider in TxDOT's bill pattern. According to the agency, this amount is insufficient to address all of the needed road and bridge construc tion and repair costs in the state park system. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 305 PERFORMANCE BONDS The Texas Government Code, Section 2253.021, requires any go vernment entity that makes a public award contract to require the contractor to obtain a performance bond if the contract exceeds of $100,000. TPWD reports that amending the statute to raise the minimum amount to $150,000 before a performance bond is required could result in increased market competition and cost savings. Obtaining a bond can be a significant barrier for new and/or small contractors attempting to bid for state work. When small contractors cannot obtain a bond, they must find a larger general contractor to serve as the prime for the use of their bonding capacity . Raising the limits could open the door for many small contractors, including Historically Underutilized Businesses, to perform as prime contractors rather than subcontractors. Increasing this threshold would thus allow more small contractor s to pursue contracts, resultin g in a larger pool of bidders, increasing competition, and possibly re sulting in lower bids to the state. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Capital Construction an d Project Delivery program would result in agency assets becoming further deteriorated and ultimately unusable. The agency reports that deferring repairs ty pically results in higher costs, asset failures, and even health and safety implications or lack of regulatory compliance in some cases. DEBT SERVICE Texas Constitution, Article 3, Sections 49-e and 50-f Mission Centrality - Weak; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Debt Service program manages debt service requiremen ts related to revenue bonds issued for infrastructure improvements and maintenance. Through the financing of debt service on bonds, this program se rves state park, historic site, and state natural area visitors, as well as hunters, anglers, boat ers, and nonconsumptive users. The Seventy-fifth Legislature, 1997 , authorized $60.0 million in revenue bonds. The bonds were approved in four issues from fiscal years 1998 to 2001. This amount represents debt service on revenu e bonds for critical facility repairs. Debt service for these bonds will be paid off in fiscal year 2020. Debt service amounts for other bonds are appropriated directly to the Texas Public Finance Authority. Figure 337 shows Debt Service program funding sources for the 2020-21 biennium.

OUTREACH AND EDUCATION The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.0181 and 11.033, Sections 31.108 to 31.110, and Section 62.014; the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 669 to 669i and Section 777.7775 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Outreach and Education program instru cts hunters, boaters, and other water users to be safe, knowledgeable, and responsible while pursuing outdoor recreati on activities and fosters the development of new outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The program includes the Hunter Education and Boater Educatio n programs required of all participants of a certain age to hunt or boat legally in the state. Other functions include outdoor skills workshops, outrea ch events, and programs that utilize trained volunteers to provide education regarding cons ervation and outdoor recreation. In fiscal year 2019, the Outreach and Education program reached 593,146 Texans and ut ilized the work of more than 7,000 active volunteers, who generated 57,832 volunteer hours. The program serves hunters; anglers; private landowners; boater s; state park, historic site natural area visitors; nonconsumptive users; and educators. Inst ructors teach outdoor enthusiasts how to hu nt, fish, and boat safely, responsibly, lawfully, and ethically, while encouraging th e conservation and enjoyment of the stat e's natural and cultural resources. In addition, the program educates the public on the science behi nd wildlife and habitat manage ment through several school- and community-based curricula, including Project WILD, Texas Aquatic Science, and Texas Waters: Exploring Water and Watersheds. Through the agency's Urba n Outreach programs, it attempts to engage new users, especially youth, women, and minorities, in natural resource outdoor recreati on, and to retain existing ou tdoor users, and reactivate returning users, who fund the agency through purchases of licenses and sporting goods.

BOATER EDUCATION FOR PADDLECRAFT OPERATORS Paddlecraft, or human propelled vessels (e.g ., kayaks, canoes, stand-up paddleboards) is one of the fastest-growing niches in the recreational boating market, and has become a gateway to the outdoors for water activities. Currently, paddlecraft do not have to be registered in Texas or pay into the traditiona l user pay, user benefit system of recreational boating safety, but operators still have the benefits of vessel access, educat ion, law enforcement presence, and search and rescue. TPWD's conservative estimate of the number of paddlecraft in Texas is approximately 290,000. Curre ntly, boater education is not required for paddlecraft operation. TPWD reports that paddlecra ft account for up to 40.0 percent of Texas boating-related fatalities, even though they account for only 2.0 percent of overall accidents. Additionally, game wardens spend hundreds of hours annually performing search and rescue for overdu e paddlers or paddlecraft found adrift. If paddlecraft were required to be registered and TPWD assessed the $32 two-year registration fee currently assessed for boats with lengths less than 16 feet, the state would collect appr oximately $4.7 million in revenue each year. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 310 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 REQUIRED STATE MATCHING FUNDS Federal Funds constitute a large portion of funding for the Hunter Education and Boater Education programs, and these funds require a state match. The aquatic education program is a ppropriated very few state dollars, requiring it to use other sources, such as volunteer hours, as match toward the fede ral grant it has access to. Without directing adequate state funding into this program, the department runs the risk of losing access to mainstay funding for aquatic educational programs. The Hunter Education program uses as its state match the revenue generated from student certification fees, without which it also would have to us e volunteer hours as the state match. RECREATIONAL WATER SAFETY The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 31.002, directs the state to promote recreational water safety, but there is no funding appropriated to support this requirement even as participation in recrea tional water activities has steadily increased statewide. Nationally and in Texas, part icipation and fatality rates of non-motorized paddlecraft users have continued to increase. TPWD reports that increased funding for boater education programs is needed to respond appropriately. BOATER EDUCATION FEES The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 31.108, requires TPWD to administer a boater education program and to approve boater education courses that meet or exceed the minimum instruction requirement. Section 31.109 requires certain boat operators to complete a boater education course. TP WD is required to charge $5 for completion of the course, and it collected $33,790 in fiscal year 2019 for courses it offered directly. Section 31.108 also authorizes an approved agent to offer boat er education courses, and requires that $10 of the amount charged for the course be remitted to TPWD. Until Novemb er 2019, when the Parks and Wildlife Commission voted to change the rules, all vendors of online boater courses were ex empted from having to remit the $10 fee to the state because TPWD sought to increase the number of online providers and allow more people to be trained in boater education. The rule change, effective January 1, 2020, requires these vendor s to remit the $10 fee to the state, and TPWD estimates that it will collect $255,000 in fisc al year 2021 from this fee. As this program continues to grow along with the number of boaters in Texas, funding resources may be inadequate. A statutory change to direct boater educat ion revenues to Account No. 9 could enable the agency to use these funds for the program. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Outreach and Education program could result in an increase in boatin g-related and hunting-related accidents resulting in damage to property and loss of life. Da ta on Texas hunter education and hunting accidents spanning decades show a correlation between increasing numbers of hunt er education certifications an d decreasing rates of hunting accidents and deaths. Discontinuation also would result in declin es in revenue generated by participant fees , license, and permit sales; loss of the ability to provide state matching dollars for federal funding; an d declines in the positive economic impact TPWD activities bring to local economies. PROVIDE COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES The Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, Sections 11.0181, 11.033, an d 11.035; Section 12.006; and Section 13.017; the U.S. Code, Title 16, Sections 669 to 669i and Section 777.7775 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Provide Communication Products and Services program includes production and publication of TPWD media, including Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine , the Texas Parks and Wildlife television program, the Passport to Texas radio program, the Under the Sky podcast, video news reports, news releases, ma rketing, website development, social media, and creative and interactive services. STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 311 The program serves the general population, including hunters; an glers; boaters; private landowners; visitors to state parks, state historic sites, and state natural areas; nature tourists ; and other outdoor enthusiasts. According to the agency, the program recruits outdoor users of all ages, ethnicities, and abilities who can benefit physically, mentally, and emotionally from spending time in nature. The program also serves the agen cy's mission by increasing hunting and fishing license sales, state park entry fees, and other revenue-generating efforts. Since the program began in 1942, the agen cy has added new sections with specia lized communication expertise in areas such as website development, mobile ap plications, marketing, and social media. The program tracks website traffic statisti cs, including the number of visitors, user origin, and referral sources. Analytics are used to identify key indicators, including engagement, user preference, campaign effectiv eness, and usability. As of April 2020, the program measures e-commerce for park and license sales resulting from online advertising, email marketing, and social media posts. The program also uses tracking system s and database analysis to measure effectiveness, including mobile application downloads and sales conversion; social media reach and enga gement and traffic to webpages, and revenue to transactional webpages; number of television viewers and podcast down loads; number of magazine subscribers and revenue generated by subscription and advertising sale s; net revenue and return on investment from marketing campaigns for Big Time Texas Hunts and co nservation license plates; and participat ion in the Great Texas Birding Classic and funds raised by the prog ram's sponsorship agreements. The agency reports that new approaches are required to serv e traditional customers and reac h new audiences. For example, to improve business modernization and customer engagement, a single platform or technology to connect the disparate customer databases and provide advanced email and text co mmunication would enable the agency to deploy strategic communications that engage and acti vate current and potential customers in a more cost-effective manner. Texas' continued population growth, demo graphic shifts, and urbanization have ch allenged TPWD's ability to inform and engage the public about outdoor recreational activities, especially those related to hunting and fishing. Although the agency is challenged with stabilizing the decrease of traditional us ers such as hunters and anglers, TPWD reports also having opportunities to more effectively recruit, retain, and engage di verse outdoor enthusiasts while preserving the critical revenue sources that make outdoor opportunities and stewar dship of natural and cultural resources possible.

LICENSE PLATE REVENUE Through the Provide Communication Products and Services pr ogram, TPWD offers Texans the opportunity to purchase conservation license plates for a fee of $30, of which the agency keeps $22. The 2020-21 GAA, Article VI, TPWD, Rider 33, Appropriation: License Plates, incl udes 15 available license plate designs. For the 2020-21 biennium, TWPD is appropriated $1.8 million from the License Plate Trust Fund , of which $0.1 million is appropriated to the Provide Communication Products and Services program. The Texas Transportation Code, Section 504.851, authorizes TxDOT to contract with a private vendor for the sale of personalized license plates, and it prohibit s any other entity from offering specialize d license plates with a background color other than white. TPWD reports that amen ding statute to allow it to offer license plates with colored backgrounds could generate increased revenues from the sa le of license plates for the program. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Provide Communication Products and Servic es program could reduce Texans' engagement in nature- based outdoor recreation and natural reso urces conservation, potentially reducing state economic benefits from nature- based tourism and eroding agency funding sources and state taxes. Without this pr ogram's outreach, Texans would be less informed and engaged in natural resource stewardship and healthy outdoor recreation.

The executive office coordina tes activities related to the Parks and Wildlife Commission and outside entities, such as the Legi slature and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation. The program implements information technology solutions to support the agency's functions, including customer service applications. Other functions performed by the program include financial and acco unting services, human resources, legal services, warehouse management, purchasing and contracting, management of th e Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB) program, headquarters complex facility management, risk management, and agency-wide records management. The program began in 1963 when the State Park Board and the Game and Fish Commission were merged to form TPWD. Specific support areas (IT, Legal, HUB, Records Management, et c.) were established at various dates thereafter. As support functions, the various divisions and acti vities within this program directly su pport all TPWD staff and divisions, and indirectly serve all individuals that use or otherwise benefit from TPWD programs. Support functions subsequently have evol ved to meet changing funding constraint s, legislative/other requirements, and technological advances. With the agency 's transition to the statewide Centra lized Accounting and Payroll/Personnel System (CAPPS), the Human Resources Division's functions have expanded to include payroll. In addition , the implementation of the CAPPS-Financials module in fiscal year 2021 will resu lt in changes to financial processes agencywide, with particular implications for organization, staffing, and operat ions in the Financial Resources (FR) Division. As a result, some functional areas within FR and other divisions may merge, expand, or develop new responsibilities to accommodate the use of the new system .

SOURCE : Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 330 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 The Legislature established TDLR's predecessor, the Texas Bu reau of Labor Statistics, in 1909 to collect and report statistical information to the Governor regarding labor and industry within the state. The Legislature gradually added powers of administration and enforcemen t of certain labor laws until a 1989 Suns et Advisory Commission review of the Texas Bureau of Labor Statistics led to the establishment of TDLR as an oversight agency for occupational licensing and regulatory programs. TDLR's mission is to provide \"innovative regulatory solutions for our li censees and those they serve.\" The Texas Occupations Code, Chap ter 51, authorizes the agency. The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation gove rns TDLR. The commission consists of seven members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. The commission serv es as TDLR's policy-making body. Commissioners are statutorily prohibited from engaging in any of the businesses or tr ades regulated by TDLR. The commission and TDLR rely on input abou t the regulated programs from 31 advi sory boards. The commission appoints these advisory boards' members, who include licensees, repres entatives from regulated businesses and industries, public representatives, and other professionals. The commission and the advisory boards regularly hold public meetings and publish meeting information on the agency's website. The agency is organized into functionally aligned divisions, or programs, rather than regulati ng each license by type. The nine programs analyzed for this Strategi c Fiscal Review (SFR) reconcile with the agency's State Budget by Program. The agency has strong authority and mission centrality for six of the programs reviewed. The remaining programs have strong authority and moderate mission centrality. The mission centra lity and authority of the Indi rect Administration program were not examined for this review. The SFR process analyzed agency funding an d performance from fiscal years 2014 to 2021. During fiscal year 2014, TDLR regulated 25 licensing programs with approximately 630,00 0 licensees. Since then, each Legislature has changed the programs that TDLR regulates through dere gulation, transfers from other agencies, or the establishment of new regulatory programs. These statutory changes have resulted in correspon ding changes to the agency's appropriations. The Eighty- sixth Legislature, 2019, transferred two programs to TDLR from other state agencies. With these additions, TDLR will regulate 40 licensure programs, made up of 238 different license types, with an estimated 1.2 million licensees by the end of fiscal year 2021. TDLR is funded primarily through appropriations of General Revenue Funds. Figure 352 shows the agency's funding by method of finance for the 2020-21 biennium. The agency was appropriated $87.4 million in All Funds for the biennium. FIGURE 352 TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATION FUNDING SOURCES 2020-21 BIENNIUM SOURCE : Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.

TDLR historically has been appropriated General Revenue-Dedicated Funds from accounts used for restitution in the barbering, cosmetology, and auctioneers li censure programs only. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, when the Motorcycle and All-Terrain Vehicle Operator Safety program transfers to TD LR, the agency was appropriated General Revenue-Dedicated Funds from Account No. 501, Motorcycle Education (Accou nt No. 501), to administer the program. The agency's appropriations increased by $15.4 million in All Funds from the 2018-19 to the 2020-21 bien nia; $12.3 million of that increase is attributable to the transfer of two regulatory programs from other state agencies to TDLR for the 2020-21 biennium.

SOURCE : Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Eighty-sixth Legislature, General A ppropriations Act, 2020-21 Biennium, Ar ticle VIII, Section 2, Appropriations Limited to Revenue Collections, requires TDLR to generate sufficient fees, fines, and misc ellaneous revenues from the industries it regulates to cover the agency's appropriations an d other direct and indirect costs. If revenue collections and fund balances are insufficient to offset the appropriations , the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) and the Office of the Governor may direct the Comptroller of P ublic Accounts to decrease the amount that the agency is authorized to spend to correspond to expected fee revenue. TDLR estimates ge nerating $111.6 million in revenue from fees, taxes, and administrative penalties for the 2020-21 biennium, $24.0 milli on more than the All Funds a ppropriations to the agency for the biennium. The excess revenue collections are deposited to General Revenue Funds. Figure 354 shows an overview comparing program funding from the 2018-19 to the 2020-21 biennia. The program with the largest funding increase during that period was Conduct Inspections. The only program with a decrease in funding during that period was License, Register, and Certify. Figure 355 shows revenue collections by program for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. The agency estimates some decreases in revenue collections ac ross programs for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded SFR requirements to include estimates for the expenditures needed to maintain the minimum level of statutorily required service in each of the agency's programs. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be higher or lower than ex isting funding levels. LBB staff asked the agency to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amounts. TDLR reported that the agency's appropriations match minimum funding needs for all programs.

Through fiscal year 2019, TDLR licensed 613,971 individuals. The key activities in this program include: initial application pr ocessing; renewal processing; criminal background checks; online application processing; online rene wal; military experience, service, training, or education verification; and expediting applicat ions from military spouses, milita ry service members, and veterans. Figure 356 shows the program funding sources. The program is fu nded primarily through appropriations from General Revenue Funds. For fiscal year 2021, the agency was appr opriated General Revenue-Dedicated Funds from Account No. 501 to operate the motorcycle safety training program that wa s transferred to the agency from the Department of Public Safety. Funding in this program also includes Appropriated Re ceipts, which are funds collected by the agency and deposited to the General Revenue Fund before they can be expended by the agency, and pass-through fund s for fees paid by licensees who use the online service Texas.gov for license renewals.

The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, appropriated an additi onal $2.0 million in Genera l Revenue Funds to TDLR to develop the first phase of a new licensing system that will replace nine disparate legacy systems. According to the agency, development began in June 2020 with an expected completi on by August 31, 2021; the agency anticipates no change requests for the project at this time. The agency anticipates requesting an estimated $1.6 mi llion in General Revenue Funds from the Eighty-seventh Legislature, 2021, for the second ph ase of the project. According to the agency, applicants' and licensees' use of electronic forms and submissions enables effi cient and effective issuance of licenses. These technologies help to outsource data entry, ensure complete application information, minimize errors and incorrect fee payments, and shorten overall application processing time . Certain applications are not eligible to be submitted using online technology because TDLR does not have the capability to receive docume nts online. For example, license applications that require submission of documentation such as proof of education, trai ning, experience, or insurance are not available online. TDLR reports that the goal to update the system to accept docume nts online frequently is set aside by the prioritization of incorporating new and transferred programs and their associated licensing systems. Figure 357 shows historical funding for this program from th e 2014-15 biennium to the 2020-21 biennium. Funding for the License, Register, and Certify pr ogram increased by 51.8 percent in All Funds from the 2014-15 biennium 2020-21 biennium. The number of full-ti (FTE) positions in this program also has in creased from 43.7 positions during fiscal year 2014 to 68.0 FT E positions appropriated for fiscal year 2021.

SOURCE : Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Several factors can affect the workload of the License, Certif y, and Register program. A si gnificant challenge for program staff is transitioning a new licensing prog ram into the agency. As the agency's fi scal years 2021 to 2025 Strategic Plan notes, TDLR's functional business model removes program isol ation to eliminate redundancies; however, frequent changes to the programs that the agency regulates results in staff es timating the behaviors of new licensees and how new programs will affect workload. For example, when 13 health-related prog rams were transferred from the Department of State Health Services during fiscal years 2017 and 2018, TDLR staff used renewal rates of existing licensees to estimate the renewal rate of the new licensees and the associated workload for staff. Howe ver, the new licensees renewed at a significantly higher rate of 82.4 percent compared to th e estimated 68.8 percent. See Appendix TDLR-B for a timeline of deregulations, new regulations, and licensure program transfers to TDLR from fiscal years 2014 to 2021. According to the agency, new requirements from the Legislature to add fingerprint background checks to existing licensure programs also may lengthen licensing outp ut times and result in licensing backlogs . The agency noted that this negative effect occurred during fiscal 2019 with the added requirement to fingerprint massa ge therapists and massage establishment o w n e r s .

SOURCE : Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Analysis of TDLR's performance in measures related to this program from fiscal years 2014 to 2021 shows that the agency typically meets or exceeds targets. The agency reported that variances of 5.0 percent less than or greater than the targets were due either to not adjusting targets after certain license types were deregulated or to inexperience with new licensee populations after program transfers. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM TDLR's License, Register, and Certify pr ogram ensures the competency of licensees in various occupati ons. Without this program, TDLR would not be able to veri fy the work experience or education of license applicants an d would not be able to conduct criminal background checks on licensees. If the program were discontinued, TDLR no longer would issue law and rule books that help licensees remain compliant with occupational license re quirements or publish its Parent-taught Drivers Education packets. Individuals needing licensure to wo rk in any of the regulated occupations would not be able to meet those requirements. According to the agency, withou t this program, the statutor y and rule requirements for obtaining individual licenses that were established to protec t the health, safety, and financ es of consumers would not be verified for compliance, and the consequences these requiremen ts were intended to prevent would occur. Discontinuance of this program would affect the protection of the public he alth and safety adversely and limit the agency's ability to respond to emergencies and disasters.

The primary cust omers for this program are individuals required to pass an examination or complete CE hours to receive or renew an occupational license. Key services provided by the Examinations and Continuing Educ ation program include statewide electron ic delivery of examinations; special accommodations for examinations, including those offered in other languages; online posting of Candidate Information Bulletins and pass rates; online reporting of student hours; approval of CE providers and courses; online posting of licensees' completion of CE hours; and auditing of CE hours. As of fiscal year 2020, 26 of TDLR's 40 licensure programs require CE. During fiscal year 2019, th e agency administered 68,137 exams. The agency reports that occupational laws and rules and some federal codes are updated periodically, requiring the agency to revise related examinations. TDLR up dates examinations with input from advi sory boards and industry subject matter experts. TDLR contracts with a third-party vendor to admini ster most exams to potential licensees, and some programs, such as Behavior Analysts and Massage Therapy, use national exams administered by other entities. In certain programs, TDLR licenses CE providers, and in other programs, TDLR a ccepts CE provided by universities, national organizations, or other authorized entities. The Examinations and Continuing Education program has grow n to accommodate the licensure programs transferred and added to TDLR since fiscal year 2014. Figure 359 shows the program funding sources for the 2020-21 biennium. This program is funded primarily through appr opriations of General Revenue Funds.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Examinations and Continuing Educatio n program at TDLR would place consumers who conduct business with individuals and businesses regulated by TDLR at risk because licensees could operate without demonstrating knowledge of the subject matter for licensure or renewal. Cons umers would be uncertain if the individual they hire meets minimum competency requirements to perform their duties. Sc hools providing education required for licensure or renewal would not be reviewed and approved by TDLR, leaving consumer s at risk of fraudulent or poorly run schools that take financial advantage of students and produce illegitimate cred entials. Additionally, without this program, the state would have no oversight of or payments from the Barber School Protection Account or the Private Beauty Culture School Protection Account, which refund students' tuition wh en barber or beauty culture schools suddenly close.

During fiscal year 2019, TDLR receiv ed approximately $131,000 from the Rider 3 appropriation. Similarly, Rider 11 authorizes the CPA to release additional approp riations from excess revenue collections related to elevator, escalator, and related equipment inspections. Although the agency has colle cted revenue in excess of the Rider 11 threshold, the excess revenue has not been needed for the insp ections to continue. The excess collections have lapsed to the General Revenue Fund since fiscal year 2014. Rider 12 us es a similar contingency rider appropriation mechanism. If the agency manages a combative sports event for which ticket sa les exceed $2.0 million, resultin g in assessing fees and taxes in excess of the CPA's Biennial Revenue Estimate, the agency may be appropriated $30,000 per fiscal year if CPA verifies the contingencies. TDLR received the $30,000 appropriation du ring fiscal year 2019, but th e agency does not anticipate meeting the threshold for fiscal year 2020 due to ev ent cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Like other programs at TDLR, the Conduc t Inspections program can be affected by external factors including economic growth, demand in the construction indu stry, building safety and maintenance, and public health issues. The program also is affected by natural disasters, due to suspensions of routine inspections in disaster areas and increased demand for inspections when construction resumes. Additionally, the massage therap y program did not include an inspections component before it was transferred to TDLR from the Depa rtment of State Health Services. As TDLR inspections of massage therapy establishments began, enforcement activity related to human trafficking increased for the inspections program. This increase prompted the agency to request exce ptional item funding to establ ish an Anti-Trafficking Unit (ATU). The Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2 019, appropriated the agency $1.5 million in General Revenue Funds for the ATU, which focuses on identifying and reporting signs of human tra fficking, offers education and training to TDLR staff, and conducts outreach to local, state, and federal partners. Acco rding to the agency, the connection between human trafficking and illicit massage establishments result s in complexity that is not found in the agency's standard inspections. Figure 370 shows the agency's actual performance in the key perf ormance measures for this program during fiscal year 2019 and the target performance for fiscal years 2020 and 2 021. The Sunset Advisory Commission Staff Report on TDLR published June 4, 2020, found that the agency's underlying data for the Tota l Number of Inspec tions Completed and Inspection Coverage Rate measures were inconsistent. Each measure requir es the agency to aggregate data across licensure programs. Sunset Advisory Commission st aff recommended a Management Action di recting TDLR to work with the LBB to develop consistent definitions for inspection-related pe rformance measures. The agency contacted LBB staff to begin making these changes in June 2020 to correct measure definitions for the 2022-23 biennium.

TDLR has struggled to meet targets for the total number of in spections completed each year since fiscal year 2014. From fiscal years 2014 to 2017, the agency's actual performance for this measure typically was 90.0 percent or less than the targets. The agency said that these performance variances were due to vacancies in inspector positions for several years, implementation of a new inspection progra m for Orthotics and Prosthetics facilities , and an overestimation of inspection projections for another new program, the mi ni-salon and shop license. The agency fi lled the inspector posi tions and, during STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 345 fiscal years 2018 and 2019, TDLR's actual performance was ab out 14.0 percent more than targets. The agency attributed this variance to an increase in construction an d reconstruction activity after Hurricane Harvey. SIGNIFICANT FINDING As part of the SFR information request, the agency was asked to identify specific statutory changes that could improve the program's effectiveness. For the Conduct Inspections program, TDLR identified the statute governing mold remediators as a potential area of improvement. According to TDLR, Texas is one of four states to ad opt licensing requirements for mold remediation businesses. The agency reports that the U. S. Environmental Protection Ag ency provides guidance for mold remediation in structures, the Americ an Industrial Hygiene Association provid es certification of mold assessors, and multiple private sector trade groups train and certify mold remediators. The agency recommends either deregulation of the program or transferring it back to the Department of State Health Services (DSHS), from which it was transferred during fiscal year 2018. TDLR currently has a memorandum of understanding with DSHS to conduct inspections for the mold program because DSHS has the industry expertise. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The Conduct Inspections program inspects facilities, businesses, and equipment to ensure the safety and health of Texans that use them. Discontinuance of this prog ram would result in significant risk to th e public in the following situations: no verification that boilers, elevators, escalators, and related equipment are operating safely; no verification that new or modified buildings and facilities are comp liant with the Texas Accessibility Standard s; no verification of meeting license requirements for experience, education, financial security, or insurance; no oversight of combative sports events for compliance with safety and fiscal requ irements; no subject matter expertise for questions from licensees and the public related to technical issues, code of conduct, and standard of care; no onsite checks for unlicensed activity and human trafficking at locations offering agency -regulated activities; and no monitori ng of third-party inspectors for the Industrialized Housing and Buildings, Elevators, Escalators and Related Equipment, and Elimination of Architectural Barriers, Boiler Safety, and Fuel Metering and Quality occupational areas. Additi onally, discontinuing this program would result in no collection of the statutory ta x of 3.0 percent on gross receipts of a ll combative sports events and telecasts.

Key activities in the program includ e responding to phone calls, emails, social media posts, and walk-in visits. Customer Service representatives maintain a knowledge base of TDLR's 40 regulated programs and the ongoing changes to these prog rams through statutory amendments, rule up dates, and process improvements. Customer service representatives must remain know ledgeable regarding the various requirem ents to obtain original and renewal licenses in all programs. TDLR reports that the Customer Se rvice program continues to experience an increase in the number of contacts regarding regulated programs.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING As part of the SFR information request, the agency was asked to identify specific statutory changes that could improve the program's effectiveness. For the Customer Service program, the agency identified statutory changes that could align statute for court-ordered programs. The Eighty-fourth Legislature, 2015, transferred these progra ms to TDLR, but the agency reports that statutory authority for the programs is located wi thin several statutes. A unified statute for the programs would make it easier for Customer Service representatives to provid e assistance to individuals required to complete the court- ordered courses. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Without the Customer Service program, the agency reports th at the public and licensees could not contact the agency easily. According to TDLR, in a typical day, Customer Servic e representatives answer 1,850 phone calls and 400 questions via email; monitor and engage the public through social media; assist walk-in cust omers in the Austin office; and provide multilingual assistance to customers in Spanish and Vietnamese . Additionally, statute requires TDLR to assist the public with licensing-related questions for all Te xas licensing entities, not just TDLR prog rams. The agency would not be able to perform this function efficiently withou t a dedicated customer service program.

The positions were vacant for an extended period due to the statewide hiring freeze during fiscal year 2017. These long- term vacancies led to a complaint case backlog; in response , the agency narrowed its focus of enforcement activities to violations that involve consumer harm or a threat to public safety. Additionally, due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey, TDLR ceased periodic inspections of faci lities in the 60 affected counties for several months, which also decreased the number of complaints cases opened.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Although these policy changes helped the agency manage its workload, Sunset Advisory Commission staff found that the agency overcorrected, resulting in a protoc ol that enables licensees to commit certai n violations without facing enforcement consequences from TDLR. Sunset Advisory Commission sta ff's management action reco mmendation is for TDLR to develop consistent protocols and identi fy common risk factors to help inspec tors determine enforcement actions. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing the Investigation program at TDLR would inhibit the agency's ability to prosecute licensees for violations of laws and rules. The program's intake and investigator staff provide facts and information about complaints to the attorneys, who pursue prosecution. The In vestigation program also provides information for denial of license applications or revocation of licenses when an applic ant or licensee has a criminal background that determines the in dividual ineligible for a license.

Comp laints may be entered by consumers, through inspections, and from license applications. The program includes the following key activiti es: processing, evaluating, and resolving complaints through negotiation or formal prosecution; providing information about the complaint investigat ion and resolution process; developing and applying criminal conviction guidelines for the issuance and renewal of licenses; developing and implementing penalty matrices for unifor m assessment of sanctions and penalties; and publishing enforcement actions. Eight license programs contain a health-related, standard-of-car e element that increases compla int complexity and requires consultation with external subject matter experts.

Additionally, field efforts such as sting operations and license sweeps continue to generate greater numbers of unlicensed activity cases, which also are resolved by this program. Similarly to other TDLR programs at the agency, the workload is affected by construction trends, natural disasters, changes in building and energy codes, and economic trends. Figure 379 shows the agency's actual performance in measures du ring fiscal year 2019 and the target performance for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The Sunset review on TDLR found that the agency calculates its recidivism rates inaccurately, skewing the data downward. Sunset Advisory Commission st aff recommended a Management Action directing TDLR to correct the measure's methodology to represent accurately th e number of individuals, not cases, that commit multiple violations within and across fiscal year s. The agency contacted LBB staff to begi n making these changes in June 2020, and Figure 379 shows the corrected data for actual performance during fiscal year 2019.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Similarly to the effects of discontinuing the Investigations program, discontinuing the Re solve Complaints program at TDLR would prevent the agency from prosecuting licensees for violations of laws and rules. Attorneys in this program develop the cases for denial of license applications or revocati on of licenses when an applic ant or licensee has a criminal background that renders the individual in eligible for a license. Without the Resolv e Complaints program, the agency would not be able to comply with the federal Administrative Proc edures Act for providing an individual due process before denying or revoking a license. According to the agency, remo ving TDLR's ability to prevent individuals who could be a danger from holding a license would put the public at risk. Additionally, without this recourse, licensed and unlicensed individuals and businesses that violate laws and rules would have no consequences, which could cause harm to consumers and result in a public health risk. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 51 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indirect Administration program at TDLR includes Central Administrati on, Information Resources, and Other Support Services.

The program oversees all administ rative functions for the agency and, therefore, the primary customers for the program include the following stakeholders individuals and businesses that may interact with the agency: licensees; public; elected o fficials; commissioners; legislative and othe r government oversight agencies; advisory board members; and public-private partners, in cluding historically underutilized businesses. Key activities in this program includ e communicating with governmental partners and industry and trade groups; providing information regarding the agency's programs; prov iding legal counsel support to the agency, commission, and advisory boards; ensuring agency compliance with ethics laws; responding to requests in accordance with the Texas Public Information Act; administering the agency's websites; eval uating and analyzing data an d input to identify process improvements; responding to media inquiries; managing the ag ency's daily operations and fiscal resources; developing workforce planning; developing, implementi ng, and maintaining licensing software systems; developing and implementing information technology security measures; supporting online and contact center services; procurement processes; state property accounting and management; facilities and vehicle management; and inventory controls. Figure 380 shows the program's funding sources. This program is funded primarily through appropriations of General Revenue Funds. The funding for the first phase of the agency's new licensing syst em is included in this program.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM The Indirect Administration program prov ides leadership, oversight, support, and management for the entire agency. Discontinuing this program would result in inefficiencies throughout the other programs because the agency would have no executive services, financial services, or oversight of the agency's budget. Consumers coul d be affected by a lack of transparency because this program would not be able to releas e reports such as a strategic plan, legislative appropriations request, operating budget, annual financial reports, or other st atutorily required reports. Public information requests would not be fulfilled, and no general counsel's office would be avai lable to provide legal advice to the commission. Discontinuing this program would eliminate the agency's information technolo gy services team, which would result in delays in issuing licenses, among other issues.

The Sixty-ninth Legislature, Second Called Session, 1986, authorized the TRC, but it did not take effect until voters approved a statewide referendum in 1987. A funding structure was provided in which the agency would re pay all startup costs with future revenues , plus 12.0 percent interest. The first racetracks were granted licenses in fiscal year 1989. The commission consists of seven members appointed by the Gove rnor and two ex officio members, the chair of the Public Safety Commission or a member designated by the chai r, and the Commissioner of Agriculture or designee. TRC regulates all aspects of pari-mutuel horse and greyho und racing through licensing, onsite monitoring, and enforcement. The agency licenses the follo wing entities and individual s: (1) racetracks that offer racing with pari-mutuel wagering; (2) individuals that participate in racing with pari -mutuel wagering; and (3) indivi duals directly involved wagering that work at the racetracks. TRC allocates race dates, supervises and officiates the conduc t of all races, monitors the health and safety of the race animals, and conducts drug tests to ensure that the animals race without prohibited substa nces. The agency oversees all pari-mutuel wagering activity, approves simulcasts, tests the totalisator systems (complex computer systems that register and calculate pari-mutuel payoffs), and en sures the proper allocation and distribut ion of revenue generated by pari-mutuel wagering. Additionally, TRC administers the Texas Bred Incentive Prog ram, which is funded with wagering-related revenue and provides economic incentives to support the horse and greyho und breeding industries in the state. It also oversees the Horse Industry Escrow Account, which is funded by sales ta xes on certain horse-breeding-related items and is used to support the horse-breeding and racing indu stries. Although the Texas Bred program' s funding is within the Treasury, all funds are passed through to the breeding industry. The Horse In dustry Escrow Account is outside of the Treasury, and up to 70.0 percent of funds may be allocated to horse racetrack associations for use as purses, which are winnings for the top race finishers. Horse breed registries may apply for the rema ining funds for an event that promotes the horse industry. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include estimates for the expenditures necessary to maintain the minimum level of st atutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be greater than or less than current funding levels. The agency was asked to provide a methodology or justification for determining these amounts. The agency chos e to maintain the current level of funding for this exercise. The agency stated that \"current levels of funding are sufficient to maintain\" cert ain programs, while noting that several programs would require funding increases to sustain its oversight and regulatory role. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS Demand, wagering, and overall revenue in the racing in dustry have decreased during the past decade. When these decreases are combined with the current agen cy funding methods, TRC has had difficulty earning enough revenue to support the agency's st atutorily required regulatory functions. The combined effects of House Bill 1995 and House Bi ll 2463, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, enabled a reduction in racetrack license fees and provided racetrac ks an economic stimulus of sorts, due to enhanced racetrack access to funds for support of the industry. The overall decrease in racing participation requires consistent and effective oversight, as TRC notes that participants \"feel driven to take risks as they push to survive in the industry.\" The existence of unlicensed racetracks is an ongoing co ncern regarding illegal activi ties and unregulated racing. TEXAS RACING COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 360 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 Approximately 30.0 percent of TRC's workforce is eligible for retirement by fiscal year 2023, and another 30.0 percent consists of return-to-work retirees. Therefore, the agency projects a shortage in staffing and skill levels necessary to meet future requirements. The agency is having difficulty sustaining the administrati ve responsibilities related to the Texas Bred Incentive Program and the Horse Industry Escrow Account, which was expanded by th e Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019. Because the racing industry tries to be responsive to customer demand for racing events, the TRC is often reactive in responding to the changing circumstances and need for regulation. TRC proposed several alternative fundin g scenarios, some or all of which could provide more solvency for the agency's required regulatory operations. Figure 382 shows that the agency's funding includes General Revenue-Dedicated Funds from Account No. 597, Texas Racing Commission (Account No. 597), and Other Funds from the Texas-bred Incentive Fund, which includes revenue for the Texas Bred Incentive Program, a pass-through fundin g incentive for the horse and greyhound breeding industries. Dedicated funding from Account No. 597 may be used only fo r administration and enforcem ent of laws governing horse racing and greyhound racing. Figure 383 shows that the majority of the $0.8 milli on increase in All Funds is due to the projected increase in Texas Bred awards. However, current decrea ses in the racing industry indicate that this increase will not materialize. Figure 384 shows a $5.5 million decrease in funding from Account No. 597 from the 2018-19 to the 2020-21 biennia, which is due to the re classification of revenues for the Texa s Bred Incentive Program into the Texas- bred Incentive Fund, pursuant to House Bill 3366, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019.

SOURCE : Texas Racing Commission. FUNDING OPTIONS TO CONSIDER TRC is statutorily required to raise its own revenue, whic h is deposited into Account No. 597. All of the Texas Bred Incentive Program funding is passed through the agency from racetracks to eligible re cipients. If General Revenue- Dedicated Funds revenues fall short of th e appropriations, no other funding provid es the difference. The agency also is subject to a requirement in the Eighty-sixth Legislature, General Appropriations Act, 2020-21 Biennium, Article VIII, Special Provisions, Section 2, which limits the agency's a ppropriations to the amounts of revenue actually collected. During fiscal year 2016, three racetracks stopped paying their license fees. This cessation led to a $690,000 shortfall in funding and necessitated a fee restructurin g. Additionally, House Bill 1995, Eighty -sixth Legislature, 2019, amended the Texas Racing Act to provide access to simulcast race pool re venues, which decreased the agency's reliance on racetrack license fees. However, with the ongoing decrease in the number of race days, the simulcast revenue pool may prove to be unreliable. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pa ndemic has decreased racing-related re venues because racetracks have been closed temporarily. See Appendix TRC-B for more information on racing-related revenues. Considering TRC's challenges regarding ea rning enough revenue to perform its regu latory functions adequately, the agency has proposed several alternative funding op tions for the Legislature's consideration. OPTION 1 - EXPAND ALLOWABLE USES OF THE HORSE INDUSTRY ESCROW ACCOUNT Direct a portion of the proceeds from sales taxes on the sale, storage, or use of horse feed, horse supplements, horse track, and other related items currently allocated to this account an d outside the Treasury to TRC for administrative purposes. Funds could be directed to the existing Account No. 597. Current statute provides up to $50.0 million for the biennium, which must be used for the horse industry. Of this amount, 70 .0 percent is allocated for race purses, and 30.0 percent is allocated for the industry via an application process. If race track license fees and the simulc ast tax revenue currently direct ed to TRC were replaced with this fundin g source, TRC would require $7.0 million for the biennium. However, this option is scalable, and a lower amount still would help to address funding concerns. OPTION 2 - ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM SIMULCAST POOLS Deduct an additional 0.5 percent from th e current 1.0 percent of each simulcast p ool and the current 1.25 percent of each cross-species simulcast pool. These simulcas t revenues are deducted and distributed to TRC for administration of the Texas Racing Act. The simulcast wagering pool in fiscal year 2019 was $251.9 million (see Appendix TRC-B ). An additional 0.5 percent would provide approximately $2.9 million for the biennium. OPTION 3 - LIVE WAGERING POOL Require the live wagering pool to suppor t TRC by deducting 2.0 percent of the live wagering pool. Current statute requires the live racing wagering handle, which is the dollar amount of wagers placed on live races, to reach $100.0 million during a calendar year before revenue may be set aside for the state. Considering the decreases in the live wagering pool, it may be prudent to remove the threshold and authorize the agency to rece ive 2.0 percent. The live wagering pool in fiscal year 2019 was $19.1 million (see Appendix TRC-B ). Based on this amount, 2.0 percent for the biennium would provide $765,200. OPTION 4 - UNCLAIMED WINNING TICKETS Provide TRC the revenue from unclaimed winning tickets and vouchers, known as outs. Racetracks currently retain the outs funding that remains after their costs for drug testing is deducted. The agency received these revenues before fiscal STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS RACING COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 363 year 2012, and racetrack license fees repl aced the funding source to establish a mo re equitable obligation across racetracks. However, considering recent issues of nonpayment of racetr ack license fees, providing thes e revenues to TRC with an understanding that license fees would be adjusted may help with cash flow. TRC estimates that outs would provide $605,000 for the biennium. OPTION 5 - CONSOLIDATE THE GENERAL REVENUE-DEDI CATED FUNDS ACCOUNT INTO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS Remove the General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 597, dire ct the agency's existing revenue streams into General Revenue Funds, and appropriate General Revenue Funds to TRC instead. The Legislature would have to amend the current statutory restriction on the use of General Revenue Funds by the Racing Commission. However, this option would enable the agency to begin operations each year without rely ing on a balance from the previous year. This option also would align TRC with most other regulatory agencies, wh ose General Revenue-Dedicated Funds accounts have been consolidated into General Revenue Funds. If options 2, 3, an d 4 also were adopted, the total of these revenues could be deposited to the General Revenue Fund. Note that the racetr acks are required to make up shortages of simulcast tax revenue, pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code, Title 16, Part 8, Section 309.8(c)(2). SUPERVISE AND CONDUCT LIVE RACES The Texas Racing Act, the Texas Occupations Code, Sections 2023 .001, 2023.101, 2025.251, and 2025.262 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The agency regulates and supervises each greyhound or horse race meet involving pari-mutuel wagering to ensure fair racing activities.

STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS RACING COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 365 SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS STAFFING CHALLENGES According to the agency, TRC has experienced difficulty meet ing its obligations to provide adequate supervision of racetracks due to decreased staff and sala ry resources. Stewards, racing judges, an d most of the other staff dedicated to regulating live racing are an integral part of each day of live racing. Most of the hours they work are dedicated to the supervision of the race performance. As the agency has had increased difficulty overseeing tracks, TRC staff have less communication with occupational licensees, including racetrac k personnel, horsemen, jockey s, veterinarians, kennelmen, and other racing participants. This decreased communication in turn decreases the ability of the agency to fully monitor and supervise racing activities. UNREGULATED TRACKS Unregulated tracks are a continual proble m in the state. TRC collaborates with lo cal, state, and federal law enforcement to track and investigate these operations, which have been found to be conducting illegal wagering on races with many different kinds of animals. TRC has statutory authority to regu late tracks that do not offer pari-mutuel wagering. However, it likely would be difficult to enforce these largel y underground operations to submit to licensure. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Loss of government regulatory oversight an d enforcement by judges and stewards coul d lead to increased criminal activity at racetracks and may endanger the lives of individuals and race animal s. Individuals that wish to influence racing illegally could use this lack of oversight as increased opportunity. Ad ditionally, the wagering public may lose confidence in the fairness of their wagers. State and local revenue may be lost due to diminished wagering. INSPECT AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE The Texas Racing Act, the Texa s Occupations Code, Section 2023. 103 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Veterinarians inspect each animal before it races to safeguard the health of racing pa rticipants and ensure a fair race for the wagering public. During each race, a vete rinarian provides emergency care and atte ntion as needed and inspects the barns and kennel areas for health and safety issu es. In addition to the training oversight program, the TRC, in partnership with the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine, has an equine necropsy program to reduce the number of catastrophic injuries. The program's goal is to identify risk factors that veterinarians can assess and dete ct in pre-race examinations. Figures 388 and 389 show the program's current and histor ical funding by method of finance.

SIGNIFICANT FINDING Fourteen horses expired or were euthanized last year at Texa s racetracks. The oversight of morning training sessions enables veterinarians to identify horses at risk of injury due to possible pre-existing co nditions. Veterinarians observe horses with weight-on, before and after exercise , and while on th e track surface. The agency contracts with four veterinarians that provide testin g, medical observation, and medical assistance to race horses and greyhounds at racetracks on live race days. The Eighty-six th Legislature, 2019, provided the agency $36,000 to increase veterinarian services at live race meets. This funding is used for contract services, but the agency has indicated that additional funding is necessary to address animal health and safety needs adequately. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Impartial racing officials, such as TRC ve terinarians, would not be able to inspec t, monitor, and enforce policies against physical abuse and drug abuse against racing animals, thus endangering individuals and animals. Owners, trainers, and the wagering public would not be protected sufficien tly from illicit activity by organized crime and others that seek to influence racing illegally for financial gain. Loss of confidence in th e health and welfare of individu als and racing animals likely would diminish the value of racing overall, incite the protests of animal activists, and may cause the closure of racetracks. This lost confidence or closure of tracks could cause the loss of revenue to the state and to local economies. MONITOR LICENSEE ACTIVITIES The Texas Racing Act, the Texas Occupations Code, Chapters 2022 , 2023, and 2025 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Moderate PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Investigators monitor licensee activities, co nduct racetrack facilities in spections, conduct investigations on positive animal drug tests, review criminal histories returned on license a pplicants, and detect illegal wagering, contraband, human drug TEXAS RACING COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 368 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 abuse, narcotics trafficking, and other illicit activities.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Loss of regulatory oversight and enforcement could lead to incr eased criminal activity at ra cetracks and may endanger the lives of individuals and race animals. Additionally, the wagering public may lose confidence in the fairness of their wagers, which could lead to decreased revenue for racetracks. This decr eased industry revenue likely wi ll result in decreased revenue for the state and local economy. Costs likely would increase for the Department of Public Safety and local police departments that address increased organized crime and illegal activity at racetracks. In addition, the loss of oversight could increase risk of injury or loss of life to race anim als and individuals including tr ainers, jockeys, and owners. ADMINISTER DRUG TESTS The Texas Racing Act, the Texa s Occupations Code, Section 2034. 002 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Veterinarians and test barn staff collect blood and urine sample s from race animals for laboratory testing. This program is intended to protect the health and welfare of animals by dete cting any inappropriate use of a range of drugs and substances, both therapeutic and nontherapeutic. Pursuant to the Texas Racing Act, the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) must perform all animal drug testing for the Texas Racing Commission. TRC has a contract with TVMDL for up to $5,000 per year. Figures 394 and 395 show the program's current and historical funding by method of finance. FIGURE 394 ADMINISTER DRUG TESTS PROGRAM FUNDING SOURCES, 2020-21 BIENNIUM SOURCE : Texas Racing Commission.

Texas has made significant progress in adop ting national regulatory standards, part icularly in the area of identifying and correcting the use of prohibited drugs in racing. The agen cy's Administer Drug Tests program detected prohibited substances or overages of therapeutic medi cations in horses in 20.1 per 1,000 specim ens tested during fiscal year 2019, as shown in Figure 396 . Aligning the state's rules and policies to matc h those of other national leaders should improve licensees' ability to comply with those expectations as they mo ve their racing operations among states. However, established rules and regulations are not suffi cient to prevent the illegal activities of partic ipants that continue to experiment with new drugs and substances that could harm an animal, alter the outcom e of a race, or interfere with the detection of illegal drugs. The agency continues to collaborate with TVMDL to stay ah ead of this problem. Any si gnificant change in TVMDL's budget and operations could affe ct TRC's drug testing program.

STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW TEXAS RACING COMMISSION OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 371 ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuing this program could lead to safety issues for jockeys, horses, and greyhounds. Drugs used to enhance the performance of animals are unfair to owners, trainers, and th e wagering public. Additionally, the influence of organized crime could increase if drug testing were not conducted. Ra cing animals that are drugged with performance enhancement or pain-killing drugs are more likely to become injured and die. Animals that are artificially induced with performance- enhancing drugs can fail on the racetrac k and fall, causing harm or death to jo ckeys. TRC investigates and prosecutes several cases of illegal drug activity at racetracks each year. OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING The Texas Racing Act, the Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 2025; the Texas Government Code, Section 2054.111 Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION TRC has more than 50 occupa tional categories for which it issues license ce rtificates in the form of identification cards showing a licensee's photograph and other information. All appl icants must submit fingerprints that are forwarded to the Department of Public Safety and the Federal Bureau of In vestigation for a criminal background check. Several state regulatory agencies provide similar lice nsing functions. For example, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) provides licensing for various professions. The ma in difference between TRC's licensing functions and TDLR's is TRC's ability to provide the services onsite at the lice nsed racetracks. TRC's licensing technicians coordinate with racetrack stewards and judges to determine who meets the eligib ility requirements, verify that an individual has passed any required examination, and issue photo identification cards. Additionally, the licensing te chnicians are responsible for ensuring that all racing participants are licensed before th e races begin. The state government website Texas.gov provides online licensing applications for certain types of occupational licenses issued by TRC.

TEXAS BRED INCENTIVE The Texas Racing Act, the Texa s Occupations Code, Section 2028. 103 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Texas Bred Incentive Program includes the following major activities: reconciling funds received from the racetracks into the Texas Bred accounts; allocating funds in accordance with TRC-approved cr iteria; issuing payments to the official breed organizations as provided in rule; and auditing the reci pients of those payments for compliance. The program affects multiple individuals and entities, includin g the racetracks, various official breed or ganizations across the state, racing hors e owners, stallion and broodmare owners, breeders, and gr eyhound owners. The racetracks must meet eligibility requirements set in the Texas Racing Act and rules governing the ownership and operat ions of a pari-mutuel facility in the state. The animal owners must be licensed by TRC, includin g completing a criminal backgr ound investigation and paying a licensing fee.

TEXAS RACING COMMISSION STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 386 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINERS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 387 STATE BOARD OF VETERINA RY MEDICAL EXAMINERS The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 801 AGENCY DESCRIPTION The stated mission of the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners (BVME) is to establish and enforce policies to ensure the best possible quality of veterinary an d equine dental provider services for Texas. The Legislature established the BVME in 191 1 to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine, surgery, and dentistry. The Legislature added responsibilities for the licensure and regula tion of equine dental provid ers in 2011 and veterinary technicians in 2013. BVME's primary purpose is to ensure that individuals that ente r the veterinary practice or provide equine dental services have demonstrated the ability to meet or exceed the state's mi nimum qualifications required to be a licensed veterinarian, veterinary technician, or equine dental provider. The agency carries out its responsibilities through its four programs, including Enforcement, Licensing, Peer Assistance, and Indirect Administration. The agency's governing board consists of nine members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate and includes five veterinarians, one licensed veterina ry technician, and three public representatives. Board members are appointed for staggered six-year terms. The agency's enabling statute and the General Appropriations Act require BVME to establis h and assess fees in amounts that are reasonable and necessary to generate revenue suffici ent to cover the costs of implementing its responsibilities. BVME rules set licensing fees to meet these requirements. Figure 413 shows the agency's funding sources for the 2020- 21 biennium, which consist primarily of ag ency fee-generated General Revenue Funds.

SOURCES : Legislative Budget Board; Board of Veterinary Medical Examine rs. SIGNIFICANT FINDING The agency has experienced significant employee turnover during recent fiscal years and vaca ncies in key positions, which the agency reports was initiated by the BVME's last Sunset review process during the 2016-17 biennium. Sunset Advisory Commission staff identified si gnificant operational and administrative is sues at BVME, including poor financial management. As a result, the Eighty-fifth Legislature, Regu lar Session, 2017, continued the agency until September 1, 2021, and the agency is subject to a limited-scope review by Sunset Adviso ry Commission staff during the 2020-21 biennium. BVME reports that when the agency's new executive administra tion started in fiscal year 2018, the agency had seven key vacancies, and four additional separations followed. Accord ing to the Legislative Workforce Summary prepared by the STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINERS OCTOBER 2020 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 389 State Auditor's Office (SAO) for the Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, BVME's turnover rate was 41.2 percent in fiscal year 2018. The agency's turnover rate in fiscal year 2019 was 27.4 percent. The Sunset review during the 2016-17 biennium included a management direct ive for BVME to review the job description for the chief financial officer position and modify the qualific ations, responsibilities, and job duties as needed to ensure that the job description accurately represents the position's requirements. Subsequently, th e agency's executive director would ensure that the agency hires an in dividual who is qualified and properly tr ained to perform these duties. The agency reports that, to date, it has not been able find a suit able candidate for the chief financial officer position. As of June 2020, the agency reported that all but two of th e 21.0 full-time-equivalent (FTE ) positions were staffed. The two vacant positions included 1.0 FTE le gal assistant position in the Enforcemen t program and the chief financial officer (1.0 position). In anticipation of potential reductions to General Revenue Funds ap propriations for the 2020-21 biennium, the agency has pr oposed leaving the legal assistant position vacant. Based on program budget information submitted by the agency for this review, salaries and wages and other personnel costs make up 79.1 percent (or $2.2 million) of the agency's total budget for the 2020-21 biennium, compared to 73.1 percent of total expenditures for the 2018-19 biennium. Th e SAO's Workforce Summary for fiscal year 2018 reported that 98.4 percent of BVME's staff were paid below the midpoint of the salary range in which they were assigned, and the agency's average salary amount of $46,836 was below the averag e salary amount of $60,376 fo r all agencies included in the General Appropriations Act, Article VIII, Regulatory function. The agency reports having few internal advancement opportunities, but the administration has used merit sala ry increases, onetime merit increases, and professional advancement to encourage staff's tenure with the agency. Beca use of the agency's small size and budget, BVME has limited additional capacity to use merit salary increases as an employee retention option. In information submitted by the agency for the Strategi c Fiscal Review, BVME report ed minimum program funding amounts greater than the amounts appropriated for the 2020-21 biennium to recruit and retain qualified staff, including the chief financial officer position. ENFORCEMENT The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 801, Subchapters I, J, and K Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners' Enforcement prog ram conducts inspections and investigations of complaints to ensure compliance with the state Veterinary Licensing A c t a n d B V M E r u l e s . T h i s p r o g ram also monitors licensee compliance with disciplinary orders. Th e Enforcement program is the agency's la rgest program in budget and allocation of FTE positions. The program includes the agency's Enforcem ent and Legal divisions. The ag ency allocates 14.0 of its 21.0 authorized FTE positions to the Enforcement program. Figure 416 shows that the program is funded with $1.7 million in General Revenue Funds, which is 62.3 percent of the agency's tota l appropriated funding for the 2020-21 biennium.

The agency's Enforcement division conducts investigations based on complaints re ceived from the public and from other local, state, and federal agencies, and co mplaints generated from the division's co mpliance inspections. BVME investigators review complaints, complete investigations, and determine whether jurisdictional violat ions have occurred. After completion of an investigation, the complaint is routed to the Legal division with a recommendation for prosecution or dismissal. The Legal division prosecutes cases against licensees, license a pplicants, and unlicensed indivi duals that have violated the state Veterinary Licensing Act.

SOURCE : Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuation of the Enforcement prog ram would eliminate the agency's Enforc ement and Legal divisions, leaving the agency without investigators to conduct compliance inspecti ons and complaint investigations and without legal staff to take action on violations of the Veterinary Licensing Act. According to the agency, the abse nce of compliance inspections would enable noncompliant, isolated licensees to remain unid entified for lengthy periods, which would pose risks to the public due to their noncompliance with BVME rules and lack of knowledge of changing veterinary practice standards. The agency reports that the most serious and most common cases generated from inspections involve violations related to controlled substances. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE As shown in Figure 419 , the agency reported a biennial minimum fund ing amount that is $110,136 (or 6.4 percent) greater than 2020-21 biennial appropriated amounts for the Enforcement program. The difference primarily consists of additional funding for salaries and wages and other personnel co sts for 1.0 additional FTE position and to retain qualified staff.

During the Strategic Fiscal Review for fiscal year 2020, the ag ency posted a position for a legal assistant (1.0 FTE position) to support the Legal division in the Enfo rcement program; however, the agency was not able to find a suitable candidate. The agency has decided to leave the position vacant in anti cipation of potential reductions to General Revenue Funds appropriations for the 2020-21 biennium. LICENSING The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 801, Subchapters F and G Mission Centrality - Strong; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners is required to provide for the licensure and examination of veterinarians, licensed veterinary technicians (LVT), and equine dental pr oviders (EDP). An individual may not practice veterinary medicine, perform equine dentistry, or act as an LVT in Texas without the appropriate BVME-issued license. The agency's Licensing program is respon sible for reviewing license applications and documentation, performing criminal history checks, administering jurisprudenc e examinations, and issuing licenses to individuals who meet the qualifications. The Licensing program also processes applications for annual li cense renewal, which includes ensuring that licensees meet continuing education requirements, are in compliance with applicable laws, and have submitted the renewal fees. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, the agency reported 10,818 active licenses, including 8,885 veterinarian, 1,873 LVT, and 60 EDP licenses. Figure 420 shows total funding of $741,724 for the Licensin g program for the 2020-21 biennium, which includes $730,670 in General Revenue Funds and $11,054 in Other Funds from Appropriated Receipts.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM Discontinuation of the Licensing program would eliminate the agency's ability to process a pplications for licensure and renewals, and the ability to ensure that individuals meet the minimum qualifications to practice veterinary medicine and equine dentistry in Texas. Additionally, BVME is required st atutorily to set fees in amounts reasonable and necessary to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of its operations and administering its responsi bilities. The agency generates revenue to cover the cost of direct appropriations for all BV ME programs and other indirect costs (e.g., employee benefits) through the assessment and collection of fees on license rene wals and new license applications. Past Legislatures, with evidence of the agency's licensee associations' support for fee increases, have used provisions of contingent revenue in the General Appropriations Act to require the agency to increase f ee revenue in amounts sufficient to offset increases in General Revenue Funds for the agency's exceptiona l item requests and appropriations incr eases for implementing requirements of BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINERS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 394 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 new legislation. Therefore, discontinuatio n of the licensing program would limit the Legislature's ability to use contingent revenue requirements to offset increases in General Revenue Funds appropriations to BVME. The Comptroller of Public Accounts' Janu ary 2019 Biennial Revenue Estimate projected that the agency would collect $3.8 million in General Revenue Funds fr om professional licensing fees and Peer Assistance program fees for the 2020-21 biennium, which is $0.2 million greate r than the agency's total General Reve nue Funds appropriations and estimated employee benefits costs for the 2020-21 biennium. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE The agency reported a biennial minimum funding amount that is $29,818 (or 4.0 percent) greater than 2020-21 biennial appropriated amount for the Licensing pr ogram. The difference consists primarily of additional funding for salaries and wages and other personnel costs to retain qualified staff. In accordance with the agency's current budget methodology, salaries and other personnel costs for certain executive administ ration staff, including the Executive Director and the chief financial officer, are allocated among the Licensing and En forcement programs. PEER ASSISTANCE The Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 467; the Texas Occupa tions Code, Section 801.157 Mission Centrality - Moderate; Authority - Strong PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners is required to establish or approve a Peer Assistance program to help professionals whose ability to perform is impaired by dependen cy on drugs or alcohol or by mental illness. The agency contracts with a vendor to provide peer assistance services for impaired licensees, and no ag ency FTE positions are funded through this program. Pursuant to the Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 467, th e agency may add a surcharge of up to $10 to its license fee or license renewal fee to fund an approved peer assistance program. The agency currently includes a surcharge of $6 on each veterinarian and equine dental provider license renewal. The General Appropriations Act requires the agency to collect revenue from peer assistance surc harges sufficient to cover the amou nts appropriated for the program. Figures 423 and 424 show funding of $90,000 in General Revenue Funds for the 2020-21 biennium, $45,000 each fiscal year, for the Peer Assistance program. The agency collected $49,931 from Peer A ssistance program fees during fi scal year 2019 and projects similar revenue collections sufficient to cover appropriat ions for each fiscal year of the 2020-21 biennium.

A licensee may participate voluntarily in th e Peer Assistance program. However, if a licensee is subject to disciplinary action based on a finding that the individual is impaired by chemical dependency or mental illness, BVME may order the licensee to submit to care, counseling, or treatm ent through the program. During fiscal ye ar 2019, 22 individuals participated in the Peer Assistance program. As of the second quarter of fi scal year 2020 ending February 2020, the agency reported 19 licensees participating in the program, including eight vo luntary participants and 11 board-ordered participants.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to BVME, the Peer Assistance program helps to av oid potential complaints agai nst licensees, disciplinary actions, and license revocations by providing services to assist impaired licensees in their recovery. EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE Senate Bill 68, Eighty-sixth Legislature, 2019, expanded Strate gic Fiscal Review requirements to include fiscal estimates for the expenditures needed to maintain the minimum level of statutorily required service. Fiscal amounts for the minimum level of service could be higher or lower than existing fund ing levels. The agency was asked to provide a methodology or BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINERS STRATEGIC FISCAL REVIEW 396 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD ID: 6450 OCTOBER 2020 justification for determining these amounts. The agency chos e to maintain the current le vel of funding for the Peer Assistance program for this exercise. INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 801 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The agency's Indirect Administration program provides su pport for human resources, pu rchasing, and administrative support for customer service. The agency currently allocates 2.0 full-time-equivalen t positions to Indirect Administration, which includes 1.0 FTE position for a sta ff services officer, and partial allocation of 0.5 FTE position for a purchaser and 0.5 position for an administrative assistant. The remainder of the FTE allocations for the purchaser and administrative assistant positions are allocated to the Licensing and En forcement programs for direct administrative support. Figure 426 shows that the Indirect Administration program is funded with $216,682 in General Revenue Funds for the 2020-21 biennium.

ADVERSE EFFECT OF DISCONTINUING PROGRAM According to BVME, discontinuing the In direct Administration program would negatively impact funding for three administrative support positions at the agency. Discontinued funding would leav e the agency without a dedicated staff services officer that oversees employee benefits, personnel issu es, basis of employment law, agency reports, and payroll. Other affected positions would include a purchaser in charge of purchasing for all agency programs and processing board member vouchers and an administrative assistant that assi sts in customer service for the Licensing and Enforcement programs by directing ca lls in a timely manner.
