EMDB accession codes are about to change! (news from PDBe EMDB page) EMDB accession codes are about to change! (news from PDBe EMDB page) - The allocation of 4 digits for EMDB accession codes will soon come to an end. Whilst these codes will remain in use, new EMDB accession codes will include an additional digit and will expand incrementally as the available range of codes is exhausted. The current 4-digit format prefixed with \"EMD-\" (i.e. EMD-XXXX) will advance to a 5-digit format (i.e. EMD-XXXXX), and so on. It is currently estimated that the 4-digit codes will be depleted around Spring 2019, at which point the 5-digit format will come into force. - The EM Navigator/Yorodumi systems omit the EMD- prefix.

Major update of PDB Major update of PDB - wwPDB released updated PDB data conforming to the new PDBx/mmCIF dictionary. - This is a major update changing the version number from 4 to 5, and with Remediation, in which all the entries are updated. - In this update, many items about electron microscopy experimental information are reorganized (e.g. em_software). - Now, EM Navigator and Yorodumi are based on the updated data.
