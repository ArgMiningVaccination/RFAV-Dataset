From 100% natural perfumes to clean perfumes that include synthetics and top notes to dry downs, it's easy to get confused in the rapidly growing world of natural non-toxic perfumes. The natural fragrance industry has grown significantly in recent years with socially conscious, niche perfume brands opting for cleaner and vegan formulations. Top clean fragrance brands like Sana Jardin and Maison Louis Marie are revered names and The 7 Virtues and Heretic Parfum can be found in the aisles of Sephora stores. Even Michelle Pfeiffer, who swore off wearing conventional fragrance a decade ago, launched her own clean fragrance brand, Henry Rose. But which are the healthiest perfumes? Which clean perfumes are long lasting? This 2023 organic perfume guide will help you navigate the best natural perfumes, discover which clean fragrance scents might be right for you, and provide a more in-depth understanding of non toxic perfumes. So toss aside your toxic Chanel perfume and read on. Olfactory senses are the only place in the human body where the central nervous system comes into direct contact with the environment.... In other words, before we know we are in contact with a smell, we have already received and reacted to it. - From the book Essence and Alchemy: A Natural History of Perfume by natural perfumer Mandy Aftel Out of all five senses, it's our sense of the smell that has the strongest connection to memory. A scent can instantly transport you to a specific time and place. The smell of vanilla wafers instantly takes me back to being dropped off at the babysitter's as a 5 year old. Now that I'm an adult, scent is another form of self-expression, but mostly a form of self-care and healing. It has been a long journey (nearly a decade) into the world of clean fragrance, and it's with great pleasure that I write this guide. A lot of natural perfume articles on the web don't differentiate between top clean fragrance scents that are 100% natural & organic and ones that use synthetics, choosing instead to lump them all under the umbrella term of \"non-toxic clean perfumes.\" For those that actually need the most natural perfumes due to health reasons (or simply get a headache from synthetics), using the word \"non-toxic\" for non-100% natural perfumes is misleading. In this clean fragrance guide I'll be covering the following eight topics: - What is a Natural perfume vs. Clean perfume? - What are safe synthetics? - Why aren't clean perfumes long lasting? - What's the difference between a perfume oil & perfume spray - Basic perfume terms - Best 100% natural and organic perfume brands - Best clean perfume brands (with synthetics) - OBL personal favorite fragrances For dozens of individual perfume brand reviews, check out the \" [Fragrance](https://organicbeautylover.com/category/perfume/)\" category on the blog. I've also enlisted the help of [Providence Perfume Co. ](http://Providenceperfumeco.com)owner and award-winning botanical perfumer Charna Ethier for an industry expert's insight and advice. If you'd like to skip to the list of best natural and clean perfume brands, scroll down towards the bottom of the post. I'm continuously trying more natural perfumes, so be sure to check back here regularly for updates. Fragrance is such a personal thing, so while this guide is meant to point you in the right direction, the best way to know if a perfume is right for you is to actually try it. Most clean fragrance companies offer sample vials for purchase or discovery sets that include a variety of their top non toxic fragrances. What is a Natural Perfume VS Clean Perfume? There are two main categories of natural perfumes in clean beauty. On one hand, you have 100% natural and organic perfumes without any synthetics included. And on the other hand, you have clean perfumes that combine both natural and synthetic ingredients. Each one caters to different types of consumers and needs. Clean perfumes that include synthetics will have more similarities to conventional fragrance. So if you're a diehard conventional fragrance lover, but still want to try to choose cleaner options, then clean perfumes with synthetics will be the easiest transition for you. 100% natural and organic perfume brands are staunchly against putting any type of synthetic, whether it's deemed a \"safe synthetic\" or not, in their products. The potential health risks of these synthetics are too great for organic perfume houses to ever use. Organic perfume brands do not formulate using synthetics, petrochemicals, fragrance oils, dyes, parabens, pthathlates or chemical fragrances. You have two very different company philosophies within the same industry. I chatted with Providence Perfume Co owner & master botanical perfumer Charna Ethier, who shared a few tips for discerning if a fragrance is truly natural or botanical (made from plants and flowers, not aroma chemicals): 1. Is the perfume colored or is it clear? It's almost impossible to make a true natural perfume that's clear as most natural essences are brightly colored when distilled. For example real jasmine absolute is a dark orange brown color. 2. Is it expensive? Most natural perfumes are costly as the materials are very expensive in comparison to synthetic aroma chemicals. If the fragrance is a bargain I highly doubt it's natural. 3. Does it smell familiar or like other perfumes you've worn for years? If so, it's likely got synthetic ingredients in it. Natural perfumes smell a little different from mainstream perfumes which are about 98% synthetic. Real sandalwood smells nothing like synthetic sandalwood, same for rose and jasmine. The real flower smells different from the chemical version! Another thing to note about natural perfumes vs chemical perfumes is that the more synthetic a perfume the more it will smell the same, no matter what, on any person. Natural perfumes, on the other hand, tend to be more affected by an individual's unique body chemistry and can smell different from person to person. A fragrance is also affected by the temperature and the level of moisture in your skin. Perfume experts advise that moisturizing your skin before applying perfume can help it last longer. Fragrances also travel better in the heat during warmer months. What are \"Safe Synthetics\" in Clean Perfumes? More and more clean perfume brands are using safe synthetics in order to smell and perform more similarly to a fine fragrance. But how do we really know if these synthetics are actually safe for human health? The answer is we can't know for certain \u2014 all we can do as consumers is trust (or not trust) product manufacturers. According to organic perfume brand [One Seed](http://Oneseedperfumes.com), ...The problem with this definition [safe synthetics] is that 75% of chemicals used in fragrance and cosmetics have never been, nor will ever be, tested for human or environmental safety. So we are relying on lack of data to call an ingredient safe - basically, innocent until proven guilty. It is, in fact, quite rare for a chemical to be extensively tested for its potential health effects, and even more rare for one to be banned for commercial use. Even after proving harmful effects, it can take up to twenty-five years for a chemical to be removed from use. More often, if there are concerns around safety, there may be industry or government recommendations for limiteduse, but no actual legislation or regulation to prevent its use. In the fragrance industry, testing tends to be only in relation to potential allergic reactions, looking at a small cohort of people over a very short time period (usually a few hours or days), with no concern as to how these chemicals might be interfering with [hormones], organs, or body systems. The cost of extensively testing a single chemical is around $1million, which is a strong deterrent that prevents many manufacturers from investigating these molecules. Unfortunately, testing is not a a prerequisite for use, so a chemical can be released for commercial use with very little, if any, governance. The onus is on product manufacturers to select ingredients that have a history of long-term safe use with no red flags around potential links to health or environmental issues, and ideally those that have undergone extensive testing. The reality is that rarely happens. What's the Difference Between Perfume Oils & Sprays If you're wondering whether to purchase a clean perfume oil or perfume spray, Charna breaks down the pros and cons of each. Oil based perfumes should last longer on the skin because oil evaporates off the skin at a slower rate than alcohol. That being said, oil based perfumes have very little sillage or scent projection. Oil perfumes are very close to the skin and are a good choice for someone who likes a subtle scent. Someone would have to lean in very close to smell a natural oil based perfume on your skin. Alcohol based fragrances have much more \"scent throw\" than oil based fragrances. It's very hard for natural perfumes to rival the potency of perfumes made with petrochemicals and aroma chemicals. Natural essences are softer and dissipate faster than chemicals. That being said, one of my claims to fame as a botanical perfumer is creating long lasting more potent fragrances. I achieve this through creating most of my fragrances at an eau de parfum potency. Why Aren't Natural Perfumes Long Lasting? One of the biggest complaints I see over and over again is that clean perfumes disappear too quickly. \"Very poor sillage\" and \"zero longevity\" are other phrases I hear often \u2014 it seems that regular consumers aren't exactly aware of how different natural perfumes are from conventional ones. Natural perfumes simply don't have the same performance as their toxic counterparts, because they don't contain lab-engineered ingredients that artificially extend their wear. Conventional fragrance contain a ton of chemical additives that increase the longevity of a fragrance, most commonly hormone-disrupting phthalates. Their potential health risks are what spurred the likes of Hollywood A-lister Michelle Pfeiffer to forgo fine fragrances entirely and create Henry Rose. Charna adds, Natural essences are super expensive, so I think some of the issue with longevity or potency with naperfumes occurs when perfumers don't formulate their fragrances with enough essence. Mainstream perfumes cost about $3.00 to make and that includes the bottle and the box! Whereas every drop of real rose oil costs $1! My profit margin is dramatically lower as it costs me much more to create my fragrances. If you're choosing a clean perfume for your health, then performance is something you'll need to be willing to compromise. Just like there isn't a natural hairspray that can give the extreme hold of a toxin-filled supermarket hairspray, natural perfumes will not have the same performance of a toxic fragrance. In my experience with clean fragrances, most will last a few hours and some will even last up to 5-7 hours as they gradually subside. Even among clean perfumes that contain synthetics, there are some brands that last longer than others. For example, By Rosie Jane and Ellis Brooklyn have somewhat less longevity than other synthetic clean perfumes. Clean perfumes that have more synthetics in their formula will have better performance. Natural perfumes are meant to be re-applied, which is why perfume oils are a great option if you want your fragrance to last all day and into the night. I recommend spritzing at least 4-5 times for clean perfumes to last at least 3-4 hours. Basic Perfume Terms I'm covering just a handful of the most basic perfume terms in this guide: - Projection: How far away from the wearer someone else would be able to smell the fragrance. - Sillage: How much of a trail of scent is left behind the wearer. - Performance: How long lasting a perfume is - Top notes: First notes that one smells after applying a fragrance. - Middle notes: Also known has heart notes, these are primary notes that define the way a scent is described and categorized. - Base notes: The heaviest, longest-lasting notes in a fragrance, that reveal themselves after the heart notes have evaporated. Base notes are present during the middle phase of a perfume, providing depth to the perfume, but once the heart notes have disappeared, the base notes take on a character of their own. - Dry down: The final scent of a fragrance after the note and middle notes have evaporated. - Gourmand: A scent that evokes food, usually a dessert. Has notes of vanilla, chocolate, fruit, caramel, and more. - Skin scent: A scent with minimal projection (i.e., one that can only be detected when extremely close to the wearer - Eau de Cologne: least concentrated style of fragrance, with a perfume oil to alcohol ratio of only 2-5% - Eau de Parfum: fragrance with a 10-15% concentration of perfume oil to alcohol - Eau de Toilette: fragrance with a 5-10% concentration of perfume oil to alcohol BEST CLEAN VANILLA PERFUMES I'm recommending my top picks for a couple popular scent categories that I think anyone could enjoy!

This Sana Jardin Paris perfume is a sweet, floral with some patchouli. In my clean fragrance journey, Incense Water comes closest to my former favorite fragrance by Paco Rabanne. [Lake by Rosie Jane](https://shrsl.com/3l94f) I'm a sucker for vanilla and so far, out of all the vanilla-y clean fragrances I've tried, I preferred Lake By Rosie Jane. Sultry with a hint of tartness, romantic and so easy to wear, I can see myself using Lake everyday. The other clean vanilla perfumes I like are Moodeux Worthy and the organic One Seed Solitude, which has strong earthy top notes but dries down to a beautiful earthy vanilla. [Sweet Jasmine Brown by Providence Perfume Co ](https://www.providenceperfume.com/products/sweet-jasmine-brown-perfume-oil?variant=958903961)(Oil) Another natural fragrance that stood out to me right away was Sweet Jasmine Brown. Jasmine is the dominant scent of this perfume oil but you also get gourmand notes of vanilla, tonka and cocoa nib along with Musk ambrette, pink pepper and ylang ylang to add depth. It's like a cup of jasmine tea with the sweetness and allure of burnt sugar. [Arizona Bloom by Floral Street](https://us.floralstreet.com/collections/all-fragrance-new/products/arizona-bloom-eau-de-parfum) Floral Street, as you can guess by its name, is all about florals. Some of their perfumes smelled too synthetic to me, especially Chypre Sublime, but I was taken by Arizona Bloom. [Solitude by One Seed (Unisex)](https://oneseedperfumes.com/products/solitude-eau-de-parfum) One Seed is a line of mostly unisex fragrances that's very different from the usual floral and feminine fragrance brands I've tried. But I can and do enjoy woodsy scents. Solitude is my favorite One Seed scent with its notes of black pepper, dry woods, tarragon, pale vanilla, ambrette seed, tonka bean, and orris root. It has the unisex woodsiness but it also leans gourmand and is warm and alluring. My other favorite One Seed perfume is Bohemia, but it doesn't officially make my personal favorites list as I can't see myself wearing it everyday. Solitude is great if you usually like Givenchy Pi, Chanel Egoiste, Replica Jazz Club, Jo Malone Myrrh & Tonka [Pua Lei by Leahlani ](https://shrsl.com/3l930)(Oil) Leahlani Pua Lei I has a strong scent memory that transports me to Hawaii and all the amazing memories I made there. While Leahlani has other Hawaii-inspired perfumes, Pua Lei transports in a way that their other perfumes don't. [Love In A Mist by Providence Perfume Co](https://www.providenceperfume.com/products/love-in-a-mist-eau-de-parfum?variant=20201457543) For an intoxicatingly sweet and feminine floral scent, Love-in-a-mist is an incredible perfume made of a rare distillation of nigella damascene, a flower called Love In A Mist. It also has notes of mimosa, sandalwood and sweet clover. Check out: Be sure to "}
