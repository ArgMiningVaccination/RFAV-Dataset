Intensive forest fragmentation of the Midwest United States limits the number of available nesting trees. We quantified annual nest-site selection patterns by southern flying squirrels across fragmented landscapes of west-central Illinois,USA. We used radiotelemetry to measure nest-tree use by 55 SFS (30 males, 25 females) captured during 2014-2016. Of 105 nest trees used by SFS, live trees and snags comprised 75% and 25%, respectively. Probability of diurnal nest-tree use increased 1.08/1.00-cm increase in diameter-breast-height and by 1.50/1-unit increase in the number of overstorymast trees between random and nest-tree habitat areas (i.e., 300-m2 circular plots). Similarly, probability of diurnal nest-tree use increased 1.29/1-unit increase in the number of snags between random and nest-tree habitat areas. Our results revealed no intersexual differences in patterns of nest-site selection, which may reflect the tendency for SFS to compensate for reduced availability of key structural attributes (i.e., snags, overstory trees) across fragmented forests by exhibiting similar intersexual patterns of nest-tree use. Use of natural cavities for denning is encouraging, but also underscores the importance of unharvested oak-hickory forests in contributing essential habitat to SFS populations in fragmented Midwestern landscapes | | Zuckerberg, B. and C.

Yet cascading effects of biodiversity loss on other taxa are largely unknown because baseline data are often unavailable. We document the collapse of a Neotropical snake community after the invasive fungal pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> caused a chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species. | | Zimmerman, G.

Journal of Wildlife Management 86:e22158, |[https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22158](https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22158). | [Abstract](/coopunits/publication/216780953600/None/all) | January 2022 || Effectively managing take of wildlife resulting from human activities poses a major challenge for applied conservation. Demographic data essential to decisions regarding take are often expensive to collect and are either not available or based on limited studies for many species. Therefore, modeling approaches that efficiently integrate available information are important to improving the scientific basis for sustainable take thresholds. We used the prescribed take level (PTL) framework to estimate allowable take for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)in the conterminous United States. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) that incorporates multiple sources of information and then use the model output as the scientific basis for components of the PTL framework. Our IPM is structured to identify key parameters needed for the PTL and to quantify uncertainties in those parameters at the scale at which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages take. Our IPM indicated that mean survival of birds >1 year old was high and precise (0.91, 95% CI = 0.90-0.92), whereas mean survival of firstyear eagles was lower and more variable(0.69, 95% CI = 0.62-0.78). We assumed that density dependence influenced recruitment by affecting the probability of breeding, which was highly imprecise and estimated to have declined from approximately 0.988 (95% CI = 0.985-0.993) to 0.66 (95% CI = 0.34-0.99) between 1994 and 2018. We sampled values from the posterior distributions of the IPM for use in the PTL and estimated that allowable take (e.g., permitted take for energy development, incidental collisions with human made structures, or removal of nests for development) ranged from approximately 12,000 to 20,000 individual eagles depending on risk tolerance and form of density dependence at the scale of the conterminous United States excluding the Southwest. Modelbased thresholds for allowable take can be inaccurate if the assumptions of the underlying framework are not met, if the influence of permitted take is underestimated, or if undetected population declines occur from other sources. Continued monitoring and use of the IPM and PTL frameworks to identify key uncertainties in bald eagle population dynamics and management of allowable take can mitigate this potential bias, especially where improved information could reduce the risk of permitting nonsustainable take. | | Zhao, Q., A.K.

Geophysical Research Letters, 48, | December 2021 We investigated how lake thermal processes responded to whole-lake warming manipulation in a lake in the Alaskan Arctic through observations and numerical modeling. The warming manipulation was conducted by artificially heating the epilimnion as a proxy for climate warming. We performed numerical modeling and used an improved lake scheme based on the Community Land Model (CLM). We simulated a control run (CTL) without warming and a warming manipulation simulation (WARM). Results indicated the WARM simulation accurately captured observed lake temperature profiles where water stratification was extended in time, and water stability was strengthened. Two additional sensitivity tests with different warming onset dates and of the same warming duration showed that earlier onsets of warming are predicted to make the lake water column more stable and less easily mixed relative to a later onset of warming. The results of this study provide a more complete understanding of lake thermal processes in arctic freshwater lake systems and how they will respond to predicted future warming. | | Zentner, D.

Connectivity for wildlife is typically modeled in a static environment that reflects a single snapshot in time. However, it has been shown that, when compared with dynamic connectivity models, static models can underestimate connectivity and mask important population processes. Therefore, including dynamism in connectivity models is important if the goal is to predict functional connectivity. We incorporated four levels of dynamism (individual, daily, seasonal, and interannual) into an individual-based movement model for black bears (Ursus americanus) in Massachusetts, USA. We used future development projections to model movement into the year 2050. We summarized habitat connectivity over the 32-year simulation period as the number of simulated movement paths crossing each pixel in our study area. Our results predict black bears will further colonize the expanding part of their range in the state and move beyond this range towards the greater Boston metropolitan area. This information is useful to managers for predicting and addressing human-wildlife conflict and in targeting public education campaigns on bear awareness. Including dynamism in connectivity models can produce more realistic models and, when future projections are incorporated, can ensure the identification of areas that offer long-term functional connectivity for wildlife. | | Zebro, L.R., J.T. and Environmental Influences on Juvenile Walleye Survivorship in Northern Wisconsin Lakes. Fisheries Management and Ecology | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/232643198976/None/all) | October 2022 || Walleye (<i>Sander vitreus</i>) natural recruitment has declined in many populations within the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin (CTWI) over the past twenty years. Using CTWI age-0 and age-1 walleye relative abundance (CPE) data during we tested for abiotic and biotic (density dependence, cannibalism) walleye mortality was strongly density-dependent. Juvenile walleye mortality was always elevated at high age-0 CPE and highly variable at low age-0 CPE. Cannibalism effects did not influence age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Mixed effects modeling results suggested that age-0 CPE (positive), May surface water temperature (positive), and peak surface water temperature (negative) were the strongest predictors of age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Our results suggest that density-dependence and environmental factors influencing spawning and ontogenetic phenology (climate variable ice-off dates), consumptive demand may dictate age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Our results also showed elevated age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality at low age-0 CPE, which supports previous findings of depensatory recruitment dynamics in CTWI walleye populations. Given observed natural recruitment declines observed in CTWI walleye populations over time, stocking has been primarily used to rehabilitate stocks. Our findings suggest that stocking on top of natural recruitment would further increase density-dependent juvenile walleye mortality rates. Additional research is needed to specifically address elevated juvenile walleye mortality at low adult stock sizes and/or with declining natural recruitment to inform conservation management decisions. | | Zatkos L., Murphy B., and Arismendi I. 2020.

In oyster reefs, internal dynamics include production of calcareous shell, which serves as settlement substrate for larval recruits. External factors include environmental conditions and predation, which regulate overall population size through growth and mortality, but also regulate settlement dynamics by exposing interior shell surfaces through mortality. Oyster reefs are also highly spatially constrained by aquatic conditions, thus their efficiency for producing settlement habitat under these constraints may be critical to self-organization and long term persistence. We developed an individual based model that simulates engineering of oyster reefs through individual contributions of shell, which slowly degrade and consolidate to form reef structure. Reef habitat has two aspects in this model, one for elevating the population above the benthos, and another for making exposed shell surfaces available for settlement. We applied the model to examine how these two aspects relate to the live population as a coupled system with complex feedbacks. In particular, we examined how temporal dynamics of the reef proceed through time as the size structure of the live population and relative composition of shell types change through time. To represent these dynamics, we simulated single restoration events and tracked ensuing dynamics over subsequent decades without additional enhancement, for an example study site in South Carolina (USA). To estimate uncertainty in restoration performance, we followed a biological ensemble modeling approach, varying selected model parameters over five scenarios of predator community composition. Our goal was to identify trends that were robust across simulations, which could serve as hypotheses and predictions for future field studies. The overall temporal pattern of simulations was three distinct phases: initial transient dynamics of the stocked population, followed by growth and saturation of the life population, and then saturation of settlement habitat several years later. All simulations incurred considerable loss of shell biomass during the transient phase when the live population was establishing and shell degradation exceeded production. Simulations with predators were able to recover from this decline through production of live oysters, while simulations without predators continued to decline throughout simulation runs. These results indicate that reefs can be productive with respect to the live population, but decline overall in reef substrate. We conclude with hypotheses relating the efficiency of generation of settlement habitat to measures of biomass and individual density, which suggest levels that may lead to reef self-organization. | | Young, J., A.

[Publisher Website](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2462) | December 2018 || Warming temperatures are having a disproportionate effect on boreal ecosystems, influencing the establishment and growth of tree species across their respective ranges. However, less is known about how competitive interactions influence growth-climate relationships. We used treering data from 26 study plots (836 trees) to investigate how the growth patterns of white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>) respond to variation in competition and climate in southwest Alaska. Using linear mixedeffects models, we compared growth against covariates for stand basal area, competition, climate (temperature, precipitation), and spruce beetle mortality. We characterized competition at the tree level using two distancedependent competition indices: Hegyi index and a height advantage index. Furthermore, we assumed that standlevel competition increased with basal area. We found that high summer temperatures resulted in reduced growth in stands with higher basal area (i.e., the most crowded stands), but increased growth at sites with low basal area. Our results suggest that historically productive stands may show declines in growth under warmer conditions, with important implications for future stand structure and productivity. | | Wright, A., Bernard, R.

Decision support frameworks (DSFs) are increasingly applied by resource managers to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and differing socio-ecological objectives inherent to conservation problems. Most published conservation research that uses DSFs focuses on analytical stages (e.g., identifying an optimal decision), making it difficult to assess and learn from previous examples in a conservation practice context. Here, we (1) evaluate the relationship between the application of decision science and the resulting conservation outcomes, and (2) identify and address existing barriers to the application of DSFs to conservation practice. To do this, we develop a framework for evaluating conservation initiatives using decision science that emphasizes setting attainable goals, building momentum, and obtaining partner buy-in. We apply this framework to a systematic review of amphibian conservation decision support projects, including a follow-up survey of the pertinent conservation practitioners, stakeholders, and scientists. We found that all projects identified optimal solutions to reach stated objectives, but positive conservation outcomes were limited when implementation challenges arose. Further, we identified multiple barriers (e.g., dynamic and hierarchical leadership, scale complexity, limited resource availability) that can inhibit the progression from decision identification to action implementation (i.e., 'decision-implementation gap'), and to successful conservation outcomes. Based on these results, we provide potential actionable steps and avenues for future development of DSFs to facilitate the transition from decision to action and the realization of conservation successes. | | Worthington, T.

Ecological Modeling | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/225848025088/None/all) | July 2022 || Monitoring is usually among the first actions taken to help inform recovery planning for declining species, but these data are rarely used formally to inform conservation decision making. For example, Central Valley Chinook salmon were once abundant, but anthropogenic activities have led to widespread habitat loss and degradation resulting in significant population declines. Juvenile Chinook salmon survival through the southern Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in particular, may be a limiting factor for juveniles outmigrating from the San Joaquin River and tributaries. However, survival and routing monitoring data have not been formally used to inform water management. Here, we illustrate how estimates derived from monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for developing adaptive management for flows. Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of Chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south Delta. We then used the resulting parameter estimates to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the San Joaquin River during smolt outmigration from February-May. We found that large flow pulses at predictable times during the spring are projected to be optimal for increasing Chinook salmon smolt survival to the Bay and that optimal scenarios differed somewhat with water year type. Sensitivity analysis revealed temperature and smolt outmigration timing are driving optimal pulse distribution and that water allocation changes little with parameter uncertainty. This case study highlights the utility of the decision-analytic framework for solving conservation problems. | | Wohner, PJ, SA Laymon, JE Stanek, SL King, RJ Cooper. 2021.

In the absence of flooding and gap-forming disturbance, planted forests often senesce without further young tree recruitment. This has largely been the case in riparian systems in California that historically supported state endangered western Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>; Cuckoo). Associated with riparian forest maturation has been around an 85% decline in Cuckoo population numbers in approximately the past thirty years. Other riparian species of concern show a concomitant decline, indicating the problem is not specific to Cuckoo. Although varying hypotheses exist for the recent decline, alternative management practices have not been sufficiently explored to rule out breeding ground habitat quality as a major contributing factor. Few intensive Cuckoo datasets currently exist to test hypotheses about breeding habitat quality due to extremely low populations in the remaining occupied sites. We used a historical (1986-1996) spot mapping dataset from the South Fork Kern River Valley, California to identify vegetation characteristics related to Cuckoo and five other sensitive riparian bird territory densities. We found Cuckoo densities were positively associated with increased vertical vegetative structure 1-5 m above ground with a threshold for mean tree height. Sensitive species densities were also related to vertical structure and started to decline with stand height greater than 6-8 m. Low and mid canopy vertical structure started declining after about age eight. Naturally regenerated sites had higher densities of most sensitive bird species than planted sites. We provide ideas for restoring mature forest with little low to mid canopy vertical structure.</b> | | Wohner, P.J., P.D. Peterson. 2023. A comprehensive multi-state conditional occupancy model for evaluating interactions of non-native and native species. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 10, p.1288. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/237551988736/None/all) | January 2023 || A major challenge in ecology is disentangling interactions of non-native, potentially invasive species on native species. Conditional two-species occupancy models are used to examine the effects of dominant species (e.g., non-native) on subordinate species (e.g., native) while considering the possibility that occupancy of one species may affect occupancy and/ or detection of the other. Although conditional two-species models are useful for evaluating the influence of one species on presence of another, it is possible that species interactions are density dependent. Therefore, we developed a novel two-species occupancy model that incorporates multiple abundance states (i.e., absent, present, abundant) of the native species. We showcase the utility of this model that has the capacity to incorporate random effects and covariates on both occupancy and detection and that can help disentangle species interactions given varying occupancy and detection in different abundance states. As a case study, we use snorkel survey data from the Umpqua basin, Oregon, where it is hypothesized that smallmouth conditional two-species multi-state (2SMS) model allowed us to conclude that in general, average occupancy was low for both fishes, and that when non-native bass were present, overall native chub occupancy in the present (0.18 \u00b1 0.05 SD) and abundant (0.19 \u00b1 0.03) states was higher than when non-natives were absent (0.14 \u00b1 0.02/ 0.08 \u00b1 0.02), indicating the non-native was not excluding the native species. By incorporating a species interaction factor into the model, we found a positive association (6.75 \u00b1 5.54 SD) between native chub and non-native bass. The covariates strongly related to occupancy were elevation, algae, and land cover type (urban and shrub). Detection probability was relatively high for both species (0.21-0.82) and was most strongly related to the covariates day of year, water temperature, gravel substrate, and stream order/ magnitude. Incorporation of detection probability and covariates enabled interpretation of interactions between the two species that may have been missed without their inclusion in the modeling process. Our new 2SMS occupancy model can be used by scientists and managers with a broad range of survey and covariate data to disentangle species interactions problems to help them inform management decisions. | | Winship A.J., Thorson J., Clarke E., Coleman H., Costa B., Georgian S., Gillett D., Gr\u00fcss A., Henderson M., Hourigan T.F., Huff D., Kreidler in . Good practices for species distribution modeling of deep-sea corals and sponges: data collection, analysis, validation, and communication. Submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/197446397952/None/all) | May 2020 || Resource managers in the United States and worldwide are tasked with identifying and mitigating trade-offs between human activities in the deep sea (e.g., fishing, energy development, and mining) and their impacts on habitat-forming invertebrates, including deep-sea corals and sponges (DSCS). Related management decisions require information about where DSCS occur and in what densities. Species distribution modeling (SDM) provides a cost-effective means of identifying potential DSCS habitat over large areas to inform these management decisions and data collection. Here we provide recommendations of good practices for DSCS SDM, especially in the context of data collection and management applications. Managers typically need information regarding DSCS encounter probabilities, densities, and sizes, defined at sub-regional to basin-wide scales and validated using subsequent, targeted data collections. To realistically achieve these goals, we recommend integrating available data sources in SDMs including fine-scale visual sampling and broad-scale resource surveys (e.g., fisheries trawl surveys). When possible, we recommend models fitted to presence-absence and density data rather than models fitted only to presence data, which are difficult to validate and can confound estimated probability of occurrence or density with sampling effort. Ensembles of models can provide robust predictions, while multi-species models leverage information across taxa and facilitate community inference. We also recommend that analysts include environmental predictor variables representing multiple spatial scales, model residual spatial autocorrelation, and quantify prediction uncertainty. To facilitate the use of models by managers, predictions should be expressed in units that are widely understood and should be validated at an appropriate spatial scale using a sampling design that provides strong statistical inference. We present three case studies for the Pacific Ocean that illustrate good practices with respect to data collection, modeling, and validation; these case studies demonstrate it is possible to implement our recommendations in real-world settings. | | Winemiller KO, Keppeler CR, Mayes KB. Can spatial food web subsidies associated with river hydrology and lateral connectivity be detected using stable isotopes? Food Webs. 2023. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/238338508800/None/all) | March 2023 || Hydrology, lateral connectivity and stable isotope ratios of fishes and mussels in the Guadalupe River, Texas, were analyzed for evidence of spatial food web subsidies between the active channel and oxbow lakes in the floodplain. During and following lateral connections, aquatic organisms residing in the channel may assimilate material from sources imported from oxbows, and oxbow residents may consume and assimilate material imported from the channel. During surveys conducted between March 2016 and April 2017, fish, mussel, algae, and riparian plants samples were collected in and around two oxbows and adjacent channel sites for analysis of stable isotope ratios. Biplots of d<sup>13</sup>C and d<sup>15</sup>N were graphed mussel species (combined) captured from oxbows and the channel. Within each graph, a source polygon was drawn to indicate the space occupied by animals that could have assimilated feasible combinations of source materials from the oxbows or river channel. Based on positions of animals within source polygons, riparian plants were the most important source of organic matter supporting biomass of fishes and mussels both within the channel and oxbows during every survey period, with algae contributing minor percentages. Most organisms had isotopic signatures consistent with assimilation of <i>in situ</i> sources, or else were inconclusive with regard to cross-habitat exchanges. Between-habitat food web subsidies were indicated for 7.6% of 314 organisms from oxbows and 11.2% of 231 from the channel, and these cases followed high flow pulses that connected oxbows for extended periods. Several issues that compromise inferences from stable isotope analysis were identified, and attempts to estimate spatial food web subsidies in fluvial systems could be enhanced by analyzing additional biomarkers, such as isotopic ratios of other elements and compound-specific stable isotopes, as well as additional sources, time-specific biotracers, and experimental approaches that directly track movement of sources and organisms in spatially structured food webs. | | Wineland, S.

Wild populations can experience stable, cyclical, or complex dynamics, therefore undisturbed populations can provide background needed to evaluate programmatic success. Many raptor species have recovered from large declines caused by environmental contaminants, making them strong candidates for ongoing efforts to understand population dynamics and ecosystem processes in response to humancaused stressors. Dynamic multistate occupancy models are a useful tool for analyzing species dynamics because they leverage the autocorrelation inherent in longterm monitoring datasets to obtain useful information about the dynamic properties of population or reproductive states. We analyzed a 23year bald eagle monitoring dataset in a dynamic multistate occupancy modeling framework to assess longterm nest occupancy and reproduction in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska. We also used a hierarchical generalized linear model to understand changes in nest productivity in relation to environmental factors. Nests were most likely to remain in the same nesting state between years. Most notably, successful nests were likely to remain in use (either occupied or successful) and had a very low probability of transitioning to an unoccupied state in the following year. There was no apparent trend in the proportion of nests used by eagles through time, and the probability that nests transitioned into or out of the successful state was not influenced by temperature or salmon availability. Productivity was constant over the course of the study, although warm April minimum temperatures were associated with increased chick production. Overall our results demonstrate the expected nesting dynamics of a healthy bald eagle population that is largely free of human disturbance and can be used as a baseline for the expected dynamics for recovering bald eagle populations in the contiguous 48 states. | | Wilson, R.

However, the implementation of fences for conservation has outpaced scientific assessment of their effectiveness, non-target impacts, and long-term costs. We assessed landscape predictors of fence crossing sites and employed camera traps over a one-year period to investigate wildlife responses to a conservation fence around Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Specifically, we measured the impact of the fence on wild mammal movement, and the temporal impacts of fence maintenance on wildlife crossings and behavior. Cameras captured more than 65,000 detections of animals approaching fences, with 3626 observed crossings over 2818 trap nights at 19 sites. Using these data, we developed a guide to classifying fence-specific mammal behaviors. Thirty-eight wild mammal species approached known weak points in the fence, and 27 species were recorded crossing the fence. No single environmental variable predicted detection or fence crossing points for all species, but seasonality, human activity, habitat visibility, and proximity to an adjacent protected area were each correlated with species-specific crossing locations. Additionally, breaches of repaired fence-crossing locations occurred within days of maintenance. We conclude that popular, 'one-size-fits-all', conservation fence designs may be ineffective and costly for restraining movement of many wildlife species. We recommend that those deploying conservation fences start with clearly articulated management goals, that fence maintenance be informed by taxa-specific tendencies to breach fences, and that managers consider the strategic creation of wildlife corridors, overpasses, or ungulate-proof fences to link fenced protected areas with surrounding habitat. | | Wilkinson, B.P., and P.G.R.

Considered an evolutionary precursor, understanding why some individuals choose to undertake migration while others do not may serve to inform general migratory theory. While several hypotheses currently exist for explaining the maintenance of partial migration, empirical support for many is limited. To address this gap, we analyzed telemetry data acquired from individual brown pelicans (<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>; <i>n</i> = 74), a partially migratory seabird, nesting on six colonies in the South Atlantic Bight over the course of four autumn migrations using a Cox's proportional hazards model. We estimated that approximately 74% of pelicans nesting within the study area may be migratory on an annual basis, with the remainder staying within the surrounding marine ecoregion year-round. Mean date of migration initiation was 9 November, although movements occurred from September - December. Modeling results indicated significant effects of rising sea-surface temperatures and decreased body condition on migration rate. We suggest that the ontogenetic migration of the primary forage species of brown pelicans from estuarine to pelagic environments causes a seasonal reduction in prey, and that individuals in poor body condition are unable to meet the energetic demands potentially associated with this decrease in prey availability (i.e., the fasting endurance hypothesis of partial migration). Although we did not find evidence for a density-dependent migratory response, the effects of intraspecific competition on migration in pelicans appears to warrant consideration. | | Wilkinson, B.P., and P.G.R.

More recently in the US, diverse stakeholders have partnered to address complex environmental issues that span land ownership or administrative boundaries, calling these efforts collaborative conservation. Reviews of community-based and collaborative conservation have historically focused on developing countries. To synthesize published information on U.S.-focused groups, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) characterize geographic distribution, types of participants, and sources of funding for these groups; 2) assess issues motivating group formation, goals, activities to achieve those goals, and outcomes; 3) identify whether these goals, activities, and outcomes were biophysical, social, and/or economic. To accomplish these objectives, we searched for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and reports in online databases from 1800's-2017. Our review resulted in 245 documents describing 296 collaborative conservation groups across all 50 states (primarily the Western U.S.) and the District of Columbia. The top three issues motivating collaborative group formation included impacts of land and resource degradation on livelihoods, water quality and management, and managing land and resources across ownership boundaries. We found that there was little published information on the outcomes of group activities (16% of groups). For the limited number of groups for which the literature reported outcomes, there was no relationship between positive outcomes and group characteristics. Our findings suggest that renewed efforts to evaluate the impact of collaboration on conservation are warranted and could support learning and improved action. | | Wilder, Benjamin T; Amanda T.

The presence of disjunct long-lived plant taxa on under-explored summits, especially Isla Tibur\u00f3n at 29\u00ba latitude in the Gulf of California, suggests a more southerly extent of Ice Age woodlands than previously understood. The phylogeography of the desert edge species <i>Canotia holacantha</i> (Celastraceae) was investigated to test the hypothesis that insular desert peak populations represent remnants of Pleistocene woodlands rather than recent dispersal events. Sequences of four chloroplast DNA regions totaling 2,032 bp were amplified from 74 individuals of 14 populations across the entire range of <i>C. holacantha</i> as well as nine individuals that represented the other two species in its clade (<i>C. wendtii</i> and <i>Acanthothamnus aphyllus</i>) and two outgroups. Results suggest that a <i>Canotia</i> common ancestor occurred on the landscape, which underwent a population contraction ca. 15 kya. The Isla Tibur\u00f3n microendemic <i>C. wendtii</i>have the greatest genetic differentiation, are sister to one another, and basal to all other <i>Canotia</i> populations. Three haplotypes within <i>C. holacantha</i> were recovered, which correspond to regional geography and thus identified as the Arizona, Sonora, and Tibur\u00f3n haplotypes, within which <i>Acanthothamnus aphyllus</i> is nested rather than as a related genus. These results indicate a once broad distribution of <i>Canotia </i>/<i> Acanthothamnus</i> during the Pleistocene, now present in relict populations on the fringes of the southern desert, in the Chihuahuan Desert, with scattered populations on desert peaks and a common or abundant distribution at the norther ecotone of the Sonoran Desert. These results suggest <i>Canotia</i> has tracked the shift of the desert's edge both in latitude and elevation since the end of the last Ice Age. | | Wiens, JD, KM Dugger, M Higley, DB Lesmeister, AB Franklin, Hamm, GC While, KE Dilione, DC Simon, RR Bown, PC Carlson, CB Yackulic, JD JE Hines, RJ McDonald, and SG Sovern. 2021.

We also identify potential impediments to applications of these techniques and recommend steps needed to further assess and enhance their applicability to Paddlefish management and conservation. | | Whitesell, M.J., E.A.

Streamflow along the Willamette River is largely controlled by upstream dams, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as part of the Willamette Valley Project. In 2008, these dams were found to have a deleterious effect on ESA-listed salmonids (NOAA Fisheries, 2008), resulting in USACE taking mitigatory actions. Included in these actions was setting seasonal streamflow targets at various locations along the river to improve survival and migration of juvenile salmonids. Though these targets were established with the best available information at the time, recent data and models have advanced understanding of river dynamics and allow a more robust analysis of the affect of streamflow on downstream habitat. This study leverages these recent datasets to build high-resolution models of useable habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon and steelhead trout to assess how this habitat varies with streamflow. Habitat models rely on hydraulic models developed in White and Wallick, 2021, and temperature models developed in Stratton Garvin and others, 2021b, both paired with literature supplied data on habitat preferences. Findings a non-uniform response to streamflow, where habitat in some reaches of the Willamette consistently increases with additional streamflow, while other reaches see habitat decrease when streamflows increase from low to moderate flows. These differences are explained by local geomorphology in each reach, particularly the transition of the river from a relatively dynamic, multi-threaded river to a simpler and more confined river downstream. The upstream reaches generally have more habitat available per unit stream distance than their counterparts, but all reaches display greatest amounts of habitat at the highest streamflows. Finally, results show that water temperature in summer greatly reduces the amount of habitat available to the focal species, particularly downstream of Corvallis. Together, these findings serve to inform flow management by providing a quantitatve assessment of the affects of streamflow on habitat. | | Whitby, M. D., T. J. Kieran, T. C. Glenn, and C.

Through this retrospective we highlight the remarkable historic fisheries resources and causative reasons for establishing public fisheries agencies and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). Through a review of primary historical documents and literature for North America, this paper identifies: factors contributing to the founding of AFS and public fish commissions; shows how selected resource issues evolved; and documents how and why selected fisheries and aquatic habitat policies changed in response to those issues. Overexploitation, landscape-scale habitat alterations, mining, and dams were the causative agents for emergence of fisheries agencies and the AFS, and these factors remain relevant today. Beginning in the 1960s, North Americans grew tired of degraded waters and fisheries and forced policy changes that have directly and indirectly affected the fisheries we manage today. The historical events and resulting corrective legislation are taken for granted by those unaware that AFS has actively participated in developing policies to address these environmental issues. Further, AFS continues to play a vital role in identifying key issues, providing conduits for information to cope with impairments, and advocating for policies to conserve intact habitats and improve degraded systems. The struggles documented in this paper offer crucial lessons as we continue to be challenged by legacy resource issues and face emerging environmental stressors such as climate change as well as regression in long-standing environmental protection policies. | | Wheeler, Crimmins, and T.R.

Fishes nasuta is a rare and cryptic fish that recently disappeared from much of its historic range. We developed and used an environmental DNA (eDNA) assay for longnose darter paired with visual surveys to better determine the species' range and compare detection probability between sampling approaches in an occupancy modeling framework. We detected longnose darter eDNA further upstream in the mainstem St. Francis River than previously reported and in a tributary for the first time. Our multi-scale occupancy approach compared models where detection was constant against a model that allowed detection to vary by survey method. The constant model received the most support indicating survey method was not a strong predictor and detection was estimated at 0.70 (0.45-0.86; 95% CI) across both methods. Our study produced effective longnose darter eDNA primers and demonstrated the application of small-bodied, cryptic fish. We detected longnose darter eDNA 27 km upstream of their known range and determined that snorkel surveys are the most efficient sampling method if water clarity allows. We recommend target sample sizes to achieve various detection goals for both sample methods and our results inform future design of distributional and monitoring efforts. | | Westbrook, P., Heffner, L., La Peyre, MK. 2019. Oyster-mediated nutrient bioassimilation, burial and denitrification: effects of timing and location. Marine Biology 166:4. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/151779831808/None/all) | December 2018 || Restoration of oyster habitat across Louisiana may offer a valuable approach to mitigating anthropogenic nutrient inputs to coastal estuaries. The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the reefs they create provide significant ecosystem services, including potential nutrient mitigation via bioassimilation, burial, and oyster-mediated denitrification. This study bioassimilation, burial, and oyster-mediated sediment denitrification in near-shore shallow-water (< 1 m water depth) and deep-water (> 1 m water depth) oyster reefs in Louisiana. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in shell and tissue was within the range of previous studies, but was found to be influenced by reproductive status, size, and habitat type. Changes in tissue percent N and C post spawning combined with significant reductions in tissue weight from the release of gametes, resulted in 20 and 46% reduction in tissue N and tissue C load (mg) for a 100 mm oyster, respectively. Percent N and C buried in sediments were highest at shallow-water reefs (0.52 0.05% and 8.92 0.89% respectively), likely due to their close proximity to the marsh edge and thus exposure to a greater influx of detrital material. Closed-system ex-situ incubations indicated net denitrification in all habitat types studied, with the highest rates exceeding 600 \u00b5mol m-2 hr-1 during the summer, but no enhancement attributable to oyster reefs specifically. Considering the large extent of reefs and oyster production across coastal Louisiana, oyster habitats may still contribute to nutrient mitigation, but their unique contribution likely comes from bioassimilation, and removal of tissue and or shell from the system. Efforts to predict oyster reef nutrient mitigation requires incorporating timing of harvest and habitat context. | | Werner, S.J., M. Gottlob, C.D. Deiter, and J.D. Stafford. 2019.

Movement Ecology | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/223943831552/None/all) | January 2022 || <i><u>Background</u><br>The timing of autumn migration in ducks is influenced by a range of environmental conditions that may elicit individual experiences and responses from individual birds, yet most studies have investigated relationships at the population level. We used data from individual satellite-tracked mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) to model the timing and environmental drivers of autumn migration movements at the landscape scale.<br><u>Methods</u> <br>We combined two sets of location records (2004-2007, and 2010-2011) from satellite-tracked mallards migrating to winter in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, and identified records that indicated the start of long-range ( 30 km) southward movements during the migration period. We developed candidate models to predict the departure date, conditional on daily mean environmental covariates (temperature, snow and ice cover, wind conditions, precipitation, cloud cover, and pressure), at a 32\u00d732 km resolution. We modeled selection of departure date by individual mallards using a discrete choice model accounting for heterogeneity in individual preferences. We ranked model performance with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).<br><u>Results</u> <br>Departure was best predicted (60% precision) by a \"winter conditions\" model containing temperature and snow cover depth and duration. Models conditional on wind speed, precipitation, pressure variation, and cloud cover received lower support. Number of days of snow cover, recently experienced (snow days), and current snow cover had the strongest positive effect on departure likelihood, followed by experienced days of freezing temperature (frost days) and current low temperature. Distributions of dominant drivers and of correct vs incorrect prediction along the movement tracks indicate that these responses applied throughout the latitudinal range of migration. Among recorded departures, most were driven by snow days (65%) followed by current temperature (30%). <br><u>Conclusions</u> <br>Our results indicate that the dominant environmental driver of departure decision in autumn-migrating mallards was the onset of snow conditions, and secondarily the onset of temperatures close to, or below, the freezing point. Mallards are likely to relocate southwards quickly when faced with foraging that is impeded by snow, and could use declining temperatures as a more graduated early cue for departure. Our findings provide further insights into the functional response of mallards to weather and climate factors during the migration period that ultimately determine distribution.</i> | | Weller, F.G., E.B.

Journal of Wildlife Management | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/218797283328/None/all) | March 2022 || Despite several secretive marsh bird (SMB) species being listed as \"Critically Imperiled\" throughout the mid-continent of North America, there is limited information on SMB distribution and habitat use within primary migratory corridors, resulting in uncertainty on contributions of wetlands in mid-latitude states toward SMB annual cycle needs. Our objectives were to quantify patterns of SMB wetland occupancy during spring migration at a mid-latitude state and evaluate the relationships between SMB colonization probability and water-level management practices, as well as the resulting habitat conditions during spring migration. We conducted a two year dynamic occupancy study (2013-2014) that included six rounds of repeated call-back surveys to detect the presence of five SMB species (Virginia rail (<i>Rallus during spring and summer (April-July) on 107 wetlands across 8 Conservation Areas and 4 National Wildlife Refuges throughout Missouri. Sora were detected most frequently, followed by Least Bittern, American Bittern, Virginia Rail, and King Rail. Colonization probability for all species was positively associated with emergent vegetation cover and negatively associated with amount of open water. Open water was the most important factor for American Bittern site colonization, to which they were negatively associated. Virginia Rail colonization had a strong positive association with vegetation height, whereas Least Bittern and Sora site colonization were influenced positively by water depth and agriculture, respectively. Based on the habitat associations within and among SMB species identified in this study, wetland managers can tailor management strategies to optimize spring migration habitat for single- or multi-species objectives. | | Webb, E.

In response, marine resource managers in many locations have established marine protected areas or seasonal closures to recover these overfished stocks. The challenge in assessing management effectiveness lies largely in the development of accurate estimates to track stock size through time. For the past 15 y, the Cayman Islands government has taken a series of management actions aimed at recovering collapsed stocks of Nassau grouper. Importantly, the government also partnered with academic and nonprofit organizations to establish a research and monitoring program (Grouper Moon) aimed at documenting the impacts of conservation action. Here, we develop an integrated population model of 2 Cayman Nassau grouper stocks based on both diver-collected mark-resight observations and video censuses. Using both data types across multiple years, we fit parameters for a state-space model for population growth. We show that over the last 15 y the Nassau grouper population on Little Cayman has more than tripled in response to conservation efforts. Census data from Cayman Brac, while more sparse, show a similar pattern. These findings demonstrate that spatial and seasonal closures aimed at rebuilding aggregation-based fisheries can foster conservation success. | | Waterhouse, L., White, J., See, K., Murdoch, A., and B.

In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management. | | Waterhouse, L., L. Ailloud, R. Austin, W. J. Golet, A. Pacicco, A. Andrews, K. Diouf, Y.

This project had the objectives of enhancing food security, stimulating economic growth, and improving management through research on tropical tuna resources in the Atlantic Ocean, including bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). Here, we combine tagging data and otolith data from the AOTTP program, Panama City Lab and the Pelagic Fisheries Lab at the University of Maine with historical tagging data and otolith data from ICCAT and other sources to fit integrated growth models with the goal of providing the most complete growth curve (in terms of data inclusion and validation of age-at-length) for bigeye tuna in the Atlantic Ocean. Both Richards and von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted. A variety of models were fitted to subsets of the data to investigate the consistency of growth information. In all cases for the integrated model, the Richards and von Bertalanffy models were very similar with the von Bertalannfy model being preferred for parsimony. The preferred model, based on fit to old fish, was the von Bertalanffy curve based on length-age pair data from multiple sources. The addition of tagging data to create an integrated model showed patterns of lack of fit to both the tagging and otolith data suggesting conflict between the tagging and otolith data. The preferred model (length-age pair data only) gave the estimates: asymptotic length L (fork length) equals 161.21 cm CI 154.39, bootstrap CI -0.306, 0.175). For the best fitting integrated model, the asymptotic length L(fork length, in cm) was estimated to be 185.78 (SD 6.298), the growth parameter K was 0.252 yr 1 (SD 0.014), and the time-axis intercept t0 was 0.524 yr (SE 0.025). The value for asymptotic length L from the integrated model was larger than the lengths of all the old fish in the sample whereas the value for the curve based on otoliths passes through the cloud of points for old fish. | | Warlick, AJ, Johnson, D., Gelatt, T., Converse, SJ. 2022.

Ecosphere 13:e4325. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/232809945088/None/all) | January 2023 || Understanding what drives changes in wildlife demography over time is fundamental to the conservation and management of depleted or declining populations, though making inference about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence survival and reproduction is challenging as they can change over time and space. Here we use almost 20 years of mark-resight data from 2000-2018 to examine the effects of environmental variability on age-specific survival and natality for the endangered western distinct population segment of Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) in Alaska, USA. Though this population has been studied extensively over the last four decades, the causes of divergent abundance trends that have been observed across the range of this population remain unknown. We developed a Bayesian multi-event mark-resight model that accounts for female reproductive state uncertainty. Results indicated that survival rates for male pups (0.44; 0.36-0.53), female yearlings (0.63; 0.49-0.73), and male yearlings (0.62; 0.51-0.71) born in the western portion of the range, estimated here for the first time, were lower than those estimated for male pups (0.69; 0.65-0.74), female yearlings (0.76; 0.71-0.81), and male yearlings (0.71; 0.65-0.78) born in the eastern portion of the range. Additionally, pup mass had a positive effect on pup survival in the eastern portion of the range and a negative effect in the western portion of the range. Local and basin-scale oceanographic features such as the Aleutian Low, the Arctic Oscillation Index, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, chlorophyll concentration, upwelling, and wind in certain seasons exhibited correlations with vital rates. However, strong inference is challenging given that relationships between ocean conditions and an adaptive top predator in a highly dynamic ecosystem are exceedingly complex. This study provides the first demographic rate estimates for the western portion of the population range where abundance estimates continue to decline. This work can inform ongoing research and management and will advance efforts to identify factors driving regionally divergent abundance trends with implications for population-level responses to future climate variability. | | Ward, M.J. and S.R.

In spatial ecology, understanding movements of a species in relation to the landscape can assist wildlife managers in better understanding other processes, including habitat use and disease transmission. In the northeastern United States (Northeast), chronic wasting disease has been detected in populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and understanding the relationship between landscape and size of home range may provide a basis for disease surveillance and containment efforts. The objectives of our study were to (1) compare size of home range between sexes and among study areas for white-tailed deer occupying a continuum of forested landscapes from highly fragmented to contiguous and (2) investigate relationships between size of home range and measures of landscape composition and configuration. We observed differences in size of 95% home range between males (3.77 km2) and females (1.83 km2) across all study areas, as well as between deer in highly fragmented and contiguous landscapes. We developed 20 linear regression models that contained measures of landscape that were correlated with size of home range, and the best model showed that size of home range increased with connectivity of forest cover. Understanding this relationship may provide a foundation for disease surveillance efforts, because size of home range may represent the scale at which disease will spread.

USGS FSP IP-121942. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/208262664192/None/all) | May 2021 || Increasing water demand, water development, and on-going climate change have driven extensive changes to the hydrology, geomorphology and biology of arid-land rivers globally, driving an increasing need to understand how annual hydrologic conditions affect the distribution and abundance of imperiled desert fish populations. We analyzed the relationship between annual hydrologic conditions and the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico, USA, using hurdle models to predict both presence and density as a function of integrated annual hydrologic metrics. Both presence and density were positively related to spring high flow magnitude and duration and negatively related to summer drying, as indicated by an integrated flow metric. Simulations suggest hydrologic conditions near the wettest observed in the data set would be required to meet recovery goals in a single year in all reaches. We demonstrate how the models developed herein can be used to examine alternative water management strategies, including strategies that may currently be socially and logistically infeasible to implement, to identify strategies minimizing trade-offs between conservation and other management goals. | | Walsh, H.L., V.S.

DOI: 10.1002/tafs.10364 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/234593550336/None/all) | July 2022 || Knowledge of the potential spread of an introduced species is critical to direct management efforts to where they will provide the greatest benefits. The Smallmouth Bass <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>, is an example of a fish that has been introduced globally, often spreads following introduction, and has substantial predatory impacts on fish assemblages. We evaluated Smallmouth Bass spread in the free-flowing Yellowstone River, Montana, where this non-native fish has expanded from warmer, downstream sections of river into colder, upstream sections. We hypothesized that progressively colder upstream climates would limit age-0 growth and overwinter survival in the Yellowstone River, thereby curbing potential upstream spread. We documented the phenology, growth, and overwinter survival of age-0 Smallmouth Bass across a gradient of temperature and population densities. Age-0 individuals were rare or absent throughout the uppermost upstream distribution of adults, suggesting that something limits or discourages reproduction farther upstream. However, we found no support for colder water temperatures alone as the limiting factor. Age-0 body size at the onset of winter did not differ significantly among the uppermost 200 km of their distribution. Rather, the earlier hatching timing exhibited by some age-0 individuals in colder, upstream sections allowed them to experience longer growing seasons than many individuals in warmer, downstream sections. This counter-intuitive hatching phenology mediated much of the negative effect of colder upstream climates on growth. Furthermore, evidence of successful overwinter survival and simulations of age-0 starvation mortality indicated that age-0 individuals at the upstream extent of their distribution successfully recruited to the age-1 year-class in four consecutive years. Taken together, our results suggest that Smallmouth Bass have not yet reached the thermal limit of their upstream distribution in the Yellowstone River, and that further spread will probably be driven by complex interactions between density dependence, spawn timing, and ambient thermal and hydrologic regimes. | | Voorhees, J.M., M.E.

Frontiers in Conservation Science, 42. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/243689771008/None/all) | August 2021 || Human-wildlife interactions are embedded within socio-ecological systems (SES), in which animal behavior and human decision-making reciprocally interact. While a growing body of research addresses specific social and ecological elements of human-wildlife interactions, including conflicts, integrating these approaches is essential for identifying practical and effective solutions. Carnivore predation on livestock can threaten human livelihoods, weaken relationships among stakeholders, and precipitate carnivore declines. As carnivores have received greater protection in recent decades, researchers and managers have sought non-lethal tools to reduce predation and promote coexistence between livestock producers and carnivores. For these tools to be successful, they must effectively deter carnivores, and they must also be adopted by producers. Relatively few studies examine the practical and context-specific effectiveness of non-lethal tools, and even fewer simultaneously consider their social acceptability among producers. To address this gap, we suggest that a tool's ecological effectiveness and social acceptability be analyzed concurrently to determine its <i>social effectiveness</i>. We thus paired an experimental study of a carnivore predation deterrent called Foxlights<sup>\u00ae</sup> with qualitative interviews of livestock producers in Northern California. We placed camera traps in sheep pastures to measure the response of coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>) to experimentally deployed Foxlights and interviewed livestock producers before and after the experiment. Our experiment revealed weak evidence for reducing coyote activity with Foxlights, but interviews revealed that the potential adoption of tools had as much to do with their social acceptability and implementation feasibility as with evidence-based measurements of tool effectiveness. Interviewees viewed Foxlights as potentially effective components of husbandry systems, despite the data suggesting otherwise, demonstrating that scientific reductionism may lag behind producer practices of systems-thinking and that isolated demonstrations of a tool's ecological effectiveness do not drive tool adoption. Future empirical tests of non-lethal tools should better consider producers' perspectives and acknowledge that data-based tests of ecological effectiveness alone have a limited place in producer decision-making. Iteratively working with producers can build trust in scientific outputs through the research process itself. | | Volkel, S., K.F. Robinson, D.B. Bunnell, M. Holden, B. Weidel. 2021.

We applied wetland management practices (disking, water level management) in a site historically disturbed by <i>Saccharum spp.</i> L. (sugarcane) cultivation at the Humacao Nature Reserve, southeastern Puerto Rico, and evaluated avian community response. We conducted weekly bird surveys and nest searches on disked and non-disked plots within recently constructed impoundments. The avian community shifted from 16 upland dominated species pre-restoration, to 67 wetland-dependent species at the end of our study (2001-2002). Ordination analysis indicated avian guild use of plots varied with environmental variables. Bird species diversity was not influenced by treatment, month, or salinity levels but was influenced by water depth and vegetation cover. Bird abundance was influenced by water depth, but not by treatment, month, salinity or vegetation cover. Furthermore, water depths of 0.10 - 0.20 m and salinity 15 ppt promoted habitat conditions suitable for a diverse wetland avian community. We located 268 nests of 8 wetland bird species and observed adults with young of various other waterbirds, including species of conservation concern such as <i>Dendrocygna arborea</i> (West Indian Whistling Duck) and <i>Porzana flaviventer</i> (Yellow-breasted Crake). Bird community responses suggest that management practices (i.e., water level management and soil disturbance) can improve wetland biodiversity in abandoned sugarcane fields of Puerto Rico. Moreover, these practices may benefit wetland biodiversity in other Caribbean islands with a similar history of land use and habitat degradation. | | Vidal, T., B. J. Irwin, C. P. Madenjian, and S.

Breeding season space use is an important component of lesser prairie-chicken conservation, because it could affect both dynamics and carrying capacity of local populations. Previous estimates of breeding season space use are largely limited to one of the four currently occupied ecoregions, but potential extrinsic drivers of breeding space use, such as landscape fragmentation, vegetative structure and composition, and density of anthropogenic structures, can show large spatial variation. Moreover, habitat needs vary greatly among the lekking/prelaying, nesting, brooding, and postbreeding stages of the breeding season, but space use by female lesser prairie-chickens during these stages remain relatively unclear. We tested whether home range area and daily displacement of female lesser prairie-chickens varied among ecoregions and breeding stages at four study sites in Kansas and Colorado, USA, representing three of the four currently occupied ecoregions. We equipped females with very-high-frequency (VHF, <i>n</i> = 39) or GPS transmitters (<i>n</i> = 157), and estimated home range area with kernel density estimators or biased random bridge models, respectively. Across all ecoregions, breeding season home range area averaged 190.4 ha (\u00b1 19.1 ha SE) for birds with VHF and 283.6 ha (\u00b1 23.1 ha) for birds with GPS transmitters, while daily displacement averaged 374.8 m (\u00b1 14.3 m). Average home range area and daily displacement were greater in the Short-Grass 319.5 \u00b1 13.8 m). Home range area and daily displacement were greatest during lekking/prelaying (252.8 \u00b1 23.0 ha, 539.7 \u00b1 223.0 m) and brooding stage (81.4 \u00b1 11.5 ha, 221.3 \u00b1 63.7 m), when female movements are restricted by mobility of chicks. Ecoregion- and breeding stage-specific estimates of space use by lesser prairie-chickens will help managers determine the spatial configuration of breeding stage-specific habitat on the landscape. Furthermore, ecoregion- and breeding stage specific estimates are crucial when estimating the amount of breeding habitat needed for lesser prairie-chicken population to persist. | | Veon, J.T., E.

Many mammalian mesopredators, such as the Virginia opossum (<i>Didelphis virginiana</i>), have adapted to living alongside human development in order to take advantage of human-subsidized food, water, and shelter and may also benefit from being \"shielded\" by humans from their natural predators if those predator species are less able to coexist with humans or if they alter their behavior when living in proximity to humans (the human shield hypothesis). The human shield hypothesis has been used to explain the co-existence of dominant and subordinate mesopredators in some of North America's largest cities. Our objective was to evaluate if patterns of Virginia opossum occupancy, abundance, and activity conformed to patterns consistent with the presence of a human shield. We used data from a coordinated continent-wide camera trapping study, Snapshot USA to estimate Virginia opossum occupancy, abundance, and activity and relate these measures to surrounding landscape and urbanization variables. We found that opossum occupancy was positively associated with an index of human activity (anthropogenic sound), although at very high levels of sound, opossum occurrence decreased. Furthermore, opossum in heavily forest areas were more likely to be detected in areas with nearby anthropogenic sound indicating a preference towards settling near humans. In areas with a high density of human housing, opossum relative abundance and predator abundance both increased suggesting that opossum were shielded from predators, whereas at low or moderate levels of housing density, opossum abundance did not increase although predator abundance did. We found that opossum were strictly nocturnal (99% of detections) and that they shifted their activity to being active earlier in the evening in the presence of high predator abundance. We found evidence that Virginia opossum are likely shielded by humans from their predators and this was most apparent when examining abundance and to some extent occupancy. These results help to explain why the Virginia opossum is such a successful urban-exploiter. wintering mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the lower mississippi alluvial valley.

High relative abundances of Gizzard Shad are crucial to the Tennessee River food web and associated fisheries because of their role as a forage base for piscivorous species. We analyzed an extensive dataset of annual gillnetting and electrofishing data extending from 1990 to 2017, to test whether Gizzard Shad relative abundances have changed in Tennessee River reservoirs since the invasion of bigheaded carps. Our analyses indicate that Gizzard Shad abundances have been declining and were already declining prior to the discovery of bigheaded carps in the Tennessee River. The Tennessee River system needs to be continually monitored for any signs of possible interactions between bigheaded carps and Gizzard Shad. | | Van Hennen, M., Horton, K.G., Stuber, E.F., Sheldon, D., Sivakumar, A.H., Wang, J., Farnsworth, A. and Winger, B.M., 2021.

The success of littoral spawning fishes depends on the timing and variability of water levels. The onset of drought between 2017 and 2018 provided an opportunity to evaluate the timing of hatch dates and relative abundance of young-of-year Largemouth Bass<i> Micropterus salmoides </i>across two water years of varying water temperatures and water levels in a southwestern U.S. reservoir. A retrospective analysis of otoliths in young-of-year Largemouth Bass revealed similar hatch dates in 2017 (14 April-29 May) and 2018 (13 April-28 May) despite differences in water temperature and water level rate-of-change. Median water temperature during hatch dates was greater in 2017 (median 19.0\u00b0C, range 14.3-24.4\u00b0C) than 2018 (17.6\u00b0C, range 13.5-21.7\u00b0C). Water level rate-of-change during hatch dates in 2017 was positive (+3.1- +13.1 cm/d), which reflected reservoir filling. In contrast, water level rate-of-change during hatch dates in 2018 was negative (-8.5- -0.6 cm/d), which reflected reservoir receding. Relative abundance of young-of-year fish was greater in 2017 (21.7 fish/h) when the reservoir was filling compared to relative abundance in 2018 (6.8 fish/h) when the reservoir was receding. The median growth rate was greater in 2017 (1.02 mm/d) when the reservoir was filling than in 2018 (0.82 mm/d) when the reservoir was receding. Despite differences in water temperature and contrasting reservoir levels between the two water years, the Largemouth Bass population in a southwest U.S. reservoir exhibited similar hatch dates reported for the species in southeastern and northeastern U.S. reservoirs. While water demand in the 21<sup>st</sup> century may exceed availability, the opportunity exists to collaborate with water managers to benefit Largemouth Bass populations in southwestern reservoirs. | | Uthe, P., R.

A recent research symposium on wildlife conservation in the Greater Etosha Landscape (GEL) highlighted increased concern of how intensification of global change will affect wildlife conservation based on participant responses to a questionnaire. The GEL includes Etosha and surrounding areas, the latter divided by a veterinary fence into large, private farms to the south and communal areas of residential and farming land to the north. Here, we leverage our knowledge of this ecosystem to provide insight into the broader challenges facing wildlife conservation in this vulnerable dryland environment. We first look backward, summarizing the history of wildlife conservation and research trends in the GEL based on a literature review, providing a broad-scale understanding of the socioecological processes that drive dryland system dynamics. We then look forward, focusing on eight key areas of challenge and opportunity for this ecosystem: climate change, water availability and quality, vegetation and fire management, adaptability of wildlife populations, disease risk, human-wildlife conflict, wildlife crime, and human dimensions of wildlife conservation. Using this model system, we summarize key lessons and identify critical threats highlighting future research needs to support wildlife management. Research in the GEL has followed a trajectory seen elsewhere reflecting an increase in complexity and integration across biological scales over time. Yet, despite these trends, a gap exists between the scope of recent research efforts and the needs of wildlife conservation to adapt to climate and land-use changes. Given the complex nature of climate change, in addition to locally existing system stressors, a framework of forward-thinking adaptive management to address these challenges, supported by integrative and multidisciplinary research could be beneficial. One critical area for growth is to better integrate research and wildlife management across land-use types. Such efforts have the potential to support wildlife conservation efforts and human development goals, while building resilience against the impacts of climate change. While our conclusions reflect the specifics of the GEL ecosystem, they have direct relevance for other African dryland systems impacted by global change. | | Turner, W.C., P.L.

Royal Society Open Science, 8: 210088. | [Publisher Website](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210088) | June 2021 || Disease outbreaks are a consequence of interactions among the three components of a host-parasite system: the infectious agent, the host, and the environment. While virulence and transmission are widely investigated, most studies of parasite life history trade-offs are conducted with theoretical models or tractable experimental systems where transmission is standardized and the environment controlled. Yet, biotic and abiotic environmental factors can strongly affect disease dynamics, and ultimately, host-parasite coevolution. Here we review research on how environmental context alters virulence-transmission relationships, focusing on the off-host portion of the parasite life cycle, and how variation in parasite survival affects the evolution of virulence and transmission. We review three inter-related \"approaches\" that have dominated the study of the evolution of virulence and transmission for different host-parasite systems: i) evolutionary trade-off theory, ii) parasite local adaptation, and iii) parasite phylodynamics. These approaches consider the role of the environment in virulence and transmission evolution from different angles, which entail different advantages and potential biases. We suggest improvements to how to investigate virulence-transmission relationships, through conceptual and methodological developments and taking environmental context into consideration. By combining developments in life history evolution, phylogenetics, adaptive dynamics, and comparative genomics, we can improve our understanding of virulence-transmission relationships across a diversity of host-parasite systems that have eluded experimental study of parasite life history. | | Turner, R.M., C.

The southeastern U.S. as a complex of use sites for nonbreeding rufa Red Knots: fifteen years 2021 || Shorebirds have been banded for decades and monitoring programs have helped to accumulate large band-encounter datasets from across the globe; however, many of these datasets are left largely unused, particularly those collected by citizen scientists. These datasets can provide valuable insight into<br>the migration and movement strategies of shorebirds and the threats they face throughout their migratory cycle. We used long-term (2003-2018) band-encounter data of Red Knots Calidris canutus rufa in North America to determine: (1) the spatiotemporal distribution during the nonbreeding season, (2) site fidelity to nonbreeding sites, and (3) migratory connectivity of knots using the southeastern United States (Southeast), an important overwintering and stopover area for this subspecies. Annual mean site fidelity ranged from 0% to 86% across 24 sites. We found movement between sites across the Southeast during migratory and wintering periods, indicating that knots are using the region as interconnected sites, as opposed to relying on a single site or a cluster of adjacent sites. We identified 'hop migration' as a common strategy for knots in the region, and showed regular within-year movement between sites in South Carolina, Georgia,<br>and Florida. The Southeast is an understudied part of the rufa range; our results show the importance of the region to the subspecies both as a stopover and wintering area. Despite the inherent biases in the data and imperfect detection due to inconsistent survey effort, the data showed large-scale movements and confirmed the region as a complex of sites connected by knots. | | Tucker, A.M., C.P McGowan, B.L.

Ecosphere. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/233165303808/None/all) | February 2023 || Consideration of the full annual cycle population dynamics can provide useful insight for conservation efforts but collecting data needed to estimate demographic parameters is often logistically difficult. For species that breed in remote areas, monitoring is often conducted during migratory stopover or at nonbreeding sites and the recruitment rate of new breeding adults can be difficult to estimate directly. Here we present an integrated population model that uses mark-resight and count data collected during migratory stopover to estimate population growth rate and recruitment rate for an Arctic-breeding shorebird of conservation concern, the red knot (<i>Calidris canutus rufa</i>), from data collected during spring stopover in Delaware Bay, USA from 2005-2018. At this site, red knot feed primarily on the eggs of spawning horseshoe crabs (<i>Limulus polyphemus</i>), a legally harvested species. We used this model to estimate the relationship between horseshoe crab abundance and red knot demographics, which informed a recent revision to framework used to establish horseshoe crab harvest regulations. Our analysis indicates that the red knot population was most likely stable from 2005-2018 (average l = 1.04, 95% CRI: 0.997, 1.07) despite recruitment rates (average = 0.093, 95% CRI: 0.036, 0.015). Adult survival probability was positively horseshoe crab abundance ( = 0.35, 95% CRI: 0.09, 0.63), but we found no effect of horseshoe crab abundance on recruitment ( = -0.08, 95% CRI: -0.41, 0.38). Our approach demonstrates the utility of integrated population models for understanding full annual cycle population dynamics, even when data are only available from one point of the annual cycle. | | Tucker, A.M. and M.C.

Denil fishways were installed at 63 low-head irrigation diversion dams in the basin to provide grayling and other fishes year-round access to critical habitats; however, their efficiency has not been evaluated comprehensively. We quantified all components of fishway efficiency (approach, attraction, entrance, and passage) for hatchery-reared grayling, wild trout (Brook Trout <i>Salvelinus fontinalis </i>and Brown <i>Salmo trutta</i>), and <i>Catostomus commersonii</i> and Longnose Sucker <i>C. catostomus</i>) during 14 field trials conducted at six Denil fishways over a representative range of fishway slopes and hydraulic conditions using passive integrated transponder telemetry. Attraction (60.4-84.3%) and entrance (44.3-78.6%) efficiencies were variable across test conditions and reduced overall fishway efficiencies (19.1-55.8%). In contrast, upon entry, passage efficiencies were high (96.2-97.0%) for all taxa across all test conditions. Attraction of hatchery-reared grayling was limited at fishways with shallow upstream depths (low fishway discharges) and low attraction flows, but wild fish were less limited by these conditions. Entrance of grayling and trout was limited at deep upstream depths (high fishway discharges) and fishways with steep slopes, especially when plunging entrance conditions associated with shallow downstream depths were present. However, both grayling and trout were more likely to enter fishways with deep downstream depths than those with shallow downstream depths, and deep downstream depths demonstrated promise for increasing entrance at fishways with high discharges and steep slopes. Our results indicate that Denil fishways have enhanced aquatic connectivity for fishes in the Big Hole River basin, and maintaining high attraction flows and deep downstream depths could increase attraction and entrance, thereby improving overall fishway efficiency. | | Tracy, E.

High offspring predation risk can favor fast growth rates among species that may be achieved by faster post-natal metabolic rates. Faster metabolism, on the other hand, may create costs for adults, such that species with low adult mortality rates may be expected to minimize such adult costs through slower metabolism. Thus, mortality at the two different life stages may differentially influence offspring metabolism. We tested these possibilities among 43 songbird species studied on three continents. We found that nest predation risk and adult mortality probability were indeed interactive in their association with offspring metabolic rates across species. Our results provide a rare example of ecological sources of mortality during different life stages being correlated with post-natal metabolic rate as a mechanism underlying offspring growth. | Toews, D.P.L., G.R. intergeneric hybrids in New World wood-warblers (Aves: Parulidae).

An increasing variety of mathematical models offer insight into invasive populations, and can help managers identify cost effective prevention, control, and eradication actions. Despite this, as model complexity grows, so does the inaccessibility of these tools to conservation practitioners making decisions about management. Here, we seek to narrow the science-practice gap by reviewing invasive species management models (ISMMs). We define ISMMs as mechanistic models used to explore invasive species management strategies, and include reaction-advection-diffusion models, integrodifference equations, gravity models, particle transport models, non-spatial and spatial discrete-time population growth models, cellular automata, and individual-based models. For each approach, we describe the model framework and its implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and give examples of conservation applications. We conclude by discussing how ISMMs can be used in concert with adaptive management to address scientific uncertainties impeding action and with multiple objective decision processes to evaluate tradeoffs among management objectives. We undertook this review to support more effective decision-making involving invasive species by providing conservation practitioners with the information they need to identify tools most useful for their applications. | | Thomas, N.

To capture variation among anglers, survey responses were grouped by level of angler specialization using K-means cluster analysis, which resulted in a three-cluster solution of most, moderate, and least specialized anglers. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to detect potential differences among the three specialization clusters.

To be effective for biodiversity and other issues, however, conservation needs to address processes related to field-based patterns of organismal distribution. Organismal distribution patterns in geographically-large, spatially-heterogeneous, and temporally-dynamic field environments can be challenging to identify using existing approaches. Here we show how dynamic-distribution telemetry data<b> </b>can provide a detailed temporal record of how individuals are distributed that provides new directions for a range of basic and applied questions beyond those issues traditionally explored by telemetry. To illustrate the advantages that accrue from this approach, we explored the connection between discrete groups of coexisting, same-species, same-size individuals and patterns of field distribution. We quantified locations of 59 acoustically-tagged striped bass (<i>Morone saxatilis) </i>within a 26-stationary unit telemetry receiver estuarine array in Plum Island Estuary. We then used cluster analyses on spatial and temporal-spatial metrics from this dataset to (1) assess if distinct groups of individuals coexisted, (2) quantify group characteristics, and (3) test associations between groups and distribution (e.g., physical site types and regions). Four discrete, co-occurring groups of similar-sized, individual striped bass were defined by different patterns of spatio-temporal use of physical habitat types and estuarine regions. Thus, our approach provides a different view of spatial distribution patterns, in a geographic area adjacent to dense human settlements, that has relevance to a wide range of ecological, evolutionary, behavioral, and conservation questions relevant to human-dominated coastalscapes. | | Taylor, R.

Aquatic Biology DOI: https://doi.org/10.3354/ab00748 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/208861530112/None/all) | January 2022 || High fisheries production within estuaries is associated with coastal upwelling, tidal mixing, and land-based runoff including river inflows that vary from climate and human activities. Understanding how estuarine nekton respond to changing river flows remains critical to manage these systems to maintain fisheries production. To compare effects of different river inflows on nekton, we quantified nekton assemblages in marsh edge and open water sites within an active and inactive delta system. Crustaceans dominated assemblages with Palaemonid shrimp contributing 44% to 65% of total catch, differing only by season, and not delta; summer and fall generally supporting higher densities. In contrast, fish density and assemblages differed seasonally between deltas with the largest differences occurring during extended and high spring river discharge into the active delta. During this period, the active delta experienced lowered salinity, temperature, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) biomass, and reduced fish densities and richness compared to the inactive delta. Active delta sites supported greater biomass of <i>Callinectes sapidus</i> during the fall at marsh edge sites compared to other season and delta combinations. Nekton densities and habitat use patterns across deltas and seasons reflect a combination of life history characteristics of dominant species and habitat conditions. The high spring river discharge in 2019 impacted habitat availability (reduced SAV biomass), habitat quality (decreased temperatures and salinity), and potentially displaced nekton to un-sampled habitat areas (i.e., interior marsh surface) within the active delta. Understanding how altered inflow impacts environmental and habitat variables supporting estuarine nekton production remains critical to support management. | | Tang, Z., Y. Zhang, Y. Wang, Y.

Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Tools With Artificial Intelligence | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/222469646336/None/all) | December 2021 || The rapid technological development of drones has led to an increase in capabilities of aerial image collection and analysis for wildlife monitoring. Historically, wildlife abundance estimates were based on manual counts from the ground or from the air using fix-winged aircraft over the regions, both of which are expensive and potentially dangerous methods. However, drones can help easily collect aerial images with a limited budget and increased flexibility, as it creates less disturbance to the wildlife, allowing us to get closer to the target animals and providing clearer images. In this paper, we propose a new, integrated system of drones and machine learning for waterfowl population surveys, which provides a user-friendly interface for data collection and integrates data post-processing using deep learning methods to detect and count waterfowl automatically. Our system has proved to be an efficient and accurate approach of collecting, analyzing, and providing outputs of waterfowl abundance estimates using drones and machine learning. | | Takahashi, F., F.

Species ecological and life history traits may predict success in human-dominated landscapes such that only species with \"winning\" combinations of traits will persist in disturbed environments. However, this link between species traits and successful coexistence with humans remains obscured by the complexity of anthropogenic disturbances and variability among study systems. We compiled detection data for 24 mammal species from 61 populations across North America to quantify the effects of (1) the direct presence of people and (2) the human footprint (landscape modification) on mammal occurrence and activity levels. Thirty-three percent of mammal species exhibited a net negative response (i.e., reduced occurrence or activity) to increasing human presence and/or footprint across populations, whereas 58% of species were positively associated with increasing disturbance. However, apparent benefits of human presence and footprint tended to decrease or disappear at higher disturbance levels, indicative of thresholds in mammal species' capacity to tolerate disturbance or exploit human-dominated landscapes. Species ecological and life history traits were strong predictors of their responses to human footprint, with increasing footprint favoring smaller, less carnivorous, faster-reproducing species. The positive and negative effects of human presence were distributed more randomly with respect to species trait values, with apparent winners and losers across a range of body sizes and dietary guilds. Differential responses by some species to human presence and human footprint highlight the importance of considering these two forms of human disturbance separately when estimating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife. Our approach provides insights into the complex mechanisms through which human activities shape mammal communities globally, revealing the drivers of the loss of larger predators in human-modified landscapes. | | Sura, S.

These calls, first made prominent by the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP) in 1990, have grown in intensity in recent years as rampant inequalities compound environmental crises, illustrating that environmental protection cannot be decoupled from social justice. In this paper, we draw on public statements released by large environmental organizations in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests to examine how their use of language around racial and social justice today reflects early calls for the environmental movement to address its own problematic legacies and align its aims with the work of environmental justice. Our findings suggest that organizations are leaning into four distinct discourses around justice that evoke ideas of <i>solidarity, heroism, internal reform, and redress of problematic legacies</i>, but also indicate a relative lack of attention to ideological or structural change within the movement. We explore the historical context of these findings, paying particular attention to the ways in which the neoliberalization of the non-profit sector over the last 30 years may have limited opportunities for more emancipatory discourses to emerge. We conclude with a call for mainstream environmental organizations to revisit the SWOP letter and explore new ways to couple internal cultural change with deeper institutional reform. | | Sullivan, C.J., K.E.

University of Hawaii at Hilo. Available online at: hdl.handle.net/10790/5553 2021 || The data-limited stock assessment models used to monitor the status of coral reef fish species in the Western Pacific region are dependent upon accurate estimates of standing stock biomass generated from underwater visual surveys of reefs. However, the imperfect detection of and variable occupancy of habitat by reef fishes are not currently accounted for in these estimates. Therefore, the objective of this project was to estimate detection and occupancy coefficients for the species listed in the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's Fishery Ecosystem Plans by analyzing the Pacific Island Fishery Science Center-Coral Reef Ecosystem Program Reef Fish Dataset. These detection and occupancy coefficients would then be applied to refine standing stock biomass estimates. In general, species with higher detection probabilities and/or lower occupancy rates tended to exhibit the greatest differences in the estimates of standing stock biomass calculated with and without accounting for detection and occupancy. The standing stock biomass of most reef fish species seem to be underestimated when detection and occupancy are not accounted for. However, the standing stock biomass of larger-bodied targeted species, such as jacks, snappers, and groupers, seem to be over-estimated relative to the estimates generated when accounting for occupancy and detection. Based on the re-estimated standing stock biomass. While there are still issues to resolve regarding how well the current data collection methods meet the underlying assumptions of the detection and occupancy modeling approach, the inclusion of detection and occupancy coefficients seems likely to improve estimates of standing stock biomass of coral reef fish species. | | Stuber, EF, BC Carlson, and B Jesmer. 2022.

Nevertheless, individual variation in spatial behaviors, such as home range behavior, movement characteristics, or habitat use has yet to be incorporated into the concepts or methodologies of ecology and evolutionary biology. To evaluate evidence for the existence of consistent among-individual differences in spatial behavior - which we refer to as \"spatial personality\" - we performed a meta-analysis of 200 repeatability estimates of home range size, movement metrics, and habitat use. We found that the existence of spatial personality is a general phenomenon, with consistently high repeatability (r) across classes of spatial behavior (r = 0.67 - 0.82), taxa (r = 0.31 - 0.79), and time between repeated measurements (r = 0.54 - 0.74). These results suggest: (1) repeatable spatial behavior may either be a cause or consequence of the environment experienced and lead to spatial personalities that may limit the ability of individuals to behaviorally adapt to changing landscapes; (2) interactions between spatial phenotypes and environmental conditions could result in differential reproduction, survival, and dispersal, suggesting that among-individual variation may facilitate population-level adaptation; (3) spatial patterns of species' distributions and spatial population dynamics may be better understood by shifting from a mean field analytical approach towards methods that account for spatial personalities and their associated fitness and ecological dynamics. | | Strickfaden, K.S., A.

Identification of snow refugia, or places with relatively late snow disappearance dates compared to surrounding areas, are especially important as climate change continues to alter snow cover timing and duration. However, many snow data products are either too coarse-scale to capture variations in snow cover or are too expensive or logistically challenging to collect over broad spatial extents. The purpose of this study was to use remote cameras to collect snow data at fine spatial and temporal scales in a complex forested terrain for the identification of snow refugia. We built generalized linear models to relate the snow disappearance dates (SDDs) at the camera sites to their topographic and vegetation characteristics. We built a model to describe SDDs of camera sites which contained elevation, aspect, and an interaction between canopy cover and cold-air pooling potential. This model could predict SDDs to within 2 weeks and to within 1 week of true SDD for 93% and 71% of the camera sites, respectively. This model contains only data which are readily available as spatially distributed datasets, which allowed for mapping of SDDs across the entire study site. This model and map can be used to guide forest management for the retention of snow, increase the accuracy of hydrologic models, and inform habitat management for snow-dependent wildlife species. | | L.K.

Wildlife Society Bulletin. http://doi.org/10.1002/wsb.1481 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/223193466880/None/all) | August 2023 || Remote cameras are used to study demographics, ecological processes, and behavior of wildlife populations. Cameras have also been used to measure snow depth with physical snow stakes. However, concerns that physical instruments at camera sites may influence animal behavior limit installation of instruments to facilitate collecting such data. Given that snow depth data are inherently contained within images, potential insights that could be made using these data are lost. To facilitate camerabased snow depth observations without additional equipment installation, we developed a method implemented in an R package called edger to superimpose virtual measurement devices onto images. The virtual snow stakes can be used to derive snow depth measurements. We validated the method for snow depth estimation using camera data from Latah County, Idaho, USA in winter 2020-2021. Mean bias error between the virtual snow stake and a physical snow stake was 5.8 cm; the mean absolute bias error was 8.8 cm. The mean Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency score comparing the fit of the 2 sets of measurements within each camera was 0.748, indicating good agreement. The edger package provides researchers with a means to take critical measurements for ecological studies without the use of physical objects that could alter animal behavior, and snow data at finer scales can complement other snow data sources that have coarser spatial and temporal resolution. | | Streker, J.

However, ghost tags create uncertainty about detected tag status (i.e. live fish or ghost tag) when using mobile interrogation systems. We developed a method to differentiate between live fish and ghost tags using a random forest classification model with a novel data input structure based on known fate PIT tag detections in the San Juan River, NM, CO, and UT, USA. We used our model to classify detected tags with an overall error rate of 6.8% (1.6% ghost tags error rate and 21.8% live fish error rate). The important variables for classification were related to distance moved and response to flood flows; however, habitat variables did not appear to influence model accuracy. Our results and approach allow the use of mobile detection data with confidence and allow for greater accuracy in movement, distribution, and habitat use studies, potentially helping identify influential management actions improving our ability to conserve and recover endangered fish. | | Stout, J.B, M.M.

Most studies have focused only on taxonomic beta diversity, and few have considered functional or phylogenetic beta diversity. Including anthropogenic factors and multiple dimensions of biodiversity may explain additional variation in beta diversity, providing new insight into how metacommunities are structured across the landscape. In this study, we used a 350 site stream fish abundance dataset from South Carolina, USA to quantify variation in beta diversity explainable by dispersal, as well as natural and anthropogenic abiotic variables. We investigated metacommunity drivers along three spatial delineations by breaking up the dataset into a metacommunity at the whole state level, two geomorphologically distinct metacommunities of the upstate and lowlands, and four natural watershed metacommunities. Within each of these metacommunities we calculated taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic beta diversity and used variation partitioning to determine explained variation. We explained 25-81% of beta diversity for stream fish metacommunities. We observed differing importance of spatial, natural, or anthropogenic factors based on the spatial delineation and diversity dimension. We detected distinct structuring of stream fish communities in South Carolina occurring between the upstate and the lowlands. When accounting for the geomorphic differences the fall line creates, we observed a significant anthropogenic signal in the upstate and lowland metacommunities. Spatial, environmental, and anthropogenic factors explained slightly more variation in beta diversity for the taxonomic dimension compared to the functional and phylogenetic dimensions. Our study highlights the importance of including anthropogenic factors when trying to determine mechanisms for stream fish community structure and the significance of spatial delineation in how researchers interpret their results. | | Stock, B.C., Heppell, S.

Pulse recruitment and recovery of Cayman Islands Nassau Grouper (Epinephelus striatus) spawning aggregations revealed by in Science 78(1): vulnerable to overexploitation, yet quantitative assessments of FSA populations are rare. We document an approach for how to conduct such an assessment, evaluating the response of Critically Endangered Nassau Grouper (<i>Epinephelus striatus</i>) to protections in the Cayman Islands. We assessed pre-protection status on all islands using length data from fishery catch. We then used 17 years of noninvasive length-frequency data, collected via diver-operated laser calipers, to estimate recruitment and spawning biomass of Nassau Grouper on Little Cayman following protection. Bimodal length distributions in 2017-2019 indicated a large recruitment pulse (4-8\u00d7 average) derived from spawning in 2011. Biomass recovered to 90-106% of the pre-exploitation level after 16 years, largely driven by the strong 2011 year class. Length distributions were also bimodal in 2017-2019 on nearby Cayman Brac, implying a synchronous recruitment pulse occurred on both islands. Our results demonstrate that: (i) <i>in situ</i> length data can be used to monitor protected FSAs; (ii) spatiotemporal FSA closures can be effective, but success takes time if population recovery depends upon sporadic recruitment; and (iii) FSA fishery management targets may need to be higher than commonly recommended (i.e. spawning potential ratio >0.6 instead of 0.4). | | Stiller, J.C., W.F. Siemer, K.A. Perkins, and A.K. Fuller. 2022. Choosing an optimal duck season: Integrating hunter values and duck abundance. Wildlife Society Bulletin. https://doi.org/10.1002/wsb.1313 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/221813516288/None/all) | June 2022 || State wildlife agencies have long struggled to identify optimal hunting season dates for migratory game bird species that meet the diverse and often competing interests of stakeholders. Many approaches have been used to ensure the regulated community is involved in the decision-making process, including public hearings, hunter season-date preference surveys, and hunter task forces or committees. Although these approaches include portions of the regulated community (i.e., typically the most avid) they may not necessarily reflect the opinions and values of all stakeholders. Additionally, these approaches rely heavily on limited anecdotal observations that may be unduly influenced by hunter avidity (e.g. days spent afield), hunter density, species preferences, and property access. To address these challenges, we used a structured decision-making framework that included a duck hunter survey to elucidate values of a representative sample of the regulated community in each duck hunting zone in New York State. Rather than asking duck hunters about their specific duck hunting season date preferences, we asked them to rank 6 objectives describing what they value in their hunting experience (e.g., maximizing the opportunity to see mallards [<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>] and black duck [<i>Anas rubripes</i>], maximizing the number of weekend days, etc.). Four of the 6 objectives described duck species availability (i.e., abundance or immigration). We used spatiotemporal abundance models derived from eBird citizen science data to estimate abundance and immigration rates of ducks in each waterfowl zone. We evaluated up to 9 unique season date alternatives developed by duck hunter task forces to determine which season date alternative best satisfied the competing objectives of duck hunters in each zone. The approach we developed allowed for selection of optimal duck hunting season dates and successfully involved avid duck hunters in the development stages, while ensuring that the values of a representative sample of all stakeholders were directly considered through a clear and transparent decision-making process. | | Stich, D., Sheehan, T., and Zydlewski, J.

A comprehensive summary of who is monitoring and evaluating capacity development interventions, what is being evaluated and how, would help in the development of evidence-based guidance to inform design and implementation decisions for future capacity development interventions and evaluations of their effectiveness. We built an evidence map by reviewing peer-reviewed and grey literature published since 2000, to identify case studies evaluating capacity development interventions in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management. We used inductive and deductive approaches to develop a coding strategy for studies that met our criteria, extracting data on the type of capacity development intervention, evaluation methods, data and analysis types, categories of outputs and outcomes assessed, and whether the study had a clear causal model and/or used a systems approach. We found that almost all studies assessed multiple outcome types: most frequent was change in knowledge, followed by behaviour, then attitude. Few studies evaluated conservation outcomes. Less than half included an explicit causal model linking interventions to expected outcomes. Half of the studies considered external factors that could influence the efficacy of the capacity development intervention, and few used an explicit systems approach. We used framework synthesis to situate our evidence map within the broader literature on capacity development evaluation. Our evidence map (including a visual heat map) highlights areas of low and high representation in investment in research on the evaluation of capacity development. | | Stephenson, M.D., L.A.

However, little is known about how the quantitative spatial dynamics of host movement and environmental change may affect the spread of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> - the causative agent of anthrax. Here, we use real-time observation and high-resolution tracking data from a population of common hippopotamus (<i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i>) to explore the relationship between changing river hydrology, <i>H. amphibius</i> movement, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active anthrax outbreak. We found that changes in water availability indirectly facilitated the spread of <i>B. anthracis</i> by modulating <i>H. amphibius</i> movements. Our findings reveal that anthrax spread upstream in the Great Ruaha River, which followed the movement patterns of infected <i>H. amphibius</i>, who moved upstream as the river dried in search of remaining aquatic refugia. Moreover, infection by <i>B. anthracis</i> did not appear to influence <i>H. rates between <i>H. amphibius </i>and <i>B. anthracis-</i>infected river pools are heterogeneous and the frequency and duration of contacts increase the probability of mortality. While difficult to obtain, the quantitative insights that we gathered during a real-time anthrax outbreak are critical to better understand, predict, and manage future outbreaks. | | Starkloff, N.

Disentangling the effects of host relatedness and elevation on haemosporidian parasite turnover in a songbirds. May 2021 || The persistence of a parasite species in an ecological community is determined together by its environmental tolerance and host breadth. The relative contribution of these niche characteristics to parasite community structure is challenging to parse because host persistence is also a consequence of extrinsic environmental factors. We investigated haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus) in a clade of avian hosts in eastern North America. This clade of Catharus thrushes contains species that occupy specific elevational bands in a non-phylogenetically determined manner. This allowed us to tease apart the effects of host relatedness and elevation on parasite diversity, community structure and infection prevalence. We screened blood and tissue samples from 414 birds from four mountain ranges in the Appalachian Highlands for blood parasites using a cytochrome-b nested PCR protocol and identified parasite lineages by sequencing. We found an overall infection prevalence of 88.4% and identified a total of 38 parasite lineages including seven novel lineages. Host relatedness rather than elevational zone predicted the beta turnover and phylobetaturnover of Leucocytozoon parasites, where closely related host species had more similar parasites. While this pattern was not seen in Plasmodium parasites, the diversity of this parasite genus varied considerably in the high elevational zones among mountain ranges, i.e. a sky-island effect. Additionally, the alpha diversity of Haemosporidians did not vary by host species or elevational zone, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon infection prevalence was determined by one or two of these predictors, respectively. Haemoproteus parasites were rare in this study system. Our study suggests that the mechanisms that underlie the community structuring vary between haemosporidian genera due to differences in the degree of host sharing among lineages. | | 2023. Qualitative value of information provides a transparent and repeatable method for identifying critical uncertainty. Ecological Applications:e2824. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/241182986240/None/all) | [Publisher Website](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2824) | February 2023 || Conservation decisions are often made in the face of uncertainty because the urgency to act can preclude delaying management while uncertainty is resolved. In this context, adaptive management is attractive, allowing simultaneous management and learning. An adaptive program design requires the identification of critical uncertainties that impede the choice of management action. Quantitative evaluation of critical uncertainty, using the expected value of information, may require more resources than are available in the early stages of conservation planning. Here, we demonstrate the use of a new qualitative index to the value ofinformation (QVoI) to prioritize which sources of uncertainty to reduceregarding the use of prescribed fire to benefit Eastern Black Rails(Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis), Yellow Rails (Coterminous noveboracensis), and Mottled Ducks (Anas fulvigula; hereafter, focal species) in high marshes of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Prescribed fire has been used as a management tool in Gulf of Mexico high marshes throughout the last 30+ years; however, effects of periodic burning on the focal species and the optimal conditions for burning marshes to improve habitat remain unknown. We followed a structured decision making framework to develop conceptual models, which we then used to identify sources of uncertainty and articulate alternative hypotheses about prescribed fire in high marshes. We used QVoI to evaluate the sources of uncertainty based on their magnitude, relevance for decision making, and reducibility. We found that hypotheses related to the optimal fire return interval and season were the highest priorities for study, whereas hypotheses related to predation rates and interactions among management techniques were lowest. These results suggest that learning about the optimal fire frequency and season to benefit the focal species might produce the greatest management benefit. In this case study, we demonstrate that QVoI can help managers decide where to apply limited resources to learn which specific actions will result in a higher likelihood of achieving the desired management objectives. Further, we summarize the strengths and limitations of QVoI and outline recommendations for its future use for prioritizing research and to reduce uncertainty about system dynamics and the effects of management actions. | | Stahlecker, M.B.

Journal of Raptor Research 54:1-11. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/222723078144/None/all) | September 2022 || Abstract.-- Deaths of four Golden Eagles (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) due to collision trauma at a new wind energy facility in east central New Mexico during 2004-2005 prompted concerns about the species' population status in the encompassing Southern Great Plains region, primarily because its breeding distribution there was poorly documented and wind energy was expanding. Therefore, we conducted aerial searches for Golden Eagle nests across northeastern New Mexico, northwestern Texas and western Oklahoma, and adjacent portions of Colorado and Kansas during 2006-2009 and 2015-2020. We delineated five Golden Eagle Nest Search Areas (NSAs) with unique physiographic/geological origins. Individual NSAs were searched partly or entirely for up to 8 yr. Collectively, we identified 123 breeding areas (BAs) occupied by Golden Eagles 1 yr, 95 (77.2%) of which were in northeastern New Mexico. The most BAs (40) were in the 11,720-km<sup>2</sup> Highlands NSA. Greatest BA density (126.6 km<sup>2</sup>/BA) and shortest BA nearest neighbor distance (7.4 km) were in the 3,533-km<sup>2</sup> Northern Caprock NSA. Wind energy was developing rapidly in the region. Wind turbines existed near (within 3.2 km) 21 nests distributed among six of 28 BAs in the Northern Caprock and were planned for siting near another BA. Elsewhere, only planned turbines were near nests and only within six BAs. Our findings indicate that the Southern Great Plains supports many Golden Eagle pairs at the eastern margin of the species' breeding range in western North America. Our data provide a solid basis for protecting breeding habitat from potential threats, particularly those posed by wind and fossil-fuel energy development, and provides a foundation for long-term population monitoring. | | Stacy, J., R.L.

Juvenile life history diversity is associated with lifetime demographic heterogeneity in a migratory fish. Ecosphere. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/235083698176/None/all) | January 2023 || Differences in the life history pathways of juvenile animals are often associated with differences in demographic rates in later life stages. For migratory animals, different life-history pathways often result in animals from the same population occupying distinct habitats subjected to different environmental drivers. Understanding how demographic rates differ among animals expressing different life history pathways may reveal fitness tradeoffs that drive the expression of alternative life history pathways and enable better prediction of population dynamics in a changing environment. To understand how demographic outcomes and their relationships with environmental variables differ among animals with different life history pathways, we analyzed a long-term mark-recapture dataset for Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) from the Wenatchee River, Washington, USA. Distinct life history pathways represented in this population include either remaining in the natal stream until emigrating to the ocean as a one-year-old (<i>natal-reach rearing</i>) or emigrating from the natal stream and rearing in downstream habitats for several months before completing the emigration to the ocean as a one-year-old (<i>downstream rearing</i>). We found that downstream-rearing fish emigrated to the ocean 19 days earlier on average and returned as adults from the ocean at higher rates. We detected a positive correlation between rate of return from the ocean by downstream-rearing fish and coastal upwelling in their spring of outmigration, whereas for natal-reach-rearing fish we detected a positive correlation with sea surface temperature during their first marine summer. Different responses to environmental variability should lead to asynchrony in adult abundance among juvenile life history pathways. A higher proportion of downstream-rearing fish returned at younger ages compared to natal-reach-rearing fish, which contributed to more variability in age at reproduction and greater mixing across generations. Our results provide an example of how diversity in juvenile life history pathways is associated with heterogeneity in demographic rates during subsequent life stages. This demographic heterogeneity can in turn affect variance in the aggregate population abundance and population response to environmental change. Our findings underscore the importance of considering life history diversity in demographic analyses and lay the foundation for the development of population models that account for different life history pathways. | | Sorel, M. H., A. R. Murdoch, R.W. Zabel, C. M. Kamphaus, E. R. Buhle, M. D. Scheuerell, and S. J. Converse. 2023. Effects of population density and environmental conditions on life-history expression in a migratory fish. Ecology and Evolution 13:e11087. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/235307030528/None/all) | May 2023 || Individual variation in life-history traits can have important implications for the ability of populations to respond to environmental variability and change. In migratory animals, flexibility in the timing of life-history events, such as juvenile emigration from natal areas, can influence the effects of population density and environmental conditions on population dynamics. We evaluated the functional relationships between population density and environmental covariates and the abundance of juveniles expressing different life-history pathways in a migratory fish, Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>), in a river basin in Washington State, USA. We found that the abundance of younger emigrants from natal streams was best described by an accelerating or near-linear function of spawners, whereas the abundance of older emigrants was best described by a decelerating function of spawners. This supports the hypothesis that emigration timing varies in response to density in natal areas, with younger-emigrating life-history pathways comprising a larger proportion of emigrants when densities of conspecifics are high. We also observed positive relationships between winter stream discharge and abundance of younger emigrants, supporting the hypothesis that habitat conditions can also influence the expression of different life-history pathways. Our results suggest that early emigration, and a resultant increase in the use of downstream rearing habitats, may increase if winter precipitation increases in the future as is projected due to climate warming. Characterizing relationships between life-history expression and environmental conditions is a necessary first step in understanding the dynamics of species with diverse life-history strategies. As environmental conditions change - due to climate change, management, or other factors - resultant life-history changes are likely to have important demographic implications that will be challenging to predict if life-history diversity is not accounted for in population models. | | Sorel MH, RW Zabel, DS Johnson, Estimating population-specific predation effects on Chinook salmon via data integration.

Increasing predation by pinnipeds on threatened salmon is of particular concern. Seemingly, pinniped conservation is now in conflict with the recovery of threatened salmon, creating a dilemma for managers. <br><br>2) We use the Lower Columbia River as a case study for examining the relationship between seasonal California sea lion (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) abundance and survival of threatened salmon. To quantify mortality associated with increasing sea lion abundance, we examined the effect of seasonal sea lion abundance on adult Chinook salmon<i> </i>(<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>)<i> </i>survival during migrations through the Lower Columbia River. We integrated data on survival with data on population-specific migration timing, allowing quantification of the relationship between sea lion abundance and survival in 18 populations of spring-summer Chinook salmon listed as Threatened or Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.<br><br>3) Of the 18 populations examined, earlier migrating populations experienced lower survival in association with increased exposure to higher sea lion abundance. We estimated that in years with high sea lion abundance, the nine earliest-migrating populations experienced an additional 21.1% (16.3, 26.1) mortality compared to years with baseline sea lion abundance, while the nine latest migrating populations experienced an additional 10.1% (7.5, 13.0). <br><br>4)<i> Synthesis and Application.</i> Integrating datasets on seasonal survival and migration timing made it possible for us to estimate population-specific mortality associated with increased sea lion abundance in the Lower Columbia River. This information could not be produced from any one data set, highlighting the utility of data integration approaches. The mortality experienced by early migrating Chinook salmon suggests the potential for demographic and evolutionary consequences. Management actions such as hazing, relocating, or removing individuals that are frequent predators on salmon have been proposed. Identifying the management actions that will allow for socially and legally acceptable tradeoffs between multiple conservation and other social values will be facilitated by development of explicit multi-species management frameworks. Continued monitoring will help to reduce the substantial uncertainty about the effect of pinnipeds on salmon and the predicted outcomes of alternative management actions. | | Soranno, P.A., K.S.

Information on potential abundance can be combined with information on the current status of an invasion to guide management towards currently uninvaded locations where the threat of invasion is high.<br><b>Objectives: </b>We aimed to support management by developing predictive maps of potential cover for cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>), a problematic invader that can transform plant communities. We integrated our predictions of potential abundance with mapped estimates of current cover to quantify invasion potential within lightly invaded areas.<br><b>Methods: </b>We used quantile regression to model cheatgrass abundance as a function of climate, weather, and disturbance, treating outputs as low to high invasion scenarios.

Our results highlight the extensive areas across the Great Basin where cheatgrass abundance could increase to levels that can alter fire behavior and cause other ecological impacts.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> We predict potential cheatgrass abundance to quantify relative invasion risk. Our model results provide high and low scenarios of cheatgrass abundance to guide resource allocation and planning efforts across shrubland ecosystems of the Great Basin that remain relatively uninvaded.

To meet these needs, we developed a model to assess benthic ecosystem impacts from fishing gear contact. The habitat impacts model is cast in discrete-time and can accommodate overlapping fisheries as well as incorporate gear-specific contact dynamics. We implemented the model in the North Pacific using fishing data from 2003 - 2017, estimating that habitat in 3.1% of the 1.2 million km2 study area was disturbed at the end of the simulation period. A marked decline in habitat disturbance was evident since 2010 attributable to a single regulatory gear change which lifted trawl gear components off the seafloor. Running scenarios without these gear modifications showed these policies may have contributed to a 24% reduction in habitat disturbance since their implementation. Ultimately, model outputs provide direct estimates of the spatial and temporal trends of habitat effects from fishing - a key component of regulatory policies for many of the world's fisheries. | | Smalling, K.L., Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in United States Tapwater: Comparison of Underserved Private-Well and Public-Supply Exposures and Associated Health Implications, Environment International, p. 108033, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108033 || June 2023 || | | Smalling, K.L., V.S.

We also used remote sensing techniques to estimate woody cover change and performed ground surveys to estimate woody species mortality, top-kill rates of woody species, size of remaining woody vegetation, postfire herbaceous composition, and the influence of herbicide and interaction on non-native saltcedar (<i>Tamarix 18 \u00b1 1% (mean \u00b1 SD) of all other trees, including all eastern redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i> L.), and another 54 \u00b1 2% of trees were top-killed and resprouted.

Systems thinking can inform their management by quantifying the impacts that they face. We apply systems thinking to the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGM) loggerhead (Caretta caretta) Recovery Unit (RU), one of the smallest subpopulations of loggerheads nesting in the USA. We characterized disturbances to nests, management actions, and hatchling production across 12 nesting beaches used by this RU to explore how hatchling production would increase if disturbances were mitigated. Annual hatchling production at sites ranged from 470 the most common annual disturbances across sites. Focusing on the most impactful disturbances at just five sites could increase annual NGM RU hatchling production by 2.2-6.7%. Efforts to mitigate wash overs and washouts are ongoing in Alabama, but these may be futile against tropical cyclones, which accounted for >80% of washouts in the present study, and further require careful examination of associated adverse side-effects. Efforts to mitigate predation are common throughout this RU, but require improved knowledge of predator ecology to reach full potential. Systems thinking allowed us to create a simple model for assessing disturbances and management strategies in terms of hatchling sea turtles. This model can be augmented to run dynamic simulations of how disturbances and management actions impact hatchling production, and can be applied to other species with similar reproductive strategies. | | Sikkel, PC, CA Cook, LP Renoux, C Bennet, LJ Tuttle, and NJ Smit. 2018.

These regulations are ideally customized to meet water-specific stock dynamics and fishery objectives. However, in districts with numerous discrete waters, fisheries are commonly managed with a universal regional regulation. Evaluating alternative regional length limits requires consideration of management objectives that may not be important at the single-system level, but that emerge as relevant at the regional scale, such as uniformity of regional harvest, diversity of average catch sizes, and opportunity to harvest. We developed a flexible tool for evaluating regional length limits. The tool joins the well-established Beverton-Holt yield-per-recruit model with elements of decision-support methods. The model quantifies regional management objectives as utility functions that are weighted and summed into a single value used to evaluate alternative length limits. The flexibility of the tool stems from its capacity to consider a mixture of stock parameters and associated uncertainty to evaluate multiple length limits, weighing an array of regional fishery objectives quantified by various performance metrics. This adjustability affords flexibility to consider a diversity of options that can stimulate innovation in setting regional length limits. We demonstrate the model by evaluating varying length limits on fishery objectives related to the management of hypothetical Yellow Perch populations and real Black Crappie populations. | | Shaftel, R., Mauger, S., Falke, J., Rinella, D., Davis, J., and L.

As part of a study of sandhill cranes <i>Antigone canadensis </i>in the zone of contact between breeding distributions of the Eastern Population and Mid-continent Population in Minnesota, United States, we monitored first summer survival of 34 sandhill cranes (hereafter, \"colts\") using VHF and/or GPS-GSM transmitters. We estimated daily survival probabilities from 19 to 120 days post-hatch using a generalized linear model accounting for interval censoring, resulting in an estimated period survival rate of 0.52 (90% confidence interval 0.36-0.71) over summer (100 days). Estimated daily probabilities of survival increased as colts became older and fledged (at 70-75 days post-hatch), when they presumably became less vulnerable to predation. Causes of mortality were mostly unknown aside from one case of a collision with a vehicle. There is a scarcity of published colt survival rate estimates for sandhill cranes and what is available varies widely by study site. Region-specific sandhill crane colt survival rate estimates can inform future management efforts and inform population dynamics research and overall natural history knowledge of sandhill cranes. | | Sethi SA, Carey MP, Gerken J, Harris B, Cunningham C, Wolf N, Restrepo F, Ashline J (2022) Juvenile salmon habitat use drives variation in growth and highlights vulnerability to river fragmentation. Ecosphere 13:e4192. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/222830170112/None/all) | July 2022 || Widespread stream network fragmentation from dams and culverts has altered habitat connectivity in river ecosystems and presents an acute threat to migratory fish. To support watershed management for an iconic migratory fish group, we assessed juvenile salmon growth outcomes across habitat use strategies and characterized how these life histories may be impacted by stream connectivity loss. Juvenile coho salmon (<i>Oncorynchus kisutch</i>) in the Big Lake drainage, Alaska, U.S.A., were individually tracked over 2012-2013 and categorized into habitat use behaviors, with fish either remaining in streams throughout freshwater residency or migrating seasonally to overwinter in lake habitats. Size, growth rate, and body condition of smolts (n=1,113) were compared across habitat use strategies. Juvenile coho salmon that moved seasonally to lake overwintering habitats, the most frequently observed strategy, grew faster and were significantly larger as smolts compared to their counterparts who remained in streams exclusively (spring age 1 fish: 18% larger by weight, 9% faster growth rate; spring age 2+ fish: 26% heavier, 11% faster growth). Environmental data from a subset of overwinter lakes indicate that greater foraging opportunity and lower energy costs may be implicated in growth advantages conferred by lentic overwintering strategies. Habitat use strategies requiring seasonal migrations, however, increased exposure to stream connectivity loss, and fish blocked from accessing a potential overwinter headwater lake by a culvert and dam had lowest body condition among study groups. Stream network fragmentation restricts access to preferred overwinter habitats, and our findings suggest this may constrain freshwater rearing strategies associated with strong juvenile coho salmon growth. As size at smolt has been implicated as a driver of salmon survival through ocean residency, reduced freshwater habitat connectivity during juvenile stages may have deleterious impacts on later marine life stages. Consequently, conservation of stream connectivity across lentic and lotic habitats represents an important watershed management priority for juvenile salmon. | | Sethi SA, Ashline J, Harris B, Gerken J, Restrepo F.

Juvenile Pacific salmon exhibit diverse habitat use and migration strategies to navigate high environmental variability and predation risk during freshwater residency. Increasingly, urbanization and climate-driven hydrological variability present further stressors for these anadromous species, emphasizing a need to conserve freshwater habitat integrity to support life history diversity as a buffer against ongoing ecosystem changes.<br>2. To inform catchment management for salmon, information on the distribution and movement dynamics of juvenile fish throughout the annual seasonal cycle is needed. While a number of studies have assessed the ecology of juvenile coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>) during summer and fall seasons, catchment use by this species throughout the annual cycle is less well characterized, particularly in high latitude systems.<br>3. Here, <i>n</i> = 3,792 tagged juvenile coho salmon were tracked throughout two complete annual cycles to assess basin-wide distribution and movement behavior of this species in a subarctic, ice-bearing catchment.<br>4. Juvenile coho salmon in the Big Lake, Alaska, basin exhibited multiple habitat use and movement strategies across seasons; however, summer rearing in lotic mainstem environments followed by migration to lentic overwinter habitats was identified as a prominent behavior, with two thirds of tracked fish migrating en masse to concentrate in a small subset of upper catchment lakes for the winter. In contrast, the most significant tributary overwintering site (8% of tracked fish) occurred below a culvert and dam blocking juvenile fish passage to a headwater lake, indicating these fish may have been restricted from reaching preferred lentic overwinter habitats.<br>5. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining aquatic connectivity to lentic habitats as a conservation priority for coho salmon during freshwater residency. | | Sethi S.A., W. Larson, K.

Mixtures of DNA from multiple contributors present a novel opportunity to count individuals to inform fish and wildlife ecology. 2. We apply a likelihood based framework to estimate the number of contributors to a DNA mixture for ecological applications. We then assess the performance of DNA mixture estimation through a combination of simulation analyses, laboratory testing, and a field trial to estimate fish predation rates from stomach content analysis. 3. Simulations indicated reasonably sized genetic marker panels could estimate the number of contributors to mixtures comprised of up to 10 individuals, with potential to resolve larger mixtures with additional markers. Mixture estimates demonstrated robustness to common genotyping errors associated with fish and wildlife genetics applications. Laboratory trials demonstrated that DNA combined from multiple yellow perch (Perca flavescens) could be successfully genotyped with a 14-loci microsatellite panel and led to successful estimation for up to 5-contributor mixtures. Stomach content analysis with DNA mixtures indicated a 5-fold increase in estimated predation rates of yellow perch by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) relative to conventional visual assessment of diet contents which can miss partially digested prey items. 4. DNA mixtures have potential to expand applications of count-based ecological analyses. Technical challenges in generating genotypes from DNA mixtures may initially limit their use, however, advances in next generation genotyping platforms are anticipated to surmount these obstacles. Chiefly, we envision opportunity for DNA mixtures to advance eDNA analysis beyond presence/absence based inference to enumeration of specimens. | | Setash, C. M., W. L. Kendall, and D. Olson. 2020.

We developed an optimality landscape and mechanistic territory model for gray wolves (<i>Canis lupus</i>) to understand mechanisms driving space use and how wolves structure territories. In the model, simulated packs selected territories to economically meet resource requirements by selecting patches with greatest net value, accounting for benefits, costs, and tradeoffs of defending and using space on the optimality landscape. Economical territory selection successfully predicted the population's distribution, territory sizes of packs, and how spatial requirements are influenced by local ecosystems, prey density, competitor density, and human-caused mortality risk. Economical territory selection is a mechanistic bridge between space use and animal distribution on the landscape. This knowledge can inform conservation. | | Sells, S. N., and M. S. Mitchell.

In Review. Predicted connectivity pathways between grizzly bear ecosystems in Western Montana | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/249563803648/None/all) | July 2023 || Habitat and corridor mapping are key components of many conservation programs. Grizzly bear populations in the continental US are fragmented and connectivity among federal recovery areas is a conservation goal. Building on recent work, we modeled movements to predict areas of connectivity, using integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) developed from GPS-collared grizzly bears (F = 46, M = 19) in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE). We applied iSSFs in a >300,000 km<sup>2</sup> area including Bitterroot (BE), and Greater Yellowstone (GYE) Ecosystems. First, we simulated directed movements (randomized shortest paths with 3 levels of exploration) between start and end nodes across populations. Second, we simulated undirected movements from start nodes in the NCDE, CYE, or GYE (no predetermined end nodes). We summarized and binned results as iSSF classes (1 = lowest relative predicted use; 10 = highest relative predicted use) and evaluated predictions using 127 outlier grizzly bear locations. Connectivity pathways were primarily associated with mountainous areas and secondarily with river and stream courses in open valleys. Values at outlier locations indicated good model fit and mean iSSF classes at outlier locations (7.4) and Spearman rank correlations (0.87) were highest for undirected simulations and directed simulations with the highest level of exploration. Our resulting predictive maps will facilitate on-the-ground application of this research for prioritizing habitat conservation, human-bear conflict mitigation, and transportation planning. Additionally, our overall modeling approach has direct utility for myriad species and conservation applications. | | Selch, T.M., S.R. Chipps, B.G. Blackwell, and R.P. Hanten. 2019.

Native tree encroachment is a recognized and long-standing conservation challenge to these landscapes, but its impact is often overlooked due to the slow pace of tree invasions and the positive public perception of trees. Here we show that tree encroachment is a dominant change agent in U.S. rangelands; tree cover has increased by more than 76,000 km2 over 30 years, and more than 25% of U.S. rangelands are now experiencing sustained tree cover expansion. Further, we use machine learning methods to estimate the potential herbaceous production (forage) lost to tree encroachment. Since 1990 roughly 315 Tg of herbaceous biomass has been lost, totaling some $5 billion in foregone revenue to agricultural<br>producers. These results suggest that tree encroachment is similar in scale and magnitude to row-crop conversion, another primary cause of rangeland loss in the U.S. Prioritizing conservation efforts to prevent tree encroachment in rangelands can bolster ecosystem and economic sustainability of these landscapes, particularly among privately-owned lands threatened by land-use conversion. | | Scoggins, M., D.B.

Implementing a veterinary forensics approach to investigate chronic wasting disease at a deer carcass disposal site. Wildlife Disease Association Meeting, Madison, WI, 23-29 July 2022. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/233271988224/None/all) | July 2022 || Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is confirmed in 29 US states, three Canadian provinces, and in Sweden, Norway, Finland, and South Korea. Although its geographic origin is speculative, much of the disease spread in North America over the past seven decades is attributed to human activities that include the movement of live animals and animal carcasses. Given the potential for CWD-causing prions to remain infectious within the environment, the disposal of CWD-positive animal remains, whether from free-ranging or captive sources, can play an important role in the transmission of CWD. Regulatory agencies provide guidance and proper disposal opportunities for the control of CWD in endemic areas and to reduce the risk of introduction to new areas. Upon the discovery of an illegal carcass dumping site associated with a CWD-positive captive cervid facility, we employed a veterinary forensics approach to investigate the existence of CWD-positive materials within the site. Animal remains were examined to determine species, age, sex, relatedness, and CWD status. We utilized advanced anatomic, entomologic, genetic, and prion amplification methods to discover CWD-positive remains across multiple age classes of white-tailed deer. CWD prions were detected via RT-QuIC in 13 of 49 carcass samples with 9 of 13 from fawns, 1 of 13 from a yearling, 2 of 13 from adults, and 1 of 13 from a deer of unknown age. We also identified CWD-positive fly larvae associated with positive remains. Our multi-methods approach provides the foundation for the veterinary forensic investigation of CWD spread by means of cervid carcasses. | | Schuyler, E.M., C. A. Hagen, C. R. Anthony, L. J.

Progression detection of Pseudoloma neurophilia in zebrafish Danio rerio Hamilton by threat to the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) model, as it is the most common infectious agent found in research facilities. This parasite can cause clinical disease, but more importantly is a causative agent of non-protocol induced variation in research utilizing zebrafish as an animal model. In this study, we tracked the progression of infection using PCR and histological diagnostic tests. The first experiment compared the application of diagnostic tools for detection of <i>P. neurophilia</i> and showed that whole-body analysis by qPCR (WB-qPCR) can be a standardized process and is comparable to previously published assays using neural tissue. We also evaluated the course of infection in experimentally infected fish, revealing that WB-qPCR is much more sensitive than histology. the parasite was detectable as early as 4 days post exposure (dpe) with WB-qPCR, whereas it was undetected by histology until 92 dpe. In this study, we also added a second slide for histologic analyses, and this increased detection in our combined data set from experiments from 24% to 26%. | | Schuster, C.J., M.L. Kent, J.

Assays for zebrafish pathogens are continually expanding, however for <i>P. neurophilia</i>, the only diagnostic methods available are through lethal sampling, often requiring euthanasia of the entire population for accurate estimates of prevalence in small populations. Thus, there is a need to develop non-lethal screening methods that are both sensitive and informative. Here, we describe a nonlethal assay to detect <i>Pseudoloma neurophilia</i> in tank water using a previously developed qPCR assay that was adapted to the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform. The assay detected concentrations as low as 77.5 spores/L and was specific for<i> P. neurophilia.</i> The assay was then validated by testing water from five tanks with infected zebrafish over a three-month period. Each tank was tested using three different water sampling methods: water from flowing tanks, static water, or water from static spawning events. Prevalence data and occupancy modeling revealed that samples collected in static conditions were more informative than samples from flow-through conditions, with prevalence of positive samples at 80% or higher compared to 47%, respectively. Prevalence of positive water samples correlated with prevalence of infection in fish, determined by qPCR. | | Schumann, D.A., M.E. Colvin, L.E. Miranda, and D.T.

Wildlife Society Bulletin | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/227262633984/None/all) | June 2023 || California condors (<i>Gymnogyps californianus</i>) are critically endangered and negatively affected by lead poisoning from spent lead-based hunting ammunition. This issue is surrounded by complex policy discussions, multiple mitigation options, and differing stakeholders' values. Because lead poisoning is the primary factor affecting condor population growth, California Fish and Game Commission banned lead hunting ammunition during 2008 in southern California. Another regulation for a statewide lead hunting ammunition ban was adopted in 2013 and fully implemented 2019. Alternatively, Arizona Game and Fish Department instituted an outreach and awareness program encouraging voluntary use of nonlead hunting ammunition in the northern portion of the state during 2005; a similar program was initiated in Utah during 2009 and accelerated in 2012. Given the data linking condor mortality to lead bullet fragments, environmental groups petitioned several federal agencies during 2010-2016 to ban lead hunting ammunition on public lands. Federal agencies declined to regulate lead ammunition and federal courts ruled against petitioner's requests, but advocacy from environmental groups has persisted. Currently, fragmented outreach and awareness programs encouraging voluntary use of nonlead exist around the country with little or no strategic planning. Human health is also an environmental justice issue through ingestion of lead bullet fragments in ground venison from hunter donations of game meat. Evaluating policy effectiveness in the three-state region includes monitoring condor blood lead levels, population status, and hunter awareness of the issue and use of nonlead hunting ammunition. | | Schultz, J.H., S.A.

Lead exposure persists for bald eagles due to bullet fragments in game animal gut piles and unretrieved carcasses, and is also a human health risk when venison is procured using lead ammunition. Programs encouraging the voluntary use of nonlead ammunition have become a popular approach mitigating these effects. This study explored attitudes and experiences of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) staff implementing an outreach program encouraging deer hunters to voluntary use nonlead ammunition on 54 National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in the Upper Midwest U.S. to understand factors affecting program implementation by field staff. During 2017-2019, we conducted 29 semi-structured interviews of FWS staff along with 365 responses from an open-ended question on an online survey. Twelve themes emerged from the data and grouped into three broad categories: (1) challenges of dealing with complex issues, (2) importance of messengers and messages, and (3) push-back from staff. Challenges of dealing with complex included administrative restraint and uncertainty, scope and scale of program, human health not an agency responsibility, contextual political influences, and public-private collaborations. Importance of messengers and messages included the importance of experience, and salience of human health risk. Finally, push-back from staff included skepticism of the science and motives behind the program, competing priorities for refuge staff, differing perceptions of regulatory and voluntary approaches, cost and availability of nonlead ammunition, and disregard by some about lead ammunition and human health risks. These findings suggest staff identified numerous challenges implementing a voluntary nonlead ammunition program, many of which are external factors beyond the control of the participants. Understanding the factors and their influence on program implementation may help guide a more rigorous program evaluation examining long-term efforts encouraging the voluntary use of nonlead ammunition by deer hunters. | | Schultz, J.H., S.A.

This paper analyzes some factors influencing program support among USFWS staff in 2017 and 2018, including the use of nonlead ammunition and lead poisoning in wildlife. Results from pooled multiple imputation showed attitudes toward eagles' lead risk and importance of informational materials had the strongest effect on program support, followed by an individual's innovation score. Although previous studies have focused on influencing hunter behavior, our research explored attributes among staff and their support for the outreach program. To enhance program support, different types of staff training might be necessary, depending on perceived eagles' lead risk, importance of informational materials, and individuals' innovativeness. Implications of these findings are discussed. | | J.A. Jenks, R.W. and cause-specific mortality in a semi-protected deer population. Journal of Wildlife Management.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging infectious disease of concern because of the potential for substantial negative effects on populations of cervids. Variability in the likelihood that CWD is detected could invalidate traditional estimators for prevalence. In some instances, deer located after death cannot be tested for infectious diseases, including CWD, because of lack of availability or condition of appropriate tissues. We used various methods to detect infectious diseases that could cause mortality for deer Odocoileus spp. residing in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA, and we report survival estimates for animals in this population. We included 34 monthly encounters of deer resightings and 67 mortalities. We tested live deer by tonsillar biopsy for CWD and estimated pooled prevalence (mean \u00b1 SE) at 5.6 \u00b1 3.0% over the three-year study. Live deer potentially had exposure to several infectious diseases, including bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, bovine viral diarrhea, West Nile virus, and malignant catarrhal fever, but no apparent morbidity or mortality from those diseases. We tested survival and influence of covariates, including age and sex, using known-fate analysis in Program MARK. Those data best supported a model with time-invariant encounter probability and an annual survival of 72.8%. Even without direct pressure from hunting within the park, average life expectancy in this population was 3.2 years. Only 68% of mortalities contained sufficient material for CWD sampling (because of predation and scavenger activity) and >42% of these were CWD-positive. These findings underscore the possible biases in postmortem surveillance estimates of disease prevalence because of potential for subclinical infected animals to be removed by predators and not tested. | | Schroeder,S.

In particular, we wanted to examine how stakeholder group, ideology, and wildlife value orientation influenced trust in a SWMA. Data were derived from a study of state residents, hunters and livestock producers related to wolf management. Results suggest differences in agency trust correlated with all three factors and the interaction between stakeholder group and wildlife value orientation. Livestock producers reported lower levels of trust in the agency, compared to hunters and the general public. Individuals with conservative or middle-of-the-road ideologies reported less trust in the agency than liberals did. Respondents with traditional wildlife values also had less trust in the agency compared to mutualist, pluralist, and distanced respondents. Results suggested parallels in the ideologies and wildlife value orientations of livestock producers and hunters, although these groups differed significantly in their trust in the agency. Agencies face the challenge of managing common-pool resources for stakeholders who hold different values and ideologies, and who are differentially affected by management decisions. | | Schroeder, S.A., A.

The transactional stress coping model has been used to examine response to social conditions (e.g., conflict, crowding) in outdoor recreation. Building on this work, we explored how Minnesota deer hunters coped with the presence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in the state. Results are based on a survey of 2018 firearm deer hunters. We examined hunters' reported behavioral intentions in scenarios related to the presence of CWD, and if the disease affected human health. Results suggest that most hunters would cope using product shift (i.e., eating meat after a \"CWD not detected\" test result) rather than displacement (i.e. hunting elsewhere or not hunting). Hunters who may cope by quitting hunting reported lower levels of involvement and higher levels of concern about CWD. Results have implications for CWD management in the state. | | Schroeder, S., L.

Using data from a mail survey about wolves, we explored relationships among seven identities (i.e., wolf advocate, hunter, environmentalist, nature enthusiast, farmer, trapper, conservationist) using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA). We examined how identities correlated with political orientation, trust in a wildlife management agency, wildlife value orientations (WVOs) and attitudes about wolves, and we evaluated whether WVOs mediated the relationship between identities and attitudes. PCA suggested two factors, while MDS and correlations found diversity beyond these factors. Hunter identity was most strongly associated with a domination WVO and conservative political ideology. Farmer identity was most strongly associated with agency distrust and negative wolf attitudes. Wolf advocate was most strongly associated with a mutualism WVO, agency trust, and positive wolf attitudes. Conservationist identity was positively correlated with all other identities. WVOs partially mediated the relationship between identities and attitudes. | | Scholl, E. A., W. F. Cross, and C. S. Guy. 2022.

Information on home range, nightly movements, and habitat selection, is important for informing rabies management decisions such as the placement of oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits and for management of the species. Our aim was to obtain baseline ecological information with an emphasis on spatial ecology of urban striped skunks in the Northern Great Plains region that is lacking in the literature. We used radio telemetry to track 22 (4 M, 18 F) skunks from September 2016 to November 2016 and March 2017 to November 2017. Size of home range using kernel density estimation with smoothing by least squares cross validation identified males (x = 4.36 km2, SE \u00b1 0.79) had larger home ranges than females (x = 1.79 km2, SE \u00b1 0.24). Female skunk home ranges differed by season with the largest home ranges found in summer 2017. However, rate of nightly movements (m/hr) among female skunks did not differ within seasons (x = 184.79 m/hr, SE \u00b1 0.53). Moreover, we found no evidence that use-availability was associated with habitat type among female skunks. The strongest predictor of habitat use was distance to water sources with female skunks more likely to be found closer to this habitat type; however, we found no association of use with road factors and geographic location within the study area. Targeting ORV efforts in areas near water may be warranted, but considering differences in habitat selection for skunk in urban areas, we caution that ORV baiting programs may not be one-size-fits-all, and a framework for effective bait placement would be most successful with studies similar to ours conducted beforehand. | | Schmidt, J.S., L.A., Bruckerhoff, H., Salehabadi, and J., Wang. 2022.

Conventional distance sampling (CDS) and its extensions (markrecapture distance sampling [MRDS], temporary emigration distance sampling [TEDS]) are popular approaches for producing unbiased estimators of wildlife abundance. However, despite extensive discussion and development of distance sampling theory in the literature, deciding which of these alternatives is most appropriate for a particular scenario can be confusing. Some of this confusion may stem from an incomplete understanding of how each approach addresses the components of the detection process. Here we describe the proper application of CDS, MRDS, and TEDS approaches and use applied examples to help clarify their differing assumptions with respect to the components of the detection process. To further aid the practitioner, we summarize the differences in a decision tree that can be used to identify cases where a more complex alternative (e.g., MRDS or TEDS) may be appropriate for a given survey application. Although the more complex approaches can account for additional sources of bias, in practical applications one also must consider estimator precision. Therefore, we also review the concept of total estimator error in the context of comparing competing methods for a given application to aid in the selection of the most appropriate distance sampling approach. Finally, we detail how the use of more advanced techniques (i.e., informed priors, openpopulation distance sampling models, and integrated modeling approaches) can further reduce total estimator error by leveraging information from existing and ongoing data collection .By synthesizing the existing literature on CDS, MRDS, TEDS and their extensions, in conjunction with the concepts of total estimator error and the components of the detection process, we provide a comprehensive guide that can be used by the practitioner to more efficiently, effectively, and appropriately apply distance sampling in a variety of settings. | | Schmidt, J.H., T.L.

Despite the focus of contemporary wildlife science on developing methods to improve inference from wildlife surveys, legacy datasets often rely on index counts that lack information about the detection process. Data integration can be a useful tool for combining index counts with data collected under more rigorous designs (i.e., designs that account for the detection process), but care is required when datasets represent different population processes or are mismatched in space and time. This can be particularly problematic in cases where animals aggregate in response to a spatially or temporally limited resource because individuals may temporarily immigrate from outside the study area and be included in the abundance index. Abundance indices based on brown bear (<i>Ursus arctos</i>) feeding aggregations within coastal meadows in early summer in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA, are one such example. These indices reflect the target population (brown bears residing within the park) and temporary immigrants (i.e., bears drawn from outside the park boundary). To properly account for the effects of temporary immigration, we integrated the index data with abundance data collected via park-wide distance sampling surveys, the latter of which properly addressed the detection process. By assuming that the distance data provide inference on abundance and the index counts represent some combination of abundance and temporary immigration processes, we were able to decompose the relative contribution of each to overall trend. We estimated that the density of brown bears within our study area was 38-54 adults/1,000 km<sup>2</sup> during 2003-2019 and that abundance increased at a rate of approximately 1.4%/year. The contribution of temporary immigrants to overall trend in the index was low, so we created 3 hypothetical scenarios to more fully demonstrate how the integrated approach could be useful in situations where the composite trend in meadow counts may obscure trends in abundance (e.g., opposing trends in abundance and temporary immigration). Our work represents a conceptual advance supporting the integration of legacy index data with more rigorous data streams and is broadly applicable in cases where trends in index values may represent a mixture of population processes. | | Schmidt, J.H., J.

While discrete mortality events provide clear evidence of direct impacts, indirect pathways are more difficult to assess but may play important roles in population and ecosystem dynamics. Here, we use multi-state occupancy models to analyze a long-term dataset on nesting bald eagles in south-central Alaska with the goal of identifying both direct and indirect mechanisms influencing reproductive output in this apex predator. We found that the probabilities of both nest occupancy and success were higher in the portion of the study area where water turbidity was low, supporting the hypothesis that access to aquatic prey is a critical factor limiting the reproductive output of eagles in this system. As expected, nest success was also positively related to salmon abundance; however, the negative effect of spring warmth suggested that access to salmon resources is indirectly diminished in warm springs as a consequence of increased glacial melt. Together, these findings reveal complex interrelationships between a critical prey resource and large-scale weather and climate processes which likely alter the accessibility of resources rather than directly affecting resource abundance. While important for understanding bald eagle reproductive dynamics in this system specifically, our results have broader implications that suggest complex interrelationships among system components. | | Schmidt, A.E., G.

Impoundments are a widespread anthropogenic stressor that can negatively impact stream fishes as they alter flow regimes, block movements, and act as fountainheads for the introduction and spread of invasive species. Recent studies, however, have reported the occurrence and reproduction of native fishes in impoundments, suggesting they might benefit some native fishes. Our primary objective was to evaluate whether impoundment construction has led to changes in fish community structure in prairie streams. To accomplish this, we compared fish occupancy in small impoundments (,5 ha) to temporal trends in stream occupancy among species to test whether species' increases in stream occupancy were related to their occupancy in impoundments. We examined stream fish communities in the Upper Cottonwood River basin, Kansas, from 1948-2018, and sampled small impoundments in 2016 and 2017. A third (32%) of fish communities in impoundments were similar to stream assemblages, whereas most impoundments (68%) were dominated by sport or bait fishes. In streams, six species showed increases in occupancy and four species showed decreases since small impoundment construction. Of the species that exhibited increased stream occupancy, five showed a positive, logistical relationship between a species' impoundment occupancy and its increase in stream occupancy. Species declining in stream occupancy experienced continued linear declines and may still be declining. Our research suggests stream fish communities have changed since impoundment construction, and are associated with locally-invasive, native species reaching a new stable state in streams accompanied by declines in other native stream fish species. | | Ryan, J.E., A.H.

The American Kestrel (<i>Falco sparverius</i>) is a widespread species with two described North American subspecies, (<i>F. s. sparverius </i>and <i>F. s. paulus</i>), the latter in the southeastern United States and the former across the remainder of its distribution. In many parts of their range, American Kestrels have been declining, but it has been difficult to interpret demographic trends without a clearer understanding of gene flow among populations. Here we sequence the first American Kestrel genome and scan the genome of 197 individuals from 12 sampling locations across the range of the two North American subspecies to identify population structure. To validate signatures of population structure and fill in sampling gaps across the breeding range we screen 192 outlier loci in an additional 376 samples from 34 sampling locations. Overall, our analyses support the existence of 5 genetically distinct lineages within American Kestrels\u2014Eastern, Western, Texas, Florida, and Alaska.Interestingly, we find that while our genome-wide genetic data support the existence of previously described subspecies boundaries, genetic differences across the species' range correlate more with putative migratory phenotypes (resident, long-distance, and short-distance migrants) rather than a priori described subspecies boundaries per se. Based on our results, we suggest the resulting five genetic lineages serve as the foundation for American Kestrel conservation and management in the face of future threats. | | Rubenstein, S.*, Peterson, E.*, Christman, P., and Zydlewski, J.

This study was prompted by concern that pinnipeds present within the estuary and lower CR during spring may be detrimentally affecting the recovery of these salmon stocks. Over a five-year period we injected adult salmon with Passive Integrated Transponder Tags as they returned to the estuary. We used these data to fit a mixed effects logistic regression model and identify covariates that influence survival to Bonneville Dam (Rkm 235). Modelling indicated sea lion exposure, the abundance of adult shad (Alosa sapidissima) within the lower Columbia River, and whether or not fish had intact adipose fins all influenced survival. Survival ranged from 0.46 to 0.80 annually over the course of the study and was lowest during the last two years. | | Royle JA and SJ Converse. 2020. Estimating abundance from capture-recapture data.

Research efforts have focused on the effects of winter tick infestation on moose survival and reproduction, but stress and nutritional responses to ticks and other stressors remain understudied. We examined the influence of several environmental factors on moose calf stress hormone metabolite concentrations and nutritional restriction in Vermont, USA. We collected 407 fecal and 461 snow urine samples from 84 radio-collared moose calves in the winters of 2017-2019 (January-April) to fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) concentrations and urea nitrogen:creatinine (UN:C) ratios. We used generalized mixed-effects models to evaluate the influence of individual condition, winter ticks, habitat, climate and human development on stress and nutrition in calf moose. We then used these physiological data to build generalized linear models to predict calf winter survival. Calf fGCM concentrations increased with nutritional restriction and snow depth during adult winter tick engorgement. Calf UN:C ratios increased in calves with lighter weights and higher tick loads in early winter. Calf UN:C ratios also increased in individuals with home ranges composed of little deciduous forests during adult winter tick engorgement. Our predictive models estimated that winter survival was negatively related to UN:C ratios and positively related to fGCM concentrations, particularly in early winter. By late March, as winter ticks are having their greatest toll and endogenous resources become depleted, we estimated a curvilinear relationship between fGCM concentrations and survival. Our results provide novel evidence linking moose calf stress and nutrition, a problematic parasite and challenging environment and winter survival. Our findings provide a baseline to support the development of non-invasive physiological monitoring for assessing environmental impacts on moose populations. | | Rosenblatt, C.J.

Large-scale projects such as eBird have produced data that have advanced science and contributed to many conservation applications. These projects also provide a means to engage the public in scientific data collection. A common challenge across contributory projects like eBird is to maintain participation, as some volunteers contribute just a few times before disengaging. To maximize contributions and manage an effective program that has broad appeal, it is useful to better understand factors that influence contribution rates. For projects capitalizing on recreation activities (e.g., birding), differences in contribution levels might be explained by the recreation specialization framework, which describes how recreationists vary in skill, behavior, and motives. We paired data from a survey of birders across the United States and Canada with data on their eBird contributions (<i>n</i> = 28,926) to test whether those who contributed most are more specialized birders. We assigned participants to 4 contribution groups based on eBird checklist submissions and compared groups' specialization levels and motivations. More active contribution groups had higher specialization, yet some specialized birders were not active participants. The most distinguishing feature among groups was the behavioral dimension of specialization, with active eBird participants owning specialized equipment and taking frequent trips away from home to bird. Active participants had the strongest achievement motivations for birding (e.g., keeping a life list), whereas all groups had strong appreciation motivations (e.g., enjoying the sights and sounds of birding). Using recreation specialization to characterize eBird participants can help explain why some do not regularly contribute data. Project managers may be able to promote participation, particularly by those who are specialized but not contributing, by appealing to a broader suite of motivations that includes both appreciation and achievement motivations, and thereby increase data for conservation. | | Rosenberry, C.

To reduce Pacific halibut mortality, Bering Sea trawlers that target flatfish have been developing expedited release procedures to sort Pacific halibut from catches earlier than current regulations allow, while continuing accurate bycatch accounting. We studied survival rates of released Pacific halibut from three trawlers by deploying accelerometer-equipped Popup Satellite Archival Tags (PSATs) on 160 fish handled under expedited procedures. PSATs recorded and transmitted two metrics indicating swimming activity for every two hours while attached to the fish for up to 60 days. Analysis of the resulting survival outcomes largely validated current survival estimation methods, based on structured viability assessments, and found longer fish length, shorter air exposure, and shorter trawl tow duration all improved predicted Pacific halibut survival. Differences in these results were detected between vessel trips and species targeted by trawling. PSATs provided detailed data from all tagged fish, while exposing fish to conditions experienced by normal releases. | | Roop, H. J., N. C. Poudyal, and C. A. Jennings. FSP initiated.

In Georgia, the proportion of Whites, which have comprised the largest segment of the recreation resource user base, is declining while the share of other racial groups (i.e., Non-whites) is increasing. Fishery managers benefit by knowing if White anglers differ from Non-white anglers in attributes such as demographic characteristics and fishing behavior and preferences. In this study, we compared the racial differences on angling metrics and other attitudinal variables from an intensively managed fishery. There significant differences between user groups in many of the attributes measured. Differences in demographics, sportfish preference, and harvest-orientated behavior confirm that the White and Non-white anglers constitute two distinct segments of this fishery, and these findings, albeit from one study area, may be applicable to other similar fisheries. | | Roop, H.

While invasive species are known to negatively affect some species and ecosystems, their influences on prey subsidies and effects on recipient consumers are unknown. The green alder sawfly (Monsoma pulveratum) is a recently riparian thin-leaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) stands across southcentral Alaska. To examine the effect of riparian alder defoliation by the larval green alder sawfly on the flow of terrestrial invertebrate prey subsidies to stream salmonids, we sampled 1) terrestrial invertebrate communities on riparian alder foliage, 2) their subsidies to streams, and 3) prey consumption by juvenile Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) along stream reaches with low and high densities of this invasive Hymenopteran. Sawfly biomass peaked mid-summer in all three categories\u2014on riparian alder foliage, as terrestrial subsidies to streams, and ingested by juvenile Coho Salmon. Broader terrestrial invertebrate communities did not decline from sawfly defoliation; instead, invasive sawflies were supplemental prey for juvenile Coho Salmon mid-summer, on top of the background invertebrate subsidy. Our study showed that invasive green alder sawfly defoliation changed terrestrial prey subsidies for these stream fishes, as predicted. Considering that this study was conducted at the early stage of sawfly invasion, the loss of riparian alder is expected to have other ecological consequences that merit further investigation. However, in this case, invasive sawflies did not affect terrestrial subsidies to stream consumers in these study streams in southcentral Alaska. | | Rolls, R.J., J.S. Rogosch, and L.M. Kuehne. 2022.

Range contractions can lead to marked impacts on populations but are usually characterized only by reduction in extent of range. For effective conservation, it is critical to recognize that not all range contractions are the same. We propose three distinct patterns of range contraction: shrinkage, amputation, and fragmentation. We tested the impact of these patterns on populations of a generalist species using forward-time simulations. All three patterns caused 86-88% reduction in population abundance and significantly increased average relatedness, with differing patterns in declines of nucleotide diversity relative to the contraction pattern. The fragmentation pattern resulted in the strongest effects on post-contraction genetic diversity and structure. Defining and quantifying range contraction patterns and their consequences for Earth's biodiversity would provide useful and necessary information to combat biological annihilation. | | Roerick, T.M., J.W.

The diet of many fish larvae is dominated by copepods, small crustaceans that are highly sensitive to hydrodynamic disturbances and possess strong escape responses. We examined how fish larvae with immature jaws, musculature and fins capture such evasive prey. The kinematics of feeding attempts by larval clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) on three developmental were investigated using high-speed videography. A stealthy approach brought the fish larva within ca. 1 mm of the copepod; shortest distances were observed in early larvae (1 5 days post-hatch [dph]) attacking immature copepods. Peak speeds during strikes increased with fish age and copepod developmental stage (150 to 250 mm s-1) with time to capture <8 ms on average. Most successful captures (70%) were of copepods that failed to initiate an escape response during the strike. If a copepod initiated an escape, capture success decreased to ca. 50% for nauplii and copepodites, and 25% for adults. Adult copepods were more likely to attempt an escape response than copepodites or nauplii. Prey stage and the interaction between strike distance and speed were the parameters that best fit a logistic regression model to the observed captures and escapes. The successful switch to larger and more evasive copepod prey by A. ocellaris larvae did not occur until 7 dph and coincided with ontogenetic changes (post-flexion) and a predatory strategy that included shorter approach phases and greater strike speeds. | | Robinson, B.

To be submitted to River Research and Applications. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/220622712832/None/all) | October 2021 || Worldwide, many productive rivers are dam-regulated and rely on flow management strategies that must balance support of ecological processes with human water use. One component of evaluating this balance is to understand ecological consequences of alternative flow management strategies, which has often been accomplished by coupling population dynamics models with models that relate streamflow to habitat availability and quality. Numerous methods assign habitat availability to locations within a river basin: these include fine-scale field-measured values that are extrapolated to other locations within the basin having similar physical characteristics, or equation-driven values created by functions of model-predicted values of physical characteristics. The array of options for creating habitat models is evolving rapidly as high-resolution remote sensing data becomes more accessible and computational capacity improves. Our objective was to identify tradeoffs among approaches that assign habitat relationships to large rivers, and to create a decision support tool to supplement choices of extent and granularity. Using a selection of case studies that represent a breadth of scales and diverse tradeoffs, we demonstrate the need for a transparent process of data evaluation and assessment to determine the appropriate fit for model scope or context that best supports management needs and recognize sources of uncertainty. The structured approach proposed here aims to improve future model development and refine population dynamics models that inform management of rivers. | | Robertson, M. D., S. R. Midway, H. S.

We partnered with the Sage Grouse and Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiatives and the Nebraska Natural Legacy Project to demonstrate the ability of these new datasets to quantify multi-scale changes and heterogeneity in plant biomass following mechanical tree removal, prescribed fire, and prescribed grazing. In Oregon's sagebrush steppe, for example, juniper tree removal resulted in a 21% increase in one pasture's productivity and an 18% decline in another. In Nebraska's Loess Canyons, perennial grass productivity initially declined 80% at sites invaded by trees that were prescriptively burned, but then fully recovered post-fire, representing a 492% increase from nadir. plant 4-fold (966,809 kg/ha) in pastures that were prescriptively grazed, with gains highly dependent upon precipitation as evidenced by sensitivity of remotely sensed estimates (SD \u00b1951,308 kg/ha).

We do this by tracking 46 years of avian spatial regime movement in the North American Great Plains. The northernmost spatial regime boundary moved >590 km northward, and the southernmost boundary moved >260 km northward.

In the Loess Canyons ecoregion of the Great Plains, USA, an association of private ranchers and natural resource agencies has led a multi-decadal, ecoregion-scale initiative to combat the continued loss of grasslands to woody plant encroachment by restoring large-scale fire regimes. Here, we use 14 years of fire treatment history with 6 years of grassland bird monitoring and remotely-sensed tree cover data across 136,767 hectares of privately-owned grassland to quantify outcomes of large-scale restoration efforts. Grassland bird richness increased across 65% (90,032 ha) of the Loess Canyons, and woody plant cover decreased up to 55% across 25% (7,408 ha) of all fire-treated areas. This was accomplished with extreme fire treatments that killed mature trees, were large (mean annual area burned was 3,100 ha), spatially clustered, and straddled boundaries between invasive woodlands and remaining grasslands\u2014not heavily-infested woodlands. Findings from this study provide the first evidence of human management reversing the impacts of woody encroachment on grassland birds at an ecoregion scale. | | Roberts, C. P., Donovan, V.

We sought to quantify the characteristics and persistence of material legacies (e.g., biotic residuals of disturbance) that arise from variation in fire severity in an eastern ponderosa pine forest in North America. We compared forest stand structure and understory woody plant and bird community composition and species richness across unburned, low, moderate, and highseverity burn patches in a 27yearold mixedseverity wildfire that had received minimal postfire management. We identified distinct tree densities (high: 14.3 \u00b1 7.4 trees per ha, 1.6% cover per 30 m low: 2.3 \u00b1 0.4) among burn severities. Understory woody plant communities differed between highseverity patches, moderate and lowseverity patches, and unburned patches (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Bird communities differed between high and moderateseverity patches, lowseverity patches, and unburned patches (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Bird species richness varied across burn severities: lowseverity patches had the highest (5.29 \u00b1 1.44) and highseverity patches had the lowest (2.87 \u00b1 0.72). Understory woody plant richness was highest in unburned (5.93 \u00b1 1.10) and highseverity (5.07 \u00b1 1.17) patches, and it was lower in moderate (3.43 \u00b1 1.17) and lowseverity (3.43 \u00b1 1.06) patches. We show material fire legacies persisted decades after the mixedseverity wildfire in eastern ponderosa forest, fostering distinct structures, communities, and species in burned versus unburned patches and across fire severities.

New methods enable tracking spatial regime boundaries via vegetation landcover data, and this approach is being used for strategic management across biomes. A clear advancement would be incorporating animal community data to track spatial regime boundaries alongside vegetation data. In a 41,170-hectare grassland experiencing woody plant encroachment, we test the utility of using animal community data to track spatial regimes via two hypotheses. (H1) Spatial regime boundaries identified via independent vegetation and animal datasets will exhibit spatial synchrony; specifically, grassland:woodland bird community boundaries will synchronize with grass:woody vegetation boundaries. (H2) Negative feedbacks will stabilize spatial regimes identified via animal data; specifically, frequent fire treatments will stabilize grassland bird community boundaries. We used 26 years of bird community and vegetation data alongside 32 years of fire history data. We identified spatial regime boundaries with bird community data via a wombling approach. We identified spatial regime boundaries with vegetation data by calculating spatial covariance between remotely-sensed grass and woody plant cover per pixel. For fire history data, we calculated the cumulative number of fires per pixel. Setting bird boundary strength (wombling <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> values) as the response variable, we tested our hypotheses with a hierarchical generalized additive model (HGAM). Both hypotheses were supported: animal boundaries synchronized with vegetation boundaries in space and time, and grassland bird communities stabilized as fire frequency increased (HGAM explained 38% of deviance). We can now track spatial regimes via animal community data pixel-by-pixel and year-by-year. Alongside vegetation boundary tracking, tracking animal community boundaries can inform the scale of management necessary to maintain animal communities endemic to desirable ecological states. Our approach will be especially useful for conserving animal communities requiring large-scale, unfragmented landscapes\u2014like grasslands and steppes. | | Robb, B. et al.

Here we estimated the effect of nine abiotic and biotic factors on local occupancy and an index of abundance (few or chorus) for four amphibian species (<i>Eleutherodactylus wightmanae</i>, <i>E. brittoni</i>, <i>E. antillensis,</i> and <i>E. coqui</i>) in Puerto Rico, USA. We also assessed how the same factors influenced reproductive activity of <i>E. coqui</i> and how species responded to hurricane Mar\u00eda (20 September 2017). As predicted, occupancy and abundance of <i>E. wightmanae</i>, <i>E. brittoni</i> and <i>E. coqui</i> were positively and strongly influenced by abiotic covariates (e.g., relative humidity) that characterize high elevation, mesic habitats. <i>E. antillensis</i> exhibited the opposite pattern, with highest probabilities (0.6) recorded at 300 m and with average relative humidity <75%. Biotic covariates (e.g., canopy cover) had a weak influence on both parameters, regardless of species. High probabilities (0.9) of detecting an <i>E. coqui</i> chorus and active nests occurred at sites experiencing average relative humidity of >80% and temperature of 26\u00b0 C. Moderate to high probabilities of detecting a chorus (0.4 - 0.7) were recorded at sites with average temperatures >26\u00b0C, but no reproductive activity was detected, implying that monitoring abundance alone could misrepresent the capacity of a local population to sustain itself. The possibility underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between local demographic and environmental parameters in the advent of global warming to help guide monitoring and management decisions, especially for high elevation specialists. Hurricanes can inflict marked reductions in population numbers, but impacts vary by location and species. We found that the abundance (chorus) of <i>E. antillensis</i> and <i>E. brittoni</i> increased after the hurricane, but the abundance of the other two species did not differ between years. Lack of impacts was probably mediated by low structural damage to forest tracts (e.g., 9% canopy loss). Our findings help assess habitat suitability in terms of parameters that foster local population growth, which provides a basis for testing spatio-temporal predictions about demographic rates in potential climate refugia and for designing criteria to help guide managed translocations. | | Rivera, S.J., K.M.

We used integrated networks of temperature loggers, PIT-tag antenna stations, and in-situ temperature mapping to investigate thermal hydrodynamics and associated movements of PIT-tagged salmonids at the confluence of Tenderfoot Creek, a major, unaltered coldwater tributary of the Smith River. Contrary to expectations, Tenderfoot Creek itself was not used as a thermal refuge by salmonids during periods of high main-stem water temperatures; rather, its cool outflow into the Smith River was used instead. Mean outflow water temperatures were 2.9 \u00b0C lower than those of the Smith River during summer and ranged from 0.5 \u00b0C to 6.1 \u00b0C less. Moreover, measured and estimated temperatures in the outflow were cooler (by up to 2.8 \u00b0C) than in Tenderfoot Creek itself at times as a result of groundwater upwelling at the confluence. Detections of PIT-tagged fish in the thermal plume increased, especially at night, when daily mean water temperatures exceeded 20\u00b0C in the main stem Smith River; 4 times as many PIT-tagged fish were detected in the plume (<i>N = </i>52) than along the opposite bank (<i>N = </i>12), which ostensibly afforded better cover. Coldwater tributary confluences may provide superior thermal refuges for salmonids\u2014cooler and more secure than the tributaries themselves\u2014when water temperatures in river main stems are stressful. | | Ritenour, K., S.L.King, S.

Oecologia et al._2020_Assessing amphibian disease risk across tropical streams while accounting for imperfect pathogen detect-1.pdf) | [Publisher Website](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32314042/) | December 2020 || Ecologists studying emerging wildlife diseases need to confront the realism of imperfect pathogen detection across heterogeneous habitats to aid in conservation decisions. For example, spatial risk assessments of amphibian disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has largely ignored imperfect pathogen detection across sampling sites. Because changes in pathogenicity and host susceptibility could trigger recurrent population declines, it is imperative to understand how pathogen prevalence and occupancy vary across environmental gradients. Here, we assessed how Bd occurrence, prevalence, and infection intensity in a diverse Neotropical landscape vary across streams in relation to abiotic and biotic predictors using a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for imperfect Bd detection caused by qPCR error. Our model indicated that the number of streams harboring Bd-infected frogs is higher than observed, with Bd likely being present at ~ 43% more streams than it was detected. We found that terrestrial-breeders captured along streams had higher Bd prevalence, but lower infection intensity, than aquatic-breeding species. We found a positive relationship between Bd occupancy probability and stream density, and a negative relationship between Bd occupancy probability and amphibian local richness. Forest cover was a weak predictor of Bd occurrence and infection intensity. Finally, we provide estimates for the minimum number of amphibian captures needed to determine the presence of Bd at a given site where Bd occurs, thus, providing guidence for cost-effective disease risk monitoring programs. | | Rhea, A.

Journal of Ornithology. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/219822714880/None/all) | June 2022 || The young of some altricial bird species hatch asynchronously, sometimes leading to considerable size differences among siblings. Asynchronous hatching may comprise a bet-hedging strategy whereby adults can maximize the probability of successfully fledging at least one young from the nest even when resources are limited. Despite the potential importance of intrabrood variation in nestling size to the breeding strategy of altricial birds, the extent of this phenomenon remains largely unclear for many species. We weighed 453 nestlings from 148 nests of three sympatric, sagebrush-associated songbird species in Wyoming, USA to describe the magnitude of intrabrood size differences for these species. Intrabrood differences in nestling mass were greatest for the largest species, the Sage Thrasher (<i>Oreoscoptes montanus</i>), for which the smallest nestling in a brood was on-average 26.2% smaller than the with the smallest nestling being 17.4% and 18.4% smaller on average than the largest for the two species, respectively. For each additional nestling within a brood, the smallest nestling was an additional 6.6 13.6% smaller than the largest nestling, depending on species. Understanding the extent of intrabrood variation in nestling traits has important implications for the productivity of sensitive species facing increasingly unpredictable environments. | | Reitsma, L.

At the same time, there was growing interest in the use of amphibians as ecological indicators. In the United States, wetland and amphibian monitoring programs were launched in some national parks as a necessary first step to evaluating the status and trends of amphibian populations within some of North America's most protected areas. In Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks, a multi-species amphibian monitoring program was launched by many of the authors in 2006 and continues to this day. This Viewpoint Article serves as a self-evaluation of our journey from conception through implementation of an ongoing, long-term monitoring program. This self-evaluation should provide a framework and guidance for other monitoring programs. We address whether we are fulfilling the program's main objective of describing status and trends of the four amphibian species, discuss how a one-size-fits-all monitoring approach does not serve all species equally, and describe opportunities to bolster our core work using emerging statistical approaches and thoughtful integration of remote sensing and molecular tools. We also describe how the data generated over the program's first 15 years have been useful beyond our initial goal of characterizing status and trend. Notably, our integration of climate datasets has allowed us to describe wetland and species-specific amphibian responses to variations in climate drivers. Documenting climate links to amphibian occurrence and their primary habitats has allowed us to identify which species, habitat types, and subregions within this large, protected landscape are most vulnerable to anticipated climate change. Recognizing that tools and threatschange over time, it will be important to adapt our original monitoring design to maximize opportunities and use of resulting information. Maintaining engagement by multiple stakeholders and expanding our funding portfolio will also be necessary to sustain our program into the future. Finally, collaboration has become standard for longterm, cross-jurisdictional, landscape-scale monitoring. We argue that collaborative monitoring facilitates resource sharing, leveraging of limited funds, completion of work, and mutual learning. Such collaboration also increases the efficacy of conservation. | | Rashel, R.H. and Pati\u00f1o, R. 2019.

Species distribution models (SDMs) and associated tools have proliferated in the past decades and have proven valuable in evaluating suitability of habitat for species. However, practitioners have yet to fully adopt the potential of SDMs to inform surveys and other conservation efforts for information-limited species. Instead, most efforts rely on expert knowledge and other traditional methods to locate extant populations. In particular, the Species Status Assessment (SSA) framework of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service would benefit from incorporating SDM approaches to facilitate conservation decisions. Here, we describe an SDM approach for at-risk species that would benefit SSAs and similar species conservation efforts. We applied four modeling techniques (generalized additive, maximum entropy, generalized boosted, and weighted ensemble) to recent monitoring data for three at-risk species proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (<i>Papaipema eryngii, Scutellaria ocmulgee, Balduina atropurpurea</i>) in the Southeastern U.S. The ensemble models reduced uncertainty caused by differences among modeling techniques and improved the predictive accuracy of fitted models. Incorporating an ensemble modeling approach into the SSA framework would benefit monitoring efforts and provide more robust status assessments for at-risk species. We emphasize the importance of producing SDM in close collaboration among the stakeholders involved in use of model outputs. | | Ramirez-Reyes, C., F.J. Vilella, K.O. Evans, G. Street, C. Pacheco, O.

This modeling approach can help guide conservation practitioners and inform decisions. Distribution models are particularly relevant for rare species, whose habitat associations are often not well understood. Using species occurrence data, and a variety of predictor variables, we developed three individual distribution models and a weighted ensemble model for the Puerto Rican harlequin butterfly (<i>Atlantea tulita</i>). The ensemble model had the greatest accuracy (AUC = 0.92). Further, the ensemble model indicated 7.1% of the main island of Puerto Rico encompassed suitable habitat for the harlequin butterfly. However, only 0.5% was classified as including the greatest suitability. Using an ensemble modeling approach to delineate areas of the island with suitable environmental conditions may improve habitat conservation efforts for the species. | | Ramirez-Reyes C., G.

The perennial bearded beaksedge (<i>Rhynchospora crinipes</i>) has been found from Mississippi to North Carolina, but known occurrences are limited. Because of the species' apparent rarity, a model to identify areas with a high likelihood of locating additional occurrences will allow conservationists to effectively prioritize and allocate scarce surveying resources. We used known occurrence records, a suite of environmental datasets, and four species distribution modeling techniques (generalized additive, GAM; maximum entropy, MaxEnt; generalized boosted, GBM; and weighted ensemble) to generate maps to inform surveys for <i>R. crinipes</i>. The ensemble approach improved predictive performance (AUC-PR = 0.95) compared to other techniques (individual model AUC-PR ranged from 0.7 to 0.8). We also obtained quantitative insights on the species' habitat relationships, including the likelihood of <i>R. crinipes</i>'s presence near Atlantic white cedar (<i>Chamaecyparis thyoides</i>) habitat and floodplains, which is consistent with prior field observations. The ensemble model indicated that 3.6% of the study area could be suitable habitat, but only 0.38% had high suitability. Small stream riparian habitats and Atlantic swamp forests in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia had the highest proportion of suitable areas. Prioritizing surveys in areas with model-indicated high habitat suitability is expected to reveal additional <i>R. crinipes</i> occurrences. We suggest surveying efforts for other at-risk species may benefit from using an ensemble modeling approach to identify and prioritize survey areas and improve ecological knowledge of these species. | | Radigan, W.

Interpretation of these trends is complicated by the many possible contributing factors, including short time series, data comprising a mix of stocks, and varying gear types. Here, we present data on the mass of individual Chinook salmon, <i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>, caught in the winter from 1946 to 2019 in central Puget Sound, Washington by participants in what may be the longest running salmon derby in North America, the Tengu Derby. In this annual recreational fishing competition, established by Japanese-Americans immediately after release from internment camps at the end of World War II, participants follow strict gear, area, and methods regulations, and catch almost exclusively salmon originating from and remaining in Puget Sound. Records revealed an overall decline in fish mass over the decades with a high degree of variability throughout the time series. Specifically, resident Chinook salmon exhibited several shifts, including an increase in size from a high in the 1950s to a low around 1980, followed by an increase to another high around 1990, and then a decline over the most recent 30 years. These salmon, displaying a form of differential migration by remaining in Puget Sound rather than migrating to the ocean coast, showed dissimilar trajectories compared with size trends of Puget Sound Chinook salmon as a whole reported previously. These distinct patterns in size for Chinook salmon from common origins associated with different migration patterns exemplify yet another important factor to be considered in the analysis and interpretation of such trends. | | Quinlan, B.A., J.P.

In Lake Champlain tributaries, Stonecats are listed as endangered in Vermont, but not in New York. Here we describe the growth of Stonecats in two tributaries to Lake Champlain, one in Vermont and one in New York. We also compared the growth of Stonecats in these waters to results from other locations near the middle of their distribution. Stonecats in the Great Chazy River, NY were larger at ages 1-3, but smaller at age 5, than Stonecats from the LaPlatte River, VT. Stonecats in Lake Champlain tributaries were generally larger at age than those from the middle of their range, except for those from Lake Erie. Lake Champlain Stonecats appear to reach maturity by age 3, though future research that directly estimates age at maturity would be more informative. These results expand the literature that lacks information about growth of this species while also providing specific information needed to manage this and other fishes in Lake Champlain tributaries. | | Prude, C.H. and J.W.

Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 2020:1-11. DOI: 1. Fisheries bycatch of non- target species in the commercial fleet is a major source of anthropogenic injury and mortality for sea turtles and marine megafauna. 2. The R\u00edo de la Plata, Maritime Front (RLPMF) and its adjacent international waters - comprising part of the Argentine and Uruguayan exclusive economic zones (EEZs), is a highly important fishing ground in the South-western Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) as well as feeding and development grounds for sea turtles. 3. This paper analyses the distribution of the bottom and pelagic trawling fishery within the RLPMF using information from Vessel Satellite Monitoring System (VMS). With this information, areas of highest trawling intensity were defined and further evaluated their overlap with sea turtle habitat-use areas from available sea turtle satellite tracking information.4. Results besides identifying high-susceptibility areas for sea turtle bycatch by the commercial trawler fleet along the RLPMF, provide predictive tools to identify vulnerable areas to interaction of sea turtles and the commercial fishing fleet.5. Implementation of bycatch mitigation measures, such as reduced fishing effort areas by the Argentine and Uruguayan fisheries management agencies has the potential to benefit the fisheries as well as marine megafauna. Furthermore, there is a need for additional research on the impact this fleet can have on sea turtles present in the area. | | Pronkevich, V. V., P. N. Maleko, K. S. Maslovsky, and J. C.

Tropical agroforestry systems offer a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture by providing food for production while also supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services. Previous studies have shown that these systems may even improve crop pollination, but the mechanisms of how these improvements occur are still poorly understood. Using coffee as a focal crop, we explored how microclimatic conditions affected nectar traits (sugar and caffeine concentration) important for pollinator visitation. We also studied how microclimate, floral traits, floral availability at the coffee plant level, availability of floral resources provided by other plant species in the agroecosystem (\"neighborhood floral availability\"), and the presence of other bees affected the amount of time bees spent foraging on coffee flowers and the proportion of coffee pollen carried on their bodies. We explored these factors using the two dominant coffee species farmed on Puerto Rico, <i>Coffea canephora</i> and <i>C. arabica</i>, under sun and shade management.<i> </i>We found that high nectar sugar concentration and temperature were important predictors of short floral visits (<15 seconds), while increased numbers of bees and open coffee flowers were important predictors of longer floral visits (16-180 seconds). High nectar caffeine concentration was an important predictor of longer visits on <i>C. arabica </i>flowers while the opposite was observed for <i>C. canephora </i>flowers. For both species, high coffee floral availability was the main predicting factor for the proportion of coffee pollen on the bees' bodies. Surprisingly, neither neighborhood floral availability nor the type of coffee plantation (agroforest/shade or sun) were important predictors of bee visitation. These results suggest non-coffee flowering plants in coffee plantations were neither competitors nor facilitators of coffee plants for pollinators. Additionally, most of the bees surveyed were carrying 80% pollen from one species (<i>C. arabica </i>or <i>C. canephora</i>), likely resulting in little heterospecific pollen deposition between <i>Coffea</i> and non-<i>Coffea</i> flowers. Shade trees in coffee plantations do not detract from pollinator visitation to coffee flowers, suggesting that the provision of multiple ecological and wildlife conservation benefits by shade trees is not in conflict with a grower's ability to maximize the benefits of insect pollination on fruit production. | | Powers, K.E., M.T.

Some institutions still use ventilators that were available prior to the advent of hyperbaric-specific units, such as the Uni-Vent Eagle Model model 754. Here we examine the performance of the Uni-Vent model 754 under hyperbaric conditions and investigate concerns of an oxygen leak in the ventilator housing, which poses a fire risk. We studied the ventilator at 1.0, 2.4 and 2.8 ATA in assist control mode using a Michigan test lung and a variety of tidal volumes and respiratory rates. We recorded the delivered volumes, peak pressures, and oxygen percentages within the hyperbaric chamber at 2.4 and 2.8 ATA and within the ventilator housing. At those pressures the ventilator delivered approximately 25% less volume than at 1.0 ATA. We observed breath stacking at high respiratory rates, but this was blunted at both 2.4 and 2.8 ATA. Oxygen levels did not rise in the housing during our investigation. In addition, we fit a linear regression to the data comparing set tidal volumes and delivered tidal volumes in order to model the changes observed. Hyperbaric conditions caused decreased delivered tidal volumes in a depth-dependent fashion, and oxygen levels within the housing did not rise. The Uni-Vent Eagle model 754 performed safely and effectively at depth but requires spirometry to correctly program desired ventilator settings. | | Poole, A. S., T. M. Koel, N. A. Thomas, and A. V.

However, survival of embryonic and larval life history stages can have profound effects on population dynamics of Lake Trout. Inducing additional mortality at those stages, especially if used in concert with intensive gillnetting of older fish, could enhance overall suppression efforts. Therefore, we conducted controlled field experiments at Yellowstone Lake to systematically evaluate the effects of sediment deposition and ground Lake Trout carcass deposition on Lake Trout embryos in prepositioned incubators. Sediment deposition caused dissolved oxygen concentrations to decline below lethal levels for a prolonged period (92 d) overwinter. Embryo mortality among overwintering incubators varied from 97 \u00b1 5.3% at the substrate surface to 100 \u00b1 0.0% 20 cm below the substrate surface. Decomposition of ground carcass material on spawning sites caused dissolved oxygen concentrations to decline to lethal levels (<3.4 mg/L) for about 9 days following biomass application rates of 14 and 28 kg/m2 in treatment plots. Exposure to ground carcass material resulted in 100 \u00b1 0.0% (mean \u00b1 SE) embryo mortality at the substrate surface and within interstices 20 cm below the surface in 14 and 28 kg/m2 biomass treatments. Embryo mortality was probably caused by hypoxic conditions within substrates in both experiments. The deposition of sediment and ground Lake Trout carcass material on Lake Trout spawning sites in Yellowstone Lake could provide an additional source of mortality in ongoing Lake Trout suppression efforts. These methods may also be beneficial in other systems when incorporated in an integrated pest management approach (IPM) targeting multiple life history stages of invasive freshwater fish. | | Poole, A.

To correct for this bias, we evaluated the current detection probability across the Black Hills during January and February 2009-2011 using radio-collared elk. We used logistic regression to evaluate topographic features, habitat characteristics, and group characteristics relative to their influence on detection probability of elk. Elk detection probability increased with less vegetation cover (%), increased group size, and more snow cover (%); overall detection probability was 0.60 (95% CI 0.52-0.68), with 91 of 152 elk groups detected. Predictive capability of the selected model was excellent (ROC = 0.807), and prediction accuracy ranged from 70.2% to 73.7%. Cross-validation of the selected model with other population estimation methods resulted in comparable estimates. Future applications of our model should be applied cautiously if characteristics of the area (e.g., vegetation cover >50%, snow cover >90%, group sizes >16 elk) differ notably from the range of variability in these factors under which the model was developed. | | Pfab, F., DiRenzo, G.

Decision sciences have developed approaches and tools that can be used to break down difficult water management decisions into their composite parts. An essential aspect of these approaches is the use of quantitative models to evaluate alternative management strategies. Here, we describe four integrated decision support models for evaluating the effect of flows on two life history stages of Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) and Steelhead trout (<i>O. mykiss</i>). We then use constrained nonlinear optimization to identify optimal flow regimes for the water year type with the least available water. These flow regimes were then used by managers to develop candidate minimum flow strategies that were evaluated using forward simulation and sensitivity analyses. We found that optimal flow regimes differed markedly from existing regulations and varied among species and life history stages. However, evaluation of tradeoffs among the four competing objectives indicated relatively minimal losses for most objectives when the optimal flows were based on equally weighting the objectives. Sensitivity analysis indicated that water temperature was the primary driver of estimated outcomes and suggested that managers consider alternative means of managing temperatures. Decision sciences have created multiple analytical tools and approaches that simplify complex problems, such as water resource management and we believe that water resource management would benefit from their increased use. | | Peterson, J.T. and M.F.

These restoration strategies are often diverse and have been met with mixed success. In this paper, we describe the Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) decision-support models developed by the Central Valley Project Improvement Act Science Integration Team as part of a larger structured decision making effort aimed at maximizing natural adult production of Chinook salmon in California's Central Valley, USA. We then describe the decision analytic tools the stakeholder group used to solve the models and explore model results, including stochastic dynamic programming, forward simulation, proportional scoring, relative loss, expected value of perfect information, response profile analyses, and indifference curves. Using these tools, the stakeholder group was able to develop and quantitatively evaluate restoration strategies for multiple Chinook salmon runs simultaneously, a first for the restoration program. Furthermore, information uncovered during this process was then used to direct efforts towards targeted research/monitoring to reduce critical uncertainties and make better restoration decisions moving forward. The decision sciences have established a wide range of analytical tools and approaches to simplify complex problems into key components, and we believe the concepts described in this paper are of great interest to many restoration practitioners that undoubtedly face similar difficulties when implementing restoration strategies for complex systems. | | Peterson, J.M., J.E.

Effective conservation and restoration of desert riverscapes requires conservation and restoration of in-stream flows with rehabilitation approaches tailored to water availability. Invited: Frontiers in Environmental Desert riverscape restoration practitioners must contend with compounding effects of increasing human water demand, persistent drought, nonnative species establishment, and climate change, which further stress desert riverine ecosystems such as rivers in the Colorado River basin, USA. Herein, we provide our perspective on the importance of natural flows, large floods in particular, for successful conservation and restoration of riverscapes. We present ideas developed from our experience with restoration projects across multiple desert tributary rivers with varying levels of habitat degradation and water abstraction. We propose broad-scale measures such as protection of in-stream flows, tailoring restoration efforts to available annual water availability, and working with nature using low-tech process-based techniques to more completely address the mechanisms of habitat degradation, such as flow reduction and vegetation-induced channel narrowing. Traditionally, restoration efforts in the Colorado River basin take place at relatively fine-scales, at convenient locations and, largely focus on reducing nonnative plant and fish species. We suggest that we need to think more broadly and creatively, and that conservation or restoration of natural flow regimes is crucial to long-term success of almost all management efforts for both in-stream and riparian communities. | | Pennock, C.A. and Bruckerhoff, L.A., 2020.

Failure to achieve recommended environmental flows coincides with declining fish populations: Long-term trends in regulated and unregulated rivers. || Dams can be operated to mimic components of the natural flow regime to minimize impacts on downstream ecosystems. However, infrastructure, societal needs, and watershed runoff constrain which and when flow regime attributes can be mimicked. We compared fish assemblage responses, including native and nonnative species, over two decades of managed environmental flows to those in a river retaining a relatively natural flow regime. Both of these arid-land rivers are within the Colorado River basin and have experienced declines in watershed runoff over the past twenty years. We predicted fish-flow relationships would be conserved across time and between managed and unmanaged rivers. Declines in flow in both rivers coincided with declines in some native fishes, and more native and nonnative fish species exhibited declines in the managed river than in the unmanaged river. Our ability to detect previously documented native fish-flow relationships diminished in the managed river system because established environmental flow targets were not met due to water management, but we detected these fish-flow relationships in the unmanaged river. Our results suggest declining watershed runoff and increased consumptive water use could reduce the effectiveness of environmental flows that have lower priority in most years. | | Pennock, C., P.

Presently, understanding spatial ecology of Shortnose Sturgeon is based on observations from a limited number Atlantic coastal rivers. To better understand Shortnose Sturgeon in the Hudson River in NY, USA, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize seasonal habitat use and to identify regions of the river where seasonal sturgeon activity occurred. From 2012-2016, 101 adult fish were tagged and tracked from 2012-2016 and sturgeon detection per unit effort (a metric of fish observation standardized by search effort) was evaluated against benthic habitat variables using generalized additive regression models. Models indicated strong habitat associations in the Spring season defined by gravel dominated substrates and specific depth ranges, presumably associated with spawning activity. During Summer, sturgeon were more dispersed associating with muddy habitats, whereas, in Fall/Winter sturgeon congregated in specific regions of the river. These data demonstrate river use and habitat associations vary seasonally and identify important areas for managing overlap between seasonal sturgeon habitat use and human activity on the river. | | Pease, B., K.

Scenario studies can offer the structure and perspective needed to understand the impacts of change and help inform management and conservation decisions. We implemented a scenario-based approach to assess how two high impact drivers of landscape change influence the distributions of managed wildlife species (<i>n</i> = 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We used expert derived species distribution models (SDMs) and scenarios developed by the New England Landscape Futures Project (NELFP) to estimate how species distributions change under various trajectories (<i>n</i> = 5) of landscape change. The NELFP scenarios were built around two primary drivers - Socio-Economic Connectedness (SEC) and Natural Resource Planning and Innovation (NRPI) - and provide plausible alternatives for how the New England region may change over 50 years (2010-2060). Our models generally resulted in species occurrence and richness declines by 2060. The majority of species (7 of 10) experienced declines in regional occurrence for all NELFP scenarios, and one species experienced a projected increase in mean regional occurrence for all scenarios. Our results indicate that the NRPI and SEC drivers strongly influenced projected distribution changes compared to baseline projections. NRPI had a greater impact on distribution change for five species (coyote, moose, striped skunk, white-tailed deer, and wild turkey), while SEC had a greater impact on four species (American black bear, bobcat, raccoon, and red fox); one species (gray fox) was equally influenced by both NRPI and SEC. These results emphasize the importance of integrating both natural resource planning and socio-economic factors when addressing issues of distribution change and offer insights that can inform proactive management and conservation planning. | | Pearman-Gillman, S., M.

Understanding where species are likely to occur now and in the future can help identify areas that are resistant to change over time and guide conservation planning. We estimated changes in species distribution patterns and spatial resistance in five future scenarios for the New England region of the northeastern United States. We present scenario-specific distribution change maps for nine harvested wildlife species, identifying regions of increasing, decreasing, or stable habitat suitability within each scenario. Next, we isolated areas where species occurrence probability is high (p > 0.7) and resistant to change across all future scenarios. Resistance was also evaluated relative to current land protection to identify patterns in and out of Protected Areas (PAs). Generally, species distributions declined in area over the 50-year assessment period (2010-2060), with the greatest average declines occurring for moose (-40.9%) and wild turkey (-22.1%). Species resistance varied considerably across the region, with coyote demonstrating the highest average regional resistance (91.81% of the region) and moose demonstrating the lowest (0.76% of the region). At the state level, average focal species resistance was highest in Maine (the largest state) and lowest in Massachusetts. Many of the focal species showed high overlap in resistance and land protection. Coyote, white-tailed deer, and black bear had the highest probability of resistance, given protection, while moose and wild turkey had the highest probability of protection, given resistance. Overall, relatively small portions of New England\u2014ranging between 0.25% and 21.12%-were both protected and resistant for the focal species. Our results provide estimates of resistance that can inform conservation planning for commonly harvested species that are important ecologically, economically, and culturally to the region. Expanding protected area coverage to include resistant areas may provide longer term benefits to these species. | | Pearman-Gillman, S, J. E. Katz, R. Mickey, J. Murdoch, and T. Donovan. 2020.

Unfortunately, empirical data that span large spatial extents across multiple taxa are limited. In this study, we used expert elicitation techniques to develop species distribution models (SDMs) for harvested wildlife species (n = 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We administered an online survey that elicited opinions from wildlife experts on the probability of species occurrence throughout the study region. We collected 3396 probability of occurrence estimates from 46 experts, and used linear mixed-effects methods and landcover variables at multiple spatial extents to develop SDMs. The models were in general agreement with the literature and provided effect sizes for variables that shape species occurrence. With the exception of gray fox, models performed well when validated against crowdsourced empirical data. We applied models to rasters (30 \u00d7 30 m cells) of the New England region to map each species' distribution. Average regional occurrence probability was highest for coyote (0.92) and white-tailed deer (0.89) and lowest for gray fox (0.42) and moose (0.52). We then stacked distribution maps of each species to estimate and map focal species richness. Species richness (<i>s</i>) varied across New England, with highest average richness in the least developed states of Vermont (<i>s</i> = 7.47) and Maine (s = 7.32), and lowest average richness in the most developed states of Rhode Island (s = 6.13) and Massachusetts (s = 6.61). Our expert-based approach provided relatively inexpensive, comprehensive information that would have otherwise been difficult to obtain given the spatial extent and range of species being assessed. The results provide valuable information about the current distribution of wildlife species and offer a means of exploring how climate and land-use change may impact wildlife in the future. | | Pearce, J.

Vector range expansion and anthropogenic factors such as habitat encroachment and climate change are altering viral evolutionary dynamics and exposure. However, little is known about the diversity of viruses present in these populations. Small felid populations with lower genetic diversity are likely to be most threatened with extinction by emerging diseases, as with other selective pressures, due to having less adaptive potential. We used a metagenomic approach to identify novel circoviruses, which may have a negative impact on the population viability, from confirmed bobcat (Lynx rufus) and puma (Puma concolor) scats collected in Sonora, Mexico. Given some circoviruses are known to cause disease in their hosts, such as porcine and avian circoviruses, we took a non-invasive approach using scat to identify circoviruses in free-roaming bobcats and puma. Three circovirus genomes were determined, and, based on the current species demarcation, they represent two novel species. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that one circovirus species is more closely related to rodent associated circoviruses and the other to bat associated circoviruses, sharing highest genome-wide pairwise identity of approximately 70% and 63%, respectively. At this time, it is unknown whether these scat-derived circoviruses infect felids, their prey, or another organism that might have had contact with the scat in the environment. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the host of these viruses and assess health impacts in felids | | Paukert, C., E. Webb, D. Fowler, and C. Hilling. 2021.

Restoring the abundance and distribution of this species has emerged as a management priority, yet our understanding of Cisco spawning habitat use is insufficient to characterize habitat needs for these populations and assess whether availability of suitable spawning habitat could be a constraint to recovery. We characterized the distribution of incubating Cisco eggs <i>in situ</i> across gradients of depth and substrate types to describe the spawning habitat used by three Great Lakes populations. In Chaumont Bay, Lake Ontario, eggs were concentrated on shallow bedrock shoals and not found on deeper silt or sand substrate. In contrast, eggs in Thunder Bay, Lake Superior, and Elk Rapids, Lake Michigan, were found on deeper fine grain sediments with low utilization of shallow rocky and cobble habitats. These patterns of egg incubation habitat use suggest a broad spawning habitat niche at the species level but distinct spawning habitat preferences at the population level. While our results indicate some historical diversity in spawning habitat use has been maintained across the species' range in the Great Lakes, comparisons of contemporary spawning habitat utilization against historical accounts raise questions as to whether some spawning habitat use behaviors may no longer be prevalent within specific lakes. Thus, characterizing the portfolio of spawning strategies remaining within lakes may improve our understanding of habitat needs and identify opportunities to maintain population diversity while supporting Cisco rehabilitation. | | Paufve MP, Sethi SA, Rudstam L, Weidel BC, Lantry BF, Chalupnicki M.

Journal of Great Lakes Research. 46:1058-1062. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/190284429312/None/all) | July 2020 || Cisco (Coregonus artedi) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) are native fish species of management concern in the Laurentian Great Lakes that often overlap in spawning locations and timing. Thus, species-level inference from in situ sampling requires methods to differentiate their eggs. Genetic barcoding and rearing of live eggs to visually identify larvae are used but can be time and cost intensive. Observations in published literature indicate that in the Great Lakes, lake whitefish eggs may be larger than those of cisco, but this has not yet been substantiated. Samples from shared spawning grounds are unlikely to contain similarly sized or colored eggs from other species. Thus, we assessed whether their eggs could be separated based on size alone. Fertilized, hardened eggs were collected in situ during spawning at Elk Rapids, Lake Michigan and Chaumont Bay, Lake Ontario and preserved in ethanol. Individual eggs were measured and genetically identified. Mean diameter for cisco (2.45 mm, SD = 0.22, n = 444) was smaller than for lake whitefish (3.21 mm, SD = 0.20, n = 99). We used classification trees to identify a species-separating size threshold of 2.88 mm (95% bootstrap CI = [2.88, 2.95]), which classified eggs with an accuracy rate of 96%. Differences between species across other samples from the same locations were mostly consistent with the threshold size, but we suggest validation if applying this method to other populations. Separation of cisco and lake whitefish eggs by diameter can be accurate, efficient, and especially suitable for large sample sizes. | | Paufve MP, Sethi SA, Lantry BF, Weidel BC, Rudstam LG.

Fisheries Research 214:19-24. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/168696250368/None/all) | January 2019 || Successful reproduction in fish requires suitable conditions for spawning and egg incubation. Thus, fish species commonly exhibit spawning site selectivity, and understanding habitat requirements to inform population ecology and management relies on in situ observations of eggs. Numerous methods and devices have been developed to sample benthic, non-adhesive fish eggs to relate egg distribution, abundance, and survival to habitat characteristics, yet most do not have estimates of sampling efficiency despite assumptions of imperfect performance. We tested the efficiency of a gasoline-powered diaphragm pump with two different intake nozzle designs by sampling benthic, non-adhesive fish eggs at known densities (50, 200, and 500 eggs m-2) across a range of substrates: silt, gravel, and two depths of cobble. The sampler was ineffective on deep cobble substrate regardless of intake design. However, on substrates with less interstitial space, a narrower intake was consistently effective at detecting the presence of eggs (mean detection probability: 0.92) and demonstrated sufficient egg recovery to detect relative differences in abundance and to estimate absolute abundance with enough repeating samples. On average, 45% of eggs directly beneath the intake were recovered after four minutes of pumping, with most collected during the first two minutes. Eggs were often collected from outside the intake area, increasing variability in egg counts. When these limitations and imperfect efficiencies are accounted for, the pump sampler is uniquely suited for in situ assessment of eggs to inform large-scale spawning site use, small-scale habitat selection, and other applications relevant to spawning ecology. | | Patton, P.

Toxic algae in inland waters of the conterminous United States\u2014A review || Cyanobacteria are the most common toxigenic algae in inland waters. Their toxins can affect the health of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, including humans. Other algal groups, such as haptophytes (e.g., Prymnesium parvum) and euglenoids Euglena form harmful algal blooms (HABs) whose toxins cause injury to aquatic biota but currently have no known effects on human health. Prymnesium parvum, however, is responsible for some of the worst HAB-related ecological disasters recorded in inland waters. Here, we provide an overview of the primary toxigenic algae found in U.S. inland waters: cyanobacteria (planktonic forms), P. parvum, and E. sanguinea with the objective of describing their similarities and differences in the areas of HAB ecology, algal toxins, and the potential for future range expansion of HABs. A detailed account of bloom habitats and their known associations with land cover and use is provided from the perspective of water quality.

While progeny sex ratios are typically stable at 1 : 1, sex reversal of genetic male catfish into functional females can be achieved with dietary steroid treatment. Morphological differentiation of ovaries and testes occur at 19 and 90-102 days postfertilization, respectively. The considerable time differential between ovarian and testicular differentiations suggests that testisinducing signals produced at 90 dpf are necessary for testicular differentiation in channel catfish -that is, the absence of estrogen production (necessary for ovarian differentiation) earlier in development is insufficient. Thus, testicular differentiation in channel catfish is proposed to occur in two phases: an early phase, when the sexdetermining gene downregulates the gonadal aromatase gene (cyp19a1a) and estrogen production to prevent ovarian differentiation; and a late phase, when masculinizing signals are produced and are required to initiate testicular formation. The products of gsdf and cxcl12 were recently identified for their potential role in the initiation of latephase testicular differentiation. Allmale progenies are desirable in channel catfish aquaculture because of their faster growth. A combination of feminizing steroid treatment, selective crossings, and progeny testing has been successfully used to produce YY male individuals that yield allmale progenies when crossed with normal females. This procedure is time and laborconsuming, however, and has not been applied in commercial operations. The recent discovery of a malespecific microsatellite marker may aid in the development of costeffective methods to produce YY brood stock. | | Pasternak, G.,C.A. Ribic, E. Spanier, A. Ariel, B.

Wildlife biologists frame spring wild turkey hunting seasons around annual trends in vocalization peaks to maximize hunter engagement. Historically, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks institutes a statewide 7 week spring harvest season; however, hunters routinely suggested there were different peaks in gobbling activity across a latitudinal gradient within the state. Our objectives were to determine if there were differences in peak gobbling activity between southern and northern Mississippi, if the current spring harvest seasons captured the peaks in gobbling activity, and to describe potential weather conditions that were observed during gobbling activity. During 2008 and 2009, we constructed a statewide gobbling survey to monitor gobbling activity and queried four Spatial Synoptic Classification sites to compare concurrent weather conditions. We determined an approximate 2 week difference in peak gobbling activity between southern and northern Mississippi. Further, the majority of all gobbling activity occurred within the spring harvest framework. We also observed gobbling activity was more prevalent on days of regionally dry conditions according to Spatial Synoptic Classification. Our results provide information to managers about the phenology of gobbling activity relative to season dates and useful weather-response information that may be of interest to hunters. Our approach could be modeled elsewhere and provide beneficial information particularly in states with relatively shorter seasons. | | Paine, R. T. R., Hurt, C. R., & Mattingly, H. T. (2021).

We developed an eDNA surveillance assay and protocol for monitoring the presence of the pygmy madtom (<i>Noturus stanauli</i>), a federally protected freshwater fish endemic to the Clinch and Duck rivers in Tennessee (United States, North America). <i>Noturus stanauli</i> is a diminutive fish that is exceedingly rare throughout its range; it is currently known only from a 115-river-km section of the Duck River and a 5-river-km section of the Clinch River. The aim of this research was to develop an eDNA assay to detect the presence of <i>N. stanauli</i> in both the Duck and Clinch rivers. We used this newly developed eDNA protocol to assess detection as a function of water depth and to further delineate the distribution of <i>N. stanauli</i> in both the Duck and Clinch rivers. Field sampling was performed to delineate the extent of <i>N. stanauli</i>'s range in both rivers. Our results indicated that samples collected from three areas within the water column, as well as a sediment core samples, yielded equal detection rates. Our assay detected the presence of <i>N. stanauli</i> at a previously unknown site outside the current distribution in the Clinch River, located approximately 2.5-river-km downstream from the Tennessee-Virginia state line. We demonstrated that eDNA detection is a promising tool for delineating the distribution of <i>N. stanauli</i>; however, further research is needed to assess environmental and life history variables that influence eDNA detection probability of small fish in large rivers. | | O'Neal, B.

We administered 10-30 mg of midazolam and 15 mg of azaperone intramuscularly (IM) to 32 mule deer in 2016 and 53 mule deer in 2017, and maintained a control group (captured but not sedated) of 38 mule deer in 2016 and 54 mule deer in 2017. To evaluate indicators of acute stress, we measured heart rate, blood-oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiration rate, and levels of serum cortisol. We recorded number of kicks and vocalizations of deer during handling and evaluated behavior during release. We also measured levels of fecal glucocorticoids as an indicator of baseline stress. Midazolam and azaperone did not reduce physiological, biochemical, or behavioral indicators of acute stress or influence probability of survival post-capture. Mule deer that were administered midazolam and azaperone, however, were more likely to hesitate, stumble or fall, and walk during release compared with individuals in the control group, which were more likely to trot, stot, or run without stumbling or falling. Our findings suggest that midazolam (10-30 mg IM) and azaperone (15 mg IM) may not yield physiological or demographic benefits for captured mule deer as previously assumed and may pose adverse effects that can complicate safety for captured animals, including drug-induced lethargy. Although we failed to find efficacy of midazolam and azaperone as a method for reducing stress in captured mule deer, the efficacy of midazolam and azaperone or other combinations of partial sedatives in reducing stress may depend on the dose of tranquilizer, study animal, capture setting, and how stress is defined. | | Orning, EK, KM Dugger, and DG Clark. 2021.

Although the success of such programs can be measured by the increase in genetic diversity and fitness of subsequent admixed individuals, little is known about the fine-scale costs of admixture at the molecular level. In this study, we analyzed nonsynonymous variation from conserved genes to quantify and compare mutation load levels (i.e., proportion of deleterious alleles and genotypes carrying these alleles) among endangered Florida panthers with different genetic backgrounds and non-endangered Texas pumas. Specifically, we used canonical (i.e., non-admixed) Florida Texas pumas, and F<sub>1</sub> (canonical Florida x Texas) panthers dating from a genetic rescue program, including Florida panthers with Central American ancestry resulting from an earlier admixture event. We found genetic drift had no significant effect in reducing overall proportions of deleterious alleles in the severely bottlenecked canonical Florida panthers. Furthermore, these deleterious alleles were distributed into a disproportionately high number of homozygous genotypes due to close inbreeding and inefficient purifying selection in this group. Conversely, admixed Florida panthers (either with Texas or Central American ancestry) presented reduced levels of homozygous genotypes carrying deleterious alleles but increased levels of heterozygous genotypes carrying these variants. Although admixture is likely to alleviate the load of standing deleterious variation present in homozygous genotypes, our results highlight concerns that introduced novel deleterious alleles (temporarily present in heterozygous state) could potentially be expressed in subsequent generations of rescued populations if their effective sizes remain small. | | Ochoa A, Onorato DP, Fitak RR, Roelke-Parker ME and M Culver. 2019.

Alternatively, proactive surveillance that relies on the detection of specific antibodies could give more reliable and timely insight into disease presence and prevalence in a population, especially if it occurs below detection thresholds for passive surveillance. An example is the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA)-ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) that was used for surveillance in impala (Aepyceros melampus) and kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) Park, South Africa. However, serological biosurveillance is hampered by a lack of species-specific conjugates that can be used in assays. In this study we developed anti-kudu and anti-impala immunoglobulin specific conjugates in chickens and examined their binding, compared to the binding of commercially available protein-G and -AG conjugates, to different herbivore species using an ELISA-based avidity index. The conjugates were evaluated for cross-reaction with other wild herbivores to assess future use in diagnostic ELISAs for other species. The developed conjugates had a high relative avidity of > 70% against kudu and impala sera. The commercial conjugates and -AG) had significantly low relative avidity (<20%) against these species. Eighteen other wildlife species demonstrated cross-reactivity with a mean relative avidity of >50% with the impala and kudu conjugates and <40% with the commercial conjugates. These results demonstrate the need for species-specific conjugates to improve the quality of immunoassays currently in use in wildlife, thus providing better tools for the surveillance of zoonotic agents along the livestock-wildlife-human interface. | | Ochai, S.O., van Heerden. 2022. Immunological evidence of variation in exposure and immune response to Bacillus anthracis in herbivores of Kruger and Etosha National [Publisher Website](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.814031/full) || Exposure and immunity to generalist pathogens differ among host species and vary across spatial scales. Anthrax, caused by a multi-host bacterial pathogen, <i>Bacillus anthracis,</i> is enzootic in Kruger (KNP), South Africa and Etosha National Park (ENP), Namibia. These parks share many of the same potential host species, yet the main anthrax host in one (greater kudu (<i>Tragelaphus</i> <i>strepsiceros</i>) in KNP and plains zebra (<i>Equus</i> <i>quagga</i>) in ENP) is only a minor host in the other. We investigated species and spatial patterns in anthrax mortalities,<i> B. anthracis</i> exposure, and the ability to neutralise the anthrax lethal toxin to determine if observed host mortality differences between locations could be attributed to population-level variation in pathogen exposure and/or immune response. Using serum collected from 20 individuals per primary host species (zebra, kudu), except for kudu in KNP (low incidence = 18, high incidence = 19) in high and low incidence areas of each park, we estimated pathogen exposure from anti-protective antigen (PA) antibody response using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lethal toxin neutralisation with a toxin neutralisation assay (TNA). Serological evidence of pathogen exposure followed mortality patterns within each system (kudus: 95% positive in KNP versus KNP). in the high-incidence area of KNP had higher anti-PA responses than those in the low-incidence area, but there were no significant differences in exposure by area within ENP. Toxin neutralizing ability was higher for host populations with lower exposure prevalence, i.e., higher in ENP kudus and KNP zebras than their conspecifics in the other park. These results indicate that host species differ in their exposure to and adaptive immunity against <i>B. anthracis</i> in the two parks. These patterns may be due to environmental differences such as vegetation, rainfall patterns, landscape or forage availability between these systems and their interplay with host behaviour (foraging or other risky behaviours), resulting in differences in exposure frequency and dose, and hence immune response. | | Oates, B. et al.

(in press) Outmigration survival of wild Chinook salmon smolts through the Sacramento River during historic drought and high water conditions. environmental biology of fishes. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/189873004544/None/all) | May 2020 || Populations of wild spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in California's Central Valley, once numbering in the millions, have dramatically declined to record low numbers in recent years. Dam construction, habitat degradation, and altered flow regimes have all contributed to depress populations of spring-run salmon, which currently persist in only a few tributaries to the Sacramento River. Mill Creek (Tehama County) continues to support these threatened fish, and contains some of the most pristine spawning and rearing habitat available in the Central Valley. Despite this pristine habitat, the number of spring-run salmon returning to spawn has declined to record low numbers, and is likely attributed to poor outmigration survival rates. Using miniature acoustic tags, it is now possible to track out-migrating juveniles throughout the freshwater migration corridor. From 2013-2017 we captured and acoustic tagged 334 smolts out-migrating from Mill Creek, tracking their movement and survival rates over 250 kilometers through the Sacramento River. During this study California experienced both an unprecedented drought and record rainfall, resulting in dramatic fluctuations in year-to-year river flows and water temperature. Cumulative survival of tagged smolts from Mill Creek through the Sacramento River was 9.5% (\u00b11.6) during the study, with relatively low survival during historic drought conditions in 2015 (4.9% \u00b1 1.6) followed by increased survival during high flows in 2017 (42.3% \u00b1 9.1). From these data, we modeled survival in Mill Creek and the Sacramento River over a range of flow values, which indicated that higher flows in each region result in increased survival rates. Data gathered in this study can help focus management and restoration actions over a relatively long migration corridor to specific regions of low survival, and provide guidance for management actions in the Sacramento River aimed at restoring populations of threatened Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon. | | Norris, D.M., M.E.

One such example is mudflat mediation in flood control reservoirs. Reservoir mudflats limit development of diverse fish assemblages due to the lack of structural habitat provided by plants. Seeding mudflats with agricultural plants may mimic floodplain wetlands once inundated and provide fish habitat and achieve habitat management objectives. However, planting success is uncertain because of unpredictable water level fluctuations that affect plant survival and growth. Decision support tools can account for uncertainty that influences decision outcomes and reduce the risk in reservoir mudflat planting decisions. We used Bayesian decision networks and sensitivity analyses to quantify uncertainty surrounding mudflat plantings as supplemental fish habitat in four northwest Mississippi reservoirs. When averaged across all uncertainty, planting was the optimal decision only in Enid Lake. Response profiles identified planting decisions depended on elevation contours within Enid, Sardis, and Grenada reservoirs. No planting was optimal at all elevations for Arkabutla Lake. These results provide a quantified basis for establishing best management practices and identifying key system states that influence decision outcomes. The process used in this study to evaluate planting decisions can be applied to any reservoir by modifying reservoir dependent inputs to evaluate planting decisions to provide supplemental fish habitat. | | Norris, D.M., Hatcher, H.R., Colvin, M.E., Coppola, G., Lashley, M.A., and L.E. 2020.

This study investigated the feasibility of establishing agricultural plantings as a management action to ameliorate mudflats by providing structural cover following reservoir refilling. We tested coolseason annual grasses and clovers applied in several mixed and monoculture treatments that were sown on the mudflats of Enid Reservoir, Mississippi, during the winter drawdown in three consecutive years. Soil samples were taken for analysis of pH and macronutrients prior to planting. Plantings were monitored until the following spring to evaluate effectiveness of establishment through ground coverage, height, and stem density sampling. Plots were assigned a seeding treatment of either plantings) or left as an unseeded control. Differences among plant treatments were assessed via repeated measures analysis of variance and differences among means evaluated with Tukey's honestly significant difference test. Soil productivity within the study area was poor all 3 years. Grasses germinated both when disked into the soil and when top sown, while clover only germinated when disked. Plots seeded with grasses performed better than control plots with respect to stem density, height, and ground coverage, while plots seeded with grass and clover mixtures performed better than control plots only with respect to height, and plots seeded with only clover did not perform significantly better than control plots. Results serve as an evaluation of the efficacy of agricultural plant establishment on the mudflats of a flood control reservoir, inform the direction of future research, and identify considerations regarding the application of agricultural plantings as a management tool to create fish habitat. | | Noring, A.M., G.G.

Shifting the public towards plant-based diets is critical for achieving environmental and public health outcomes. Increasingly news articles and organizations have begun using the saliency of the COVID-19 crisis to highlight the link between animal agriculture, pandemic risks, and other widespread public health threats. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of this messaging strategy for motivating dietary change. We conducted a randomized trial with an online sample to examine the impact of: (1) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the risk of disease transmission from factory farms, and (2) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the threat to worker's health created by factory farms. We examine whether these messages are more effective at changing beliefs about and behavioral intentions towards plant-based eating, as compared to more traditional messages that highlight the environmental, personal health, or animal welfare implications of factory farmed meat consumption. We find that all messages differentially influenced beliefs about the various negative consequences of meat consumption. However, these altered beliefs did not differentially motivate changes in respondents' intentions to reduce meat consumption and choose plant-based alternatives. This was possibly due to the numerous other barriers to behavior change identified in qualitative survey responses, such as cost, taste, and social factors. We did find that messages that highlight the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption were more effective at increasing public trust in the message deliverer. Our results suggest that highlighting personal health benefits in messaging and addressing the additional identified barriers to behavior change may be critical for building trust and shifting the public towards plant-based diets. | | Niemiec, R.

Although the growing focus on collective action for natural resource management has led to many new and potentially useful insights for governance and outreach, we suggest that researchers and practitioners may benefit from taking a step back to think about the degree and type of collective action that is needed for each particular social-ecological context. We use the examples of invasive species management, fire management, and habitat conservation to argue that categorizing certain natural resource management challenges by the degree and type of public good collective action problem (i.e., continuous and step level) they create can provide insight into effective policy and management solutions for each problem. In so doing, we build on experimental psychology and economics research that suggests that outreach and governance solutions that work for one type of public good collective action problem may be less effective for addressing another type of problem that does not require collective action. We conclude by arguing for more studies examining: (1) how aspects of the social and ecological context determine the degree and type of public good collective action problem posed by natural resource management challenges, and (2) how the drivers of land manager decision making and the resulting effective governance solutions vary by the type and degree of public good collective action problem. | | Niemiec, R, Jones, MS, Lischka, S, Champine, V.

However, little is known about how to effectively encourage large numbers of residents to reach out to others about conservation causes. We examined the influence of normative and efficacy-based messaging at motivating residents to engage in and to encourage others to participate in native plant gardening in their community. To do so, we conducted a field experiment with messages on mailings and tracked native plant vouchers used. Efficacy messages tended to be more effective than normative messages at increasing residents' willingness to reach out to others to encourage conservation action, as indicated by a several percentage point increase in native plant voucher use by residents' friends and neighbors. Messages sometimes had different impacts on residents based on past behaviors and perceptions related to native plant gardening. Among these subgroups, efficacy and combined efficacy and norm messages most effectively encouraged individual and collective actions, as indicated by increased voucher usage. Our findings suggest that interventions that build residents' efficacy for engaging in a conservation behavior and for reaching out to others may be a promising path forward for outreach. However, given our results were significant at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.25 but not 0.05, more experimental trials are needed to determine the robustness of these trends. | | Niedringhaus, K.D, L.S.

Recently, a new genus in this family, <i>Versteria,</i> has been implicated as the cause of severe morbidity and mortality in humans and animals in North America. This report describes a case of fatal <i>Versteria</i> infection in a muskrat (<i>Ondatra zibethicus</i>) which has not been previously reported to develop disease associated with infection. Postmortem examination revealed widespread tissue loss and replacement by solid-bodied cestode larvae with minimal adjacent inflammation in many visceral organs, most severe in the lungs, liver, and brain. Characteristic morphological features via histology included multiple cephalic structures and short rostellar hooklets, which are characteristic for the genus. Genetic characterization confirmed the cestode as being an undescribed lineage of <i>Versteria</i> that has been implicated as the cause of severe morbidity and mortality in humans and non-human primates in North America. Considering the zoonotic significance of this pathogen, this report expands on the limited literature regarding disease caused by <i>Versteria </i>and emphasizes the need to identify the causative tapeworm more accurately, especially in rodent intermediate hosts as all previous reports do not have molecular confirmation of species. | | Nichols, J.

Habitat edges influence the distribution of nest predators for Seaside Sparrows, but not nesting decisions or success. Ornithological Applications 124:duac023. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/223200733184/None/all) | May 2022 || Nest failure for coastal marsh bird species is primarily caused by predation and nest flooding. As sea level rise makes nest flooding more likely, the threat of nest predation will constrain the potential adaptive responses of marsh nesting species. Thus, understanding the predictors of nest predation is important for conservation and management of birds inhabiting coastal marshes, such as Seaside Sparrows (<i>Ammospiza maritima</i>). Predator activity may be influenced by landscape features (particularly edges between marshes and other habitats), potentially making nest predation predictable. We aimed to understand the predictability of Seaside Sparrow nest predation relative to two major landscape features: distance to roads and distance to tidal rivers, as both of these edges may be entryways or attractants for predators in the marsh. In coastal Georgia, USA, we assessed mammalian predator activity relative to the two features of interest, and hypothesized that predator activity would be greater close to roads and tidal rivers. We also recorded Seaside Sparrow nest locations and nest predation events and hypothesized that nest predation events would increase with increasing predator activity. Consistent with our hypothesis, predator activity increased close to roads and tidal rivers, but mammalian predator distribution did not explain the spatial variation in Seaside Sparrow nest predation. Seaside Sparrows also placed their nests in locations with increased predator activity, indicating that the ability to avoid nesting in high risk areas may be constrained by habitat or resource limitations. Additionally, mammals may not be the primary nest predators, as we found that one bird species (Marsh Wren, <i>Cistothorus palustris</i>) contributed substantially to nest predation rates. Understanding the predictability of mammalian predator distribution can contribute to predation risk management for Seaside Sparrows, which could relax the constraint of nest predation on the species' ability to respond to the intensifying threat of sea level rise. | | Newsome, C.D., Evans, K.M., and E.A.

During the infection experiment, 4.5% of infected fish died within 54 days with mortality significantly related to copepod infection intensity. The potential for autoinfection were compared to cross infection by cohabitation of infected fish with na\u00efve fish.

We quantified the effects of landscape composition (Shannon's diversity index) and configuration (contagion, edge density and largest patch index), and human footprint (road density) on the survival probabilities of the three North American breeding populations (western, central and eastern) of Turkey Vultures wintering in the Neotropics during a 17-year period. We used Cox's proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates to estimate spatial and temporal changes in survival rates of adult Turkey Vultures. Human footprint, but not landscape composition and configuration, influenced survival rates in space and time. Overall annual survival averaged 0.87 (95% CI = 0.74 - 0.98). Mortality risk was low in western and central populations (hazard ratio <1) but was 3.7 times greater for vultures in the eastern population. Risk of mortality for all vulture populations increased with road density, and this was greater during the non-breeding and return migration seasons. The spatial variation in road density across America may generate a network of ecological traps for Turkey Vultures induced to stop in areas of greater road-kill abundance. The negative impact of roads on Turkey Vultures goes beyond the ecological aspect. Roads acting as a magnet for vultures can increase the occurrence of vulture-vehicle collisions and potentially aggravate human-wildlife conflicts. Further analysis are needed to address survivorship and mortality factors of young birds. We emphasize the need for studies focusing on the impact of other linear infrastructures (<i>e.g.</i> railways and power lines) and the management of human-vulture conflicts (through vultures depredation permits) that may can compromise the long term survival of Turkey Vultures and other avian scavengers. | | Navarro, N., P.

Sampling only during daytime can mischaracterize zooplankton distributions and abundances if populations perform vertical or horizontal diel migrations. Zooplankton often display reduced capture avoidance at night in addition to occupying areas easier to sample near the surface and away from littoral structure and the benthos. We examined zooplankton during daytime and nighttime new moon periods using discrete depth sampling in oligo-mesotrophic reservoirs in Oregon, USA. These reservoirs have limited littoral structure, but support populations of zooplanktivorous fishes that we expected to drive diel vertical migrations. Contrary to our expectations, most zooplankton taxa were within 2 meters of their daytime distributional peak and did not display significant differences in abundance from day to night sampling. We consider factors that may help predict whether diel migration occurs in a system. Where daytime sampling is sufficient for characterizing zooplankton densities and distributions, costs and risks specific to nighttime sampling may be avoided. Improving our understanding of zooplankton dynamics, particularly in ecosystems with limited diurnal variability, is an important part of understanding lake and reservoir food webs and can optimize the efforts of future studies. | | Murphy, C.A., Pollock, A.M., Johnson, S.L., and Arismendi, I.

Recent research has indicated an important role of temperature in copepod development and fish susceptibility. Here, we examine the role of temperature on relative infection risk for juvenile Chinook Salmon in multiple reservoirs of the upper Willamette River Basin, Oregon. We used and expanded the GrowChinook model (a linked foraging and bioenergetics model) to estimate juvenile salmon infection risk. Based on salmon vertical migration patterns, we added estimates of copepod generations produced and thermal strata metrics for the infectious copepodid lifestage that appear associated with copepodid aggregations and increased infection risk. Our model predicted that Chinook Salmon in Lookout Point Reservoir consistently presented the greatest infection hours and estimated copepod generations, especially compared to Cougar Reservoir. This relative modelled risk is consistent with recent models of infection driven mortality and the severe damage caused by the infectious copepodid, a lifestage that is not readily visible in the field and thus has not been included in traditional infection prevalence and intensity counts. We discuss model limitations, potential for future research, and the potential for application of the copepod expansion equations to existing linked foraging and bioenergetics models or observed behaviors of salmonids in other lentic systems. We demonstrate that using a temperature sensitive model framework to test our existing knowledge and assumptions about copepod infection dynamics is useful in interpreting other lines of evidence, such as mortality estimates. Collectively, this work provides a testable framework for future comparisons of infection potential by this parasite infecting Pacific salmon and trout species. | | Murphy, B., T. Walsworth, P.

Direct in situ water temperature collection efforts provide point-samples but are cost-prohibitive for characterizing stream temperatures across large spatial scales, especially for small, remote streams. In contrast, satellite thermal infrared imagery may provide a spatially extensive means of monitoring riverine water temperatures, however, the accuracy of these remotely sensed temperatures for small streams is not well understood. Here, we investigated the utility of Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery and both local and regional environmental variables to estimate subsurface temperatures in high latitude small streams (2 - 30 m wetted width), from a test watershed in southcentral Alaska. Our results suggested that Landsat-based surface temperatures were biased high, and the degree of bias varied with hydrological and meteorological factors. However, with limited in-stream validation work, results indicated it is possible to reconstruct average in situ water temperatures for small streams at regional-scales using a regression modelling framework coupled with publicly-available Landsat or air temperature information. Generalized additive models built from stream stage information from a single gage and air temperatures from a single weather station in the drainage fit to a limited set of in situ temperature recordings could estimate average stream temperatures at the watershed-level with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error = 2.4\u00b0C). Landsat information did track closely with regional air temperatures and could also be incorporated into a regression model as a substitute for air temperature to estimate in situ stream temperatures at watershed scales. Importantly, however, while average watershed-scale stream temperatures may be predictable, site-level estimates did not improve with the use of Landsat information or other local covariates, indicating that additional information may be necessary to generate accurate spatially explicit temperature predictions for small order streams. | | Murphy C.A., Zatkos L., Antonelli K., C\u00e1rdenas 45(7): DOI:10.1002/fsh.10485 || July 2020 || | | Murphy C.A., Taylor G., Piece T., Arismendi I. and Johnson S.L. 2019.

Selective water withdrawals can be used to minimize thermal impacts to downstream reaches. However, other water quality parameters, in-reservoir production, and species composition also vary with depth. In the South Fork McKenzie River, in the Pacific Northwest of North America, an existing large dam was retrofitted to mix and export water from multiple depths, allowing dam operators to adjust the outflow temperatures to be in sync with the upstream thermal regime. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate responses after implementation of selective water withdrawal, comparing it to thermally similar flow-through conditions, expecting to see shifts in the community over time to resemble upstream, undammed reaches. However, species composition and traits downstream of the dam became more dissimilar to upstream and to flow-through after selective water withdrawal. These changes included increases in non-insect taxa and taxa known to feed on plankton and detritus. The most likely explanation for this transition is that selective water withdrawal from multiple depths of a stratified reservoir included epilimnetic releases, which resulted in increased export of plankton and organic material downstream. This strategy favored taxa able to capitalize on resource subsidies from the reservoir. Our findings highlight the interconnected nature of responses to dams and dam operations, including the importance of considering biotic communities in addition to temperature and flow when planning water management strategies. | | Murphy C.A., Gerth W., Pauk K., Konstantinidis P. and Arismendi I. 2020.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3354/meps13912 2022 || Sound production rates of fishes can be used as an indicator for coral reef health, providing an opportunity to utilize long-term acoustic recordings to assess environmental change. As acoustic datasets become more common, computational techniques need to be developed to facilitate analysis of the massive data files produced by long-term monitoring. Machine learning techniques demonstrate an advantage in the identification of fish sounds over manual sampling approaches. Here we evaluate the ability of convolutional neural networks to identify and monitor call patterns for pomacentrids (damselfishes) in a tropical reef region of the western Pacific. A stationary hydrophone was deployed for 39 months(2014-2018) in the National Park of American Samoa to continuously record the local marine acoustic environment. A neural network was trained\u2014achieving 94%identification accuracy of pomacentrids\u2014to demonstrate the applicability of machine learning in fish acoustics and ecology. The distribution of sound production was found to vary on diel and interannual timescales. Additionally, the distribution of sound production was correlated with wind speed, water temperature, tidal amplitude, and sound pressure level. This research has broad implications for state--of--the--art acoustic analysis and promises to be an efficient, scalable asset for ecological research, environmental monitoring and conservation planning. | | Mummah, R.

Phenotypes can be influenced directly by genes and/or by phenotypic plasticity. The amphibiankilling fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Bd) has a global distribution, unusually broad host range, and high genetic diversity. Phenotypic plasticity may be an important process that allows this pathogen to infect hundreds of species in diverse environments. We quantified phenotypic variation of nine Bd genotypes from two Bd lineages (Global Pandemic Lineage [GPL] and Brazil) and a hybrid (GPLBrazil) grown at three temperatures (12, 18 and 24\u00b0C). We measured five functional traits including two morphological traits (zoospore and zoosporangium sizes) and three life history traits (carrying capacity, time to fastest growth and exponential growth rate) in a phylogenetic framework. Temperature caused highly plastic responses within each genotype, with all Bd genotypes showing phenotypic plasticity in at least three traits. Among genotypes, Bd generally showed the same direction of plastic response to temperature: larger zoosporangia, higher carrying capacity, longer time to fastest growth and slower exponential growth at lower temperatures. The exception was zoospore size, which was highly variable. Our findings indicate that Bd genotypes have evolved novel phenotypes through plastic responses to temperature over very short timescales. High phenotypic variability likely extends to other traits and may facilitate the large host range and rapid spread of Bd. | | Muir, A.M., N. Young, S.J. Cooke. Submitted.

We investigated the effects of hypoxia, temperature (with acclimation), nitrogenous chemical compounds, and chloride on Topeka shiners (<i>Notropis topeka</i>) by monitoring behavioral responses to a reduction in oxygen and, using swimming speed, determining thermal optima and onset of effect for concentrations of nitrogenous compounds and chloride. We found ASR<sub>50</sub> (i.e., dissolved oxygen concentrations where 50% of fish use aquatic surface respiration) to be 1.65 mg/L and ASR<sub>90</sub> to be 1.08 mg/L of dissolved oxygen. Optimum temperatures for the species ranged from 17.7 to 28.0 \u00b0C, while predicted 100% mortality ranged from 33.7 to 40.3 \u00b0C, depending on the temperature at which fish were acclimated prior to experiments. Ammonia and sodium chloride reduced swimming speed at concentrations below known LC<sub>50</sub> values, while nitrite concentrations did not correspond with swimming speed, but rather, post-experiment mortality. This provides insight into where Topeka shiners can not only persist, but also thrive. Although swimming speed may not be a suitable metric for determining the effects of all contaminants, our focus on optima and sub-lethal effects over tolerance allows selections of the most suitable reintroduction site matching the species' physiological profile. | | Morrison, T.

One hypothesis is that site fidelity is shaped by an animal's environment, such that animals living in landscapes with predictable resources have stronger site fidelity. Site fidelity may also be conditional on the success of animals' recent visits to that location, and it may become stronger with age as the animal accumulates experience in their landscape. Finally, differences between species, such as the way memory shapes site attractiveness, may interact with environmental drivers to modulate the strength of site fidelity. We compared inter-year site fidelity in 669 individuals across eight ungulate species fitted with GPS collars and occupying a range of environmental conditions in North America and Africa. We used a distance-based index of site fidelity and tested hypothesized drivers of site fidelity using linear mixed effects models, while accounting for variation in annual range size. Mule deer <i>Odocoileus hemionus</i> and moose <i>Alces alces</i> exhibited and barren-ground caribou <i>Rangifer tarandus granti</i> had relatively weak fidelity. Site fidelity was strongest in predictable landscapes where vegetative greening occurred at regular intervals over time (i.e. high temporal contingency). Species differed in their response to spatial heterogeneity in greenness (i.e. spatial constancy). Site fidelity varied seasonally in some species, but remained constant over time in others. Elk employed a 'win-stay, lose-switch' strategy, in which successful resource tracking in the springtime resulted in strong site fidelity the following spring. Site fidelity did not vary with age in any species tested. Our results provide support for the environmental hypothesis, particularly that regularity in vegetative phenology shapes the strength of site fidelity at the inter-annual scale. Large unexplained differences in site fidelity suggest that other factors, possibly species-specific differences in attraction to known sites, contribute to variation in the expression of this behaviour. Understanding drivers of variation in site fidelity across groups of organisms living in different environments provides important behavioural context for predicting how animals will respond to environmental change. | | Morris, S.A., C.W.

Ecological Applications. doi:10.1002/eap.2382. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/194462429184/None/all) | January 2021 || One of the paramount goals of oyster reef living shorelines is to achieve sustained and adaptive coastal protection, which requires meeting ecological (i.e., develop a self-sustaining oyster population) and engineering (i.e., provide coastal defence) targets. In a large-scale comparison along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, the efficacy of various designs of oyster reef living shorelines at providing wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization was evaluated. Historical aerial imagery (to quantify shoreline change) combined with on-ground wave attenuation measurements of 15 oyster reef living shorelines, and paired controls, was analyzed. Oyster reef living shorelines varied in age, construction material (oyster shell or pre-cast concrete units), reef dimensions (i.e. length, width, height) and placement (i.e., tidal height, wave exposure, distance from shore) among sites. At six sites oyster reefs showed significantly greater wave attenuation than the paired controls, and the reduction in wave height at those oyster reefs varied between 13 - 55%. The oyster reefs in the other sites were not effective at wave attenuation and substantial continued shoreline erosion was observed. Wave attenuation was greatest at reefs where either (1) the crest height was at or above the water depth; or (2) the reef had a wider footprint. However, some of the tall reefs exceeded the tolerable aerial exposure for oysters (i.e., the amount of time a reef can spend out of the water) and, thus, the peak of such reefs was not suitable oyster habitat. There is, therefore, a trade-off between maximizing coastal protection or oyster habitat when designing an oyster reef living shoreline. Yet our results provide evidence that oyster reefs may be designed to deliver both substantial coastal protection and oyster habitat through further study of the relationship between reef structural attributes (height and width) and oyster habitat suitability. Verification of these observations under storm conditions, which drive erosive events, will be important to inform appropriate design and wider implementation of living shorelines globally. | | Morris RL, Bilkovic DM, Boswell MK, Bushek KM, Peyre MK, McClenachan G, Moody J, Sacks P, Shinn JP, Sparks EL, Temple NA, Walters LJ, Webb BM, Swearer BM. 2019.

However, accuracy of results and the following inference are contingent on multiple sources of sampling error including missed detections and pseudoreplication in statistical comparisons that assume independence within scat samples. We compared a repeatedsampling occupancy framework intended to estimate detection and occurrence rates for diet items with a multinomial modeling approach intended to estimate diet selection while accounting for nonindependence of diet items within samples. Both methods allowed for multimodel inference to specifically test hypotheses about differences in diet. We applied each method to 2 example data sets, a bobcat (<i>Lynx rufus</i>) scat data set (<i>n</i> = 101) collected in western Virginia, USA, from 2011 to 2013 with morphological identification of diet items, and a coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) scat data set (<i>n</i> = 50) collected in Tooele County, Utah, USA, in 2014 with molecular identification of diet items, and compared results with those commonly implemented in diet studies (frequency of occurrence calculations). We found imperfect detection of diet items was not a major source of bias in either the morphological or molecular data set results, but grouping similar or indistinguishable diet items in the morphological data set affected estimates when there was heterogeneity in detection among items. Using the occupancy approach on the morphological data set demonstrated that presence or amount of some diet items could decrease detection of other items and bias occurrence estimates. Furthermore, comparing multiple models of bobcat diet using Akaike's Information Criterion with either approach revealed no support for seasonal differences, even though traditional frequency of occurrence calculations differed by almost 10%. Thus, we suggest even moderate trends in diet based on frequency of occurrence calculations without incorporating measures of uncertainty may represent sampling error, and not true differences in diet. When detection is not conditional on other diet items, comparison of multinomial models will typically be sufficient to make accurate inference about carnivore diets without requiring additional processing of scat samples. | | Moriarity M, Sethi SA, Pedreschi D, TS, McGonigle C, Harris BP, Wolf N, Greenstreet SPR.

ICES Journal of Marine Science 77:539-552. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/175941773312/None/all) | March 2020 || Ecosystem-scale examination of fish communities typically involves creating spatio-temporally explicit relative abundance distribution maps using data from multiple fishery-independent surveys. However, sampling performance varies by vessel and sampling gear, which may influence estimated species distribution patterns. Using GAMMs, the effect of different gear-vessel combinations on relative abundance estimates at length was investigated using European fisheries-independent groundfish survey data. We constructed a modelling framework for evaluating relative efficiency of multiple gear-vessel combinations. 19 northeast Atlantic surveys for 254 species-length combinations were examined. Space-time variables explained most of the variation in catches for 181/254 species-length cases, indicating that for many species, models successfully characterized distribution patterns when combining data from disparate surveys. Variables controlling for gear efficiency explained substantial variation in catches for 127/254 species-length data sets. Models that fail to control for gear efficiencies across surveys can mask changes in the spatial distribution of species. Estimated relative differences in catch efficiencies grouped strongly by gear type, but did not exhibit a clear pattern across species' functional forms, suggesting difficulty in predicting the potential impact of gear efficiency differences when combining survey data to assess species' distributions and highlighting the importance of modelling approaches that can control for gear differences. | | Morandini, V., K.M.

Understanding migratory connectivity and migration phenology is important in identifying factors that influence survival and fitness over the full annual cycle. However, until recently, practical methods (i.e., data derived from banding and VHF telemetry) for elucidating migratory connectivity and migration phenology of woodcock have provided relatively coarse-resolution delineation of migration patterns. Based largely on analysis of band returns, woodcock are managed in 2 management regions (Eastern and Central Management Regions) with management region boundaries analogous to those of the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. To better understand woodcock migration and evaluate the validity of current management regions, we deployed satellite transmitters on 73 woodcock in the Central Management Region, and from 2014-2016 documented migration paths of 60 individual woodcock and 87 autumn or spring woodcock migrations. Marked woodcock captured in the Central Management Region used 2 primary migrations routes: a Western Route and a Central Route. The Western Route ran north-south, connecting the breeding and wintering grounds within the Central Management Region. The hourglass-shaped Central Route connected an area on the wintering grounds reaching from Texas to Florida, to sites throughout northeastern North America in the Eastern Management Region and Central Management Region. Woodcock following the Central Route migrated through the area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi Alluvial Valley in western Tennessee during both autumn and spring. A higher than anticipated (based on previous banding data analyses) percentage (36%, n = 12) of marked woodcock captured in Texas and Louisiana and monitored during spring migration migrated to breeding-period sites in the Eastern Management Region, raising questions about the biological relevance of managing woodcock in separate management regions. | | Moore, J.

The timing of the designated survey windows were designed to count woodcock that have settled in an area while minimizing the counting of migrating woodcock to the best extent possible. Since the implementation of the SGS in 1968, concerns over survey protocols that may bias data have been raised and investigated; however, the extent of survey coverage , the timing of the survey window zones, and whether double counting might occur within and among survey zones have not been critically investigated We used three years of data collected from satellite-marked male and female woodcock to assess the timing of the SGS survey windows and to what extent there was potential to double count woodcock among the survey zones. SGS coverage encompassed the majority of woodcock breeding-period sites within the U.S. (n = 17, 92%) and approximately half of the breeding period sites in Canada (n = 6, 43%). Thirteen of the 37 monitored woodcock with known breeding-period site arrival dates (35%) were migrating through a survey zone during an active survey window, all in the northernmost four out of five SGS zones. Thirteen woodcock arrived at breeding period sites after the start of surveys, all but one with breeding-period sites in the northernmost two zones. The combination of these situations may result in the SGS weighing too heavily the contribution of routes in southern portion of the primary breeding range while weighing too lightly the routes in the northern portion of the primary breeding range. We believe that we have demonstrated enough concerns about zone window timing to suggest that additional information is necessary to evaluate whether current zone window dates are sufficient, or whether they need to be changed. | | Moore, D.

U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Cooperator Science Series XXX-XXX. Washington, D.C. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/185980303360/None/all) | June 2019 || Blue Sucker (Cycleptus elongatus) is a state-listed threatened species in Texas and is considered vulnerable throughout its range. Once considered a single, wide-ranging species, blue suckers are now recognized as a complex of closely related, but genetically and morphologically distinct species within the genus Cycleptus, including an undescribed species within the Rio Grande Basin. Numerous factors likely are driving the decline of blue suckers in Texas, including flow alteration, water quality, habitat fragmentation, and changing land-use patterns, but it is not clear how these factors interact to influence the abundance and distribution of the species. Our research integrates a variety of methodologies to provide information critical to the conservation and management of Blue Sucker in the Sabine River (Texas and Louisiana) and Colorado River (Texas) and Rio Grande Blue Sucker (Cycleptus sp. cf. elongatus) in the Rio Grande. The objectives of this report are to 1) determine the habitat associations of the young-of-the-year (YOY) Rio Grande Blue Sucker; 2) assess the effects of flow regime on growth and recruitment of Blue Sucker in the lower Sabine River; and 3) examine differences in life-history traits of Blue Suckers and flow regime across river basins in Texas. This study is the first to quantitatively address the sequence of YOY blue sucker mesohabitat use and increases our understanding of early life history of blue suckers, and the results of this work will help to develop conservation and management strategies (e.g., prioritizing conservation areas, developing flow recommendation, etc.) for blue suckers throughout their geographic distribution. Key findings of this study were: 1) The body size of YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker in pool habitats were significantly lower than that in other mesohabitats, suggesting that YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker undergo onotogenetic habitat shifts into higher current velocity habitats as they grow. 2) Slow current areas, such as pools, could be important nursery habitats for small YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker (total length 45 mm). 3) YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker move into riffles and runs as they grow from April to June, suggesting that extreme low flow conditions during early summer may negatively affect the habitat quality or availability for YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker. 4) The growth and recruitment of Blue Sucker in the lower Sabine River increased with increasing the river discharge from early summer to fall in our study areas. 5) The life-history traits of Blue Sucker differed between the lower Sabine River and the lower Colorado River: the total length and age of Blue Sucker in the lower Colorado River were larger than those of Blue Sucker in the lower Sabine River, and the growth and mortality rates of Blue Sucker of the lower Sabine River tended to be higher than those of the lower Colorado River. 6) Our results suggest that mesohabitat area and flow regime could be important factors determining the growth and recruitment of blue suckers, and the importance of these environmental factors could change according to the life-history stage (larval stage, juvenile stage, and adult stage). 7) Important areas for future research efforts include a) quantifying the differences in the mesohabitat area/quality/density among the three river basins; b) examining interactions between the spatial distributions of potential spawning habitat relative to suitable YOY mesohabitat and how variations in river flow influence their quality and connectivity to each other; and c) continuing to monitor the effects of flow regime on blue suckers for longer time periods. | | Miyazono S, AA Pease, S Fritts, & TB Grabowski. 2020.

It is important to understand how hydrologic conditions can affect ontogenetic habitat shifts of imperiled fishes in order to develop conservation and management strategies for each life-history stage. To better understand the factors affecting ontogenetic habitat shifts of an imperiled aridland river fish, we examined relationships between the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Rio Grande Blue Sucker and various abiotic variables in the Trans-Pecos region of the Rio Grande in Texas, USA using open <i>N</i>-mixture modeling. In addition, we examined differences in Rio Grande Blue Sucker total length among three mesohabitat types (pool, riffle, and run). The results of open <i>N</i>-mixture modeling suggested that as pool area increased, the recruitment of Rio Grande Blue Sucker increased. Total length of YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker also significantly differed among the three mesohabitat types. The total lengths of YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker in pool habitats were lower than in other mesohabitats, suggesting that YOY Rio Grande Blue Sucker undergo ontogenetic habitat shifts into greater current velocity habitats as they grow. The habitat associations we documented support the growing body of research emphasizing the importance of maintaining sufficient and appropriately timed flows to avoid prolonged low flows that limit habitat availability for native fish species during sensitive life stages in the Rio Grande and other aridland rivers. | | Mitchell, N.R., C.W.

These events are projected to transform reservoir aquatic habitats in various and often unpredictable ways. Aging affects in-lake habitats directly, whereas climate change affects both in-lake and off-lake conditions. Climate change is expected to accelerate and, in some instances, possibly decelerate aging. Aging can be indexed as functional age, an index that signals the position of a reservoir along its lifespan relying on in lake descriptors of aquatic habitat. Using existing habitat datasets and climate projections, we developed semi-quantitative predictions about the effect of climate change on reservoir functional age in the USA. Driven by increased warming, functional age was predicted to increase latitudinally from south to north with no obvious longitudinal gradient. Functional age also changed with precipitation, increasing latitudinally from south to north and longitudinally in the east and west but decreasing in the central USA. Our projections are tentative because of the uncertain nature of reservoir aging and climate change sciences, as well as the inexactness of available data and models. We review general strategies suitable for systematically dealing with the unpredictable and constantly changing conditions expected to occur this century as reservoirs certainly continue to get older, within the scope of uncertain climate change projections. | | Miranda, L.E., and K.J.

In view of this deficit, our objective was to assess diel water quality patterns in the nearshore zone of a reservoir and test whether diel patterns differed relative to the presence or absence of riparian shade. Light intensity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential, and specific conductance were greater in unshaded sites (p < 0.05), whereas concentrations of phosphate and nitrate were greater in shaded sites, and pH values were similar in shaded and unshaded sites. Most variables exhibited distinct diel cycles, except specific conductance, turbidity, phosphate, and nitrate. Other than light intensity (average 66% lower in shade), differences in water quality patterns between shaded and unshaded sites seemed small (average <5%) and within the range of tolerances of aquatic biotic communities. In most lacustrine systems the nearshore shaded band is small relative to the unshaded open water, and the large open-water volume tends to neutralize effects of shading on water physicochemistry. As a result, riparian shade may not have a large influence on water temperature and chemistry of lacustrine systems, and its biggest effect may be a reduction in light intensity in the nearshore band. The observed decrease in light intensity in shaded sites has the potential to influence biotic assemblages through competitive mechanisms associated with finding food, avoiding predation, and other aspects associated with rather than through physiologic effects via water quality. | | Miranda, L.E., R.V.

We expected that location in the basin would reflect a multiplicity of factors that determine fish habitat and fish assemblage composition, and therefore also anticipated a correlation between fish species composition and spatial variables if the gear type reflected legitimate differences in fish assemblages. We collected 1.6 million fish of 129 species in 22 reservoirs of the Tennessee River basin, USA. Standardized electrofishing represented different aspects of the fish assemblages than standardized gillnetting. Nevertheless, the assemblages documented by each gear type were correlated with the spatial location of the reservoirs in the river basin. Thus, even as these gear types reflected different aspects of existing fish assemblages, they each tracked spatial differences, suggesting that they reflected standing fish assemblages. Our study endorses the use of standardized boat electrofishing and gillnetting as proper means for monitoring fish assemblages at large spatial scales. Our results further suggest that a well-designed and standardized sampling protocol can in fact provide an informative bird's eye view of fish assemblages at regional, national, or continental scales suitable for informing conservation programs. | | Miranda, L.E., M.C.

These floodplain lakes are scattered throughout the valley and carved over thousands of years by shifting river courses and other hydro-fluvial processes associated with contemporary and prehistoric rivers. These lakes have significant ecological importance as they support a large component of North American biodiversity. We used remote sensing to catalog lakes, to characterize morphology, and to construct a typology via cluster analysis. We identified over 1,300 permanent lakes totaling over 100,000 ha. The lakes were classified into 12 types according to lake size, shape, depth, connectivity, inundation frequency, and surrounding landcover. We anticipate that biotic characteristics differ among the 12 types, but large-scale systematic analyses of biotic assemblages of floodplain lakes in the region are mostly absent. Our typology can provide the framework essential for organizing research to define water dynamics, water quality, and ecological conditions such as forests, mussel, fish, and avian communities to construct conservation plans. The typology encourages a large-scale view of the properties of floodplain lakes in the alluvial valley. It is a functional tool that can be used to begin identifying conservation and research needs, adapt monitoring and management programs, customize environmental programs, and use conservation resources more effectively to achieve large-scale management objectives. | | Miranda, L.E., K.M.

We tested whether black bass habitat selection differed among species, and if species co-occurrence depended on habitat type. We found that some species occurred in some habitats in proportion to habitat availability, some at higher frequencies, some at frequencies lower than availability, and that juveniles and adults exhibited similar occurrence patterns. Our habitat selection results largely corroborate previous descriptions of black bass habitat associations and generally track preference for lithic habitats as reported in native streams. We expected black bass species to show negative cooccurrence to avoid competitive interactions. Nevertheless, we found that with few exceptions, adults co-occurred in habitats mostly as expected by chance, and juveniles co-occurred more often than expected by chance. Our findings imply that environmental filtering, rather than competitive interactions that dominate in natural environments, may be the dominant mechanism shaping black bass assemblages in reservoirs of the Tennessee River. The observed patterns of habitat selection and co-occurrence further suggest that conservation and management of black bass assemblages in reservoirs can be supported through habitat management activities. Protecting and enhancing the remaining lithic habitat in the reservoirs as well as recovering habitat blanketed by sediment could provide desirable environments for all black bass species. | | Miranda, L.E., K.J.

Patterns of zero and nonzero counts indicate spatiotemporal distributions, aggregation, and dispersion of invasive Management | || Bigheaded carp Hypophthalmichthys spp. are invasive species native to Asia expanding in the Mississippi River Basin in North America. An understanding of spatiotemporal distribution and aggregation of invasive carp is key to establishing when and where to focus surveillance designed to monitor expansion, and to managing harvest programs designed to curb population densities. We applied a two-stage hurdle model to assess three aspects of bigheaded carp ecology: distribution, relative abundance, and aggregation. Stage 1 was a binary 0/1 model that represented fish presence (p), and stage 2 was a truncated count distribution that had no zeros and included counts 1 only (C). Estimates of p and C varied temporally and spatially, but not in harmony and sometimes in opposing directions, indicating temporal and spatial swings in fish distributions and aggregations. Intense fish aggregations in channels in spring shown by low p's and high C's, eventually scattered by summer and fall as shown by high p's and low C's. An alternative but complementary interpretation of our observations is that p indexes incidence of aggregations and C indexes size of aggregations. Partitioning catch into its zero and nonzero components provided insight into population ecology that can inform development of monitoring and management of harvesting programs targeted at lessening potential effects of the invasion. | | Miranda, L.E., G.

The effects of climate change are increasingly evident and are anticipated to profoundly affect our ability to conserve fish habitats and fish assemblages as we know them. Preparing to cope with the effects of climate change is developing as the central concern of aquatic resources conservation and management. Reservoirs are important structures for coping with projected shifts in water supply, but they also provide refuge for riverine fishes and retain distinct fish assemblages that support diverse fisheries. The effects of climate change on reservoirs are unique among aquatic systems because reservoirs have distinctive habitat characteristics due to their terrestrial origin and strong linkage to catchments. We review (1) the projected effects of rising temperature and shifting precipitation on reservoir fish habitats, and (2) adaptation strategies to cope with the anticipated effects. Climate warming impacts to reservoirs include higher water temperatures and shifts in hydrology that can result in reduced water levels in summer and fall, altered water residence cycles, disconnection from upstream riverine habitats and backwaters, increased stratification, eutrophication, anoxia, and a general shift in biotic assemblages including plants, invertebrates, and fishes. We suggest that what is needed to cope with these changes is a perspective that focuses on maintaining ecosystem functionality rather than on retaining a certain species composition. To that end, we identify various strategies organized into planning, monitoring, and managing compartments. The coping strategies we identify are broad and general and represent a starting line applicable for developing creative alternatives relevant to local conditions. | | Miranda, L.E., G. Coppola, H.R.

A basin-scale perspective may increase awareness at a broader scope and generate insight not evident at local scales. We examined the diversity of reservoir attributes and fisheries in the Mississippi Basin to identify management opportunities. The basin is the third largest in the world and includes over 1,700 reservoirs >100 ha, the most of any river basin anywhere. Our bird's-eye view reveals a piecemeal approach where reservoirs are mostly administered at the local level. Basin-wide or catchment coordination to holistically address problems that recur across the basin is mostly lacking. A basin-wide coordination arrangement akin to the North American Waterfowl Management Plan could facilitate various facets of reservoir management. Such an arrangement may steer reservoir fisheries management through a potentially turbulent 21st century as reservoirs age beyond their useful life and climate shifts render status-quo management ineffective. | | Miranda, L.E., D.M.

Fisheries. https://doi.org/10.1002/fsh.10990 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/258219939840/None/all) | August 2023 || Reservoirs in the Mississippi Basin are facing three momentous threats. The first two, aging and climate change, are relatively slow-moving and their signal can be hard to discern given their stretched temporal scales. The third, species invasions, is faster-paced and discernable within shorter temporal scales and restricted spatial scales. Aging and climate directly impact reservoir environments and indirectly their biotic communities. Climate change is expected to interact with aging to speed up and, in some instances, slow down aging. Conversely, invasions primarily imperil biotic communities but can also impact environmental elements. This triple jeopardy is expected to transform reservoir environs and their biotic assemblages in various, often uncertain, ways. I take a broad view of these threats within the Mississippi Basin. A basin-scale perspective, in contrast to a single reservoir or regional scale, may enhance awareness of reservoirs at a larger level and produce understanding less evident at local levels, hence possibly offering a wider range of choices for confronting threats. My aim was to (1) provide a synopsis of the assemblage of reservoirs and their attributes over the Mississippi Basin, (2) describe the issues related to aging, climate change, and invasions, and (3) consider a conservation framework suitable for confronting these pressures. Given the overlapping temporal, spatial, and ecological effects of these threats, it is essential to address their effects simultaneously. | | Miranda, L.E. 2023.

This positive relationship implies that abundance increases faster than occupancy, so populations that occupy more sites also tend to occupy them at higher abundances. Plainly, there is a limit to the sites available for a species to occupy, so as the population expands numerically, abundance at a site must also increase. The pattern may differ across species and geography depending on aspects such as species vital rates, resource use, and resource availability. I investigated abundance-occupancy patterns of three black basses Micropterus (Centrarchidae) in reservoirs of the mainstem Tennessee River, USA. The dataset included relative abundance estimates made at 7,237 sites in nine reservoirs sampled during 1997-2018 for 43,243 black bass including 67% Largemouth 14% Bass M. dolomieu, and 19% Spotted Bass M. punctulatus. As relative abundance increased due to natural annual population fluctuations, occupancy also increased but faster for Largemouth Bass and more slowly for Smallmouth Bass and Spotted Bass. Largemouth Bass abundance was spread more thinly over many sites, and Smallmouth Bass and Spotted Bass abundance was spread more thickly over fewer sites. The recognition that black bass populations that decline in occupancy face the additional burden of disproportionally larger decreases in abundance per site, or that black bass that decline in abundance per site face decreases in occupancy, has various conservation and habitat management implications | | Milsap, B.

We documented changes in genetic diversity in an isolated, reintroduced population of bobcats on Cumberland Island (CUIS), Georgia, USA, compared to another bobcat population on Kiawah Island, South Carolina that was naturally established and experiences limited immigration from the mainland. The CUIS population declined from 32 reintroduced bobcats in 1989 to 10-24 individuals during 2012-2019, and observed heterozygosity declined from 0.72 (SE = 0.024) to 0.63 (SE = 0.039). Observed heterozygosity of bobcats on Kiawah was 0.699 (SE = 0.026). We estimated that one bobcat immigrated to Kiawah Island every 5.3 years. We compared the predictions of a population viability analysis (PVA) to empirical estimates of abundance and genetic diversity on CUIS and used the PVA to identify management actions that are likely to support long-term viability. Mean heterozygosity from the PVA (0.588, SD = 0.065) was within 1 standard deviation of the empirical estimate. The PVA estimated the population would decline following population restoration due to loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding depression. Translocations of one female every four years would stabilize allele heterozygosity, but even translocations of two females every two years would not restore heterozygosity. The PVA predicted no management action would result in a one in five probability of extinction within 50 years of reintroduction, but all translocation strategies nearly eliminated extinction risk through 100 years. | | Miller, W.M., C.M.

Fish Predation on a Landscape Scale. Submitted to Ecological Applications. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/192983001088/None/all) | June 2020 || Spatial patterns and environmental predictors of predator-prey dynamics are often investigated at discrete locations, limiting our ability to extrapolate to broader landscape scales. At these broader scales, landscapes often contain multiple complex and heterogeneous habitats, thus a spatially balanced sample throughout the different habitats is necessary to sufficiently represent them. This challenge is especially pronounced in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where the landscape scale impact of fish predators on native prey fish is information needed by managers to protect multiple imperiled populations. During the spring of 2017, we quantified relative predation risk in the southern half of the Delta (South Delta) using floating baited tethers that record the exact time and location of predation events. We selected 20 study sites (1-km long) using a generalized random tessellation stratified survey design, which allowed us to infer relationships between the environment and predation across a broader spatial scale compared to previous studies. In addition to estimating relative predation risk at each study site, we also collected relevant environmental covariates including distance to nearest predators, water temperature, turbidity, depth, bottom slope, bottom roughness, water velocity, and distance to nearest riverbank and nearest submerged aquatic vegetation. We employed model selection to determine the environmental covariates that best predicted predation risk. Our most parsimonious model included water temperature, time of day, mean predator distance, and river bottom roughness. Using this model, we estimated predation risk for the entire South Delta at a 1-km resolution. This effort identified certain predation risk hotspots - the most important of which was corroborated by other studies - and allowed us to generate predicted survival rates for migrating fish transiting the South Delta. Because the 2017 water year was unusually wet, this methodology should be repeated across a suite of hydrologically distinct years to further develop the relationships. | | Michael, P.E., K.M Hixson, J.S.

In this study, we collaborated with recreational river runners and other citizen scientists in Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA to record bat activity and sample riparian insects for one hour at dusk from April through October in 2017-2020. Citizen scientists collected 1,428 paired samples on 611 sampling nights at 410 sampling sites throughout a 470 km segment of river. Light traps collected a total of 71 insect taxa and acoustic monitors detected 19 bat species. We hypothesized that bat activity would be positively related to insect catch rates. Additionally, we predicted that bat activity in the riparian zone would be unrelated to terrestrial insect abundance. We fit Bayesian regression models to test these hypotheses as well as other competing hypotheses regarding the potential effects of quantify the relation between and environmental variables including time-of-year, time-of-day, distance downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, channel width, riparian vegetation density, air temperature, and lunar phase. We found that bat activity was positively related to the abundance of aquatic flies (Diptera), which outcompeted other prey categories in our models. We also found that activity of small Myotis (Myotis californicus and M. yumanensis) was higher later in the evening and that canyon bats (Parastrellus hesperus), conversely, were more active earlier in the evening. Activity of canyon bats also varied seasonally, with peak activity in August. Our results highlight the importance of aquatic flies as prey for bats along a large, regulated river corridor and demonstrate the power of citizen science as a tool for ecosystem monitoring. | | Messinger, L.N., E.F.

However, the effectiveness of e-flow programs may be limited by a singular focus on ensuring adequate flow conditions at local sites, which overlooks the role of other ecological processes. Recent advances in metasystem ecology have shown that biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functions across river networks result from the interplay of local (environmental filtering and biotic interactions) and regional (dispersal) processes. No guidelines currently exist to account for these processes in designing e-flows. We address this gap, providing a step-by-step operational framework of how e-flows can be designed to conserve or restore metasystem dynamics. Our recommendations are relevant to diverse regulatory contexts and can improve e-flow outcomes even in basins with limited in situ data. | | Merkle, J. et al.

Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/214490431488/None/all) | January 2022 || Site fidelity, or returning to previously visited locations, is a behavior observed across taxa and ecosystems. By developing familiarity with a particular location, site fidelity provides a range of benefits and is advantageous in stable or predictable environments. Yet, the Anthropocene is characterized by rates of environmental change that outpace the evolutionary history of extant taxa. Such change can drive site fidelity to become maladaptive. Here we outline the theoretical underpinnings for maladaptive site fidelity and synthesize empirical research supporting its occurrence. We examine maladaptive site fidelity in the context of a related concept, ecological traps, whereby organisms exhibit maladaptive behavior in habitat selection. We discuss adaptive mechanisms that may enable species with site fidelity to persist in the Anthropocene. With ongoing environmental change, researchers and practitioners should expect fidelity-induced ecological traps to become relatively common, and initiate projects to identify, understand, and conserve this widespread and ecologically important behavior. | | Mensinger, M., Brehm, A., Mortelliti, A., Blomberg, E., Zydlewski, J.

USGS FSP IP- 136834. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/229407119360/None/all) | January 2023 || Increased drought frequency and severity due to climate change can compound development pressures on water storage reservoirs throughout the western U.S. with uncertain effects on economically and ecologically valuable fisheries. Island Park Reservoir is a mid-sized hypolimnetic-release water storage reservoir on the Henrys Fork River in Idaho that supports a popular sport fishery for kokanee <i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>. A region-wide drought in 2021 provided an opportunity to use Island Park Reservoir as a case study to examine how drought-induced drawdown affects kokanee habitat. We hypothesized that drawdown reduces the volume of water in the reservoir featuring \"optimal\" water quality for kokanee. We monitored water quality at five locations in Island Park Reservoir from spring turnover to fall turnover, from which we calculated the approximate volume of for kokanee. We found severe drawdown had a disproportionately negative impact on kokanee habitat availability. Although there was spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the availability of optimal and survivable conditions, drawdown for downstream water supply was the central mechanistic driver of declines in optimal and survivable conditions. Our findings explain interannual patterns in long-term kokanee spawning run return numbers, which were higher with higher reservoir carryover. Water conservation and precision management in the Henrys Fork watershed saved ~39 million m<sup>3 </sup>(32,000 acre-feet) in Island Park Reservoir in 2021, resulting in a ~150% increase in future spawning kokanee numbers from ~250 to ~650 in the 4,500 m study reach. Our study highlights the effects of drawdown on fisheries in water storage reservoirs and illustrates the degree to which hydrologic management, including projects to reduce water consumption, can benefit reservoir fish populations. | | McKnight, D.T., K.

Spawning patterns of Pacific herring (<i>Clupea pallasii</i>) were examined in Prince William Sound (1973-2019) where the population collapsed in 1993 and has failed to recover. Abrupt shifts in spawn distribution preceded the rapid increase in population size in the 1980s and later its collapse by one and two years, respectively. As the population declined, spawning contracted away from historically productive regions towards southeastern areas of the Sound, and the proportion of occupied spawning areas declined from 65% to <9%. Spatial differences in spawn timing variation were also apparent, as the median spawn date shifted earlier by 26 days in eastern and 15 days in western areas of Prince William Sound between 1980 and 2006, and then shifted later by 25 (eastern) and 19 (western) days over a 7-year period. Effects of contracted spawning areas and timing shifts on first-year survival and recruitment are uncertain and require future investigation. | | McGowan CP, Lyons JE, and Smith DR. 2020 Adaptive management of horseshoe crab harvest in Delaware Bay: decision implementation and the double-loop process, in Runge MC, Converse SJ, Lyons JE, Smith DR.

North American Journal of Fisheries Management 42 (2), 295-306 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/227944955904/None/all) | March 2022 || The release of live baitfish by anglers has been identified as a high-risk pathway for aquatic invasive species due to the potential for invasive fish, invertebrates, or pathogens to be released simultaneously with the baitfish. Consequently, the release of live baitfish is illegal in many jurisdictions, but little is known about compliance rates or motivations for illegal release. To assess the incidence of live baitfish release in Minnesota, USA, a state with significant live baitfish use and substantial recreational fisheries, we administered a mailed survey to a random sample of anglers who held a 2018-2019 annual fishing license and received 671 completed responses. To mitigate potential recall bias, we also administered 345 intercept surveys at waterbody access sites around the state asking anglers about the current day's behaviors. Four hundred and eighty-one (72%) of the mailed survey respondents reported that they used live baitfish and of those, 99 (20%) reported that they release their leftover live baitfish into the water at least some of the time. Of the anglers surveyed at waterbody access sites, 59 (19%) were using live baitfish on the day they were surveyed and of those, 11 (18%) released their leftover baitfish into the water. The reasons provided for release included convenience and a misperception that released baitfish benefit the recipient ecosystem. Given the millions of fishing trips that occur every year, the current rate of baitfish release results in many chances for invasive species introduction. However, there is also significant opportunity for management interventions aimed at changing perceptions and providing convenient disposal alternatives to illegal release to reduce the risk presented by this pathway. | | McCullough, K., G.

The Candy Darter, <i>Etheostoma osburni</i>, is an endangered stream fish with a dramatically reduced distribution in Virginia in the eastern United States, now known from only four isolated populations. We used visual implant elastomer tags and microsatellite DNA markers to directly describe movement patterns in two populations. Parentage analysis based on parent-offspring pairs was used to infer movement patterns of young-of-year and age-1 individuals, as well as the reproductive contribution of certain adults. Direct measurements of movement distances were generally similar between methods, but microsatellite markers revealed greater distances moved, commensurate with greater spatial frames sampled. Parent-offspring pairs were found throughout the species' 18.8-km distribution in Stony Creek, while most parent-offspring pairs were in 2 km of the 4.25-km distribution in Laurel Creek. Sibship reconstruction allowed us to characterize the mating system and number of spawning years for adults. Our results provide the first measures of movement patterns of Candy Darter as well as the spatial distribution of parent-offspring pairs, which may be useful for selecting collection sites in source populations to be used for translocation or reintroductions. Our results highlight the importance of documenting species movement patterns and spatial distributions of related individuals as steps toward understanding population dynamics and informing translocation strategies. We also demonstrate that the reproductive longevity of this species is greater than previously described, which may be the case for other small stream fishes. | | Maynard-Bean, E. E. M. Kaye, T.

To accelerate the progress of the American Fisheries Society (AFS) towards diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), ten presentations and a group discussion provided context for our present efforts and suggested opportunities for synthesis that can enhance future successes. An introduction highlighted the value of coordinating existing strengths. A temporal perspective encouraged intergenerational teams to build on past achievements. Contributions of the Equal Opportunities Section, recommendations of the AFS DEI standing committee, citizen science educational programs, and the structure provided by historically black colleges and universities are existing strengths on which AFS can build. Although addressing power-differentials and institutional constraints are challenges, individuals have personal power to implement change. Furthermore, enhancing diversity can make individuals more successful, help professional teams solve difficult problems, and enhance AFS's effectiveness in resource conservation. Taking a long view temporally with a wide lens across within-society specializations, this symposium highlighted the advantages of a framework to coordinate ongoing activities as a component of a longer term strategic plan. | | Mather, M.

Drawing on transformations to sustainability scholarship, we review recent proposals for transformative change in biodiversity conservation, considering the suggested goals and means of transformation. We outline the crucial role for critical social scientific inquiry in transformative change by highlighting two core contributions. First, critical social science is an analytical device that politicises and pluralises debates and second, it can help facililitate the identification of transformative alternatives. We then show how such a critical social science approach is operationalised within the CONVIVA (Towards Convivial Conservation: Governing Human-Wildlife Interactions in the Anthropocene) project to pursue transformative change in biodiversity conservation. | | Maslovsky, K.S., P.

Effective methods to control blooms of this species in the field, however, are unavailable. This study examined five natural compounds present in the invasive plant <i>Arundo donax</i> and one synthetic derivative (5,6-dichlorogramine) for their effect on <i>P. parvum</i> growth. All compounds except one inhibited growth in the following order of potency: ellipticine>>5,6-dichlorogramine>1 H-indole = 2,4,6-trimethyl-benzonitrile>gramine. Ellipticine was by far the most potent inhibitor, with full algicidal activity at concentrations as low as 0.04 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and 3- and 9-day IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.012 and 0.007 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. A reduction in chlorophyll content and swimming activity and an increase in length and volume (swelling) were documented in algal cells exposed to 0.01-0.02 mg ellipticine L<sup>-1</sup>. These results show that ellipticine is among the most potent natural algicides identified to date. The sixth compound tested, oleamide, unexpectedly stimulated algal growth above control levels. Overall, these observations confirm the existence of highly potent anti-<i>P. parvum</i> allelochemicals in giant reed and demonstrate potential for using products derived from this plant in the development of natural, environmentally friendly methods to control harmful algal blooms. | | Martinez-Lanfranco, J.A., F.J.

Forest Ecology and Management 503:119765 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/216614180864/None/all) | January 2022 || Establishing commercial tree plantations in native grassland ecosystems introduces a fundamentally different structural and functional vegetation cover type, with expected implications for biodiversity. To better understand biodiversity responses to afforestation, we conducted a resource-use study, with birds as a focal group, during the 2013-2014 breeding season in the Northern Campos grasslands of Uruguay. We sampled birds in native environments and plantations of loblolly pine (<i>Pinus taeda</i>) and flooded gum (<i>Eucalyptus grandis</i>) at different rotation stages. We recorded 103 species during 1,573 10-min visits to 570 stratified sampling units. Grasslands and forests exhibited greater diversity and had greater variability in species composition than structurally homogeneous plantations. Avian communities in plantations had distinct species combinations and relative abundances not found in native conditions. Avian communities in older plantations were more similar to native forests while those of newly-planted stands were more like grasslands. However, communities in plantations were dominated by habitat generalists and some forest-dependent species, with negligible use by grassland specialist birds. Our results suggest the best conservation opportunities for grassland-dependent birds in afforested systems may depend on targeting larger and diverse landscape-level measures rather than stand-level management practices. Albeit our research constituted a comprehensive assessment of bird taxonomic alpha and beta diversity, research on complementary diversity facets and multi-scale resource selection and demographic studies are needed to better understand opportunities for conserving and managing grassland birds in afforested landscapes. | Orth. 2021. Coal-mining intensity influences species and trait distributions of stream fishes in two Central Appalachian watersheds. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 30: 347-365. DOI:10.1111/eff.12588. Documenting responses of biotic assemblages to coal-mining impacts is crucial to informing regulatory and reclamation actions. However, attributing biotic patterns to specific stressors is difficult given the dearth of pre-impact studies and prevalence of confounding factors. Analyzing species distributions and abundances, especially stratified by species traits, provides insights into how assemblage composition shifts occur. We evaluated stream habitats and fish assemblages along a mining intensity gradient in 83 headwater (2nd- and 3rd-order) streams of the upper Clinch and Powell river basins in Virginia. Our multivariate gradient (MINE.PC1) was based on percentages of watershed area covered by surface mine, underground mine, and valley fill to represent spatial variance in mining intensity. MINE.PC1 was positively correlated with conductivity and percentage of substrate as cobble. Forty fish-assemblage metrics were analyzed via boosted regression trees to assess assemblage responses to mining intensity, while accounting for environmental variation and spatial structure among sites. Conductivity and MINE.PC1 were strongly negatively related to reproductive metrics of assemblage composition responded strongly to mining intensity or its instream correlates. For example, coal mining favored omnivore-herbivores, but inhibited invertivores, simple lithophils, and nonsimple nonlithophils. We revealed distinct threshold responses to mining-related stressors, which suggest changes to macroinvertebrate prey availability and/or contaminant loads contribute to fish extirpations in coalfield streams. Future assessments of mining impacts on fish assemblages could be more instructive by including characterizations of physicochemical stressors and regionally-calibrated biotic metrics with demonstrated sensitivity to mining. | | Martin, T.

We assessed the relationships between oyster size, the relative proportion of females across size classes, and fecundity. Finally, we quantified reproductive potential (eggs m<sup>-2</sup>) of an engineered reef by connecting fecundity with annual oyster population demographic data as a means to assess population sustainability.The proportion of females generally increased with shell height, achieving a population with >50% females in Biloxi oysters >75 mm, and Grand Isle oysters >100 mm. Fecundity across both sites and seasons ranged from ~2,000 to >55 million eggs oyster<sup>-1</sup>. Mean fecundity generally increased with shell height, varying significantly by site with Grand Isle (high salinity) oysters having greater fecundity than Biloxi (low salinity) oysters. Fecundity did not differ by season. Mean reproductive potential (eggs m<sup>-2</sup>) was driven by density (i.e., reef type) and size distribution. Reef technologies with high densities and higher counts of market oysters had reproductive potential 5X greater than those with low densities and low counts of juvenile oysters.Synthesis and applications: With increasing changes in water quality from coastal management and climate, impacts on oyster reproduction may critically impact population sustainability. Reproductive potential provides critical data to assess individual reef ecosystem services, and potential for maintenance of local metapopulations. | | Marshall, D., M.K. La Peyre, responses from estuaries across an extensive gradient: an assessment of northwestern Gulf of Mexico estuaries based on stable isotopes. Limnology || Estuaries exist across a large climatic gradient in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, capturing a range of hydrologic conditions and estuarine functioning. We examined freshwater inflow, salinity and stable isotope compositions (<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N) of oysters, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), and surface sediment organic matter (SSOM) from five estuaries across the hydrologic gradient. All five estuaries experienced large decreases in freshwater inflow over the last 40 years, with three estuaries being subject to freshwater inflow reductions of more than 85%. Generally, these freshwater inflow decreases were associated with estuarine salinity increases. Across the spatial gradient, average salinity generally increased from northeast to southwest estuaries. SPOM in the northeastern, lower salinity estuaries generally contained more continental organic matter and was of higher quality (i.e., lower C/chlorophyll <i>a </i>ratio), as compared to southwestern, higher salinity estuaries. Similarly, both SSOM and oyster <sup>13</sup>C values were positively correlated with salinity, further highlighting that food webs in lower salinity estuaries are more greatly influenced by continental organic matter than those in higher salinity estuaries. A decrease in the connectivity between continental and coastal habitats may have broad consequences for flows of organic matter, and estuarine function and health. Conducting studies across large-scale hydrologic gradients can provide a useful approach to informing and predicting shifts in estuarine functioning. | | Marshall DA, Coxe NC, La Peyre MK, Walton W, Beseres Pollack J, Kelly M, La Peyre JF. 2021.

Conservation Physiology 9:10.1093/conjphys/coab065. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/211343032320/None/all) | May 2021 || The eastern oyster, <i>Crassostrea virginica,</i> is a key foundation species within U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) estuaries that has experienced substantial population declines. As changes from management and climate are expected to continue to impact estuarine salinity, understanding how local oyster populations might respond, and identifying populations with specific adaptations to more extreme changes in salinity will inform resource management, including restoration, and aquaculture programs. Wild oysters were therefore collected from four estuarine sites from Texas (Packery Channel = PC: 35.5 \u00b1 5.1 annual mean salinity, Aransas Bay = AB: 23.0 \u00b1 6.9) and Louisiana (Calcasieu Lake = CL: 16.2 \u00b1 2.8, Vermilion Bay = VB: 7.4 \u00b1 1.6) and spawned. The progeny were compared in field and laboratory studies under different salinity regimes. For the field study, oysters were deployed at low (6.4 \u00b1 5.1) and moderate (16.5 \u00b1 6.5) salinity sites in Alabama, USA. Growth and mortality were measured monthly. Condition index (CI), dermo infection intensity and shell height to weight ratio were measured quarterly. For the laboratory studies, oysters were exposed to salinities of 2.0, 4.0, 20.0 (or 22.0), 38.0 and 44.0 with and without acclimation and mortality recorded. The results of these field and laboratory studies with (acclimation) indicated that PC oysters are adapted to high salinity conditions, and do not tolerate very low salinities. The AB stock seemed to show the highest plasticity as it performed as well as the PC stock at the high salinities and as well as the Louisiana stocks at the lowest salinity. The Louisiana stocks did not perform as well as at the Texas stocks at high salinities. Different results were obtained with oysters with no salinity acclimation which likely reflects their ability to withstand extended valve closures rather than their adaptability of survival in different salinities. | | Marschall, E.A., Glover, Parrish. 2021.

We simulated spawning at each river kilometer (RKM 138-280) on each day (1 April-31 August) to understand how spawning date and location drive larval recruitment differentially across years and decades. For both temperature and flow, inter-annual variation was large in comparison to interdecadal differences. Variation in simulated recruitment was best explained by a combination of season-specific temperature and location in along the course of the river. Greatest potential recruitment occurred in years in which June temperatures were relatively high. In years when June and July were warmer than average, maximum recruitment resulted from spawning taking place at the upstream portion of the modeled reach. Model scenarios (stationary or passive-drift larvae and dams or no dams) had predictable effects. When dams were present, but offspring were stationary, the area directly above the dams resulted in poor recruitment, due to the habitat being inappropriate for eggs. When offspring exhibited passive drift, they traveled far downstream. If dams were present, they frequently ended their movement at the dams. When larvae moved downstream but their movement was not limited by dams, spatial differences in expected recruitment relative to spawning sites were reduced. Our results demonstrate the importance of spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity for producing positive recruitment over the longterm. In addition, our results suggest the importance of successful passage of spawners to historical spawning sites upstream of Vernon Dam in the Connecticut River, especially as conditions shift with climate change. | | Marks-Fife, C.A., E.D.

Biological Invasions | January 2022 || Smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) are an invasive fish species that have experienced widespread range expansions in recent decades and can have deleterious effects on native fish communities. Rapidly assessing their invasions will aid conservation and management actions geared towards controlling their spread and mitigating their impacts. Smallmouth bass have recently experienced a rapid upstream expansion in a Great Plains river (Laramie River, Wyoming, USA), which provided an opportunity to determine the drivers and impacts of this expansion by using a modified before-after, control-impact (BACI) design. Our objectives were to determine whether climatic drivers were responsible for this range expansion and subsequent effects of the expansion on native fish communities. Smallmouth bass abundance in a local reservoir spiked following a climatically extreme wet year, with statistically extreme amounts of spring-time and June precipitation creating high discharge events that coincided with the upstream expansion. Unlike previous studies highlighting the invasive nature of smallmouth bass, the modified BACI analysis revealed no declines in species richness induced by the expansion. However, there was evidence that native small-bodied minnow species (family <i>Cyprinidae</i>) declined in relative abundance and that community-level and species-level trophic niches were compressed for invaded sites. Our findings provide important insight into how climatic extremes can prompt biological invasions and how some invasions may not produce immediate negative effects on community diversity. | | Marjadi, M.N., A.H.

Ecosphere, 11:e03259. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/195413743616/None/all) | October 2020 || Close-kin mark-recapture is a powerful new method for the assessment of fish and wildlife populations. Unlike traditional mark-recapture techniques, the use of kinship as an identifying \"mark\" is robust to many forms of capture heterogeneity including variation in gear efficiency and tagging-based effects such as loss and differential mortality. In addition, close-kin methods can be applied to a wider range of sampling designs than traditional methods including single-occasion surveys, can provide retrospective historical abundance estimates, and can produce survival estimates from as few as two sampling occasions. We evaluated the ability of close-kin mark-recapture to provide estimates of abundance and adult survival, and then compared results to those from traditional mark-recapture. This analysis incorporated data from a three year study of lake resident brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) where individuals were both physically (Passive Integrated Transponder, PIT) tagged and genotyped for 44 <i>de novo</i> developed microsatellites with high throughput sequencing. Traditional mark-recapture estimates were derived using Pollock's Robust Design, relying upon three primary \"open\" sampling occasions and four secondary \"closed\" occasions. We found that close-kin methods produced contemporary estimates of adult abundance and survival that were similar to those produced by traditional mark-recapture in both magnitude and precision. Furthermore, close-kin mark-recapture provided abundance estimates for multiple years prior to sampling and, when restricted to data from a single year, could still produce reliable abundance estimates for at least one and as many as three years. Retrospective abundance estimates corresponded with those from a separate historical two-sample mark-recapture dataset. This study provides support for the use of close-kin mark-recapture as a robust and sampling-efficient alternative to traditional mark-recapture methods of assessing population parameters. | | Manning, S.

Whereas existing protocols for obtaining DNA from reptile scat focus on analyses of whole, fresh scat deposited during animal handling, the collection of scat naturally deposited by reptiles <i>in situ</i>, as required for non-invasive population monitoring, requires protocols to extract highly degraded DNA. Using surface swabs from such scats can reduce PCR inhibition, ecological impacts of removing scat, and zoonotic risks. We report on three related but independently designed studies of DNA analyses from scat swabs of herbivorous reptiles under natural desert conditions: desert tortoise (Agassiz's US) and the common chuckwalla (<i>Sauromalus atar</i>) (Arizona, US, and Sonora, MX). We analyzed samples from both tortoise species with the same set of 16 microsatellites and chuckwalla samples with four mtDNA markers; studies also varied in swab preservation medium and DNA extraction method. Microsatellite amplification success per sample, defined as 9 loci with amplification, varied between studies, with 15% for tortoise and 42% Morafka's desert tortoise. For chuckwallas, we successfully amplified and sequenced 50% of samples. We recovered fragments up to 400 bp for tortoises and 980 bp for chuckwallas from scat swab samples. This study demonstrates that genotypes can successfully be obtained from swabs of herbivorous reptile scat collected in the field under natural environmental conditions and emphasizes that repeat amplifications are necessary for genetic identification of individuals from non-invasive samples. | | Mangan, A.O., T.

Unsustainable, continuous, and rapid alterations within and between coupled human and natural systems have significantly disrupted wildlife disease dynamics. Direct and indirect anthropogenic factors, such as climate change, pollution, encroachment, urbanization, travel, and trade, can hinder wildlife immune systems and exacerbate disease vulnerability. These factors can also increase the probability of viral spillover as well as zoonotic disease transmission and propagation at large scales. In this review, we present a novel framework to study anthropogenic impacts within coupled human and natural systems that facilitate emerging infectious disease outbreaks involving wildlife. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to Fibropapillomatosis disease of marine turtles. We aim to articulate the intricate and complex nature of anthropogenically-exacerbated wildlife infectious diseases as multifactorial as Fibropapillomatosis. This paper encourages the adoption of a One Health approach and invites the collaboration of multiple disciplines for the achievement of effective and long-lasting conservation and wildlife disease mitigation outcomes. | | Mandeville, A.W.

This study applies the NOAA Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment method to 64 federally-managed species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem to assess their vulnerability to climate change, where vulnerability is a function of a species' exposure to environmental change and its biological sensitivity to a set of environmental conditions, which includes components of its resiliency and adaptive capacity to respond to these new conditions. Overall, two-thirds of the species were judged to have Moderate or greater vulnerability to climate change, and only one species was anticipated to have a positive response. Species classified as Highly or Very Highly vulnerable share one or more characteristics including: 1) having complex life histories that utilize a wide range of freshwater and marine habitats; 2) having habitat specialization, particularly for areas that are likely to experience increased hypoxia; 3) having long lifespans and low population growth rates; and/or 4) being of high commercial value combined with impacts from non-climate stressors such as anthropogenic habitat degradation. Species with Low or Moderate vulnerability are either habitat generalists, occupy deep-water habitats or are highly mobile and likely to shift their ranges. As climate-related changes intensify, this work provides key information for both scientists and managers as they address the long-term sustainability of fisheries in the region. This information will inform near-term advice for prioritizing species-level data collection and research on climate impacts, help managers to determine when and where a precautionary approach might be warranted, in harvest or other management decisions, and help identify habitats or life history stages that might be especially important to protect or restore. | | L\u00f3pez-Altarriba, E., Pati\u00f1o, R., V\u00e1zquez-Sauceda, M.L., P\u00e9rez-Casta\u00f1eda, R., Arellano-M\u00e9ndez, L.U., Ventura, R., Heyer, L. 2020.

Bioscience, 72:45-56. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/225974190080/None/all) | January 2022 || Intensifying global change is propelling many ecosystems towards irreversible transformations. Natural resource managers face the complex task of conserving these important resources under unprecedented conditions and expanding uncertainty. As once familiar ecological conditions disappear, traditional management approaches that assume the future will reflect the past are becoming increasingly untenable. Here, we place adaptive management within the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework to assist informed risk-taking for transforming ecosystems. This approach empowers managers to use familiar techniques associated with adaptive management in the unfamiliar territory of ecosystem transformation. By providing a common lexicon, it gives decision makers agency to revisit objectives, consider new system trajectories, and discuss RAD strategies in relation to current system state and direction of change. Operationalizing RAD adaptive management requires periodic review and update of management actions and objectives; monitoring, experimentation, and pilot studies; and bet hedging to better identify and tolerate associated risks. | | Lynch A.

Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 19:461-469. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/209411586048/None/all) | October 2021 || Ecosystem transformation involves the emergence of a self-organizing, self-sustaining, ecological or social-ecological system that diverges, dramatically and irreversibly, from prior ecosystem structure and function. Such transformations are occurring at increasing rates across the globe owing to rapid changes in climate, land use, and prevalence of introduced species. Consequently, a dynamic view of ecosystem processes that accommodates rapid, irreversible change will be critical for effectively conserving fish, wildlife, and other species. However, managing ecosystems toward states with novel structure and function is an inherently unpredictable and difficult task. We suggest that managers navigating ecosystem transformation consider broader objectives beyond a traditional focus on resisting ecosystem change, and also consider whether accepting inevitable change or directing it to some desirable outcome is more appropriate under some circumstances (R-A-D strategies). By explicitly acknowledging system transformation and implementing an iterative R-A-D approach, natural-resource managers can be deliberate and strategic in addressing radical ecosystem changes. | | Luukkonen, B.Z, O.E.

As a result, focus has shifted from restoration to managing harvest and addressing humangoose conflict. Conflict persists or is increasing in urban areas throughout the Mississippi Flyway. Managers need more information regarding demographic rates to determine how hunting affects geese breeding in urban areas and what management actions may be required to achieve management goals. We estimated survival, dead recovery, live recapture, and fidelity probabilities using data from 77,872 Canada geese banded in Iowa, USA, during 1999-2019 using Burnham joint live-dead band recovery models. Factors predicted to affect parameters in candidate models included age (juvenile, subadult, adult), banding site (urban, rural), time, trend, harvest regulation index, and winter severity index. We predicted Canada geese banded in urban areas would have higher survival and lower dead recovery rates than geese banded at rural sites. The top model indicated support for age and banding site effects, and trends in survival and recovery rate (Brownie parameterization). Adult survival was similar for urban (0.75;range=0.60-0.92) and rural (0.75; range=0.66-0.82) geese and relatively constant across years. Mean juvenile survival was lower in urban (0.74; range=0.48-0.93) than rural (0.85; range=0.68-0.92) areas. Survival increased for urbanbanded juveniles and recovery rates increased during liberalization of harvest regulations and decreased after regulations stabilized. Recovery rates of subadults increased for the urban and rural groups. Our results suggest Canada geese breeding in urban areas contribute to harvest and specialized regulations can affect these populations. Harvest regulations in place during our analysis may not have reached a threshold required to observe substantial changes in survival. Current humangoose conflict in urban areas suggests survival has not decreased to a level required to completely address conflict via reduction in goose abundance. Managers may consider additional liberalization of harvest regulations and monitoring via banding to determine to what degree hunter harvest contributes to reducing humangoose conflict and what additional management actions will be required to achieve goals. | | Lundblad, C.G., and C.

Once common, kit foxes have declined from historical levels. Research on kit foxes in western Utah has spanned nearly 70 years and has potential to inform management and conservation within the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion of the Great Basin Desert. We conducted a systematic literature review on the northern kit fox subspecies V. m. nevadensis. We focused on studies conducted in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion, which represents the majority of the Great Basin Desert, and provided a comprehensive summary of their ecology and demographics for resource managers. To guide future monitoring, we also reviewed techniques used for kit fox monitoring and research, and evaluated the strengths, limitations, and advances of these techniques. We identified four key factors that deserve consideration when selecting monitoring techniques for kit foxes: estimable parameters, reliability, cost, and rate of data return. Finally, we identify four primary management recommendations. We recommend that managers (i) expand kit fox monitoring and population assessments more broadly across the Great Basin Desert. To ensure future monitoring meets the needs of resource managers, we recommend (ii) the application of a structured decision-making process to identify key parameters and approaches. To better understand the factors limiting kit fox populations we recommend (iii) population viability and parameter sensitivity analyses to identify drivers of population change. Finally, based on evidence that genetic diversity of kit fox populations has been maintained by undescribed patterns of gene flow, we recommend (iv) a broad-scale assessment of population connectivity to identify corridors supporting metapopulation dynamics. These recommendations will facilitate proactive conservation of kit foxes and management practices to reduce future population declines. | | Lonsinger, R. C., R. N. Knight, and L. P. Waits. 2021. Detection criteria and post-field sample processing influence results and cost efficiency of occupancy-based monitoring. Ecological Application 31(7): e02404. || Optimization of occupancy-based monitoring has focused on balancing the number of sites and surveys to minimize field efforts and costs. When survey techniques require post-field processing of samples to confirm species detections, there may be opportunities to further improve efficiency. We used scat-based noninvasive genetic sampling for kit foxes (<i>Vulpes macrotis</i>) in Utah, USA, as a model system to assess post-field data processing strategies, evaluate the impacts of these strategies on estimates of occupancy and associations between parameters and predictors, and identify the most cost-effective approach. We identified scats with three criteria that varied in costs and reliability: (i) field-based identification (expert opinion), (ii) statistical-based morphological identification, and (iii) genetic-based identification (mitochondrial DNA). We also considered four novel post-field sample processing strategies that integrated statistical and genetic identifications to reduce costly genetic procedures, including (iv) a combined statistical-genetic identification, (v) a genetic removal design, (vi) a within-survey conditional-replicate design, and (vii) a single-genetic-replicate with false-positive modeling design. We considered results based on genetic identification as the best approximation of truth and used this to evaluate the performance of alternatives. Field-based and statistical-based criteria prone to misidentification produced estimates of occupancy that were biased high (~1.8 and 2.1 times higher than estimates without misidentifications, respectively). These criteria failed to recover associations between parameters and predictors consistent with genetic identification. The genetic removal design performed poorly, with limited detections leading to estimates that were biased high with poor precision and patterns inconsistent with genetic identification. Both statistical-genetic identification and the conditional-replicate design produced occupancy estimates comparable to genetic identification, while recovering the same model structure and associations at cost reductions of 67% and 74%, respectively. The false-positive design had the lowest cost (88% reduction) and recovered patterns consistent with genetic identification but had occupancy estimates that were ~32% lower than estimated occupancy based on genetic identification. Our results demonstrate that careful consideration of detection criteria and post-field data processing can reduce costs without significantly altering resulting inferences. Combined with earlier guidance on sampling designs for occupancy modeling, these findings can aid managers in optimizing occupancy-based monitoring. | | Lonsinger, R. C., P. M. Lukacs, E. M.

Advances in noninvasive genetic sampling have fueled an increase in the use of noninvasive genetic sampling- based capture-recapture. However, when working with free-ranging populations of unknown size, managers often lack data necessary to select the appropriate estimator. This leads to uncertainty regarding how choice of estimator or sampling design influence estimates, and managers may select estimators based on funding or logistical constraints. Alternatively, comparing estimates from multiple estimators can provide managers with greater confidence in estimates, or highlight potential differences. We used noninvasive genetic sampling to estimate the abundance of free-ranging kit foxes <i>Vulpes macrotis</i> and coyotes <i>Canis latrans</i>. We estimates of abundance with two non-spatial likelihood- based estimators: 1) robust design Huggins capture-recapture models and 2) single-occasion capture with replacement (CAPWIRE) models. We compared these with recently published estimates derived from spatially explicit capture- recapture (SECR) models. For both species, estimates from Huggins models were generally lower than those from SECR. Abundance estimates from CAPWIRE, which was developed specifically for noninvasive genetic sampling and generates estimates from a single sampling occasion, tended to be biased low with high precision. Our results suggest that choice of estimator and sampling design can significantly influence estimates, and that the relationship between estimators varied between species. Our results further suggest that single-occasion sampling often employed with CAPWIRE abundance estimation may produce biased results and be inappropriate for species requiring dispersed sampling strategies. | | Lonsinger, R.

Online early. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/256215644160/None/all) | July 2023 || Effective conservation requires near-real-time multi-species monitoring at broad scales. Remote cameras have become a widespread data-collection tool for terrestrial mammals, but classifying images can be labor intensive and limit the usefulness of cameras for rapid, broad-scale population assessments. Machine learning algorithms for automated image classification can expedite data processing, but image misclassifications may influence inferences. Here, we used camera data for three sympatric species with disparate body sizes and life histories\u2014black-tailed americana</i>)\u2014as a model system to evaluate the influence of competing image classification approaches on estimates of occupancy and inferences about space use patterns. We classified images with: (i) single review (manual), (ii) double review (manual by two observers), (iii) an automated-manual review (machine learning to cull empty images and single review of remaining images), (iv) a pre-trained machine-learning algorithm that classifies images to species (base model), (v) the base model accepting only classifications with 95% confidence, (vi) the base model trained with regional images (trained model), and (vii) the trained model accepting only classifications with 95% confidence. We compared species-specific results from alternative approaches to results from double review, which reduces the potential for misclassifications and was assumed to be the best approximation of truth. Despite high classification success, species-level misclassification rates for the base and trained models were sufficiently high to produce erroneous occupancy estimates and inferences related to patterns of space use across species. Increasing the confidence thresholds for image classification to 95% did not consistently improve performance. Classifying images as empty (or not) offered a reasonable approach to reduce effort (by 97.7%) and facilitated a semi-automated workflow that produced reliable estimates and inferences. Thus, camera-based monitoring combined with machine learning algorithms for image classification could facilitate near-real-time monitoring with limited manual image classification. | | Lonsinger, R.

Alternatively, historical samples can provide insights into changes in genetic diversity and effective population size (<i>N</i><sub>e</sub>). Kit foxes (<i>Vulpes macrotis</i>) are a species of conservation concern across much of their range. In western Utah, kit fox abundance has declined precipitously from historical levels, causing concern about population persistence. We analyzed genetic samples from museum specimens and contemporary scats to evaluate temporal changes in (a) genetic diversity and (b) <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> for kit foxes in western Utah, and (c) discuss our findings with respect to population risk and conservation. The <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> of kit foxes in western Utah has decreased substantially. When compared to established conservation thresholds for <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> (e.g., the 50/500 rule), observed levels suggest the population may be at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction. In contrast, we found no significant decrease in genetic diversity associated with declining <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. We detected evidence of low levels of immigration into the population and suspect genetic diversity may have been maintained by this previously undescribed gene flow from adjacent populations. Low or intermittent immigration may serve to temper the potential shortterm negative consequences of low <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. We recommend that kit fox conservation efforts focus on evaluating and maintaining landscape connectivity. We demonstrate how historical specimens can provide a baseline of comparison for contemporary populations, highlighting the importance of natural history collections to conservation during a period of declining funding and support. | | Lonsinger, R.

Destructive sampling for DNA may be in disagreement with NHC goals of long-term care and maintenance. Differentiating quality among sample sources can direct destructive sampling to the source predicted to yield the highest quality DNA and most reliable data, potentially reducing damage to specimens, laboratory costs, and genotyping errors. We used the kit fox (<i>Vulpes macrotis</i>) as a model species and evaluated the quality and reliability of genetic data obtained from carnivoran specimens via three different sample sources: cranial bones, nasal bones, and toepads. We quantified variation in microsatellite amplification success and genotyping error rates and assessed the reliability of source- specific genic data. Toepads had the highest amplification success rates and lowest genotyping error rates. Shorter loci had higher amplification success and lower allelic dropout rates than longer loci. There were substantial differences in the reliability of resulting multilocus genotypes. Toepads produced the most reliable data, required the fewest replicates, and therefore, had the lowest costs to achieve reliable data. Our results demonstrate that the quality of DNA obtained from specimens varies by sample source and can inform NHCs when evaluating requests for destructive sampling. Our results suggest that prior to large-scale specimen sampling, researchers should conduct pilot studies to differentiate among source-specific data reliability, identify high performing loci, reduce costs of analyses, and minimize destructive sampling. | | Lonsinger, R. C. 2022. Co-occurrence models fail to infer underlying patterns of avoidance and aggregation when closure is violated. Ecology and Evolution 7: e9104. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/230158575616/None/all) | June 2022 || Advances in multi-species monitoring approaches have led to an increase in the use of multi-species occupancy analyses to assess patterns of co-occurrence among species, even when data were collected at spatial or temporal scales that likely violated the assumption that sites were closed to changes in occupancy state for the target species. Violating the closure assumption may lead to erroneous conclusions related to patterns of co-occurrence among species. Patterns of occurrence for two hypothetical species were simulated under patterns of avoidance, aggregation, or independence, when the closure assumption either was or was not met. Simulated populations were sampled at two levels (<i>N = </i>250 or 100 sites) and two scales of temporal resolution for surveys. Sample data were analysed with conditional two-species occupancy models and performance was assessed by comparing the proportion of simulations recovering the true pattern of co-occurrence. Estimates of occupancy were unbiased when closure was met, but biased when closure violations occurred; bias increased when sample size was small and encounter histories were collapsed to a large-scale temporal resolution. When patterns of avoidance and aggregation were simulated, conditional two-species models tended to correctly find support for non-independence when closure was met and estimated species interaction factors aligned with predicted values. Models tended to incorrectly infer a pattern of independence when closure was violated and power to detect simulated patterns of avoidance or aggregation decreased with smaller sample size. Simulation results suggest that when the closure assumption is violated, occupancy-based models of co-occurrence often fail to detect underlying patterns of avoidance or aggregation and incorrectly identify a pattern of independence among species, which could have negative consequences for our understanding of species interactions and conservation efforts. When closure is not met, inferred patterns of independence from multi-species occupancy models should be interpreted cautiously. In contrast, when violations of the closure assumption likely occur, evidence of avoidance or aggregation is likely a conservative estimate of true pattern or interaction. | | Long, J.M., W.W.

DOI: 10.1002/tafs.10108 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/160943970304/None/all) | November 2018 || Gar (Lepisosteidae) are increasingly being managed as native components of the ecosystem rather than being reviled as they once were. There is a paucity of information on early life history for many species, which would aid their conservation and management. Daily rings in otoliths are useful for determining many early life-history parameters, such as growth rates and date of hatch, but properly interpreting these structures requires additional information on otolith formation. Gar represent an ancient lineage and their otoliths are unlike those of teleost fishes that have been better studied. We used computed tomography (CT) X-ray scanning and oxytetracycline (OTC) marking of a series of known-age fish from hatch through 10-12 days post-hatch (dph) to understand the formation of otoliths in Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus, a species that is of management concern in several parts of its range in North America. Otoliths, sagittae and lapilli, began as a loose associations of otoconia at hatch, fused and hardened into single crystals by 4 dph, in concert with the transition from attached larvae to free-swimming juvenile. Asterisci otoliths were not observed in any of the individuals examined through 12 dph. Oxytetracycline marks were not observed on individuals treated at hatch and variable marks were detected at 1 dph through 5 dph. By 6 dph, 100% of individuals exhibited OTC marks on sagittae and lapilli. Daily rings could not be discerned until fish were marked 4 dph, after which, daily age estimates increased linearly with fish age. Results of this study verify that otoliths (sagittae and lapilli) of Spotted Gar and their daily rings form several days after hatch, in relation to the transition from sessile, attached larvae to free-swimming juvenile. | | Long, J.M. and M.J.

Springer Publishing. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/204906115072/None/all) | December 2020 || Coal mining has been one of many anthropogenic stressors that have impacted terrestrial and semi-aquatic wildlife and their habitats in the Appalachian Plateau since European settlement of the region. Creation of large grassland and early-successional habitats resulting from mining in a largely forested landscape has resulted in novel, non-analog habitat conditions throughout the Appalachian Plateau. Depending on the taxa, extent of mining at the local and landscape level, and reclamation practices, effects have ranged across a gradient of wholly negative to positive. Forest-obligate species such as woodland salamanders and forest-interior birds and/or those that depend on aquatic systems for part or all of their life cycle have been most affected. Others, such as grassland and early-successional bird species have responded favorably. Some bat species, for example, as an unintended consequence, can use legacy deep mines as winter hibernacula in a region with limited Karst geology. Recovery and recolonization of impacted wildlife that often depends not only on life strategies and species' vagility, but also on the altered or arrest successional processes on the post-surface mine landscape. Forest-obligate species will benefit from Forest Reclamation Approach practices going forward. In the future, managers will be faced with decisions about reforestation versus maintaining open habitats depending on the conservation need of species considered. Lastly, the post-mined landscape currently is the focal point for a region-wide effort to reintroduce and restore elk (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>) in the Appalachian region. | | Linner-Warren, K., B.D.

Journal of Raptor Research 57:251-263. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/231389655040/None/all) | June 2023 || ABSTRACT.\u2014The American Kestrel (<i>Falco sparverius</i>) is in general decline across its North American distribution but the population in the Southern High Plains region currently appears to be stable. Historical evidence suggests the region had a very low presence of kestrels, and that their current abundance is due to landscape changes associated with European settlement. We conducted monthly surveys for American Kestrels across two years to estimate seasonal densities and identify land cover associations in the Southern High Plains of Texas. We found an overall estimated density of a 0.99/km<sup>2</sup> (95% CI = 0.406, 1.582). across the two-year period with seasonal estimated densities highest in autumn and winter (0.92 - 2.53/km<sup>2</sup>), and lowest in spring (0.49 - 0.67/km<sup>2</sup>). Whereas other studies have found temperature influenced detection of wintering kestrels, we found an interaction of drought conditions and snow most strongly influenced detection rates in our study area. Kestrels largely used land cover types in proportion to availability but there was some evidence of seasonal shifts. In generally, they appeared to select against cotton fields and select for areas with woodlots, abandoned or occupied houses, and barns, all of which likely provided nesting and roosting opportunities. Our study provides the first contemporary assessment of seasonal abundance and habitat associations of American Kestrels in the Southern High Plains where their presence and abundance is has been unintentionally facilitated by landscape changes following settlement. We provide a baseline for population monitoring and studies assessing response to additional landscape changes (e.g., wind energy) and a changing climate. | | Link WA, SJ Converse, AA Yackel Adams, and NJ Hostetter. 2018.

In response, decisions about how much water should be stored in large reservoirs and how much water can be consumptively used will be necessary. These decisions have the potential to limit riverine ecosystem management options through the effect water-supply decisions have on reservoir elevations. We used projected hydrology and river temperatures to compare the outcome of combinations of water storage scenarios and consumptive use limits on metrics associated with ecosystem management of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. Ecosystem management metrics included the ability to implement designer flows, temperature suitability for fishes, and fragmentation. We compared current water management operations to prioritizing storage in either Lake Mead or Lake Powell combined with three levels of consumptive use. Projected reservoir levels limited environmental flow delivery and increased fragmentation regardless of where water was stored if consumptive use was not limited. Warmer river temperatures associated with low reservoir levels are likely, creating suitable conditions for non-native species of concern, such as smallmouth bass. Water storage decisions provided variability and management flexibility, but water storage was less important when less water was available, highlighting the importance of keeping water in the system to provide flexibility for achieving ecosystem goals. | | Lindelien S., A.C.

Features Influence Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus) Spawning Habitat Suitability in Arctic Alaska. For Ecosystems. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/216175953920/None/all) | April 2022 || Landscape-level geomorphic processes influence the spatial and temporal arrangement of fish habitats in freshwater ecosystems and fish move across riverscapes selecting a suite of habitats to maximize fitness. Here, we explore the influence of geomorphology on stream channel attributes and assess Broad Whitefish (<i>Coregonus nasus</i>) spawning habitat potential in the Colville River, in Arctic Alaska. Using high-resolution digital surface models (5 m<sup>2</sup>), we quantified the stream network extent and summarized channel habitat attributes continuously across the drainage network. Next, we developed an intrinsic potential (IP) model for Broad Whitefish by using geomorphic channel parameters previously understood to be associated with spawning habitats (channel width, median substrate size, and channel braiding) to estimate the potential of streams across the Colville River watershed to provide spawning habitat. Our model results show the majority of habitat with high IP ( 0.6) was located within the braided sections of the main channel, which encompass > 1,548 km, but only 2 % of the total channel network. The IP model was tested by tracking radio-tagged Broad Whitefish using aerial surveys. Prespawn fish moved into the watershed starting mid-July and mostly used habitat with moderate to very high IP in the middle and lower watershed. Several individuals were relocated in smaller anastomosing channels that contained very low IP ( 0.2), suggesting that other factors, such as hyporheic flow, may also influence spawning habitat selection. Our study demonstrates that IP modeling offers a useful method to quantify spawning habitat potential in data-poor riverscapes, providing useful information for managers to assess potential anthropogenic impacts, and develop conservation plans to protect essential Broad Whitefish habitat. | | Lennox, R., S.J.

We constructed a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) for American alligators (<i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>) in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA using records of mark-recapture-recovery, clutch size, harvest, and nightlight survey counts collected locally, and auxiliary information on fecundity, sex ratio, and growth from other studies. We created a multistate mark-recapture-recovery model with six size classes to estimate survival probability, and we linked it to a state-space count model to derive estimates of size class-specific detection probability and abundance. Because we worked from a count dataset in which 60% of the original observations were of unknown size, we treated size class as a latent property of detections and developed a novel observation model to make use of information where size could be partly observed. Detection probability was positively associated with alligator size and water temperature, and negatively influenced by water level. Survival probability was lowest in the smallest size class (hatchlings) but was relatively similar among the other five size classes (>0.90 for each). While the two nightlight survey count sites exhibited relatively stable population trends, we detected substantially different patterns in size class-specific abundance and trends between each site, including 30-50% declines in the largest size classes at the site with greater hunting activity. Here, we illustrate the use of IPMs to produce high resolution output of latent population structure that is partially observed during the monitoring process. | | Lawson, A.J., Application of qualitative value of information to prioritize uncertainties about eastern black rail population recovery.

The question for the decision maker is whether the uncertainty is an impediment to the decision and, if so, whether it is worth reducing uncertainty before or while implementing actions. Value of information (VoI) methods are decision analytical tools to evaluate the benefit to the decision maker of resolving uncertainty. These methods, however, require quantitative predictions of the outcomes as a function of management alternatives and uncertainty, predictions which may not be available at early stages of decision prototyping. Here we describe the first participatory application of a new qualitative approach to VoI in an adaptive management workshop for Atlantic coast eastern black rail populations. The eastern black rail is a small, cryptic marsh bird that was recently listed as federally Threatened, with extremely little demographic data available. Workshop participants developed conceptual models and nine hypotheses related to the effects of habitat management alternatives on black rail demography. Here we describe the qualitative VoI framework, how it was implemented in the workshop, and the outcomes of the analysis, and offer lessons learned so that others may improve upon implementation of these methods in the future. | | Lawson, A.J., Clinton T.

Dynamic Energy Budget modelling to predict eastern oyster growth, reproduction, and mortality under river management and climate change scenarios. Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/204499755008/None/all) | January 2021 || Eastern oysters growing in deltaic Louisiana estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico must tolerate considerable salinity variation from natural climate variability (e.g., rainfall and stream run-off pushing isohalines offshore; tropical storms pushing isohalines inshore) and man-made diversions and siphons releasing freshwater from the Mississippi River. These salinity variations are predicted to increase with future climate change because of the increased frequency of stronger storms and also in response to proposed large-scale river diversions. Increased Mississippi River flow into coastal estuaries from river diversions, along with potential changes in rainfall and stream run-off from climate change will alter spatial and temporal salinity patterns. In this study we used an individual Dynamic Energy Budget model to predict growth and reproductive potential of eastern oysters across observed and simulated salinity gradients corresponding to different climate and river management scenarios. We used validated model outputs of salinity from a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamic model to assess the current impacts of Davis Pond diversion discharge on oysters located downstream. Under a high diversion discharge scenario oyster growth potential was reduced by 9%, 4%, and 1% in Upper, Mid, and Lower Bay locations, respectively, as compared to a limited discharge year. Reproductive outputs decreased by 34% and 2% in the Upper and Lower Bay locations, respectively, and increased by 2% at the Mid Bay site. In scenarios combining predicted increased temperature with the effect of diversions, all oysters located in the Upper and Mid Bay sites died due to severe summer conditions (high temperatures combined with low salinity). Overall, oysters in down-estuary locations, influenced by both estuarine river management and gulf conditions demonstrated significant tolerance to changing salinity and temperature conditions from diversions alone and when combined with climate change. In contrast, oysters located up-estuary, and exposed to more extreme salinity impacts from river management, demonstrated potentially lethal impacts through direct mortality, and reduced sustainability through decrease in reproductive effort. These predictions at the individual level may translate into less sustainable populations in the most extreme scenarios; restoration and production plans would benefit from accounting for these impacts on reproductive output particularly as decision makers seek to restore critical oyster areas. | | S,G.

This has implications for many grassland species that require diverse vegetation patches and structure throughout their life or patches that have limited availability in the absence of fire. The lesser prairie-chicken (<i>Tympanuchus pallidicinctus</i>) is a declining species of prairie-grouse that require heterogeneous grasslands throughout their life-history and fire has been removed from much of their range. Patch-burn grazing is a management strategy that introduces fire to a system and increases grassland heterogeneity. We sought to understand the effects of patch-burn grazing on lesser prairie-chicken space-use, habitat, and vegetation selection during a 4-year field study from 2014-2017. We found that female lesser prairie-chickens selected 1- and 2-year post fire patches during the lekking season, >3-year post-fire patches during the nesting season, and year-of-fire and 1-year post-fire patches during post-nesting and nonbreeding seasons. Vegetation selection was similar to available vegetation in patches that were selected during the nesting and nonbreeding season. Vegetation selection during the lekking and post-nesting seasons was not similar to available vegetation in selected patches, suggesting that lesser prairie-chickens are cuing in on other factors during this season. Because lesser prairie-chickens selected all available patches during their life-history, patch-burn grazing may be a viable management tool to maintain heterogeneity on the landscape and help control woody encroachment in the eastern portion of their range. | | Lassiter, E.V., J.H.

Inter-wetland movement was not influenced by intrinsic turtle effects but larger adult turtles moved further, used more wetlands, and had larger home-ranges than smaller turtles.<i> </i><br><i>Conclusions. </i>Turtle response to variation in season and wetland configuration highlight the need for complex and dynamic landscapes that are required to sustain this species.<br><i>Implications. </i>This study has important conservation implications showing that spotted turtles rely on a large number of diverse wetlands as well as upland habitat to fulfill their resource needs and that these habitat associations vary seasonally. And more broadly, results from our study can aid in the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation in patch characteristics (e.g. quality and extent) and inter-patch movement by organisms, which is critical for the conservation and management of semi-aquatic species and other species that occupy patchy habitat systems.<i> | M.S.

In a meta-food web - an integrated network of local food webs - spatial heterogeneity in physical processes may have profound effects on food web function and energy flow. In the Arctic, surface water connectivity plays a vital role in determining fish assemblage composition, and potentially, food web structure. We examined lentic food web complexity associated with heterogeneity in surface water connectivity among Arctic lakes at the local scale, by contrasting lakes over a stream-lake connectivity gradient, and at the regional scale, by contrasting two locations with different surface water conditions (i.e., wet and dry) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Among lakes and across locations, increased hydrologic connectivity between streams and lakes increased the number of fish species and increased the complexity of the food web. The interaction of the region's hydrologic connectivity, local stream-lake connections, and the trophic niches of relevant fish species produced integrated, complex meta-food webs. Fully understanding mechanisms that support meta-food web stability are crucial when assessing future changes to Arctic stream-lake networks and the function and persistence of aquatic food webs. | | Lasharr, Kelsie, D.C.

Using a mail survey conducted during the 2015-2016 hunting season, we examined goal-oriented, introspective, and leadership experiences among hunters on Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Wildlife Management Area (WMAs). We used k-means cluster analysis to identify six clusters based on experience preferences. We defined these clusters using their ranked experience preferences and segregated them into categories of either participants or enthusiasts. These clusters showed differences in demographic characteristics, as well as support for management actions on WMAs. Hunters in clusters with lower importance ratings of experience preferences also reported less attachment to WMAs. High levels of support for management actions were closely related to high levels of place attachment. Using information gained from describing the heterogeneity of desired experiences, managers may be better able to understand their constituents and prioritize management goals to provide a variety of hunting experiences. | | Larson, signatures of selection at genomic islands of divergence and the major histocompatibility complex in ecotypes of sockeye salmon across Alaska.

To understand the diel activity of Northern Snakehead <i>Channa argus</i>, feeding habits and movement patterns were observed. Two hundred seventy-three Northern Snakehead were captured by boat electrofishing during May and June of 2007 and 2008. Their gut contents were extracted and preserved. The level of digestion of each prey item was estimated from fresh (1) to >50% digested (4) or empty (5). Random forest models were used to predict feeding activity based on time of day, tide level, date, water temperature, fish total length, and sex. Diel movement patterns were assessed by implanting Northern Snakehead with radio transmitters and monitoring them every 1.5 hours for 24 hours in both March and July 2007. Movement rates were compared between March and July and among four daily time periods. Independent variables accounted for only 6% of the variation in feeding activity; however, temporal feeding patterns were apparent. No fresh items were observed in guts between 12:30 and 7:30 am, and the proportion of empty stomachs increased at the end of May coinciding with the onset of the spawning season. Overall, fish moved greater distances during the July tracking period compared to March. Fish showed a greater propensity to move during daylight hours than at night during the March tracking period. A similar but non-significant (<i>P</i> > 0.05) pattern was observed in July. Movement and feeding data both indicated greater activity during daylight hours than at night, suggesting that Northern Snakehead is a diurnal species. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that a) diurnal species are more susceptible than nocturnal species to predation by Northern Snakehead and b) Northern Snakehead are more likely to compete for food with diurnal than nocturnal predators. | | Lapierre, J-F., S.M.

We investigated two urban habitat types (public gardens and restored/reconstructed prairies) and compared three survey methods (Pollard transects, purposive point counts, and random point counts) to determine which was most productive for detecting butterflies and assessing family diversity. We conducted 66 butterfly surveys by using each method (198 total) from May through September in 2015 and 2016 at six sites (three public gardens and three prairies) inAmes, Ankeny and Des Moines, Iowa. All survey methods were used on 11 sampling dates at each site. Overall, we observed 2,227 butterflies representing 38 species: 1,076 in public gardens and 1,151 in prairie areas.We used a smaller data set standardized for survey effort, including 1,361 of these sightings, to compare survey methods and habitat types. Although there were no significant differences in number of butterfly sightings between the two habitats, more sightings (798) were documented by using purposive point counts when compared to Pollard transects (297) or random point counts (266) (for both comparisons, p < 0.0001). Occupancy modeling also indicated that purposive point counts were most effective in detecting certain species of butterflies, most notably those within the Pieridae (whites, sulphurs) and Papilionidae (swallowtails). We conclude that public gardens and restored/reconstructed prairies in urban settings can provide important butterfly habitat, and that purposive point-count surveys are most effective for detecting butterflies in these relatively small-scale landscape features. | | Landon, A.C., K.

Changes in temperature may result in changes in the sex ratio of the population which can directly affect reproductive rate, abundance and population dynamics. The NW Atlantic loggerhead turtle population is listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and one of the smallest subpopulations in this assemblage nests in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Here, we describe the incubation environment of northern Gulf of Mexico loggerheads nesting at several different beaches in Northwest Florida. Temperature dataloggers were placed inside and adjacent to nests on different nesting beaches across Northwest Florida. In addition, incubation durations were recorded from nests deposited on those same beaches. Internal nest temperatures were higher than those in the sand, however sand temperatures were correlated with incubation durations. Sand temperatures differed along the vertical beach profile and according to depth. Temperatures also differed along a geographic gradient across Northwest Florida and in relation to distance from the Apalachicola River. Incubation durations followed a similar pattern. Mean monthly temperatures at all sites were at or lower than 29 \u00b0C (range 23.1 \u00b0C-29.6 \u00b0C at the dunes; 23.8 \u00b0C-29.4 \u00b0C at mid-beach) which suggests nests in Northwest Florida may be producing a significant number of males, in contrast to the large number of females being produced on Florida's Atlantic coast. The temperatures and incubation durations on these nesting beaches may be regulated by differing sources of sand and beach orientations across Northwest Florida. | | Lamont et al.

Several of these methods sequence DNA associated with endonuclease restriction sites (various RAD and GBS methods). For use in taxa without a reference genome, these methods rely on <i>de novo</i> assembly of fragments in the sequencing library. Many of the software options available for this application were originally developed for other assembly types and we do not know their accuracy for reduced representation libraries. To address this important knowledge gap, we simulated data from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Homo sapiens</i> genomes and compared <i>de novo</i> assemblies by six software programs that are commonly used or promising for this purpose (ABySS, CD-HIT, Stacks, Stacks2, Velvet and VSEARCH). We simulated different mutation rates and types of mutations, and then applied the six assemblers to the simulated data sets, varying assembly parameters. We found substantial variation in software performance across simulations and parameter settings. ABySS failed to recover any true genome fragments, and Velvet and VSEARCH performed poorly for most simulations. Stacks and Stacks2 produced accurate assemblies of simulations containing SNPs, but the addition of insertion and deletion mutations decreased their performance. CD-HIT was the only assembler that consistently recovered a high proportion of true genome fragments. Here, we demonstrate the substantial difference in the accuracy of assemblies from different software programs and the importance of comparing assemblies that result from different parameter settings. | | La Peyre, M.K., Marshall, D.A., and Sable, S.E., 2021, Oyster model inventory: Identifying critical data and modeling approaches to support restoration of oyster reefs in coastal U.S. Gulf of Mexico waters: U.S. Geological SurveyOpen-File Report 2021-1063, 40 p., 2021 || | | Peyre Taylor C, Watkins KS, Kiskaddon E, Baustian M. 2021.

Indicators such as total biomass and mean trophic level derived from these data and from CASM outputs inform management and facilitate assessments of on-going and predicted coastal change and restoration activities on fisheries, but rely on consistent sampling to enable comparisons across space and time. Changes in coastal estuarine gradients, combined with the availability of new sampling technologies, highlight a need to assess the potential consequences of changing sampling technologies on fisheries data and the cascading impact on model outputs. In Louisiana, USA, CASM models are used to inform coastal restoration projects, relying on 40 years of fisheries independent data derived from 50' seine sampling. However, alternative use of electrofishers as a sampling method has been proposed to replace the seine sampling. In this study, we examine data from concurrent seine and electrofisher sampling in Barataria Basin, Louisiana, and compare biomass, assemblage data and CASM outputs related to species biomass, food web structure and energy cycling. In a paired comparison of data in 2018-2019, the electrofisher captured higher total catch and diversity compared to the seine. The electrofisher samples were dominated by shrimp (grass, white, brown) and larger bodied fish, while seine samples were dominated by smaller-bodied fish (i.e., anchovy, menhaden). Ecosystem indicators derived from running the CASM using biomass data from seine and electrofisher sampling separately provide contrasting results. Although initializing the CASM biomasses for key species using seine and electrofisher data to begin the model simulations did not cause large or long-running changes in the simulated biomasses over time, results using the electrofisher biomasses substituted into the original calibrated CASM on day 500 in a different simulation resulted in changes in biomass structure, with a doubling of total food web biomass due to the increased shrimp count, and a 13% increase in total energy flow (TST) through the food web. Conversions based on area and gear efficiency for overall catch may be useful in maintaining the continuity of historical data. However, differences in species-specific catch due to gear selectivity could have large consequences for constructing and calibrating fish and ecosystem models and remain difficult to reconcile. These differences in assemblages, and estimated biomasses for key food web species, suggest careful consideration in changing gears. | | La Peyre MK, Marshall DA, Miller LS, Humphries A. 2019.

Recent focus on the restoration of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs derives from their role as ecosystem engineers, including their unique provision of hard bottom habitat for fish and decapod crustaceans. Within the shallow estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico, the eastern oyster is the dominant reef building organism occurring providing unique habitat. This study synthesizes data from the literature on fish and decapod crustacean use of oyster reefs across the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). Relevant data from twenty four studies were identified, representing data collected from all five U.S. nGoM states over the last 28 years. Cumulatively, these studies document over 120,000 individuals from 106 fish and 41 decapod crustacean species. Densities ranged up to over 2800 ind m-2, with up to 52 unique species identified on a single oyster reef. While these data provide a first step in quantifying oyster reef support of nekton and developing benchmarks for oyster reef restoration, more targeted goals could be identified if habitat characteristics that may be driving the differences between reef assemblages, densities, and species richness could be identified. More explicit reef descriptions (e.g., rugosity, height, area, adjacent habitat) along with standardization of sampling gears and techniques would enable more explicit target setting, and provide clear benchmarks to guide habitat-species based policy goals. Establishing benchmarks of fisheries-habitat associations provides critical support for assessing damages (injury) to resources, provides targets for restoration projects, and overall, provides data to support assessments and predict future reef landscapes. | | La Peyre MK, Buie SCL, Rossi R, Roberts BJ. 2022.

Success of such nature-based coastal defense depends on the reef-building species' life history, habitat requirements, and ability to thrive through short-term and longer-term environmental variation, yet few projects have reported on outcomes beyond the first few years. In coastal Louisiana, USA, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i> (oyster) is an ecosystem engineer, creating self-sustaining, vertically accreting reefs that also provide ecosystem services. Here, we examine the short (< 3 years) and medium (> 10 years) term outcomes of experimental reefs constructed in 2009 for nature-based coastal defense in a Louisiana estuarine lake. Oyster reef density, demography, along with adjacent salt marsh, and shoreline movement were compared at six fringing shoreline reefs and paired reference sites over the first three years post-construction (2009-2011), and a decade later (2019-2020). Oyster density measured in 2019-2020 (< 60 ind m<sup>-2</sup>) was less than 10% of density measured during 2009-2011 (> 1000 ind m<sup>-2</sup>). This density difference largely reflected a lack of new recruits and small oysters (< 75 mm shell height) in later samples, with adult oyster densities similar between 2011, 2019 and 2020. Lack of smaller oysters in recent sampling likely reflected the impact of multiple extended low salinity events in this region in recent years, including the record-breaking low salinity in 2019. No differences in shoreline characteristics were detected in marsh vegetation, soil properties or nutrient concentrations between reef and reference sites. Similarly, shoreline erosion at both reef and reference sites immediately post-construction, and 10 years later, was high (~1m y<sup>-1</sup>). These findings highlight the need to consider both current and future conditions, including the effect of extreme years, when implementing nature-based coastal defense. On the other hand, the persistence of reproductive-sized oysters on the reef, indicate reef resilience and potential for reef development and shoreline benefits, should better site conditions return in future years.

Changing conditions from restoration and climate change alter freshwater and sediment inflows into critical estuarine areas affecting water quality, including salinity and concentrations of suspended sediment. This study examined the effects of acute (1 hour) and chronic (8 weeks) exposure of suspended sediment concentrations on the eastern oyster's respiration and clearance rates. Acute exposure at six sediment concentrations (0, 10, 50, 200, 500, 1000 mg L-1) and one salinity (15) indicated that sediment concentration significantly affected oyster clearance rates, with increasing clearance rates as suspended sediment concentrations increased up to 500 mg L-1. Respiration rates were not affected by sediment concentration (p = 0.12). Chronic exposure at two salinities (6 and 15) and three sediment concentrations (0, 50, 400 mg L-1) found no significant effect of sediment, salinity or their interaction on clearance rates (p > 0.71). Respiration rate was reduced at higher sediment concentrations (50 and 400 mg L-1 versus 0 mg L-1; p=0.0145) and lower salinity (p<0.0001). As clearance and oxygen consumption rates critically inform oyster energetic models, these data provide valuable insight to more accurately predict eastern oyster population dynamics and inform harvest models in the face of changing estuarine conditions. Changes in rates of growth through altered energetic demands ultimately can impact not just the economic viability of the industry, but also the ability for the populations to maintain sustainable reefs. | | L.

Seed-treatments containing neonicotinoids reduce aquatic insect abundance in managed floodplain wetlands. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/200947396608/None/all) | February 2022 || Neonicotinoid insecticides are commonly used as seed-treatments on major agricultural row crops (e.g., corn). Indeed, neonicotinoid treated agricultural crops are often planted directly in floodplain wetlands managed for wildlife, specifically waterfowl. Numerous studies have documented impacts of neonicotinoids to aquatic invertebrates in laboratory and mesocosm settings; however, there is limited information on impacts to aquatic invertebrates in field settings. We investigated invertebrate community response to planting of neonicotinoid-treated seed in managed wetland ecosystems in Missouri. In 2016, we sampled water, sediment, and aquatic invertebrates from 22 paired wetlands during spring (pre-wetland drawdown) and fall (post-wetland flood-up) followed by a third sampling period (spring 2017). During summer, portions of study wetlands were planted with either seed treated corn (treated) or untreated corn (control). Water and sediment concentrations of the three most common neonicotinoids were used to calculate overall neonicotinoids toxicity equivalents (NI-EQs) based on an additive model of neonicotinoids toxic equivalency factors. Mean total NI-EQs for sediment (0.58 g/kg) were an order of magnitude greater than water (0.02 g/L). Water quality parameters and insecticide concentrations were used to evaluate effects of neonicotinoid and fungicide concentrations on aquatic macroinvertebrates using a series of generalized linear mixed effects models. Results indicate an overall decrease in aquatic insect richness and abundance with increasing NI-EQs in both wetland water and sediments, as well as a similar negative relationship with sediment fungicide concentration. Post-treatment, treated wetlands had lower insect richness and abundance compared to untreated wetlands, but a recovery in abundance and richness followed in spring 2017. Our results have implications for aquatic invertebrates and wetland-dependent species (e.g., migrating waterbirds) as neonicotinoids, although below lethal concentrations, are impacting wetland ecosystems. Research results will be useful to wetland managers in making decisions regarding use of neonicotinoid seed-treatments, and potentially, provide broader considerations of the role agricultural production has in future wetland management and conservation planning. | | Kubicek, K.

Wildfire effects on mass and thermal tolerance of Hydropsyche oslari (Trichoptera) in southwestern montane | March 2022 || Large-scale disturbances, such as wildfire, can markedly affect streams for years. As terrestrial areas within a watershed slowly recover, stream environments and biota can experience repeated and long-lasting challenges. In 2011, the Las Conchas wildfire burned <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, USA. Seven y post-fire, streams located near the burn perimeter continue to experience varying levels of alteration (e.g., channel alteration with large diel temperature swings), whereas the terrestrial uplands have begun to recover. Extreme temperatures in stream systems may affect the aquatic community, including ectotherms such as caddisflies. These post-fire temperature ranges may increase an ectotherm's breadth of thermal adaptation, but at metabolic costs that diminish organismal performance, such as growth, development, and fecundity. In this study we characterized in situ effects of varied thermal regimes across preserve streams on the performance of the caddisfly <i>Hydropsyche oslari</i> Banks, 1905. We measured mass and critical thermal maximum (CT<sub>max</sub>) in <i>H. oslari</i> larvae from preserve streams affected by wildfire (high temperature range) and in streams minimally affected by wildfire (low temperature range). We predicted that increased daily temperature maxima and reduced daily temperature minima (i.e., large diel temperature swings) would be associated with reduced <i>H. oslari</i> mass because of the limiting effects of suboptimal temperatures on growth. As predicted, in the weeks prior to their emergence as terrestrial adults, 5<sup>th</sup>-instar larvae within the high-temperature-range stream had reduced mass (mean 3.3 \u00b1 SE 0.55 mg) relative to larvae from the low-temperature-range stream (6.2 \u00b1 0.69 mg). We also predicted that CT<sub>max</sub> of <i>H. oslari</i> would reflect stream thermal history. Indeed, larvae <i>H. oslari</i> from the high-temperature-range stream exhibited increased from the low-temperature-range stream (34.4 \u00b1 0.28\u00b0C). We demonstrated that the effects of wildfire on caddisflies can be long lasting, as evidenced by the reduced size at maturity and higher thermal tolerance in a caddisfly population 7 y post-fire. | | Krementz, D.G., D.

The ability of animal populations to survive these stochastic events depends on how individual animals respond to their altered environments, yet our understanding of the immediate and short-term behavioral responses of animals to acute disturbances remains poor. We focused on animal behavioral responses to the environmental disturbance created by megafire. Specifically, we explored the effects of the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire in northern California, USA, on the behavior and body condition of black-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus columbianus</i>). We predicted that deer would be displaced by the disturbance or experience high mortality post-fire if they stayed in the burn area. We used data from GPS collars on 18 individual deer to quantify patterns of home range use, movement, and habitat selection before and after the fire. We assessed changes in body condition using images from a camera trap grid. The fire burned through half of the study area, facilitating a comparison between deer in burned and unburned areas. Despite a dramatic reduction in vegetation in burned areas, deer showed high site fidelity to pre-fire home ranges, returning within hours of the fire. However, mean home range size doubled after the fire and corresponded to increased daily activity in a severely resource-depleted environment. Within their home ranges, deer also selected strongly for patches of surviving vegetation and woodland habitat, as these areas provided forage and cover in an otherwise desolate landscape. Deer body condition significantly decreased after the fire, likely as a result of a reduction in forage within their home ranges, but all collared deer survived for the duration of the study. Understanding the ways in which large mammals respond to disturbances such as wildfire is increasingly important as the extent and severity of such events increases across the world. While many animals are adapted to disturbance regimes, species that exhibit high site fidelity or otherwise fixed behavioral strategies may struggle to cope with increased climate instability and associated extreme disturbance events. | | Krejsa, D.

ORF1 protein sequence similarity network analyses coupled with phylogenetic analyses, revealed two distinct clusters that are populated by felid-derived anellovirus sequences, a pattern mirroring that observed for the porcine anelloviruses. Of the two-felid dominant anellovirus groups, one includes sequences from bobcats, pumas, domestic cats and an ocelot, and the other includes sequences from caracals, Canada lynx, domestic cats and pumas. Coinfections of diverse anelloviruses appear to be common among the felids. Evidence of recombination, both within and between felid-specific anellovirus groups, supports a long coevolution history between host and virus. | | Krabbenhoft, T., Myers, B., Wong, J., Chu, C., Tingley, R., Falke, J., Kwak, T., Paukert, C., and A.

Anthropause shows differential influence of tourism and a no-take reserve on the abundance and size of two fished species.

Marine reserves are essential spatial conservation tools that have been shown to work alongside fishery management strategies to provide benefits to ecosystems and communities. Reserves often incentivize local tourism, which can provide the impetus for reserve creation but may have negative impacts on the ecosystem.<br>2. The COVID-19 pandemic paused global travel and provided an unprecedented opportunity to compare short-term changes in exploited populations, during the reprieve from visitation provided by this 'anthropause', with the results of long-term conservation management.<br>3. Repeated surveys of Caribbean spiny lobster and Nassau grouper were conducted at popular dive and snorkel locations within a Bahamian no-take reserve and surrounding areas during peak visitation prior to travel restrictions and immediately after restrictions were lifted. Repeated survey results were referenced against surveys over a broader area, including another Bahamian Bank, to examine the consistency of effects and how the ease of access for fishers impacted abundance.<br>4. In the reserve, lobsters were encountered in significantly greater abundances, and significantly greater sizes of both lobster and grouper were observed in repeated surveys. Significantly more grouper were encountered during the repeated survey within the reserve after travel restrictions, but lobster abundances did not change significantly.<br>5. Over a broader scale, lobster abundance was significantly greater further from population centres. Observed lobster abundance was affected by habitat and inferred fishing pressure, whereas observed grouper abundance was affected by survey depth, effort, and habitat.<br>6. Marine reserves had clear benefits for both species and likely facilitated an increase in grouper abundance during the anthropause. Lobsters are a sustainably managed stock in The Bahamas, whereas grouper are a threatened species that appear to have benefited from an unplanned fishery restriction. Well-managed marine reserves enhance populations long term and can have additive effects with fisheries management over short timescales. | | Kornegay, M. Edye, A. N. M. Wiewel, J. A. Collazo, J. F.

The National Park Service (NPS) monitors status and trends of vital signs to evaluate compliance with the NPS mission. Although abundant, The Southwest Alaska Network (SWAN) monitors bald eagles because of their inherent importance to park visitors and role as an important ecological indicator. Our goal is to identify an optimal monitoring program that may be standardized among participating parks. We gathered an expert panel of scientists and managers, and implemented a Delphi Process to gather information about the bald eagle monitoring program. Panelists generated a list of means objectives for the monitoring program: minimizing cost, minimizing effort, maximizing the ability to detect change in bald eagle populations, and maximizing the amount of accurate information collected about bald eagles. We used a swing-weighting technique to assign importance to each objective. Collecting accurate information about bald eagles was considered the most important means objective. Combining panelist-generated information with objective importance, we analyzed the scenarios and defined the optimal decision using linear value modeling. Through our analysis, we found that a \"Comprehensive\" monitoring scenario, comprised of all feasible monitoring metrics, is the optimal monitoring scenario. Even with greatly increased cost, the Comprehensive monitoring scenario remains the best solution. We suggest further exploration of the cost and effort required for the Comprehensive scenario, to determine whether it is in the parks' best interest to begin monitoring additional metrics.

Using noninvasive genetics for estimating density and assessing diet of urban and rural coyotes in Florida, USA. Urban Naturalist latrans</i>) are expanding their range and due to conflicts with the public and concerns of coyotes affecting natural resources such as game or sensitive species, there is interest and often a demand to monitor coyote populations. A challenge to monitoring is that traditional invasive methods involving live-capture of individual animals are costly and can be controversial. Natural resource management agencies can benefit from contemporary noninvasive genetic sampling approaches aimed at determining key aspects of coyote ecology (e.g., population density and food habits). However, the efficacy of such approaches under different environmental conditions is poorly understood. Our objectives were to 1) examine accumulation and DNA degradation rates of coyote scats in metropolitan and rural sites in Florida to help optimize methods to estimate population density; and 2) explore new genetic methods for determining diet of coyotes based on vertebrate, plant, and invertebrate species DNA identified in scat. Recently developed DNA metabarcoding approaches make it possible to simultaneously identify DNA from multiple prey species in predator scat samples, but an exploration of this tool for assessing coyote diet has not been pursued. We observed that scat accumulation rates (0.02 scats/km/day) did not vary between sites and fecal DNA amplification success decreased and genotyping errors increased over time with exposure to sun and precipitation. DNA sampling allowed us to generate a coyote density estimate for the urban environment of eight coyotes per 100 km<sup>2</sup>,<sup> </sup>but lack of recaptures in the rural area precluded density estimation. DNA metabarcoding showed promise for assessing diet contributions of vertebrate species to coyote diet. Feral swine (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) were detected as prey at higher frequencies than expected. We identify several considerations that can be used to optimize future noninvasive sampling efforts for coyotes in the southeastern United States. We also discuss strengths and drawbacks of utilizing DNA metabarcoding for assessing diet of generalist carnivores such as coyotes. | | Klobucar, S.L., and P. Budy. 2020.

USGS FSP IP-109849. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/186587963392/None/all) | October 2020 || With low species diversity and primary production across arctic lakes, trophic structure (e.g., top predator species, predator size) is surprisingly variable. We investigated trophic structure in lakes of arctic Alaska containing arctic char <i>Salvelinus alpinus</i> using predator diets and stable isotopes in two geographically-close but hydrologically-distinct lake clusters to investigate how these fishes may interact and compete for limited food resources. Aside from different lake connectivity patterns ('leaky' versus 'closed'), differing fish communities (up to five versus only two species) between lake clusters allowed us to test food web hypotheses including: 1) arctic char are more piscivorous, and thereby grow larger and obtain higher trophic positions, in the presence of other fish species; and, 2) across arctic char size classes, resource polymorphism is more prominent, and thereby trophic niches are narrower and overlap less, in the absence of other predators. Regardless of lake cluster, we observed little direct evidence of arctic char consume other fishes, but char were larger (mean TL = 468 vs. 264 mm) and trophic position was higher (mean TP = 4.0 vs 3.8 for large char) in lakes with other fishes. Further, char demonstrated less intraspecific overlap when other predators were present whereas niche overlap was up to 100% in closed, char only lakes. As hydrologic characteristics (e.g., lake connectivity, water temperatures) will change across the Arctic owing to climate change, our results provide insight regarding potential concomitant changes to fish interactions and increase our understanding of lake trophic structure to guide management and conservation goals. | | Klobucar, S.L., J.A.

Using a captive herd of white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania, USA, we tested the efficacy of two electric fence designs (one three-strand and one six-strand) constructed along separate primary fence lines (each composed of 20 m of chain link and 20 m of woven wire fencing) dividing paddocks of captive deer. From June to November 2019, we conducted three trials of variable lengths to assess how season, age, and sex impacted behavior and motivation of deer to breach the electric fence. When no electric fence was in place, we observed direct contact through both woven wire and chain link fences. With the electric fences in place, we observed electric fence breaches (some of which led to direct contact between deer) only by weaned fawns (37 breaches, 4 direct contacts) and males in the mid- and late-rut (2 breaches, 1 direct contact). The majority of these breaches occurred across the three-strand-fence. Our results suggest that no style of primary fence alone is sufficient to prevent direct contacts and that the addition of a secondary, properly designed electric fence constructed along the primary fence of captive white-tailed deer facilities could prevent direct contact between captive and free-ranging deer. | | Khalighifar, A., B.

The occurrence of mussels in multi-species mussel beds suggests that common physical factors influence or limit the occurrence of multiple species. Fine-scale geomorphic and hydraulic factors (e.g., scour, bed stability[A1] [A2] ) are predictive of mussel bed occurrence, but they are computationally challenging to represent at intermediate, or riverscape scales. We used maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to evaluate associations between riverscape-scale hydrogeomorphic variables and mussel bed presence along 530 river km of the Meramec River basin, USA, to identify river reaches that are fundamentally suitable and unsuitable for mussels. Locations of mussel beds were obtained from an existing, multi-year dataset, and river variables were derived from high-resolution, open-source datasets of aerial imagery and topography. Mussel beds occurred almost exclusively in reaches identified by our model as suitable, which were characterized by laterally stable channels, absence of adjacent bluffs, proximity to gravel bars, higher stream power, and larger areas of contiguous water (a proxy for drought vulnerability). We validated our model findings based on model sensitivity using a set of mussel bed locations not used in model development. These findings can inform how resource managers allocate survey, monitoring, and conservation efforts. | | Ketz, A.C., T.L. Johnson, M.B. Hooten, and N.T. Hobbs. (2019).

Low-cost GPS trackers were assembled and deployed on ring-necked pheasants <i>Phasianus colchicus</i> in conjunction with an ongoing winter survival study. To assess GPS receiver accuracy, we deployed trackers in a static test. The static test fix rate was 1.0, median error was 2.5 m and mean error was 13.3 m (SD = 39.5). During the mobile test, wild pheasants were captured using walk-in funnel traps baited with corn from January to March 2019. During winter, 407 VHF locations and 1574 GPS locations of 35 individuals were collected, resulting in a 287% increase in data density at only 23% increase in cost. The fix rate during the mobile test averaged to 0.83. To determine if trackers were low-cost, we calculated cumulative costs of equipment and supplies required to recreate the GPS tracking unit. GPS costs were $47.60 per unit with an additional $202.00 for the supplemental VHF transmitter. | | Kauth, H. R., A. J. Gregory, A. J. Kauth, S. Harsh, T. J. Runia, and R. C. Lonsinger. 2022.

Journal of Wildlife Management 86: e22243. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/225871292416/None/all) | May of ring-necked pheasants (<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>) occupying fragmented landscapes within the Prairie Pothole Region in South Dakota where severe winter weather events historically limited pheasant population growth due to increased mortality. Recent landscape transformations could further impact overwinter adult female survival by reducing critical winter resources. Assessing the influence of time-dependent landscape features on survival at small focal scales may reveal spatially important relationships. We captured and monitored 321 adult female pheasants from 2017-2019 and recorded 110 pheasant winter mortalities. Female pheasant winter survival was 0.66 (85% CI = 0.62-0.70) and was inversely correlated to snow depth. We generated cox-proportional hazard models to determine risk of mortality associated with landscape features. Pheasants using landscapes other than concealment (e.g., emergent wetland, tall vegetation, woody, and food plot) experienced 222% increased risk of raptor predation than pheasants using concealment landscape features. Additionally, pheasants experienced a 58% reduced risk of weather mortality when using emergent wetlands. We analyzed resource selection ratios to understand how perceived landscape risks at the population level scaled down to land use preference at the individual level. Female pheasants selected for emergent wetlands, showed no selection for woody features, and avoided tall vegetation (>75 cm non-aquatic herbaceous vegetation) during severe winters. Pheasants would greatly benefit from conservation of emergent wetlands and integrating concealment opportunities into harvested fields. | | Kaushal, S.S., M.J. Fork, R.J. Hawley, K.G. Hopkins, B.

Herein, we review and synthesize nearly seven decades of work on migration and other long-distance movements of wild ungulates. Although it has long been appreciated that ungulates migrate to enhance access to forage, recent contributions demonstrate that their movements are fine tuned to dynamic landscapes where forage, snow, and drought change seasonally. Researchers are beginning to understand how ungulates navigate migrations, with the emerging view that animals blend gradient tracking with spatial memory, some of which is socially learned. Although migration often promotes abundant populations\u2014with broad effects on ecosystems\u2014many migrations around the world have been lost or are currently threatened by habitat fragmentation, climate change, and barriers to movement. Fortunately, new efforts that use empirical tracking data to map migrations in detail are facilitating effective conservation measures to maintain ungulate migration. | | Kauffman et al.

Attributes include habitat features of high conservation value, representativeness and redundancy of biological communities. We conducted a rapid ecological assessment of resident avian species in the west-central mountainous region of Puerto Rico in 2015, a landscape dominated by coffee cultivation. We focused on this landscape because shade and shade-restored coffee plantations offer an opportunity to complement protected habitat (e.g., reserves) to enhance species persistence. We used species richness, which tallies the number of unique species, and a quadratic entropy index of diversity, which incorporates interspecific taxonomic differentiation to evaluate species representativeness and redundancy across sun and shade coffee plantations and secondary forest. We surveyed 120 sites, calculating both metrics using species-specific occupancy probabilities estimated from community-level occupancy models. Species representativeness and redundancy was high as neither metric was able to discriminate among habitat classes, possibly because plant communities were redundant and the avian community was dominated by species adept at exploiting altered habitats. Similarly, we could not discriminate among avian communities modeling each biodiversity metric as a function of site-specific habitat covariates. Our findings and available knowledge on avian community demographics suggest that conservation strategies could couple protected habitat (e.g., reserves) and restored habitat (e.g., coffee plantations) to enhance species diversity and persistence across human-modified landscapes. | | Karish, T., G.W.

As a universal paradigm for examining these interactions, the telecoupling framework (published in 2013) has been broadly implemented across the world by researchers from diverse disciplines. We conducted a systematic review of the first five years of telecoupling research to evaluate the state of telecoupling science and identify strengths, areas to be improved, and promising avenues for future study. We identified 89 studies using any derivation of the term telecoupling. These works emphasize trade flows, information transfer, and species dispersal at international, national, and regional scales involving one or a few countries, with China, Brazil, and the United States being the most frequently studied countries. Our review showed a rising trend in publications and citations on telecoupling, with 63% of identified telecoupling studies using the framework's specific language (e.g., \"flows\", \"agents\"). This result suggests that future telecoupling studies could apply the standardized telecoupling language and terminology to better coordinate, synthesize, and operationalize interdisciplinary research. Compelling topics for future research include operationalization of the telecoupling framework, commonalities among telecouplings, telecoupling mechanisms and causality, and telecoupled systems governance. Overall, the first five years of telecoupling research have improved our understanding of human-environment interactions, laying a promising foundation for future social-ecological research in a telecoupled world. | | Kapsar, K.

Wildscaping, a type of stewardship PEB in which people create wildlife-friendly gardens, has been promoted by conservation organizations, yet fundamental questions remain about what wildscaping entails and what factors contribute to sustained involvement. We used a social-ecological systems (SES) framework to examine behavior change among urban residents in Colorado who had received wildscape gardening certification and training. We employed semi-structured interviews (n = 11), quantitative surveys (n = 63), participant observation, and document analysis, and analyzed data using grounded theoretical techniques. We found that program participants engaged in 14 gardening behaviors targeting habitat creation on their properties, and 11 advocacy behaviors targeting social change. These behaviors were driven by 10 interconnected motivations, including mutual refuge with wildlife, changing norms, aesthetic beauty, and sense of place. Engagement in wildscaping was sustained over time by multi-scalar contextual factors, including social interactions and formal program participation. These findings offer the first SES understanding of how urban residents begin and expand their engagement in wildscape gardening and advocacy. Future research should focus on how understanding of SES characteristics can enable more effective behavior change programs in urban landscapes. Possible ways that conservation outreach could consider SES include encouraging evolving feedback loops between participants' motivations and behaviors, emphasizing reciprocal benefits to individuals and their social-ecological context, and promoting coordinated involvement by different types of actors at multiple scales of the system. | | Jones, M.

We sought to understand one such challenge, how motherhood affects women's careers, by conducting interviews with 56 women conservation leaders in the United States and analyzing the data using grounded theory. All participants described how conflict between motherhood and conservation expectations affects women's leadership, particularly for mothers of young children. Mothers in conservation reported experiencing stress from this conflict and so pursued adaptive responses, including gradually returning from maternity leave, restructuring schedules, working part-time, reducing travel, foregoing opportunities, and occasionally changing jobs. These adaptations were shaped by multilevel systems factors at individual, family, organization, and conservation profession scales. We found that having to navigate these factors can undermine women's wellbeing and lead them to restructure their careers, which may jeopardize organizations' abilities to fulfill their conservation objectives. Conversely, our results suggest that greater compatibility between women's motherhood and conservation leadership work may make conservation practitioners and institutions more effective. As more women advance in conservation leadership, the profession should consider ways to better integrate motherhood to support a more sustainable and diverse conservation movement. | | Jones, M.

This study identifies gender-related challenges women conservation leaders experienced in their careers, and supports helping them advance. Using an intersectionality framing to identify intersections between gender, race/ethnicity, age, and leadership position, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with 56 women leaders in conservation organizations across the United States. All interviewees reported experiencing or witnessing a gender-related workplace challenge in at least one of six categories, and the vast majority reported encountering four or more of these challenges: salary inequality and difficulty negotiating, formal exclusion, informal exclusion, harassment and inadequate organizational response, assumptions of inadequacy, and assumptions of wrongness. Participants also experienced two categories of supports: structural supports and supportive relationships. Women's experiences varied based on age, race and ethnicity, and leadership position. Our results indicate more effort is needed to identify effective strategies for making conservation a more inclusive, empowering, and appealing profession in which to work. | | Jones, M.

However, many conservation practitioners struggle to engage new audiences. Research suggests one effective strategy to reach nonengaged individuals is to encourage interested conservation actors to share information, provide resources and assistance, and organize local events to recruit others; we call these \"diffusion behaviors.\" Previous studies suggest few conservation actors who engage in personal-sphere PEB also engage in diffusion PEB, potentially because these behaviors have unique barriers which have yet to be identified. We investigated if there are different psychosocial drivers of diffusion and personal-sphere PEB by surveying residents in Colorado, USA about their personal-sphere wildscape behaviors (e.g. planting native plants) and diffusion wildscape behaviors (e.g. helping a friend plant native plants). Including diffusion-specific psychosocial variables led to better predictions of both personal-sphere and diffusion PEB. Diffusion-specific self-efficacy, social and environmental response efficacy, and reputational concerns about perceived competence were significant predictors of diffusion behavior. Diffusion-specific environmental response efficacy and injunctive norms enforced through sanctioning significantly predicted personal-sphere behavior. Personal-sphere self-efficacy and dynamic norm beliefs predicted both behavior types. Our findings suggest that research should consider personal-sphere and diffusion PEB as distinct domains and should investigate the power of diffusion-specific perceptions. Conservation outreach programs seeking to encourage diffusion of PEB may benefit from designing programming to try to change these perceptions. | | Jones MS & Niemiec RM. (2023).

Conservation Science & Practice. https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12880 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/242739507200/None/all) | January 2023 || As biodiversity loss and climate change accelerate, more people worldwide are engaging in conservation behaviors to 'do their part.' Yet individual behavior change alone is insufficient for the large-scale, rapid change needed to address these crises. Relational organizing, which involves individuals reaching out to others in their social network, can enhance the speed and scale of conservation behavior change and address the complex, collective action nature of many conservation problems. However, many people practicing conservation behaviors in their own lives don't engage in relational organizing about conservation issues.

If these traits are heritable, harvest by angling can select on them, eventually rendering a target population less vulnerable to angling and consequently impacting the quality of the fishery. In this study, we used parental-based tags to investigate whether vulnerability to angling might be heritable in steelhead trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) spawned at a hatchery in western Oregon, U.S.A. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that vulnerability to angling is a heritable trait in steelhead. In fact, steelhead whose parents had been collected by anglers were less likely to be caught by anglers than expected. Moreover, we found that steelhead collected with in-river traps produced nearly twice as many adult offspring as steelhead collected by anglers. The underlying mechanisms for this difference in adult-to-adult production remain to be identified, though effects from collection stress and time in captivity prior to spawning offer candidate explanations. Our findings suggest that hatcheries could optimize the fitness of fish they spawn by using traps to collect broodstock, in favor of angler-assisted collection programs. We suggest that future research investigate the mechanisms contributing to fitness differences between broodstock fish collected with traps and by anglers. | | Johnson, J.R., A.T. Taylor, and J.M.

Although estimated at ~1,000 breeding pairs, only ~100 nests have been located at two sites in Haiti and three sites in the Dominican Republic. At sea, the species primarily occupies waters of the western Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. Due to limited data, there is currently not a consensus on the geographic marine range of the species although no current proposed ranges include the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we report on observations of black-capped petrels during two vessel-based survey efforts throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico from 2010 - 2011 and from 2017 - 2019. During 558 days and ~54,700 km of surveys we tallied 40 black-capped petrels. Most observations occurred in the eastern Gulf, although birds were observed over much of the east-west and north-south footprint of the survey area. Predictive models indicated that habitat suitability for black-capped petrels was highest in areas associated with dynamic waters of the Loop Current. We used the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO) concepts to delimit the geographic range of the species within the northern Gulf of Mexico. We suggest that the marine range for black-capped petrels be modified to include the northern Gulf of Mexico, recognizing that distribution may be more clumped in the eastern Gulf and that occurrence in the southern Gulf remains unknown due to a lack of surveys there. To date, however, it remains unclear which nesting areas are linked to the Gulf of Mexico. | | Jodice, P.G.R., J.S. Lamb, Y.G. Satg\u00e9, C.R. Perkins. 2023.

We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance. | | Jesmer et al.

Fisheries Research 249: 106235. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/213818697728/None/all) | May 2022 || Improved understanding of angling behavior in recreational fisheries can help managers account for partial controllability in systems in which angling effort is not directly regulated. Relevant aspects of angling behavior include fishing participation, site choice, and catch-and-release actions and can be considered at scales of both aggregate fishing effort and individual-decision-making. Using creel survey data collected across eight fishery seasons, we predicted aggregate angling effort (e.g., daily number of boating trips engaged in fishing) and characterized influences of individual trip-based site choice for recreational fisheries acting on fall-run Chinook salmon and coho salmon near the mouth of the Columbia River, United States. We applied an overdispersed Poisson likelihood-based generalized linear model with an autoregressive structure to aggregate boating effort and a multinomial logit model to trip-based site choice decisions among separate ocean and estuary fishing zones. Predictive models explained 71% and 79% of out-of-sample and in-sample variability in aggregate effort, respectively, and included the covariates weekend status, Chinook salmon catch rate, tidal range, and pre-season expectations of fish abundance. Site choice model selection revealed the influence of weather, expected fishery season lengths, and the individual-specific characteristics of boat length and guide status on decision-making. Model results provide predictive models for short-term fishery planning, revealed underlying influences of individual decision-making, and highlight the value of standardized creel data for evaluating angling behavior. | | Jensen, A.J., C.B.

Marine and Coastal Fisheries 13: 99-112. https://doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.10145 | Rapid phenotypic stock identification in mixed-stock fisheries can provide a useful alternative to more time-intensive methods (e.g., genetics) in assessing harvest and informing management decisions. We leveraged anecdotal knowledge and understanding of life history differences to develop rapid stock identification tools for fall-run Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) encountered in the Buoy 10 recreational fishery at the mouth of the Columbia River. Specifically, we sought to differentiate between the fishery's two dominant genetic lineages: lower river tules and upriver brights. We sampled recreationally landed Chinook salmon in 2017, 2018, and 2019, assigned sampled individuals to genetic group using a probabilistic approach and single nucleotide polymorphisms, and collected measurements on phenotypic traits. Using traits including pigmentation patterns (e.g., spotting), fin morphology, characters indicative of sexual maturity, and muscle lipid content, random forest classification models provided consistently high classification success across and within genetic groups (i.e., up to 90% in certain cases). Classification success remained consistent over time within fishery seasons and between years, but showed meaningful bias between sexes. Based on observed classification success, we developed and evaluated a categorical visual identification guide capable of facilitating more rapid trait observations and on-site stock identification. The resulting classification key, built using classification trees and visual guide observations from 2019, achieved slightly lower classification success across and within genetic groups and highly variably success among samplers. Trade-offs among stock identification methods offer unique management applications for each alternative, including their complementary use in harvest assessment alongside standard data collection methods. Rapid phenotypic stock identification methods offer the potential for increased precision and timeliness in harvest assessments. | | Jensen, A.J., B. Cox, and J.T. Peterson. 2022.

Waterbirds 44:55-67. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/197488228352/None/all) || When provisioning chicks, parents make trade-offs toward allocating time, energy, and other resources to maximize reproductive success. As parents adjust investment to maximize their own fitness, impacts on offspring growth can occur. We investigated the relationships between provisioning (an index of parental investment) and chick growth of Ad\u00e9lie penguins <i>Pygoscelis adeliae</i> at a large, high latitude colony, where competition for food affects foraging effort and limits chick growth. We measured average amount of food delivered per day, quality of prey delivered, and foraging trip duration, and compared them to mass and skeletal growth rate of chicks during two breeding seasons of contrasting conditions. We used mixed-effects models to test the prediction that increased parental investment would lead to increased growth rates, while accounting for confounding effects of parent age, chick sex, year, brood size, hatching order, and the lack of independence between siblings. Little evidence indicated an effect of parent age. All measures of provisioning were important in predicting growth of at least one morphological character but, especially during the year of normal reproductive success, no measure of provisioning strongly or consistently predicted growth across a majority of morphological characters. However, during the difficult year a positive relationship existed between growth rates and parental investment, especially for male chicks <i>\u2014</i> only the male chicks fed a high-fish diet grew as fast as the overall average male growth rate in the normal year. Growth of male chicks may be more sensitive to variation in parental investment, particularly under challenging conditions, and the results at least partially agree with theory about offspring-sex-based variation in parental investment. The observed variation in growth rates between males and females, and between years of contrasting apparent resource availability, was large enough to lead to size differences that may subsequently affect post-fledging survival and ultimately population processes. | | Jennings, S, KM Dugger, G Ballard, and DG Ainley. 2023.

Movement of white-tailed deer in contrasting landscapes influences management of chronic wasting disease. Journal of Wildlife Management 86:e22306. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/227921639424/None/all) | October 2022 || For several decades, chronic wasting disease (CWD) has exhibited an unabated expansion in distribution and intensity across North America. Upon detection, either for the first time in a novel area or in a region with an existing outbreak, wildlife management agencies are tasked with responding to mitigate the disease. This often entails creation or modification of a management zone within which rules and regulations can be modified that support an agency's disease management plan. To help inform the process of creating an appropriately-sized CWD management zone, assuming that wild deer movements are the primary risk factor for disease spread, we used data from GPS-collared white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) in southeastern Minnesota and southcentral Pennsylvania to estimate long-distance movements associated with dispersal and migratory behaviors. These contrasting study areas with active CWD outbreaks permit an evaluation of deer movement dynamics in different parts of their range. We quantified the proportion, distribution, timing, and orientation of dispersing and migratory deer. We observed 21% of female and 58% of male yearlings disperse from their apparent natal home range in Minnesota, while in Pennsylvania, 4% of female and 68% of male yearlings dispersed. We also documented 20% of females and 6% of males migrated between seasonal home ranges in Minnesota, while in Pennsylvania, no females and 5% of males migrated. The average distance deer dispersed or migrated in Minnesota was 20 km and 11 km, respectively, while in Pennsylvania deer dispersed or migrated only about 4km. Both sexes in Minnesota tended to disperse in a consisent, westerly direction; however there was no directional preference observed for migratory deer, nor for dispersing deer in Pennsylvania. We found differences in natal and adult home range size for both sexes in Minnesota, but not for males in Pennsylvania. Our results identify the considerable variability in disperal and migration dynamics of white-tailed deer in disparate landscapes, which is important to agencies managing CWD. We summarize the distribution of these long-distance movements and suggest agencies use this information to decide on an optimal management zone size that meets their needs. We encourage the development of formalized assesments of the tradeoffs associated with optimizing decisions about creation of CWD management zones across white-tailed deer populations that exhibit variation in dispersal behavior and caution against an arbitrary size/shape or one-size fits-all approach to creation of disease management zones. | | Jenkins, JMA, DB.

Warmer winters increase the biomass of phytoplankton in a large floodplain river. Journal of Geophysical Research: | Biogeosciences, | September 2021 || Winters are changing rapidly across the globe but the implications for aquatic productivity and food webs are not well understood. In addition, the degree to which winter dynamics in aquatic systems respond to large-scale climate versus ecosystem-level factors is unclear but important for understanding and managing potential changes. We used a unique winter data set from the Upper Mississippi River System to explore spatial and temporal patterns in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll <i>a</i>, CHL) and associated environmental covariates across 25 years and 1,500 river km. To assess the role of regional climate versus site-specific drivers of winter CHL, we evaluated whether there were coherent long-term CHL dynamics from north to south and across lotic-lentic areas. We then estimated the degree to which these patterns were associated with climate variability (i.e., the Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index), winter severity (freezing degree days), river discharge, or site-specific environmental variables (ice depth, snow depth, and nutrient concentrations). We found that winter CHL was typically highest in ice-free reaches and backwater lakes, occasionally exceeding summer values. We did not find highly synchronous CHL dynamics across the basin, but instead show that temporal trends were independent among river reaches and lotic-lentic areas of the river. Moreover, after accounting for these spatial dynamics, we found that CHL was most responsive to winter air temperature, being consistently higher in years with warmer winters across the basin. These results indicate that although productivity dynamics are highly dynamic within large river ecosystems, changes in the duration and severity of winter may uniformly increase wintertime productivity. | | Janke, A.K., M.J.

Vulnerability of Pacific salmon to invasion of northern pike (Esox lucius) in Southcentral Alaska. July 2021 || The relentless role of invasive species in the extinction of native biota requires predictions of ecosystem vulnerability to inform proactive management strategies. The worldwide invasion and range expansion of predatory northern pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>) has been linked to the decline of native fishes and tools are needed to predict the vulnerability of habitats to invasion over broad geographic scales. To address this need, we coupled an intrinsic potential habitat modelling approach with a Bayesian network to evaluate the vulnerability of five culturally and economically vital species of Pacific salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus</i> spp.) to invasion by northern pike. This study was conducted along 22,875 stream km in the Southcentral region of Alaska, USA. Pink salmon (<i>O</i>. <i>gorbuscha</i>) were the most vulnerable species, with 15.2% (2,458 km) of their calculated extent identified as \"highly\" vulnerable, followed closely by chum salmon (<i>O</i>. 2,536 km). Moreover, all five Pacific salmon species were highly vulnerable in 1,001 stream km of shared habitat. This simple to implement, adaptable, and cost-effective framework will allow prioritizing habitats for early detection and monitoring of invading northern pike. | | Jacques, C.N., R.W.

We sought to develop and evaluate the efficacy of SCR models for estimating density of a presumed lowdensity bobcat (Lynx rufus) population in fragmented landscapes of westcentral Illinois, USA. We analyzed cameratrapping data from 49 camera stations in a 1,458km2 area deployed over a 77day period from 1 February to 18 April 2017. Mean operational time of cameras was 52 days (range =32-67 days). We captured 23 uniquely identifiable bobcats 113 times and recaptured these same individuals 90 times; 15 of 23 (65.2%) individuals were recaptured at 2 camera traps. Total number of bobcat capture events was 139, of which 26 (18.7%) were discarded from analyses because of poor image quality or capture of only a part of an animal in photographs. Of 113 capture events used in analyses, 106 (93.8%) and 7 (6.2%) were classified as positive and tentative identifications, respectively; agreement on tentative identifications of bobcats was high (71.4%) among 3 observers. We photographed bobcats at 36 of 49 (73.5%) camera stations, of which 34 stations were used in analyses. We estimated bobcat density at 1.40 individuals (range =1.00-2.02)/100 km2. Our modeled bobcat density estimates are considerably below previously reported densities (30.5 individuals/100 km2) within the state, and among the lowest yet recorded for the species. Nevertheless, use of remote cameras and SCR models was a viable technique for reliably estimating bobcat density across westcentral Illinois. Our research establishes ecological benchmarks for understanding potential effects of colonization, habitat fragmentation, and exploitation on future assessments of bobcat density using standardized methodologies that can be compared directly over time. Further application of SCR models that quantify specific costs of animal movements (i.e., leastcost path models) while accounting for landscape connectivity has great utility and relevance for conservation and management of bobcat populations across fragmentedMidwestern landscapes. | | Jacobson, R., K.

In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to examine seasonal distribution and movement patterns of endangered Lake Sturgeon in Lake Champlain, Vermont. Acoustic tags were implanted in 29 juvenile (453-874 mm TL) and 19 adult Lake Sturgeon (1215-1615 mm TL) from the Winooski River and nearby areas of Lake Champlain between 2015 and 2019; tags were detected with 23 passive acoustic receivers deployed in the river and delta area and an additional 34 throughout Lake Champlain. Home range analysis using a lattice-based density estimator (LDE) indicated that the size of juvenile home ranges was the same as adult home ranges in spring and summer but was statistically larger than adult home ranges in winter (Mann Whitney U-test, P < 0.05). Cumulative home range analysis showed that juvenile and adult home ranges overlapped in shallow (< 10 m) water in the summer and fall. In winter and spring, cumulative home ranges from juveniles included deep-water sites (> 25 m), while adults remained in shallow water near the mouth of their spawning river. Some juveniles (n = 7) made long-range movements (18-34 km) during the winter and spring months, and some juveniles (n = 13) moved back into the lower section of their natal river after overwintering in Lake Champlain. This study is the first to directly compare adult and juvenile Lake Sturgeon distribution, home range size, movements, and habitat use in a large lake system, and provides a baseline for further research on the movement ecology of Lake Sturgeon in Lake Champlain. | G.B. Multi-run migratory behavior of adult male lake sturgeon in a short river. Journal of Great Lakes Research. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2021.06.012 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/209253826560/None/all) | July 2021 || Lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>) can migrate long distances to spawn, but many populations currently spawn in systems where the length of accessible riverine migratory habitat has been greatly reduced by dam construction. With the increased prevalence of shortened rivers, focusing on migratory dynamics in short rivers (<30 km) is beneficial to understanding the migratory needs of lake sturgeon populations. Here we document male lake sturgeon movements during the spawning period in the Winooski River, Vermont, USA; a river with only 17 km to the first natural upstream barrier. Male lake sturgeon were acoustically tagged (n = 25, 1215-1470 mm TL) and tracked using five to nine stationary receivers from 2017 to 2019. River discharge, temperature, the lagged effect of temperature (3-day), and time of day were significant factors describing upstream movements of tagged fish. Migrating male lake sturgeon (n = 10 in 2017, n = 18 in 2018, and n = 17 in 2019) displayed general movement patterns during the spawning period that included a single run upstream to the spawning site (60%), upstream and downstream movements throughout the river during the season (20%), or multiple runs made up the entire length of the spawning tributary to the spawning site (20%). No multi-run males were observed during 2018 when discharge was less flashy (i.e., fewer steep increases and declines in discharge) than in 2017 and 2019. These results suggest that the prevalence of multi-run spawning behavior of male lake sturgeon is related to flow conditions. | | Izzo, L.K., D.L. Parrish, G.B. Zydlewski, and R. Koenigs. 2021. Second fin ray shows promise for estimating ages of juvenile but not adult Lake Sturgeon. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 41: 217-228. doi: 10.1002/nafm.10561. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/206005929984/None/all) | February 2021 || The first marginal pectoral fin ray (fin spine) is the most common structure used for estimating the age of sturgeons, including listed Lake Sturgeon <i>Acipenser fulvescens </i>populations. However, conflicting results on the effects of fin spine removal have made some managers hesitant about the practice. We investigate if the second pectoral fin ray, which can be removed in a less invasive procedure, could be used for estimating ages of Lake Sturgeon. Ages estimated from fin spine and second fin ray samples were compared for 53 wild (470 to 1981 mm total length, TL) and 16 stocked, known-age (ages 8 - 18) Lake Sturgeon. Mean coefficient of variation (CV) for all samples was 12.4% for the fin spine and 17.5% for the second fin ray. In known-age fish, 17% of estimated ages for the fin spine and the second fin ray matched true age. For the remaining estimates, the difference between the second fin ray and true age was greater than the difference between the fin spine and true age (<i>P </i>< 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In juvenile fish (n = 24), 75% of ages estimated from fin spines and second fin rays were within \u00b1 4 annuli, which was similar to differences in reader agreement for the same fin spine. Age estimates for adult Lake Sturgeon (n = 45) were less when using the second fin ray relative to the fin spine (up to -34 years). Additionally, poor annulus clarity was observed in > 70% of the second fin rays sampled from adult fish. Our results suggest that the second fin ray does not provide reliable age estimates for adult Lake Sturgeon but may have some utility for estimating age of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Additional research with a larger sample size would be required to provide more conclusive results. | | Izzo, L. K., G. B. Zydlewski, and D. L. Parrish. 2021.

While sonars can be deployed continuously, improper assumptions about unidirectional migration and complete spatial coverage can lead to inaccurate estimates. To address these challenges, we present a framework for combining fixed-location count data from a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) with movement data from acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning run abundance of lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>). Acoustic telemetry data were used to estimate the probability of observing a lake sturgeon on the DIDSON and to determine the probability that a lake sturgeon passing the DIDSON site had passed the site previously during the season. Combining probabilities with DIDSON counts, using a Bayesian integrated model, we estimated the following abundances: 99 (42-215 CI) in 2017, 131 (82-248 CI) in 2018, and 92 (47-184 CI) in 2019. Adding movement data generated better inferences on count data by incorporating fish behavior (e.g., multiple migrations in a single season) and its uncertainty into abundance estimates. This framework can be applied to count and movement data to estimate abundance of spawning runs of other migratory fishes in riverine systems. | Hansen, and D. Caroffino. 2020.

We assessed avian responses in non-protected habitat, specifically shade-restored coffee plantations, because their structural complexity retains many attributes of secondary forests, and may contribute to landscape scale species resiliency. We tallied species richness and estimated occupancy probability of 12 resident avian species, after adjusting for imperfect detection, to assess the impact of hurricane Maria (20 September 2017) in shade-restored coffee plantations. For five of those species, we also estimated local colonization and extinction probabilities to assess their prospect of rebounding (resiliency) in the context of two stages of shade restoration. We used survey data collected March-June 2015-2017 (pre-hurricane) and 2018 (post-hurricane) in 58 coffee farms and satellite imagery to assess vegetation structure. Restored farms were grouped into two categories based on time-since-restoration: newly-restored and fully-restored. We predicted that mean percent forest cover in fully-restored farms (~30-40%) would revert to levels in newly-restored farms (<15%), with concomitant changes in occupancy by avian species. As predicted, mean percent forest cover (16.17 \u00b1 4.27%) in fully-restored farms farms (15.00 \u00b1 5.61%). The loss represented 30-38% relative to the pre-hurricane cover levels. Detections of focal species dropped an average of 41% post-hurricane, with associated reductions in occupancy for 9/11 species. Occupancy of the Puerto Rican Bullfinch and Puerto Rican Spindalis reverted to levels detected in newly-restored plantations prior to the hurricane as predicted. Prospects of rebounding were more likely for species with invariant or increases in colonization probability (e.g., Yellow-faced Grassquit, Northern Mockingbird, Puerto Rican Spindalis). Rebounding for frugivores like the Puerto Rican Bullfinch would be protracted given that colonization rates dropped from 0.56 \u00b1 0.12 (pre-hurricane) to 0.04 \u00b1 0.2 (post-hurricane), regardless of restoration stage. Our work showed that the avian community associated with restored coffee farms exhibited a high degree of ecological resistance as the similarity in species composition before and after the hurricane was 81%, and all 12 focal species continued to occupy farms under both restoration stages. The prospect of the focal species to rebound (resiliency) was species-specific, and in some cases, mediated by their affinity to a particular farm restoration stage. The strength of hurricanes is projected to intensify with global warming. Pockets of undamaged or partially damaged shade-grown or fully-restored coffee plantations may contribute to species resiliency by increasing landscape level habitat redundancy, and facilitate habitat shifts to secure food resources or harbor source populations to colonize recovering, hurricane-damaged habitat tracts. | | Inzalaco, H.N., F.

Circulating PrP<sup>CWD</sup> in blood may pose a risk for indirect transmission by way of hematophagous ectoparasites acting as mechanical vectors.

Ingestion of ticks during allogrooming may expose na\u00efve animals to CWD, if ticks harbor PrP<sup>CWD</sup>. This study investigates whether ticks can harbor transmission-relevant quantities of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> by combining experimental tick feeding trials and evaluation of ticks from free-ranging white-tailed using of misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), we detected seeding activity from 6 of 15 (40%) pooled tick samples collected from wild CWD-infected white-tailed deer. Seeding activities in ticks were analogous to 10 -1,000 ng of CWD-positive retropharyngeal lymph node collected from deer upon which they were feeding. Estimates revealed a median infectious dose range of 0.3 - 42.4 per tick, suggesting that ticks can take up transmission-relevant amounts of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> and may pose a CWD risk to cervids. | | Ingram, S.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis</i>, RGCT) occupy arid southwestern U.S.A. streams at the southern-most edge of all cutthroat trout distributions, making RGCT particularly vulnerable to the anticipated warming and drying in this region. We hypothesized that RGCT possess a portfolio of life-history traits that aid in their persistence within streams of varying temperature and stream drying conditions. We used otolith and multistate capture-mark-recapture data to determine how these environmental constraints influence life-history trait expression (length- and age-at-maturity) and demography in RGCT populations from northern New Mexico, U.S.A. We found evidence that RGCT reached maturity fastest at sites with warm stream temperatures and low densities. We did not find a strong relationship between discharge and any demographic rate, although apparent survival of mature RGCT decreased as stream temperature increased. Our study suggests plasticity in trait expression may be a life-history characteristic which can assist trailing edge populations like RGCT persist in a changing climate. | | Huntsman, B. M., A. J.

Our results suggest that competition most strongly affected the immature portion of RGCT populations, and this effect was only detectable when temperatures were warmest and energetic stress was likely at its highest. The quadratic relationship between temperature and growth rates also demonstrated that stream temperatures were below as well as above optimal growth temperatures for RGCT.

Endangered Species Research 46:215-226. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/220656001024/None/all) | December 2021 || The effects of climate change on at-risk species will depend on how life history processes respond to climate and whether the seasonal timing of local climate changes overlap with species-specific windows of climate sensitivity. For long-lived, iteroparous species like gopher tortoises (<i>Gopherus polyphemus</i>), reproductive processes are more likely to be climate-sensitive than adult survival. Our objective was to estimate the timing, magnitude, and direction of climate-driven effects on gopher tortoise reproductive output using a 25-year dataset collected in southeastern Georgia, USA, near the northern edge of the species' range. We assessed the timing of climate effects on reproductive output (both probability of reproduction and clutch size) by fitting models with climate covariates (maximum temperature, precipitation, and temperature range) summarized at all possible time intervals (at one-month increments) within the 24-month period prior to the summer census date. We then fit a final model of reproductive output as a function of the identified climate variables and time windows using a Bayesian mixture model. Probability of reproduction was positively correlated with the prior year's April-May maximum temperature, and clutch size was positively correlated with the prior year's June maximum temperature. April-May and June maximum temperatures have increased over the past three decades at the study site, which likely led to an increase in clutch size of approximately 1 egg (15% increase over mean 6.5 eggs). However, the net effect of climate change on gopher tortoise population dynamics will depend on whether there are opposing or reinforcing climate responses for other demographic rates. | | Hunter, E.A., J.P.

As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to determine how resource-dependent people are vulnerable to environmental change. This is particularly true in coastal Louisiana where the current era of rapid land loss has the potential to undermine oyster-associated livelihoods. Yet, little is known about how such changes might differentially impact resource-users. We examined social components of vulnerability to environmental change using indicators of sensitivity and adaptive capacity within the oyster fishery of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Specifically, we used semi-structured interviews to compare three resource-user roles: oyster fishers, oyster fishers/lease owners, and oyster lease owners only. Results indicated that oyster fishers/lease owners were highly dependent and thus sensitive to changes in the environmental conditions of the fishery due to high levels of occupational identity. The same people, however, were the most adaptable to change, which was reflected in their willingness to learn about new practices and evolve over time. In other words, higher sensitivity was offset by an increased ability to adapt, cope, and respond to changes in the environment. In contrast to these findings, oyster fishers that did not own any portion of a lease or business in which they operated were bad at coping with change and frequently held negative or fatalistic views on financial planning. These attributes made them the most vulnerable to environmental change. Overall, the most vulnerable participants in the Terrebonne Parish oyster fishery were those with low to moderate levels of personal and financial buffers and trust, coupled with high occupational identity and a low motivation to change.

The risk of pathogen exposure or the spatial distribution of disease outbreaks may vary as a result of changing host range size. This study examined the host range sizes of mammalian herbivore species in two ecosystems with different observed patterns for disease outbreaks of a multi-host environmentally transmitted pathogen.<br><u>Methods</u><br>We examined the spatial extent of anthrax outbreaks and range sizes for seven host species in Etosha National Park, Namibia and Kruger National Park, South Africa, where the main host species and outbreak sizes differ. We estimated the spatial distribution of annual anthrax mortalities using the local convex hull (LoCoH) method and evaluated whether outbreak distribution was correlated with case numbers of a given host species. We estimated host range sizes at different temporal scales, individual temporal range overlap, and evaluated relationships between range size and resource availability by species.<br><u>Results</u><br>The spatial distribution of anthrax mortalities was similar between parks but less variable in Etosha than Kruger, where outbreaks varied from locally clustered to large areas, with more cases and species affected. Herbivore space use differed among species and study areas, with individuals in Etosha having larger ranges than in Kruger due to an inverse relationship between range size and resource productivity. In Kruger the main host species had small range sizes and high range overlap, which may heighten exposure when outbreaks occur in their ranges. In contrast, the main host in Etosha had large range sizes. Case numbers of secondary host species with larger range sizes were positively correlated with the extent of anthrax outbreaks. <br><u>Conclusions</u><br>Our results provide new information on the spatiotemporal structuring of ranging movements of prominent mammalian herbivores in two savanna ecosystems, with comparative values for four species in both systems. While our anthrax results are correlative, they suggest that differences in host space use may have implications for disease dynamics; and, though partial and proximate, space use factors likely contribute to other factors known to affect disease transmission. | | Huang, Y.-H., K. Turner. 2022. Environmental drivers of biseasonal anthrax outbreak dynamics two 2022 Seasonality in infectious diseases is common, however bi-seasonality or bimodal seasonality in infections is less commonly reported. Bi-seasonality may involve multi-host interactions and environmental drivers, with multiple triggers. We explored patterns in anthrax infections in two multi-host systems in southern Africa: Etosha National Park, Namibia, and Kruger National Park, South Africa. We assessed possible transmission mechanisms behind anthrax dynamics, by examining 1) within- and between-species correlations of cases, and 2) associations between anthrax mortalities and environmental factors (rainfall and a remotely-sensed vegetation index). Anthrax cases in Kruger had wide inter-annual variation in intensity, and large outbreaks seemed to follow a largely decadal cycle. In contrast, anthrax outbreaks in Etosha were smaller in magnitude and occurred annually. In Etosha, the host species composition of outbreaks remained consistent over several decades, although plains zebra (<i>Equus quagga</i>) became more dominant. In Kruger, turnover of the main host species occurred, where the previously dominant host species, greater kudu (<i>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</i>), was replaced by impala (<i>Aepyceros melampus</i>), a species that rarely contributed to historical outbreaks. In both parks, anthrax infections showed two seasonal peaks, with each species having only one peak in a year. Anthrax mortalities in host species shared between the two parks peaked in the same season in both systems. Even though the relationships among species may be complex, especially in Kruger, species within the same seasonal (wet or dry) group could have synchronization of anthrax mortalities, implying common or similar transmission mechanisms or infectious sources. We found that with higher vegetation greenness, there were more zebra anthrax mortalities in Etosha, whereas there were fewer elephant cases in both parks. These suggest that host behavioral responses to environmental conditions are important for anthrax transmission. Comparing across species and systems, different seasonal peaks are potentially governed by divergent mechanisms of anthrax transmission and dynamics. This divergence of mechanisms is likely to lead to the multi-host anthrax seasonality and dynamics. This study reveals anthrax dynamics and potentially their driving forces in the two parks, which may help us better understand anthrax transmission worldwide.<br> <br><br> | | Huang, Turner. 2022.

When a transmission hotspot for an environmentally persistent pathogen establishes in otherwise high-quality habitat, the disease may exert stronger impact on the host population, and potentially forms an ecological trap. However, fluctuating environmental conditions lead to heterogeneity in habitat quality and animal habitat preference, which may interrupt the overlap between selected and risky habitats. We evaluated spatiotemporal patterns in anthrax mortalities in a plains zebra (<i>Equus quagga</i>) population in Etosha National Park, Namibia, incorporating remote-sensing and host telemetry data. A higher proportion of anthrax mortalities was detected in open habitats than in other habitat types. Resource selection functions showed that the zebra population shifted habitat selection in response to changes in vegetation productivity and rainfall. Average to high rainfall years supported larger anthrax outbreaks, with animals congregating in preferred open habitats, while a severe drought forced animals into otherwise less preferred habitats, leading to few anthrax mortalities. Thus, the timing of anthrax outbreaks was congruent with preference for open plains habitats and a corresponding increase in pathogen exposure. Given shifts in habitat preference, the overlap in high-quality habitat and high-risk habitat is intermittent, reducing the adverse consequences for the population. | | Hostetter, NJ, AF Evans, Q Payton, DD Roby, DE Lyons, and K Collis. 2023.

Disturbances such as drought may alter animals' nutrient contributions through shifts in species composition and biomass. Headwater streams are particularly vulnerable to extreme climate events and thus might show rapid changes in stream biota and their ecosystem effects. We tested how biomass and subsequent ecosystem effects (nutrient cycling) of an intermittent prairie stream community changed during a drought. We quantified the biomass and contributions to nutrient cycling for assemblages comprising fishes, crayfish, and tadpoles in 12 isolated pools over 3 months encompassing the harshest drought on record for Kings Creek, KS, U.S.A. We predicted that macroconsumer biomass would decline with pool surface area and that differences in macroconsumer biomass and taxonomic composition would lead to different contributions of pool assemblages to nutrient cycling. The biomass of pool assemblages declined with decreasing pool size, a pattern apparently driven by mortality, emigration, or metamorphosis. We also observed a change in assemblage structure of drying pools during drought relative to pool size, shifting dominance toward species with more drought-resistant traits. Accordingly, assemblage nitrogen (N) excretion rates declined as pool biomass was reduced, leading to a 58% reduction in N available to epilithic biofilms. Phosphorus (P) excretion rates declined from June to July, but increased in August, as species with high P excretion rates maintained similar proportional biomass and biomass of a non-native fish increased. Molar N:P of pool assemblage excretion declined significantly throughout the drought and coincided with of southern redbelly dace (<i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i>: Cyprinidae). Animal-mediated nutrient cycling was altered the loss of biomass and stoichiometric traits of taxa that differed in their occurrences and ability to tolerate abiotic conditions during drought. Elevated availability of dissolved N in isolated pools may increase N uptake rates by biofilms during drought conditions, indicating the importance of N excreted by aggregated macroconsumers, especially those with unique stoichiometric traits. While the significance of shifts in the composition of freshwater communities to ecosystems is not entirely known, additional losses in ecosystem function and changes in community structure may follow episodes of severe drought. | | Hopper, G.W., Gido, K.B., C.K. and Bruckerhoff, L.A., 2020.

Golden eagles have an extended subadult stage (4-5 years) that is critical to maintaining recruitment into the breeding population and population viability. Compared to adult golden eagles, the ecology of subadults has received little attention. We investigated patterns of resource selection for subadults in the Great Basin Desert of the western United States during summer and winter, 2013-2019. We monitored 46 subadults with GPS transmitters and related locational data (<i>n </i>= 99,037) with spatial predictors hypothesized to influence seasonal patterns of space use with mixed-effects logistic regression. Subadults selected for ridges and upper slopes in both seasons, but higher elevations in summer. Subadults showed weak selection for lower ridge density in summer, which was likely facilitated by selection for areas with greater thermal wind current potential. In contrast, subadults showed strong selection for higher ridge density in winter. Subadults selected areas further from roads in summer and closer to roads and electrical transmission lines in winter, which may be related to winter scavenging of road-killed ungulates. Resource selection functions suggested subadults selected for shrublands and woodlands in both seasons, but odds ratios revealed that during winter subadults avoided shrublands and increased selection of woodlands. Subadults tended to select for areas with infrequent fires in both seasons; areas with frequent fires were avoided in summer but selected for in winter. Seasonal changes in resource selection suggest that subadults used woodlands more than expected, and this may reflect spatial partitioning by subadults to lower-quality habitats to minimize competition with breeding adults during winter when energetic demands were higher and prey more limited. Our models had high predictive power and can inform natural resource planning to promote golden eagle conservation. | | Hitchman, Sean, M., Martha E. Mather, Joseph M. Smith. 2021.

However, since the target species is not directlyobserved, interpretation of results cannot preclude process Type I errors. Specifically,there may be a spatial or temporal gap between the target eDNA and the eDNAsource in the sampled area. Moreover, eDNA surveillance lacks the ability to distinguishwhether eDNA originated from a living or non-living source. This kind of Type I error isdifficult to control for, in part, because the relationship between the state of eDNA (i.e.,intracellular or extracellular) and the degradation rate is still unclear. Here, we appliedPMA (Propidium monoazide) to eDNA analysis which enabled us to differentiate \"intactcells\" from \"disrupted cells.\" PMA is a dye that has a high affinity for double-strandedDNA and forms a covalent bond with double-stranded DNA and inhibits amplification ofthe bonded DNA molecules by PCR. Since PMA is impermeable to the cell membrane,DNA protected by an intact cell membrane can be selectively detected. In this study,we investigated the workability of PMA Danio rerio.Aquarium was incubated for week to the eDNA degradation process intracellular and rerio different amplification lengths that enabled independentquantification of total eDNA (sum of intracellular and extracellular eDNA, commonlymeasured in other studies) and intracellular eDNA (DNA in intact cells) and allow foranalyses of sequence length-dependent eDNA degradation in combination with PMA.We confirmed that PMA is effective at differentiating \"intact\" and \"disrupted\" fish cells.We found that total eDNA and intracellular eDNA have different degradation processes that are dependent on the length of target sequence. For future conservation effortsusing eDNA analyses, it is necessary to increase the reliability of the analysis results. Theresearch presented here provides new analysis tools that expand our understanding ofthe ecology of eDNA, so that more accurate and reliable conclusions can be determined. | | Hirama, S., B.

Although hatchlingdisorientation has been documented for many beaches, data that managers can use in understanding, predicting, and managing the issue are of limited detail. Thepresent study provides baseline hatchling orientation data that can be compared to those from beaches with artificial lighting to prioritize light-management effortsthere. In 2014, the precision of hatchling orientation was quantified for 87 nests on a naturally lighted beach that had little to no artificial lighting. Precision ofhatchling orientation was regressed against seven environmental variables: beach slope, distance from nest to dune, dune height, apparent dune silhouette heightrelative to nest site, moon illumination percentage, cloud cover percentage, and relative humidity. Results favored a regression model that included distance fromnest to dune, with shorter distances from the dune predicting a narrower angular range (i.e., greater precision) of hatchling orientation. The study confirmed findingsof an earlier laboratory experiment that highlighted the importance to accurate hatchling orientation of a dark silhouette (dune) on the side of the nest site oppositethe ocean side. Reducing artificial light and promoting the planting of pioneer plants that assist dune formation can increase hatchling survival. | | Hirama, S. B. Witherington, S. Hirsch, A. Sylvia, and R. R.

The purpose of this study was to understand how dune proximity (distance from nest to dune silhouette) affected hatchling orientation, and if differences existed in nesting locations in three sea turtle species sharing the same nesting beach. We measured accuracy and precision of hatchling orientation in hatchling loggerheads, green turtles, and leatherbacks, using tracks left in beach sand. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the effect of dune proximity on sea turtle hatchling orientation. A Kruskal-Wallace analysis of variance was employed to further understand differences in dune proximity of nests across species. The results indicated a significant decrease in hatchling orientation accuracy and precision across species as the distance between nests and dune increased, while green turtles and loggerheads showed similar orientation ability when in the same proximity to dune. We conclude that dune features are likely to provide important cues for hatchling orientation on sea turtle nesting beaches. Considering the importance of beach dunes to sea-finding success of hatchlings, we suggest management strategies to maintain natural beach profiles on sea turtle nesting beaches. | | Hinrichs, M.

Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C<sub>org</sub>); non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C<sub>org</sub>, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes, landscape level carbon pool estimates would benefit from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates. We assessed C<sub>org</sub> stocks in SAV habitats from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C<sub>org</sub> stocks (56-231 Mg C<sub>org</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>) equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior stocks (231.6 \u00b1 19.5 Mg C<sub>org </sub>ha<sup>-1</sup>) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 \u00b1 10.4 Mg C<sub>org</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>).

We documented SAV composition and biomass across a salinity gradient in a coastal estuary over 12 months. Ten species were identified. The dominant species, Ceratophylum demersum and Myriophylum spicatum, accounted for over 40% of total biomass. Only Ruppia maritima occurred across the salinity gradient. Salinity, water depth and clarity delineated three assemblages, a saline assemblage, and separated fresher species into two groups, one associated with deeper water and lower water clarity and the other associated with shallow water and /higher water clarity. These assemblages exhibited intra-annual variation with at least five times more biomass in late spring/mid-summer compared to early winter. This pattern was consistent across the estuary, however the difference between peak and low biomass varied by habitat type; brackish exhibited the greatest magnitude. This variation is likely due to higher variation in salinity, and the species composition of this habitat. As climate change and coastal restoration impact timing and range of salinity, water depth and clarity in this region, these data can be used to help inform predictive models, and management decisions. | | Hillmann ER, La Peyre MK.

Before the study, little was known about the Yellow Perch population in Cheat Lake, a hydropower reservoir in northern, WV, including no population characteristic information such as age structure, size structure, condition, total instantaneous mortality, growth and diet. This study documented population characteristics of a Yellow Perch fishery in northern WV, including information on age structure, size structure, condition, total instantaneous mortality, growth and diet. This information was needed by West Virginia Division of Natural Resources for developing and implementing management strategies for the fishery. The project was a collaborative effort, including West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (the agency responsible for Yellow Perch management in the reservoir) and First Energy Corporation (the owner of the hydropower reservoir during the research project). Information from this study on age structure, size structure, condition, total instantaneous mortality, growth, and diet of Yellow Perch in Cheat Lake are currently being used by West Virginia Division of Natural Resources toward developing management decisions on new length and creel limit regulations for this fishery. | | Hill, N.M., D.H.

Estimates of predator densities using mobile DIDSON surveys: implications for survival of Central Valley Chinook salmon. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 43: 628-645. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/243209934848/None/all) | June 2023 || The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) is one of the most invaded estuaries in the world, and non-native predators may be a major factor in the observed decline of Central Valley Chinook salmon over recent decades. In order for managers to take actions that might reduce predation related mortality for these ecologically, culturally, and economically valuable salmon, it's important to understand the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of piscivores in the Delta. In this study, we use a multibeam imaging sonar (i.e., DIDSON) to conduct mobile surveys and quantify the abundances of piscivores in the Delta. We then used these data to identify the habitat features that are correlated with the abundance of piscivores. Prior to conducting the surveys, we used DIDSON data from captured fish to develop an algorithm to distinguish piscivores from non-piscivores with high confidence (98% accuracy). Results from the surveys indicated that predator abundances were most associated with areas of increased submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) patches, sites that are straighter, and sites with increased bathymetric complexity. When applied to the entire survey area, this model was successfully able to predict known areas of high predator densities. These results indicate that one approach to reduce predator densities along these migration corridors, and improve juvenile salmon outmigration survival, is to reduce the extent of invasive SAV. Because experimental predator removals have been largely ineffective in the Delta, efforts to manipulate habitat to discourage non-native predator recruitment and favor native species recruitment may be more effective. | | Henderson, M.J., Iglesias, I.S., Michel, C.J., Ammann, A.J., Huff, D.D. 2019.

To address this uncertainty, we analyzed underwater video transects collected over a ten-year period, documenting the locations and abundance of DSCS and demersal fishes in the Southern California Bight. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicator species, and cluster analyses revealed six distinct DSCS assemblages based on depth and substratum, and we identified 44 fish taxa that were predominantly associated with a particular assemblage. We then used logistic regression to identify the ecological drivers most associated with the presence of individual fish taxa throughout the study area. Factors related to fish presence included depth, substratum relief, latitude, fish density, coral cover, coral height, and the abundance of individual coral and sponge taxa. Even after controlling for depth and substratum relief, multiple fish taxa were much more likely to be found in locations containing specific DSCS taxa. Of particular interest, young-of-the-year rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) were more than twice as likely to be found in locations with Placogorgia spp., suggesting that this gorgonian coral serves as nursery habitat. Our results provide valuable information on the relationships between environmental conditions and demersal community assemblages, which is necessary to understand how future oceanic conditions may influence the abundance and distribution of DSCS and associated fishes. | | Henderson, M.J., Fiechter, J., Huff, D.D., and Wells, B. 2019.

Agencies have traditionally used infrequent mail surveys to collect human dimensions data. Internet surveys provide cost savings but are associated with caution due to data quality issues. To improve study validity, survey access can be controlled using email invitations, but because these addresses are voluntary results may not be applicable to the entire population. Additionally, internet surveys typically have lower response rates than mail surveys, thus a greater potential for nonresponse bias. To address potential coverage and nonresponse biases, internet survey data were compared to mail surveys of anglers not providing an email address, and non-respondents to the internet survey. Internet survey data was similar to both mail surveys for most of the variables measured. Internet survey data would slightly over represent male anglers and younger anglers.

Although such dietary transitions are commonplace across global inland and coastal communities dependent on small-scale fisheries, their nutritional consequences are unknown. Here, using detailed human demographic and fish nutritional data from the Peruvian Amazon, we show that substituting wild fisheries with aquaculture and chicken has the potential to limit iron and fatty acid access. However, chicken, in particular, can increase zinc and protein supplies. Considering that farmed foods may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and land use, strategies that work to maintain access to wild resources while improving the quality, diversity and environmental impacts of farmed foods can contribute to the long term diversity and sustainability of food systems. | | Heilpern S, DeFries R, Fiorella K, Flecker A, Sethi M, Naeem S.

Although biodiversity's role in maintaining ecosystem functions is well established, biodiversity is notably absent from consideration on fisheries and food security. Here we analyze how fish biodiversity loss affects the probability of failing to sustain fish-based nutrient supplies, or nutritional vulnerability, in the Amazon, Earth's most diverse river basin. Non-random biodiversity loss, in which small sedentary species replace large migratory species, increases the potential to meet intake thresholds for several key nutrients (e.g., fatty acids), but decreases others (e.g., zinc, iron). Biodiversity loss, however, often comes at the cost of increased nutritional vulnerability, but the magnitude depends on biomass compensation, how species vary in their functional traits and the ability of people to substitute fish with other animal foods. In contrast to findings from numerous biodiversity studies, functional diversity could either buffer or exasperate nutritional vulnerability depending on the extent to which species are nutritionally unique and vary in their tolerance to river threats.<b> </b>These results imply that prioritizing biomass production together with multiple dimensions of freshwater biodiversity, including taxonomic and functional diversity, may maximize long-term nutritional benefits from fisheries. | | Heckel, J.

Snowy plovers (<i>Charadrius nivosus</i>) in particular rely on the nearly 5,000 ha salt flat at Salt Plains NWR, which thousands use as breeding and stopover habitat. Elsewhere on the Southern Great Plains (SGP), decadal declines up to 75% within snowy plover subpopulations have been documented and attributed to vegetation encroachment, increased rates of nest predation, and decreased availability of fresh surface water. Despite many attempts to estimate this species' abundance across the continent, to date, no known attempt at distance sampling of snowy plovers has occurred. To address this paucity of data, this study was designed to assess feasibility of distance sampling methods to accurately estimate snowy plover abundance and to determine their detectability. Distance sampling surveys (2017-2018) indicated high detection probability (<i>P</i> = 0.81) and the population abundance estimate across the salt flat extrapolated to 3,246 individuals. The distance sampling population abundance estimate is lower than population abundance estimates determined by Thomas et al. (2012) and the 2013-2017 refuge annual surveys (Hensley et al. unpublished data), but far greater than 2,105 estimated for the entire Great Plains (Morrison et al. 2006). Overall, distance sampling snowy plovers at Salt Plains NWR proved to be an effective addition to pre-established survey protocols but further investigation is needed to compare accuracy and precision of methods used in this study, annual surveys conducted by the refuge, and other potential snowy plover surveys. | | He, Xinchen, K.

The ABM's performance improved, and the alternative models' performance worsened, when we only looked at data on real walks that involve crop consumption. This suggests that there is more randomness involved when elephants are engaged in foraging activity that do not include crop consumption. At the same time, elephant walks involving crop consumption seem to more closely follow optimizing principles.<br><br>Findings from this ABM approach support ecological understanding of elephant crop foraging, highlighting the optimal movements involved in crop foraging events as well as the importance of trespassing costs and landscape configuration.

An initial line of inquiry into designing wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species, single-season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote (Canis latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit the most positive association to natural land cover and the most negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus skunk (Mephitis mephitis), would demonstrate a neutral association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any particular natural landcover may be driving wildlife distribution in our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly con-structed residential development to better connect urban green space and residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow. | | Hauptfeld R, Jones MS and Skylander K.

We found moderate to transformational impacts on participants' practice and professional trajectories, and on multiple dimensions of capacity, including comfort, conviction, and identity. Flexible funding, immersion into a safe community of practice, and the obligation and opportunity to experiment with collaborative approaches fostered these changes. We also found evidence of a developing landscape of practice, and perceived benefits to communities where fellows worked.

Habitat amount or landscape configuration: Emerging HotSpot analysis reveals the importance of habitat amount for a grassland bird in South Dakota. PloS ONE 17(9): September 2022 || Habitat loss and fragmentation are two important drivers of biodiversity decline. Understanding how species respond to landscape composition and configuration in dynamic landscape is of great importance for informing the conservation and management of grassland species. With limited conservation resources, prescribed management targeted at the appropriate landscape process is necessary for effective management of species. We used pheasants (<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>) across South Dakota, USA as a model species to identify environmental factors driving spatiotemporal variation in population productivity. Using an emerging Hotspot analysis, we analyzed annual count data from 105 fixed pheasant brood routes over24-year period to identify high (HotSpot) and low (ColdSpot) pheasant population productivity areas. We then applied classification and regression tree modeling to evaluate landscape attributes associated with pheasant productivity among spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m). We found that the amount of grassland at a local spatial scale was the primary factor influencing an area being a HotSpot. Our results also demonstrated non-significant or weak effects of fragmentation per se on pheasant populations. These findings are in accordance with the habitat amount hypothesis highlighting the importance of habitat amount in the landscape for maintaining and increasing the pheasant population. We, therefore, recommend that managers should focus on increasing the total habitat area in the landscape and restoring degraded habitats. Our method of identifying areas of high productivity across the landscape can be applied to other species with count data. | | Harryman, S.W.H., selection of lesser prairie-chickens in an agriculture/conservation reserve program land matrix.

Recovery team managers want to reestablish pronghorn in their native range, but there is currently uncertainty regarding the subspecies status of extinct pronghorn populations that historically inhabited southern California, USA, and northern Baja California, Mexico. To address this uncertainty, we genotyped museum specimens and conducted phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of historical data in the context of 3 contemporary pronghorn populations. The historical northern Baja California pronghorn share the most ancestry with contemporary Peninsular pronghorn, whereas pronghorn in southern California share more ancestry with contemporary American (<i>A. a. americana</i>) pronghorn. For reintroductions into northern Baja California, the Peninsular subspecies is more appropriate based on museum genetic data. For reintroductions into Southern California, ecological and genetic factors are both important, as the subspecies most genetically related to historical populations (American) may not be welladapted to the hot, lowelevation deserts of the reintroduction area. | | Hahn EE and M Culver. 2021.

Recreation specialization has been operationalized using several approaches, including summative indices, cluster analysis, and self-classification categorical measures. While these approaches have their benefits, there remains a need for a continuous (interval) measure of recreation specialization that reflects the influence of the different dimensions of the framework by accounting for individual variation among the dimensions. This research note illustrates an approach that uses second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) factor scores as weights to determine a person's degree of recreation specialization and compares the CFA-based results to a cluster analysis approach. Data were collected from an online survey of eBird registrants from the United States. This CFA approach provides increased consistency in the operationalization and application of recreation specialization. | | Gyug, L. W., R. C. Dobbs, T. E. Martin, and C. J. Conway. 2020.

We assessed age-specific Guadalupe bass habitat associations at three different spatial scales in the South Llano River, a spring-fed stream on the Edwards Plateau of central Texas, and the influence of habitat and flow regime on growth. Substrates were classified using a low-cost side-scan sonar system. Scale microstructure was used to determine age and back-calculated size at age. Over 65% of captured Guadalupe bass were age-2 or age-3, but individuals ranged from 0-7 years of age. There was considerable overlap in habitat associations among age classes 1-3+, but age-0 Guadalupe bass tended to associate with greater proportions of pool and run mesohabitats with submerged aquatic substrates. While habitat metrics across multiple scales did not have a large effect on growth, discharge was negatively correlated with growth rates. Understanding age-specific Guadalupe bass habitat associations at multiple scales will increase the effectiveness of restoration efforts directed at the species and the use of low-cost side scan sonar seemed to provide an effective means of generating these data that can be adapted for other stream fishes. | | Grodsky, S.M. 2021.

Using mitochondrial DNA sequence data, we tested several predictions relating to the postglacial recolonization of the northern United States and southern Canada by Mudpuppies (Necturus maculosus). Our analyses revealed a significant split between western and eastern lineages, with the divide corresponding to the location of the Mississippi River. Our data support the presence of one or more Mississippian glacial refugia, with subsequent expansion and diversification of a western clade into the upper Midwest, and an eastern cluster into the eastern Great Lakes and New England. As predicted in cases of postglacial colonization, each of these clades contains a single widespread and common haplotype, along with numerous low-frequency, closely related haplotypes. Given recent conservation concerns about amphibians in general, and Mudpuppies specifically, we discuss our results in light of species conservation. Knowledge of a species' genetic diversity allows for informed management and facilitates decisions that preserve local adaptation and evolutionary potential. | | Green, SJ, E 2019.

However, molecular methods rarely detect target DNA perfectly. For example, molecular pathogen detection methods can result in misclassification (i.e., false positives and false negatives) or partial detection errors (i.e., detections with 'ambiguous', 'uncertain', or 'equivocal' results). Typically, these partial observations are either discarded or censored from the data; this, however, disregards information that may be exploited to make inference to the true state. Here, we develop a Bayesian hierarchal framework that accommodates false negative, false positive, and uncertain detections to improve inference to the occupancy of a pathogen. We apply our modeling framework to a case study of the fungal pathogen <i>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</i> (Pd) identified in Texas bats at the invasion front of white-nose syndrome. To improve future surveillance programs, we provide guidance on sample sizes required to be 95% certain a target organism is absent from a site. We found that the presence of uncertain detections increased the variability of resulting posterior probability distributions of pathogen occurrence, and estimates of required sample size were very sensitive to prior information about occupancy and prevalence. In the Pd case study, we found that the posterior probability of occupancy was very low in 2018, but approached 1 in 2020, reflecting increasing prior probabilities of occupancy and prevalence elicited from a manager.Our modeling framework provides the user a posterior probability distribution of pathogen occurrence, which allows for subjective interpretation by the decision-maker. To help readers apply and use the methods we developed, we also provide an interactive RShiny app that generates target species occupancy estimation and sample size estimates to make these methods more accessible to the scientific community. This modeling framework and sample size guide will be useful to improving inferences from molecular surveillance data about emerging pathogens, non-native invasive species, and endangered species where misclassifications and ambiguous detections are known to occur. | | G., Gao, S.

However, little is known about how these factors influence scale shape in fishes, a feature which may be important for drag reduction. We evaluated the impact of both on scale shape variation in the primarily benthic, riverine darter clade (Percidae: Etheostomatinae) of fishes. We darters with close phylogenetic relationships and/or shared ecologies would have more similar scale shapes, but this relationship would be mediated by use of the substrate boundary layer. We used geometric morphometrics and seven homologous landmarks for 92 species of darters representing all genera and 37 terminal clades within genera to measure scale shape. Phylogenetic relationships and ecological categories describing habitat, spawning mode, and maximum body size of each species were summarized from the literature. We used ordinations to examine scale shape variation among phylogenetic and ecological groups. We conducted Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares analyses to test for relationships between scale shape and ecological characteristics. Scale shape variation occurred within and among darter clades, and was significantly related to phylogeny. However, we found divergent scale shapes between close relatives and similar scale shapes between distantly related species. After accounting for phylogenetic signal, size and water column position were related to scale shape. Extra-large, hyperbenthic species had longer, narrower scales that may decrease laminar drag. Sub-benthic darters had scales that were narrower at the insertion, and with enlarged ctenial margins that may facilitate burying. Among benthic darters, size was significantly related to scale shape though a lack of clustering among many taxonomic and ecological groups may indicate that boundary layer use has reduced selective pressures from drag. Our results are consistent with others that have found both environment and phylogeny influence Teleost fish morphology. | | Grabowski TB, SP Young, & P Cott. 2019.

Audio and video recordings of Burbot spawning aggregations were made through holes drilled into the ice at known spawning grounds at Moyie Lake in British Columbia, Canada. Acoustic behavior was related to video data to determine how acoustic activity correlated to any observed spawning behavior. Burbot vocalizations were difficult to identify with only about 6% of the recordings containing calls being successfully identified as such in the field. Burbot vocalized more often between sundown and sunrise than during daylight hours. Calls recorded at night tended to be lower frequency, longer duration and have lower bandwidth than those made during the day. Further, Burbot vocalizations were not recorded in conjunction with video recordings of spawning activity. These results suggest that while it may be feasible to use passive acoustic monitoring to locate Burbot spawning grounds and identify periods of activity, it does not seem to hold much promise for monitoring activity in real time. | | Grabowski TB, HM Williams, R Verble, A Pease, & JE Pease. 2019. Guadalupe Bass flow-ecology relationships; with emphasis on the impact of flow on recruitment. U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Cooperator Science Series XXX-XXX. Washington, D.C. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/192754956288/None/all) | December 2019 || Guadalupe Bass Micropterus treculii is an economically and ecologically important black bass species endemic to the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and the lower portions of the Colorado River in central Texas. It is considered a fluvial specialist and as such, there are concerns that the increasing demands being placed upon the water resources of central Texas by growing human populations have the potential to negatively impact Guadalupe Bass populations. As such, this study assessed the relationship between Guadalupe Bass growth, feeding ecology, and streamflow. Sagittal otoliths were removed from Guadalupe Bass collected from throughout their range during 2015-2017 and used to estimate the age and back-calculate the growth trajectory of each individual. Additionally, young-of-year (YOY) Guadalupe Bass were collected every 10-14 days from two second-order streams, the North Llano River and South Llano River, in the Colorado Basin on the Edwards Plateau. Stomach contents of these individuals were identified and the effect of streamflow on the occurrence of the taxa comprising the stomach contents assessed. <br>Guadalupe Bass growth was greater in the Colorado and Guadalupe River basins, independent of stream order, and tended increase with increasing stream order within a basin. Growth was higher in streams and during years with lower spring and summer monthly median flows, lower minimum and maximum flows, slower rise and fall rates, and higher baseflows. Growth was not influenced by years with higher monthly median flows in winter. These results would seem to contradict previous research, but seem to be influenced by the fact that previous studies were conducted during a period of extensive drought, while the current study was conducted during relatively wet conditions. Taken together with previous studies, the current study suggests that Guadalupe Bass growth is sensitive to flow conditions and is lower in years with flow conditions that fall outside a basin- and stream order-specific optimal range for the species.<br>A total of 21 unique taxonomic groups were recovered from the stomachs of YOY Guadalupe Bass collected from the North Llano River and South Llano River. Aquatic most frequently encountered taxa. While there was no difference between the two rivers in stomach content composition, there was a strong longitudinal gradient in both systems with aquatic insects predominating at upstream sample sites and fishes being more common at downstream sites. Stream discharge during the 24 hours prior to collection did not have any influence on the probability of a taxa being found in Guadalupe Bass stomachs. <br>The results of this study support efforts to manage Guadalupe Bass populations at a sub-watershed basis and suggests that populations occupying the same stream order within a basin are likely to have similar responses to annual flow conditions. In addition, these results indicate that the lower Colorado River population may inhabit a unique set of conditions that has supported the development of a trophy Guadalupe Bass fishery. Further, this study highlights the need to incorporate a sufficient range of annual flow conditions to ensure that the influence of stream flow on fish growth is adequately assessed. While interannual variation in growth rates are seem to be capable of serving as a proxy for recruitment and year-class strength, long-term monitoring of recruitment paired with assessment of growth is necessary to further clarify the relationship between population density, flow regime, recruitment and growth and allow the construction of predictive models. | | Grabowski TB, Benedum ME, Curley A, Dill De-Sa C, & Shuey ML. 2023.

PeerJ 11:e14994. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14994 . | | December 2023 || How does a global pandemic alter fishing behaviors in Hawaiian nearshore fisheries? Using social media, we collect evidence for how nearshore fisheries are impacted by the global pandemic in Hawai'i. We later confirm our social media findings and obtain a more complete understanding of the changes in nearshore non-commercial fisheries in Hawaii through a more conventional approach - speaking directly with fishers. We find that resource users posted nearly three times as often during the pandemic with nearly double the number of fishes pictured per post. We also find that individuals who fished for subsistence were more likely to increase the amount of time spent fishing and relied more on their catch for food security. Furthermore, we find that individuals fishing exclusively for subsistence were more likely to fish for different species during the pandemic than individuals fishing recreationally. Traditional data collection methods are resource-intensive and this study shows that social media data can be used to rapidly collect data and predict changes in nearshore fisheries due to large scale disturbances. As climate change threatens additional disturbances, it will be necessary for resource managers to collect reliable data efficiently to prevent species collapse and to better target monitoring and management efforts. | | Grabowski TB & JH Grabowski. 2019.

John Wiley and Sons, New York. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/148025604096/None/all) | January 2019 || Like all marine fishes that undergo a planktonic life history stage, Atlantic cod must overcome a daunting set of challenges as part of their early life history. Atlantic cod must develop the morphological and physiological characteristics that will enable them to transition to a demersal, predatory existence as juveniles and adults, while retaining the ability to deal with the immediate and pressing challenges of a planktonic existence, e.g., avoiding predators while finding and subduing prey. At fertilization, an individual Atlantic cod embryo is cast adrift simultaneously with potentially millions of its siblings and half-siblings. Each embryo will take with it all of the parental investment it will ever receive in the form of energy reserves in its yolk sac provided by its mother and genetic material with a proven record of success from both parents. The parents of each embryo have themselves successfully completed the journey that this new generation of cod is about to undertake. The parents may have traveled hundreds of kilometers to release their offspring at the time and place where the most favorable conditions possible exist for success. Even so, the odds of any individual possessing the \"winning\" combination of pure luck and genetic fitness to overcome the specific hazards faced are infinitesimally small. Only the sheer number of embryos set adrift guarantees that there will be individuals capable of running the gauntlet. The truly amazing thing about cod is not the tremendous amount of mortality that occurs during this stage, but the fact that so many individuals survive. From a management perspective, understanding the factors influencing the high levels of mortality that occur during the early life history of cod is a critical component of predicting the future population size of cod stocks. This chapter details the early life history of the Atlantic cod starting at fertilization through larval development and continues with the descent of a juvenile cod from the plankton to suitable nursery habitat on the seafloor. This chapter also covers the early years, from habitat use to growth, diet, mortality and behavior, and ends as the juvenile cod begins to shift to adult habitats and behaviors. | | Govenor, H., L.A.H.

Deep and machine learning image classification of coastal wetlands using unpiloted aircraft system multispectral images and lidar datasets. |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/236460271616/None/all) | August 2022 || The recent developments of new deep learning architectures create opportunities to accurately classify high-resolution Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) images of natural coastal systems and mandate continuous evaluation of algorithm performance. We evaluated the performance of four machine learning techniques applied to UAS multispectral aerial imagery and canopy height models (CHM) prepared using both, UAS-acquired lidar, and structure-from-motion (SfM) point clouds combined with a DTM from a publicly accessible lidar dataset. We assessed the performance of the U-Net and DeepLabv3 deep convolutional network architectures and two traditional machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) applied to seventeen coastal land cover types in the Wolf Branch Creek Coastal Nature Preserve located in west Florida. Twelve combinations of spectral bands and CHMs were used to train the classifiers. The classification algorithms were trained with a total of 3,094 polygons created from an object-based image segmentation step. A total of 747 random, ground-truth accuracy assessment points, representing all 17 classes, were used to assess the classification results. Our results using the spectral bands showed that the U-Net (83.80% - 85.27% overall accuracy) and the DeepLabV3 (75.20% - 83.50% overall accuracy) deep learning techniques outperformed the SVM (60.50%-71.10% overall accuracy) and the RF (57.40% -71.0%) machine learning algorithms. Adding the CHM to the spectral bands slightly increased the overall accuracy as a whole in the deep learning models, with some vegetation classifications benefitting from the additional information, while the addition of a CHM notably improved the SVM and RF results. Similarly, using bands outside the three spectral bands, namely near infrared and red edge, increased the performance of the machine learning classifiers with minimal impact on the deep learning classification results. The difference in the overall accuracies produced by the use of UAS-based lidar and SfM point clouds, as supplementary geometrical information, in the classification process were minimal across all classification techniques. Our results highlight the advantage of using deep learning networks to classify high resolution UAS images in highly diverse coastal landscapes. We also found that low-cost, three-visible-band imagery is feasible without risking a significant reduction in the classification accuracy when deep learning models are adopted. | | Gomez, L.M., V.A.

Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships\u2014Theoretical or empirical in nature\u2014Tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R<sub>0</sub>, and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures. | | Gomes, C., T.

Journal of Coastal Research. 38 (3): 523-537, https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-21-00082.1 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/222015569920/None/all) | February 2022 || The success of individual sea turtle nests is influenced by nest location on the beach and the resulting incubation environment. Several abiotic factors affect nest incubation, and thus nest success, but tides and gas exchange are two of the most important. The effects of tides on nest success have been well documented in regard to overwash and inundation events. However, the possible effect of tidally-driven gas exchange has received little attention. The incursion and retreat of the saltwater wedge may cause substantial movement of gases through the beach during the tidal cycle. This study quantifies the differences in tidally-driven gas exchange among beach types and shoreline elevation levels. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux was used as a means of measuring gas movement through the beach to examine tidal effects across different beach zones and among different beach types. CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was measured throughout the tidal cycle at three distinct beaches (accreting, eroding, and nourished) at Cape San Blas, Florida. There was a general pattern of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux rising and falling throughout the tidal cycle on each beach and a difference in the CO<sub>2</sub> efflux observed among beaches and beach zones. Efflux patterns at the nourished and eroding beaches were similar, but the nourished beach exhibited a decreased and dampened CO<sub>2</sub> efflux pattern throughout the course of the tidal cycle. Analyses of the hatchling turtle emergence success data from 2011 to 2014 for the three beaches found that emergence success differed among the three beaches. The highest emergence success was on the nourished beach, which exhibited a relatively consistent efflux pattern. These results suggest that tidally-driven gas exchange may have implications on nest incubation and survival and are a consideration in beach restoration management and best practices for coastline conservation. | | Goebel, K.M., N.M.

Adoption of these practices, however, is influenced by numerous factors. We conducted a survey of 89 coffee farmers in Puerto Rico to understand their farming practices, experience with existing incentives, and willingness to participate in conservation programs. Quantitative analysis showed that current farming practices, farm size, and annual income from farming were associated with willingness to participate in conservation programs. Qualitative results suggested that financial considerations, conflicting state and federal incentives, lack of information about conservation programs, distrust in government, and land use restrictions might hinder participation. Some farmers perceived that sun farming - a practice incompatible with sustainable conservation - was required to be eligible for state agricultural incentives. The way some farmers practiced shade farming differed from the way suggested for conservation purposes, particularly in the type of shade trees and their cover density. Farmers highlighted the need for financial incentives to encourage adoption of shade farming. They also expressed concerns that participation in conservation programs could limit their land management autonomy. We suggest that availability of financial incentives, reconciliation of institutional barriers, increased outreach, and involvement of farmers in design of conservation programs can increase adoption and retention of conservation practices. | | Girard, C.E. and A.W.

Cause of death, pathology, and chronic wasting disease status of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) mortalities in Wisconsin, Journal of Wildlife Odocoileus virginianus) are a critical species for ecosystem function and wildlife management. As such, studies of cause-specific mortality among WTD have long been used to understand population dynamics. However, detailed pathological information is rarely documented for free-ranging WTD, especially in regions with a high prevalence of chronic wasting disease (CWD). This leaves a critical gap in understanding how CWD affects the prevalence of other disease processes or comorbidities which may subsequently alter broader population dynamics. In this study, we investigated unknown mortalities among GPS or VHF collared WTD in southwestern Wisconsin, an area of high CWD prevalence. We tested for associations between CWD and other disease processes and used a network approach to test for clusters of co-occurrences of disease processes. Predation and infectious disease were top causes of death, with high prevalence of CWD (42.4%; n = 245) and pneumonia (51.2%; n = 168) in our sample. CWD prevalence increased with age, before decreasing among older individuals, with more older females than males in our sample. Females were more likely to be CWD positive, and while this was not statistically significant when accounting for age, females were significantly more likely to die with end-stage CWD than were males and may consequently be an underrecognized source of CWD transmission. Diagnosis of CWD was associated with emaciation, atrophy of marrow fat, and ectoparasitism (lice, ticks). Occurrences of severe infectious disease pathologies clustered together (e.g., pneumonia, CWD), as compared to non-infectious or low severity processes (e.g., sarcocystosis). However, pneumonia cases were not fully explained by CWD status. With the prevalence of CWD increasing across North America, our results highlight the critical importance of understanding the role of CWD in favoring or maintaining disease processes of importance for deer population health and dynamics. | | Gilbertson, M.L.J., A.

The prairie pothole ecosystem is found in the northern plains of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Because most of the land in this region is privately owned and used for agricultural production, most impacts to wildlife habitat are the result of decisions by individual landowners. Landowner trust in natural resource management agencies is important for agencies to effectively accomplish their mission. We measured the nature (competence and fairness) and level of trust that western Minnesota landowners have in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MnDNR) and landowners' wildlife value orientations (WVO). Landowners rated MnDNR slightly higher in competence than fairness; however, these two dimensions were strongly correlated. We developed a MnDNR trust scale (six items) and a three-cluster model dividing landowners along the MnDNR trust scale, which we named Negative (28%), Neutral (43%), and Positive (29%). We provide evidence supporting the salient values similarity (SVS) model that states people have trust in agencies holding similar values; landowners reporting greater importance for wildlife consideration when making land-use decisions also reported greater trust in the MnDNR. In addition, mutualist landowners had the highest trust in the MnDNR and utilitarian landowners the lowest level of trust, which is opposite of the trust relationship reported for the general public with state wildlife agencies. Based on the SVS model, our results suggest that mutualist landowners perceive greater congruence with MnDNR goals related to wildlife habitat compared to utilitarian landowners. | | Gigliotti, L.M. 2018.

Thegeographic ranges of these two species were historically separated by Kanawha Falls, a natural barrier to fish dispersal locatedat Glen Ferris, WV. In the osburni first collectedat locations upstream of Kanawha Falls, and have since undergone range expansion. Hybridization with the Variegate Darterwas one of the threats that led to the Candy Darter being listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in2018. Genetic and morphologic data were examined for individuals from the New, Gauley, and Greenbrier river drainages.Individuals were genotyped using a suite of 5 diagnostic microsatellite loci to investigate potential hybridization. Widespreadhybridization was found throughout populations of Candy Darters, with the geographic range of hybridization expandingfrom 2004 to 2014. A hybrid zone was observed, with the highest levels of Variegate Darter introgression representing thekernel within this zone and the locations of first-generation (F1) hybrids at the periphery. F1 hybrids were morphologicallyintermediate within and across characters for parental species. Introgressive hybridization threatens the genetic integrity ofthe Candy Darter, and may lead to population extirpation or extinction. | | Ghoddousi, A., Buchholtz, E.K., Dietsch, A.M., Williamson, M.A., and Dutta, T., 2021.

Yet, current connectivity planning efforts typically assess landscape resistance, the ability of organisms to cross various biophysical elements in a landscape, while overlooking the various ways in which human behaviors influence connectivity. Here, we introduce the concept of \"anthropogenic resistance\" to capture the impacts of human behaviors on species' movement through a landscape. We discuss psychological and socioeconomic factors that influence the degree of anthropogenic resistance, such as the economic value or the risks posed by a species, and suggest methods to estimate and include anthropogenic resistance in connectivity analyses. Finally, we highlight how addressing anthropogenic resistance through a social-ecological perspective can lead to better outcomes for both humans and wildlife. We call for multidisciplinary approaches in connectivity planning to ensure the functionality of landscapes and sustainability of populations in the long term. | | Gerth, W.J., Murphy, C.A., and Arismendi, I. 2023.

Journal of Animal Ecology, 91(1), 46-60. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/243689879552/None/all) | January 2022 || Spatiotemporal variation predation risk arises from interactions between landscape heterogeneity, predator densities and predator hunting mode, generating landscapes of fear for prey species that can have important effects on prey behaviour and ecosystem dynamics. As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions <i>Puma concolor</i> to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer <i>Odocoileus hemionus columbianus</i> in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism of predation risk avoidance. | | Gaya, H. E., L. L. Smith, and C. T. Moore. 2022.

In order to understand population dynamics and survival, it is important to first understand the ecology of local populations. We investigated the dwelling structure use, movements, home range, and survival of radio-tagged muskrats (n = 17) in an urban wetland complex in central Pennsylvania. We used locations collected from intensive radio telemetry monitoring to determine number of lodging structures used, hourly movement, and size and percent area overlap of home ranges. Muskrats shared an average of nine lodging structures and on average 68% of a muskrat's home range overlapped other muskrat home ranges. We used four home range estimators (Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) <i><sub>href</sub></i>, KDE<i><sub>ad hoc</sub></i>, KDE<i><sub>plug-in</sub></i>, and Local Convex Hull estimator) to assess the ability of each estimator in representing muskrat home ranges. The KDE<i><sub>plug-in</sub></i> that constrained the estimate of home range to habitat boundaries provided the more appropriate home range size for muskrats in a linear-non-linear habitat matrix. We also calculated overwinter survival estimates using known-fate models in Program MARK\u00ae. Our top model indicated a positive effect of the average weekly precipitation on survival with an overwinter survival estimate of 0.59 (SE = 0.16). The main cause of muskrat mortality was mink (n = 6). Our model suggests that snowfall may be an important factor in muskrat survival. Our study provides novel data on muskrat ecology in Pennsylvania as well as preliminary evidence for future investigations of climate's impact on muskrat survival during the winter months. | | Ganoe, L.S., J.D.

Several theories for the decline have been proposed, including increased parasite infections and disease within muskrat populations. No existing wholistic review of muskrat exposure to pathogens, contaminants, and diseases exists. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a thorough review of existing literature on muskrat pathogens, contaminants, and diseases across their natural range. This review is comprised of 129 articles from 1915-2019were and from 27 U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces. A wide diversity of contaminants, toxins, and pathogens were reported in muskrats, with the most common diseases being cysticercosis, tularemia, Tyzzer's disease, and biotoxin poisoning from cyanobacteria. This review provides a summary of muskrat pathogens, contaminants, and disease over a century that has observed significant population declines throughout the species' range in North America. Such data provides baseline data for understanding the potential role of disease in these declines. In addition, these data highlight critical knowledge gaps that warrant future research efforts. | | Ganoe, L.S., J.D. Brown, M.J.

Between 1977 and 2019, 26 diagnostic cases were examined from Kansas and throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, USA. We identified multiple causes of mortality in muskrats, but trauma (8/26), Tyzzer's disease (5/6), and cysticercosis (5/26) were the most common. We also conducted necropsies, during November 2018 - January 2019 Pennsylvania muskrat trapping season, on 380 trapper-harvested muskrat carcasses after the pelt was removed. Tissue samples and exudate were tested for presence of or exposure to a suite of pathogens and contaminants. Gastrointestinal tracts were examined for helminths. Intestinal helminths were (44%) being the most common. Molecular testing identified a low prevalence of infection with <i>Clostridium piliforme </i>in the feces and <i>Sarcocystis</i> spp. in the We detected a low seroprevalence to <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and 15% (57/380) of our trapper-harvested muskrats. Toxic concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury were not detected in tested liver samples. Copper, molybdenum, and zinc concentrations were detected at acceptable levels comparative to previous studies. Parasite intensity and abundance were typical of historic reports; however, younger muskrats had higher intensity of infection than older muskrats which is contradictory to what has been previously reported. A diversity of pathogens and contaminants have been reported from muskrats, but the associated disease impacts are poorly understood. Our data are consistent with historic reports and highlight the wide range of parasites, pathogens and contaminants harbored by muskrats in Pennsylvania. The data collected are a critical component in assessing overall muskrat health and serve as a basis for understanding the impacts of disease on recent muskrat population declines. | | Gallardo, J.C., F.J.

We developed a periodic population matrix model of the Red-tailed Hawk in eastern Puerto Rico to describe the influence of early life-stages on population growth in the lower and upper forests of the Luquillo Mountains. Model results indicated the Red-tailed Hawk populations exhibited a positive discrete rate of growth in the study region (upper forest: = 1.05; lower forest: = 1.27). Further, adult survival was the most important parameter influencing population growth (elasticity upper forest = 0.86, elasticity lower forest = 0.53). Besides adult survival, nestling survival had a greater influence in than for other life-stages (sensitivity lowlands = 0.46, sensitivity highlands = 0.48), highlighting the importance of this life stage to the growth rate of Red-tailed Hawks in our study area. Our approach may serve as a conceptual and analytical modeling framework to quantify the influence of early life-stages on population growth in other avian species. | | Galat, D. L., P. Braaten, C.

Making an informed decision necessitates that patients receive information on the risks and benefits of their surgical options so they can evaluate tradeoffs among their objectives. However, women frequently report not being completely informed about their treatment options prior to making a decision. There is a recent emphasis on shared decision making; use of decision aiding tools can result in increased dialog between physician and patient and can help inform patients about the costs and benefits of viable treatments that meet their objectives. Decision aids have demonstrated reduced decisional conflict and improved patient knowledge and satisfaction with their surgery decision. The purpose of this study was to review and synthesize existing breast cancer surgical decision aids with a focus on describing how tradeoffs among objectives are evaluated to arrive at a decision among viable surgical options. | | Fuller, A.K., and L.M.

Taxonomic and conservation implications of population genetic admixture, mito-nuclear discordance, and male-biased dispersal | July 2019 || Accurate species delimitation and description are necessary to guide effective conservation of imperiled species, and this synergy is maximized when multiple data sources are used to delimit species. We illustrate this point by examining <i>Drymarchon couperi</i> (Eastern Indigo Snake), a large, federally-protected species in North America that was recently divided into two species based on gene sequence data from three loci and heuristic morphological assessment. Here, we re-evaluate the two-species hypothesis for <i>D</i>. <i>couperi</i> by evaluating both population genetic and gene sequence data. Our analyses of 14 microsatellite markers revealed 6-8 genetic population clusters with significant admixture, particularly across the contact zone between the two hypothesized species. Phylogenetic analyses of gene sequence data with maximum-likelihood methods suggested discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers and provided phylogenetic support for one species rather than two. For these reasons, we place <i>Drymarchon kolpobasileus</i> into synonymy with <i>D</i>. <i>couperi</i>. We suggest inconsistent patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are driven by high dispersal of males relative to females. We advocate for species delimitation exercises that evaluate admixture and gene flow in addition to phylogenetic analyses, particularly when the latter reveal monophyletic lineages. This is particularly important for taxa, such as squamates, that exhibit strong sex-biased dispersal. Problems associated with over-delimitation of species richness can become particularly acute for threatened and endangered species, because of high costs to conservation when taxonomy demands protection of more individual species than are supported by accumulating data. | | Folt B., McGowan CP, Steen DA, Hoffman M, Godwin J, Guyer C, 2020, Modeling strategies and evaluating success during repatriations of an elusive and endangered species, Animal Conservation 23: 273-285. || January 2020 || | | Folt B, Marshall M, Emanuel JA, Dziadzio M, Cooke J, Mena L, Hinderliter M, Hoffman S, Rankin N, Tupy J, McGowan C, In Review, Using Predictions from Multiple Anthropogenic Stressors to Estimate Future Population Conditions of an Imperiled Species, For submission to PLOS 1. || August 2022 || | | Folt B, Gessling J, Tucker A, Guyer C, S Hermann, Shelton-Nix E, and McGowan C, In review, Contrasting Patterns of Demography and Population Viability among Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) Populations at the Species' Northern Range Edge, for submission to Journal of Wildlife Management. || June 2021 || | | Fogelman, Kaelyn, Elise, Maureen Walsh, Brewer, Shannon, and Stoeckel, James A. 2023.

In 2000 the Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment was listed as an endangered species, with joint listing authority shared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Complexity surrounding leadership is a challenge common in fisheries management. Because regulators and managers from federal, state, and Penobscot Nation contexts operate with independent authorities, recovery decisions depend upon effective communication and coordination. Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed and interviewed members of the Atlantic Salmon Recovery Framework (ASRF), the governance structure responsible for Atlantic Salmon management and recovery in Maine. The Communication Network Analysis (CNA) used survey results to better understand the flow of information and communication among members of ASRF. Survey and interview results revealed three areas of concern: 1) slow and ineffective decision-making, 2) confusion surrounding leadership and accountability, and 3) lack of adaptive capacity. Despite these challenges, ASRF members reported a commitment to maintaining a collaborative governance structure. Individuals reported long-standing relationships and a history of working together within and among organizations. This coupled with the high degree of current communication shows that transmission pathways exist and may be built upon over time. As management organizations work to restructure the ASRF, the following considerations may serve to improve collaborative efficiency: 1) encouraging inter-agency collaborations within Boards and Teams, 2) alignment of ASRF and organizational decision-making and power structures, 3) formalizations of information flow and 4) formalization of the program implementation process. As more species become threatened/endangered and management resources become scarcer, the need to work collaboratively across jurisdictions will become increasingly essential to environmental management and recovery. Understanding collaborative governance structures from a structural perspective may provide a means to assessing collaborative efficiency and highlighting areas for improvement. | | Flowers, H.J., T.J.

November 2021 || Otolith microchemistry has emerged as a powerful technique with which to identifythe natal origins of fishes, but it relies on differences in underlying geology that may occur over large spatial scales. An examination of how small a spatial scale on which this technique can be implemented, especially in water bodies that share a large proportion of their flow, would be useful for guiding aquatic invasive species control efforts. We examined trace isotopic signatures in northern pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>) otoliths to estimate their provenance between two reservoirs in the Upper Yampa River Basin, Colorado, USA. This is a challenging study area as these reservoirs are only 11-rkm apart on the same river and thus share a high proportion of their inflow. We found that three isotopes (86Sr, 137Ba, and 55Mn) were useful in discriminating between these reservoirs, but their signatures varied annually, and the values overlapped. Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) were different between sites and relatively stable across three years, which made them an ideal marker for determining northern pike provenance. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of otolith microchemistry for natal origin determination within the same river over a relatively small spatial scale when there are geologic differences between sites, especially geologic differences underlying tributaries between sites. | | Fitzpatrick KB, Weidel BC, Connerton MJ, Lantry Rudstam LG, Sullivan P, Brenden TO, Sethi SA.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 79:1529-1545. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/217947252736/None/all) | September 2022 || Trophic interactions are drivers of ecosystem change and stability, yet are often excluded from fisheries assessment models. Incorporating predator-prey interactions directly into population models may improve estimates of species dynamics and predictions of future fishery sustainability. In Lake Ontario, popular recreational salmonine fisheries, including Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) and lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>), are dependent on a single prey species, alewife (<i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>). To incorporate these tight predator-prey relationships into our assessment model, we built a multispecies population dynamics model that links, and simultaneously estimates, the dynamics of both predators and alewife. We found that prey availability has recently declined due to decreased alewife recruitment and a spike in Chinook salmon recruitment in 2016, leading to higher alewife mortality rates and lower predator growth rates. We then used the model to explore future predator-prey dynamics, specifically the impact of Chinook salmon stocking reductions on the potential for alewife population growth. Combined with other assessment tools, multispecies models can provide information on how trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics may affect future fishery sustainability. | | Fitzgerald, D., M.

While some frameworks adopt procedures for assigning threatened status to ecological communities or ecosystems, multispecies assessments under the United States Endangered Species Act ultimately lead to species-level listing decisions. This presents a range of potential benefits and consequences, and guidance is needed for how multispecies approaches can be incorporated into ESA risk assessments. To aid development of such guidance, this study reviewed multispecies assessments conducted between 1993-2019 in support of ESA listing decisions to identify the ecological basis for combining species, the assessment approach used, and the policy factors that may influence their efficacy. Forty-two unique cases were identified, covering 359 individual species. Most assessments (81%) included between 2-5 species, although some contained as many as 82. A common theme among reviewed cases was grouping narrow endemics or habitat specialists based on taxonomic relatedness, similar distributions, and common threats to persistence, although what constituted similar distributions varied from zero to nearly 100% overlap in ranges. All assessments included a combined threats analysis, but relatively few employed a similar species' response model or expert elicitation process. While ESA risk assessments are distinct from policy decisions, majority of assessments resulted in decisions that all species warranted endangered status. The challenge with developing guidance for selecting species based on qualitative proxies such as common geographies or threats is that ecological patterns and processes are scale dependent. We therefore argue for a tiered approach that recognizes these assessments as a collection of methods with varying degrees of potential bias and gains in efficiency. The ESA presents several unique challenges for implementing multispecies risk assessments, but a flexible approach may provide opportunities to realize increased efficiency while minimizing the risk of biasing decisions. | | Fitzgerald, D., A.

A Bayesian framework for assessing extinction risk based on ordinal categories of population condition and projected landscape change. Biological Conservation 253: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108866 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/210886889472/None/all) | December 2020 || Many at-risk species lack standardized surveys across their range or quantitative data capable of detecting demographic trends. As a result, extinction risk assessments often rely on ordinal categories of risk based on explicit criteria or expert elicitation. This study demonstrates a Bayesian approach to assessing extinction risk based on this common data structure, using three freshwater mussel species being considered for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. The probability that a population is classified under each risk category was modeled as a function of projected landscape change using ordered probit regression, assuming observed categories reflect a latent, continuous probability of persistence. All three species were more likely than not (mean probability > 0.5) to be classified as extirpated or low condition throughout their range based on effects of urban development and hydrologic alteration. Spatial variation in estimates revealed strongholds and high-risk areas relevant to conservation decision making. Projected change in probabilities of each risk category based on multiple land-use and climate models was generally small relative to high baseline risk resulting from past landscape changes. Assessing extinction risk based on probabilities of ordinal condition as a function of landscape patterns may provide a flexible and robust approach for many at-risk taxa by adjusting species' demographic criteria to match relative risk categories, following standardized criteria, or using expert elicitation for data-deficient species. This approach provides decision makers with a useful measure of uncertainty around ordinal classifications and provides a framework for estimating future risk based on projections of anthropogenic stressors.<br> | | Fischer, J.R., T.J.

North American Journal of Fisheries Management 39:607-624. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/75669235712/None/all) | October 2019 || Reservoirs are often managed similar to natural lakes because they are assumed to be functionally comparable. However, direct comparisons of fish assemblage-environment relationships between these two ecosystems are rare. We investigated associations of fish assemblage structure from 45 natural lakes and reservoirs in Iowa, USA. Fish sampling was conducted with benthic trawls in summer in conjunction with modified-fyke nets and night electrofishing in fall to characterize lentic fish assemblages and reduce gear selectivity. High species diversity in reservoirs was most strongly related to morphometric characteristics (i.e., larger surface area, increased depth); whereas, fewer species were observed in natural lakes with low water clarity and high suspended solids. Fish assemblage structure between natural lakes and reservoirs was consistently dissimilar for all sampling methods. Structuring of species composition in reservoirs was correlated with a variety of limnological and physical characteristics, but was inconsistent among sampling methods. In contrast, trophic structure of fishes in reservoirs was weakly associated with the environmental factors and was similar to taxonomic structure of fish in natural lakes. Fish trophic composition of natural lakes was most strongly related to waterbody size. Overall, distinct differences in fish assemblage structure were observed between natural and artificial lentic ecosystems. Differences were likely the result of dissimilar management activities (e.g., rotenone, stocking) between waterbody types that had overriding effects on assemblage-habitat relationships. Our results emphasize the need to consider waterbody origin and management legacies on fish assemblage characterization and subsequent inferences made from environmental correlations. | | Fiorello, C., P.G.R.

Changes in the physical characteristics, such as reductions in flow, increased sediment deposition, and increased surface area, often influence the system's biological components, including plant, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages. In addition to having direct effects on impounded waterbodies, impoundments can also have wide-ranging effects at the watershed scale, particularly on upstream tributary streams. The purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude of these effects. We analyzed historical data from 26 streams distributed across five sub-basins in the Bluff Hills region of the Yazoo Basin, MS, USA. All five major tributary rivers in this region are impounded by large(11,240-26,143 hectares) reservoirs for flood control. We compared fish assemblages in streams located upstream and downstream of the four reservoirs using PERMANOVA, and contrary to expectations, we found no significant differences between the upstream and downstream assemblages. We explore several possible explanations for this discrepancy and suggest that stream assemblage response to impoundment may be nuanced by the regional species pool, the history of stream conditions in the watershed, and the resistance of the streams to periodic disturbances. | | Faucheux, N.M., A.R.

We looked for general cascading spatial patternsacross five categories of reservoir attributes: land cover, morphology and hydrology, fish habitat, fishassemblages, and fisheries. Attributes were pulled from various databases for large reservoirs (>100 ha) locatedin the United States. 16 widely distributed river basins, each including a minimum of 15 large reservoirs, wereselected for analysis. Using analysis of covariance with basin as the class variable, we tested each attribute as alinear function of catchment area, which is an index of reservoir position in the basin. The majority of reservoirattributes displayed log-linear patterns as catchment area increased, indicating that reservoirs act as membersof a larger network just as river reaches do. Several patterns were detected including attributes with no apparentlengthwise arrangement along the basin; cascading spatial patterns in which attributes increase or decreasefrom upstream to downstream within a basin; and attributes that increase with catchment area in some basins,decrease in others, or may simply remain constant throughout the basin. We conclude that each pattern mayhave different implications for management, and that the effectiveness with which most management activitiesinfluence reservoirs is likely to increase or decrease along river basins. | | Fashingbauer, MC, LJ Tuttle, HE Robinson, JR Strickler, DK Hartline, and PH Lenz. 2019.

Certain alleles in host's prion protein gene are responsible for reduced susceptibility to CWD. We assessed for the first time variability in the prion protein gene of elk (<i>Cervus canadensis</i>) present in Pennsylvania, a reintroduced population for which CWD cases have never been reported. We sequenced the prion protein gene (PRNP) of 565 elk samples collected over seven years (2014-2020), and found two polymorphic sites (codon 21 and codon 132). The allele associated with reduced susceptibility to CWD is present in the population, and there was no evidence of deviations from H-W equilibrium in any of our sampling years (<i>p</i>-values between 0.14 and 1), consistent the lack of selective pressure on the PRNP. The less susceptible genotypes were found in a frequency similar to the ones reported for elk populations of Wyoming and South Dakota before CWD was detected. We calculated the proportion of less susceptible genotypes in each hunt zone in Pennsylvania as a proxy for their vulnerability to the establishment of CWD repeating the process for different hunt zone delineations implemented in previous years. We interpolated these results to obtain a surface representing expected proportion of the less susceptible genotypes across the area. We found significant correlation between the results obtained for different hunt zone delineations (p-value<0.001), showing consistency in the pattern regardless of the hunt zone delineation used. Based on this analysis, hunt zones located in the southern part of our study area have a low proportion of less susceptible genotypes, which is discouraging for elk persistence in Pennsylvania given that these hunt zones were adjacent to the deer Disease Management Area 3, where CWD has been present since 2014. | | Fallon, J.A., E.P.

Using social values in the prioritization of research: quantitative examples and generalizations. Ecology and Evolution 10.1002/ece3.8394 December 2021 || Identifying critical uncertainties about ecological systems can help prioritize research efforts intended to inform management decisions. However, exclusively focusing on the ecological system neglects the objectives of natural resource managers and the associated social values tied to risks and rewards of actions.I demonstrate how to prioritize research efforts for a harvested population by applying expected value of perfect information (EVPI) to harvest decisions made with a density-independent matrix population model. Research priorities identified by EVPI diverge from priorities identified by matrix elasticity analyses that ignore social utility. Using a density-dependent harvest model, the value of information about the intrinsic productivity of a population is shown to be sensitive to the socially determined penalty for implementing a harvest rate that deviates from the goal because of imperfection in estimation. <i>Synthesis and applications.</i> The effect of including social values into harvest decision-making depends on the assumed population model, uncertainty in population vital rates, and the particular form of the utility function used to represent risk/reward of harvest. EVPI analyses that includes perceived utility of different outcomes can be used by managers seeking to optimize monitoring and research spending.

The relationship between increasing investment in information and the attendant decline in probability of making bad decisions can be optimized to ensure that applied environmental research is cost effective. In the present article, I use straightforward analytical and numerical methods to explore conditions in which the value of information is less than the cost of obtaining it. As pressures on Earth's natural resources grow, managers will be called on increasingly to do more with less, which can be achieved with formal optimization. Implementing such optimizations will help ensure that formal decision-making tools are used to translate science into decisions, which will often require collaboration between biological scientists and social scientists. | | Fabiano, E., C.

We further evaluated the intrinsic potential (IP) for sites to support Finescale Dace using predicted probability of occurrence values from species distribution models (SDM) fit with basin-wide fish occurrence surveys from 2008 - 2019 (<i>n </i>= 124) and spatially continuous environmental variables including forecasted stream temperature scenarios. Sites with Finescale Dace tended to occur close to lentic waterbodies, contain emergent vegetation cover, and did not exhibit large overlap in species-space with either native or nonnative species. Predicted probability of Finescale Dace occurrence exhibited non-linear relationships to mean August stream temperature, channel slope, and baseflow index. The amount of suitable habitat (i.e., high IP scores) declined with forecasted stream warming scenarios. We ranked potential translocation sites based on: distance measures from occupied sites in the 1) habitat MVA, 2) fish community MVA, and 3) extracted IP scores for current and future warming scenarios. Our highest ranked translocation sites provide a basis for management actions aimed at safeguarding an at-risk climate relict fish population into the future and our approach may be transferable to other wild animal populations with restricted distributions. | | Euclide, P.T., G.

Managing development requires information on the public's acceptability of development and understanding which factors shape acceptability. In this study, we examined three questions: 1) What is the public's acceptability of development? 2) Is acceptability of development influenced by wildlife information? and 3) Is the maximum amount of acceptable development influenced by views about wildlife, involvement in outdoor recreation, and demographic factors? We conducted a visual-preference survey of 9,000 households in Vermont, USA that asked about acceptable levels of development, acceptability of wildlife, involvement in recreation, and individual and town demographics. The survey response rate was 44%. Maximum acceptable condition (MAC) for development was 41 houses/km2 and not meaningfully influenced by broader consequences of development on seven common wildlife species. MAC was influenced by views on individual species, including bear and coyote, but not by other species such as deer, fox, and bobcat. Respondents with a positive attitude toward bear favored less development, whereas the opposite relationship existed for coyote. Similarly, MAC was negatively influenced by involvement in birding and hunting, but not by other common recreational activities. Among demographic factors, respondents that were younger and not born in Vermont were more accepting of development. Population density also positively influenced development acceptability. Results provide measures of the public's acceptability of development that can help guide decision-making about development, wildlife, and recreation management. | (2021) Body size and digestive system shape resource selection by ungulates: A cross-taxa test of the forage maturation hypothesis.

Nevertheless, metabolic allometry and different digestive systems suggest that resource selection should vary across ungulate species. By combining GPS relocations with remotely sensed data on forage characteristics and surface water, we quantified the effect of body size and digestive system in determining movements of 30 populations of hindgut fermenters (equids) and ruminants across biomes. Selection for intermediate forage biomass was negatively related to body size, regardless of digestive system. Selection for proximity to surface water was stronger for equids relative to ruminants, regardless of body size. To be more generalisable, we suggest that the FMH explicitly incorporate contingencies in body size and digestive system, with smallbodied ruminants selecting more strongly for potential energy intake, and hindgut fermenters selecting more strongly for surface water. | | Erwin JA, Vargas K, Blais BR, Bennett K, Muldoon J, Findysz S, Christie C, Heffelfinger JR and M Culver. 2018.

In theory, stocking YY males or ZZ females would allow managers to skew sex ratios until populations collapse. In combination with other suppression methods, such as removal, this approach could be incorporated into Integrated Pest Management plans. For example, fishery managers have stocked YY males to control isolated non-native brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) populations. However, life histories and demographic factors (e.g., lifespans) vary across species and could affect the feasibility of skewing sex ratios as an effective control strategy for a given population. Likewise, some species may have sex determinations that do not allow population control through sex-skewing methods. We compared five representative aquatic invasive species with global invasion ranges for potential control by skewing the sex ratio through closed population simulations: red swamp tilapia determined that Nile tilapia, red swamp crayfish, and zebra mussels would be the most suitable to control through skewing the sex ratio assuming appropriate sex determination exists in the species. Lake trout could be eliminated by stocking YY males but would require either long stocking periods or high stocking numbers because of the long lifespan of the species. Silver carp populations were more difficult to crash because they live longer and produce many recruits. Broadly, these patterns demonstrated that short lived species lend themselves to control by skewing the sex ratio. | | Eric Lonsdorf, Carol A. Sanders-Reed, Clint Boal, and Taber D. Allison. 2018.

Ecologists and conservationists need tools to assess the effect of these ecological and environmental perturbations on organismal fitness. One possibility is glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol and corticosterone) which integrate various factors such as anthropogenic disturbances, predation, food, or environmental stressors. Here we tested the hypothesis that fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (GCMs) in wild female elk (<i>Cervus canadensis</i>) increased as the hunting season progressed. We also examined the influence of year, food availability, and elk group size on fecal GCMs. We found that as the hunting season progressed, fecal GCMs tended to decrease. We also found that as the number of cows in a group increased, GCMs decreased, and found a strong effect of year on fecal GCMs, with samples collected in 2016 having lower fecal GCMs than those collected in 2015, 2017, and 2018. However, yearly variation was not driven by availability of hard mast forage. The lack of positive association between hunting pressure and fecal GCMs and identifying what is driving yearly variation in fecal GCMs warrants further study. We highlight the negative influence of group size, possibly due to vigilance, on fecal GCMs and the importance of examining ecologically relevant covariates to accurately identify main treatment effects. | | Engman, A.C., T.J.

Tissue samples acted as a control to compare extraction and DNA suitability for microsatellite analysis for nasal swabs and nasal swabs and ocular fluid extracted from FTA Elute cards. We determined that FTA Elute cards improved the extraction time and storage of samples and that nasal swabs and ocular fluid containing pigmented fluid were reasonable alternatives to traditional tissue DNA extractions. Also, DNA extractions from nasal swabs provided ample DNA but did not improve extraction time or storage of samples. | | Eddy, M. C., Lord, B., Perrot, D., Bower, L. M., & Peoples, B. K. (2022). Predictability of flow metrics calculated using a distributed hydrologic model across ecoregions and stream classes: Implications for developing e2387. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/226114142208/None/all) | March 2022 || Developing environmental flow standards requires an empirical understanding of the relationship between species' ecology and instream flow. However, when congruent biological and hydrologic data are lacking, the accurate simulation of hydrologic metrics (HMs) corresponding to the locations of biological data is needed. Methods to predict HMs vary in formulation (i.e., statistical vs. process-based hydrologic models), ability to simulate HMs across the full range of the hydrologic regime (i.e., magnitude, duration, frequency, rate of change, and timing), and ability to transfer HMs from gaged to ungaged locations. Yet despite the breadth of modeling approaches, less attention has been paid to the variability in HMs associated with each approach. In this study, we apply a distributed hydrologic model to the diverse watersheds of South Carolina to examine the predictability of HMs from simulated daily time series of streamflow across ecoregions, stream classifications, and level of human alteration. In doing so, we contextualize the predictability of HMs, giving managers and researchers in South Carolina the flexibility of choosing HMs that are best suited for quantifying flow-ecology relationships based on the location, flow regime components of interest, and uncertainty of HMs. We found that at least one HM within each of the five flow regime components (out of a selected subset of 41 non-redundant HMs) was consistently and accurately predicted across the diverse streams of the study area. We discuss the patterns of predictability related to site characterizations and individual HMs and their implications for developing environmental flow standards. | | Eddleman, W. R. and C. J.

In some areas, cats occur in higher densities than native mammalian predators and can have severe impacts upon prey populations. We set 51 wildlife game cameras in residential yards in Arkansas USA to understand which landscape and yard features influenced the cat abundance occurring in yards. Additionally, we quantified the daily activity patterns of cats and explored how habitat features and human or predator activity influenced the timing of cat activity. We found that cats were present in 65% of yards with an average of 3 recognizable individuals per yard. Abundance of cats was higher than all native mesopredators except for raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) and Virginia opossum (<i>Didelphis virginiana</i>). Cat abundance increased as housing unit density and agricultural land use surrounding homes increased. We found no relationship between cat abundance and yard features. Cats were active at all times of the day but tended to be more diurnal in areas closer to city centers or in agricultural settings. Conversely, cats were more nocturnal later in the summer and in areas that had high levels of human or predator activity. Our results suggest that cats are widespread in this region and their relative abundance is driven more by landscape features than it is by yard features. Cats may alter their activity to better coexist with humans and predators. Alteration of yard features is likely not an effective deterrent for cats and more direct control measures may be necessary. | | Dzul, Maria Christina, William Louis Kendall, Charles Brandon Yackulic, Dana L.

Prior to EuroAmerican settlement, these forests experienced frequent surface fires but are now vulnerable to uncharacteristically large, high severity fires. Fire directly influences the structure and composition of these forested systems and, in turn, the wildlife that inhabit them. Thus, the changing fire regime results in uncertain consequences for vegetation dynamics and wildlife habitat. A southwestern mixed-conifer forest inhabitant of particular note is the Mexican spotted owl (<i>Strix occidentalis lucida</i>), which is federally listed as threatened. High-severity fire has been cited as the owl's primary threat, but uncertainties surround the impacts of high severity fire on the threatened subspecies, particularly across a timeframe longer than a few years. Our objective was to explore the <i>long-term </i>(i.e., 100-year timeframe) effects of fire severity on elements of forest structure vital for Mexican spotted owl nesting. To accomplish this, we quantified desirable structural attributes for nest/roost habitat across burned (varying severity levels) and unburned (control) mixed-conifer forests within the last century. High severity fire has the strongest deleterious impact on elements of forest structure vital to Mexican spotted owl nesting, and although the structural differences between severity classes diminish with time, it took 80-100 years to reach the structural conditions desired for Mexican spotted owl nesting after stand-replacing fires. The most important attribute measured, canopy cover, required 90-100 years after high severity fires to reach levels known to support Mexican spotted owls. As fires increase in frequency, severity, and size compared to the last century, forests of the Sacramento Mountains will face an overall decrease in the structural conditions needed for Mexican spotted owl nesting habitat. Uncharacteristic high severity fire in particular poses an imminent threat to nesting habitat far into the future. | | Dunn, C.G., M.J. temperature.

It is unclear how increasingly frequent extreme-flow events and warming air temperatures will affect crayfish populations, partly because there are few long-term crayfish monitoring datasets. Using a unique 10-year dataset, we asked: 1) whether recruitment of crayfish in summer responded to extreme-flow events and air temperature during spring brooding and summer growing periods, and 2) whether responses were similar among 3 co-occurring crayfish species. Golden <i>Faxonius crayfishes were sampled in quadrats at 2 sites each in the Big Piney (1993-2000) and Jacks Fork (1992-2001) rivers 3355 1-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats). We models to relate variability in quadrat-level age-0 counts to mean daily maximum air temperatures and flow metrics (variability, magnitude, and frequency of extreme high- and low-flow events). Species ranged from a small-bodied, abundant, habitat generalist (Golden Crayfish) to large-bodied, uncommon, habitat specialists (Ozark, Spothand crayfishes). Golden Crayfish occurred in higher-velocity habitats (riffles, runs) and had variable recruitment that increased during years with few spring and summer high-flow events and summers with lower flows and warmer temperatures. In contrast, annual recruitment variability of Ozark and Spothand crayfishes was low and explained by positive effects of cooler summers and by varying flow metrics. Spothand Crayfish recruitment decreased in years with frequent spring and summer high-flow events, whereas lower summer minimum flow was the only flow metric that explained slight increases in Ozark Crayfish recruitment. Relationships with the preceding year's recruitment were quadratic for Ozark and Spothand crayfishes, suggesting potential density dependence at higher recruitment levels. Species-specific responses suggest that closely related crayfishes could respond idiosyncratically to changes in temperature and flow. Temperature- and flow-related disturbances may be key mechanisms mediating competition and, thus, may help maintain crayfish diversity. However, warming air temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme-flow events could disadvantage some species, thereby altering future crayfish assemblages. | | Dunn, C.G. and P.L.

A tributary's discharge at its mouth is a coarse indicator of the richness of large-river specialists found within the tributary, but the relative influences of regional dispersal and local habitat underpinning this species-discharge relationship are often unknown. We sampled large-river specialist fishes at sites within two nonwadeable tributaries of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers with contrasting prairie (Grand River) vs. upland (Meramec River) habitats to address four research questions: (1) Do alpha diversity (mean site-level species richness) and beta diversity (among-site species compositional differences) vary between tributaries? (2) Does mean annual discharge correlate with local habitat and downstream distance to mainstem rivers (i.e., mainstem connectivity)? (3) Are slopes of species-discharge relationships consistent between tributaries? And (4) Do local habitat and downstream distance explain residual richness at sites beyond variation already explained by species-discharge relationships? We detected 30 of 42 potential large-river specialist fishes, demonstrating most mainstem species use tributaries. Mean site richness was higher in the Grand River (12.5 species vs. 9.8 species in Meramec River), but partitioning of lower reaches (sites < 116 km from river mouth) and dispersal limitation in upper reaches (sites 145 km from river mouth) caused Meramec River beta diversity to be three times higher. Mean annual discharge correlated with habitat availability at sites and downstream distance to a mainstem. Although site-level alpha richness generally increased with discharge in both tributaries, slopes of species-discharge relationships varied between tributaries. Analyzing species-discharge residuals revealed downstream distance explained additional variation in site-level richness not accounted for by local discharge. For example, discharge alone underrepresented richness in lower-discharge sites accessible to dispersers (maximum underestimate = 8.7 species) and overrepresented richness in isolated sites (maximum overestimate = 5.8 species). Thus, predictive performance of species-discharge relationships can be improved by accounting for varying habitats among tributaries and downstream distance of sites to mainstems when valuing tributaries for fishes with dispersal-dependent life cycles. | | Dunn, C.

Nine sites were sampled seasonally with six gears in two physiographic regions in Missouri (USA). Using resampling procedures and mixed-effects modeling, we quantified richness and compositional overlap among gears, identified efficient gear combinations, and evaluated protocol performance across regions and seasons. We detected 25-75 species per sample and 89 185 fish. On average, no single gear detected >62% of observed species, but an optimized, integrated-gear protocol with four complementary gears on average detected 90% of species while only requiring 51.9% of initial sampling effort. Neither season nor physiographic region explained low spatiotemporal variation in percent richness detected by the integrated-gear protocol. In contrast, equivalent effort with an electrofishing-only protocol was 53.5% less efficient, seasonally biased and imprecise (36.1%-82.3% of richness), and on average detected 15.9% less of observed richness. Altogether, riverine fish richness is likely underestimated with single-gear survey designs. When paired with existing wadeable-stream inventories, our customizable approach could benefit regional monitoring by comprehensively documenting riverine contributions to riverscape biodiversity. | | Dunn, C.

Retrospective analyses of species' responses to anthropogenic disturbances can inform such strategies. We developed a hierarchical framework to contrast environmental conditions underlying persistence versus extirpation of an imperiled stream fish, Candy Darter (Etheostoma osburni), over decades of changing land use. The decline of E. osburni may broadly represent the challenge of conserving sensitive freshwater species in intensively used upland environments. Location: New River drainage, Appalachian Mountains, USA. Methods: We surveyed fish and habitat in historically occupied sites to identify population refugia, and used multivariate and spatial analyses to address three questions: (a) what are the environmental correlates of refugia? (b) are the pathways by which land use impacts instream habitat constrained by catchment and/or segmentscale features? and (c) are E. osburni distributional dynamics spatially structured and explained by fine sediment and warm stream temperatures? Results: We confirmed a recently localized distribution similar to other upland species, marked by at least seven extirpations from streams throughout E. osburni's southern range. Catchmentscale features primarily constrained land use and finerscale habitat, leading to either extirpations or populationsupporting refugia defined by features at multiple scales. Refugium habitats contained cooler temperatures and less fine sediment. Rare mismatches between persistence and habitat suitability were explained by network location, suggesting unmeasured environmental gradients and/or dispersal contributed to distributional dynamics. Main conclusions: We provided insight at multiple spatial scales into how aquatic species' distributions become fragmented and localized. Our results demonstrate that natural landscape heterogeneity imparts spatially variable resistance of sensitive species to intensive land uses. By recognizing the scalespecific features that buffer populations from extirpation, conservation strategies could be tailored to protect naturally occurring refugium habitats and focus restoration in systems where such habitats are broadly lacking. | | Dunlop, K, M Wipfli, R Muladal, G Wierzbinski. 2020.

Over the past 16 years, camera traps have become an increasingly common tool to monitor and understand the current distribution of Eastern Spotted Skunks. To inform best surveying practices, we reviewed 16 camera trap studies specifically targeting this species. We focused on reported latency to initial detection and 3 main aspects of study design: seasonality of detections, baits and lures, and camera trap brands. Latency to initial detection ranged from 1-82 days with a mean of 17.1 days (SD = 9.1). Attractants varied among projects, but most (75%) used sardines as bait. The highest percentage of skunk detections occurred in March (92%). Studies using Moultrie brand camera traps were the most widely used, but Bushnell camera traps had a higher detection rate (mean = 24%, SD = 18.5, <i>n =</i> 4) than other brands included in our review. We conclude by outlining effective surveying techniques that will aid in developing more efficient methods to address key knowledge gaps for this elusive species. | | Dugger, Katie M., Alan B.

This assumption is rarely evaluated, and there is a need to understand the degree of connectivity among patches to appropriately define, manage, and conserve biological populations. <br><i> </i><br><i>Objectives </i>Our objectives were to quantify local persistence, colonization, and recruitment (metademographic rates) in relation to habitat attributes, evaluate the influence of the spatial arrangement of patches on landscape-scale population dynamics, and estimate the scale at which metapopulation dynamics are occurring for Oregon spotted frog (<i>Rana pretiosa</i>).<br><i> </i><br><i>Methods </i>We collected <i>R. pretiosa</i> detection/non-detection data and habitat information from 93 sites spread throughout the species' core extant range in Oregon, USA, 2010-2018.

However, this approach requires replicate detection/non-detection data and many long-term monitoring programs lack temporal replicate surveys at a sample unit. In such cases, it has been suggested that surveying subunits within a larger sample unit may be an efficient substitution (i.e., space-for-time substitution). Still, the efficacy of fitting occupancy models using a space-for-time substitution has not been fully explored and is likely context dependent. Herein, we fit multistate occupancy models to Delta Smelt (<i>Hypomesus transpacificus</i>) and Longfin Smelt (<i>Spirinchus thaleichthys</i>) catch data collected by two different monitoring programs in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, USA. We demonstrate how our inferences concerning the distribution and relative abundance of these species changes when using a space-for-time substitution. Specifically, we found the probability that a sample unit was occupied and contained a large number of fish was much greater when using a space-for-time substitution, presumably due to the change in the spatial scale of our inferences. Furthermore, our results indicate that as the spatial scale of our inferences increased our ability to detect environmental effects on system dynamics decreased, which we suspect is related to the tradeoffs associated with spatial grain and extent. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering how the unique characteristics of monitoring programs influences inferences, which has broad implications for how to appropriately leverage existing long-term monitoring data to understand the distribution and relative abundance of species. | | DuFour, M., K.F.

The habitat preferences of host individuals affect their probability of exposure to pathogens. If preference behavior can be incorporated in ecological niche models (ENMs) when data on pathogen distributions is available, then variation in such behavior may dramatically impact exposure risk. Here we use data from the anthrax endemic system of Etosha National Park, Namibia, to demonstrate how integrating inferred movement behavior alters the construction of disease risk maps. We used a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model that associated soil, bioclimatic, and vegetation variables with the best available pathogen presence data collected at anthrax carcass sites to map areas of most likely <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> (the causative bacterium of anthrax) persistence. We then used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to distinguish foraging and non-foraging behavioral states along the movement tracks of nine zebra (<i>Equus quagga</i>) during the 2009 and 2010 anthrax seasons. The resulting tracks, decomposed on the basis of the inferred behavioral state, formed the basis of step-selection functions (SSFs) that used the MaxEnt output as a potential predictor variable. Our analyses revealed different risks of exposure during different zebra behavioral states, which were obscured when the full movement tracks were analyzed without consideration of the underlying behavioral states of individuals. Pathogen (or vector) distribution models may be misleading with regard to the actual risk faced by host animal populations when specific behavioral states are not explicitly accounted for in selection analyses. To more accurately evaluate exposure risk, especially in the case of environmentally transmitted pathogens, selection functions could be built for each identified behavioral state and then used to assess the comparative exposure risk across relevant states. The scale of data collection and analysis, however, introduces complexities and limitations for consideration when interpreting results. | | Dornak, L.L., J. L. Aycrigg, J. Sauer, and C. J.

We conducted the first range-wide assessment of population trends for the iconic Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (<i>Ovis canadensis canadensis</i>) of North America to investigate links between population trends and translocation history. Millions of US dollars have been spent translocating bighorn sheep to achieve conservation objectives, yet a range-wide assessment is lacking. We collected bighorn sheep population estimates for 217 populations across ten US states and two Canadian provinces. We categorized each population by translocation status: native (populations received no translocations), augmented (native populations supplemented with translocation), or reintroduced (populations beginning from translocation). Fifty-eight percent of populations increased in recent years. While most reintroduced and native populations increased in the last 5 years of records, almost double the number of augmented populations declined compared to increased. Reintroduced and augmented populations from the north-central portion of bighorn sheep range declined the most in the last 5 years of records, while southern populations tended to be more stable. Although Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep appear to be a conservation and restoration success, the threat of local population loss remains high in certain regions. We show how amalgamating multi-jurisdictional population data can assist in determining wildlife status and assessing broad-scale management outcomes. | | Donovan, T.M., and R. M. Mickey. 2019.

American and Eurasian beavers (<i>Castor canadensis; C. fiber</i>) are frequently translocated for reintroductions, to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, and as an ecosystem restoration tool. However, little is known about movement behavior of translocated beavers post-release, especially in desert rivers with patchy and dynamic resources. We identified space-use patterns of beaver movement behavior after translocation. We translocated and monitored nuisance American beavers in desert river restoration sites on the Price and San Rafael Rivers, Utah, USA, and compared their space use to resident beavers after tracking both across two years. Resident adult beavers were detected at a mean maximum distance of 0.86 \u00b1 0.21 river beavers were detected at substantially greater maximum distances. Based on coarse-scale movement models, translocated and resident subadult beavers moved substantially farther from release sites and faster than resident adult beavers up to six months post-release. In contrast, fine-scale movement models using 5-minute location intervals showed similar median distance traveled between resident adult and translocated beavers. Our findings suggest day-to-day activities, such as foraging and resting, were largely unaltered by translocation, but translocated beavers exhibited coarse-scale movement behavior most similar to dispersal by resident subadults. Coarse-scale movement rates decreased with time since release, suggesting that translocated beavers adjusted to the novel environment over time and eventually settled into a home range similar to resident adult beavers. Understanding translocated beaver movement behavior in response to a novel desert system can help future beaver-assisted restoration efforts to identify appropriate release sites and strategies. | | Do Bark-Beetle Affected Forests Provide Elk a Refuge to Elude Hunters? || January 2020 || | | Dillon, K.

Despite ongoing declines in many coastal shark populations, conventional surveys might be too fleeting and too recent to describe population trends over decades to millennia. Placing recent shark declines into historical context should improve management efforts as well as our understanding of past ecosystem dynamics. A new palaeoecological approach for surveying shark abundance on coral reefs is to quantify dermal denticle assemblages preserved in sediments. This approach assumes that denticle accumulation rates correlate with shark abundances. Here, we test this assumption by comparing the denticle record in surface sediments to three conventional shark survey methods at Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, central Pacific Ocean, where shark density is high and spatially heterogeneous. We generally found a significant positive correlation between denticle accumulation rates and shark abundances derived from underwater visual census, baited remote underwater video and hook and line surveys. Denticle accumulation rates reflected shark abundances, suggesting that denticle assemblages can preserve a signal of timeaveraged shark abundance in lowenergy coral reef environments. We offer suggestions for applying this tool to measure shark abundance over long timescales in other contexts. | | Diggins. C.A. and W.M. Ford. 2021.

Ifju. 2022, The Bathy-drone: An autonomous October 2022 || A unique drone-based system for underwater mapping (bathymetry) was developed at the University of Florida. The system, called the \"Bathy-drone,\" is comprised of a drone that drags, via a tether, a small vessel on the water surface in a raster pattern. The vessel is equipped with a recreational commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sonar unit that has down-scan, side-scan, and chirp capabilities and logs GPS referenced sonar data onboard or transmitted in real-time with a telemetry link. Data can then be retrieved post-mission and plotted in various ways. The system provides both isobaths and contours of bottom hardness. Extensive testing of the system was conducted on a 5-acre pond located at the University of Florida Plant Science and Education Unit in Citra, FL. Prior to performing scans of the pond, ground truth data was acquired with an RTK GNSS unit on a pole to precisely measure the location of the bottom at over 300 locations. An assessment of the accuracy and resolution of the system was measured by comparison to the ground truth data. The pond ground truth had an average depth of 2.30m while the Bathy-drone measured an average 21.6cm deeper than the ground truth, repeatable to within 2.6cm. The results justify integration of RTK and IMU corrections. During testing, it was found that there are numerous advantages of the Bathy-drone system compared to conventional methods including ease of implementation and the ability to initiate surveys from the land by flying the system to the water or placing the platform in the water. The system is also inexpensive, lightweight, and low volume, thus making transport convenient. The Bathy-drone can collect data at speeds of 0-24 km/h (0-15 mph), and thus can be used in waters with swift currents. Additionally, there are no propellers or control surfaces underwater, so the vessel does not tend to snag on floating vegetation and can be dragged over sandbars. An area of more than 10 acres was surveyed using the Bathy-drone in one battery charge and in less than 25 minutes. | | DiStefano, R.J., J.T. Westhoff, C.J. Rice, and A.E. || | | DiStefano RJ, D.

Plethodontid variable December 2021 || Emerging infectious diseases are among the leading drivers of the sixth mass extinction. The recent invasion of a highly pathogenic chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i> (<i>Bsal</i>), across Europe has led to salamander mass mortality. To date, it remains unclear whether <i>Bsal</i> will cause salamander mass mortalities in North America. Here, we tested the <i>Bsal</i> susceptibility (10,000 zoospores) and high (500,000 zoospores) <i>Bsal</i> dose<i>.</i> Overall, we found rapid and complete mortality of <i>N. viridescens</i> accompanied with high-<i>Bsal</i> infections (> 200,000 <i>Bsal</i> zoospores) and severe <i>Bsal</i> lesions distributed across the body and deep within the skin. In contrast, we found low mortality of plethodontid salamanders, where only 5 of 60 (8%) <i>Bsal</i>-exposed individuals died over the course of the experiment. In general, plethodontid salamanders experienced moderate <i>Bsal</i> infections (~ 4000 <i>Bsal</i> zoospores) with small numbers of <i>Bsal</i>-type lesions limited to the head and lateral body. Following the first <i>Bsal</i> inoculation, we found that <i>Bd</i> co-infections negatively affected <i>Bsal</i> infections, suggesting cross reactivity of the immune system or competitive exclusion, but this pattern did not persist following the second inoculation. We also found that <i>Bsal</i> infection intensity decreased over time following the second higher <i>Bsal</i> inoculation, suggesting evidence of immune priming. Throughout the experiment, all species and treatments experienced stable or increasing body condition over time. Lastly, ancestral state reconstruction of <i>Bsal</i> susceptibility indicated that although the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the family Plethodontidae is resistant to <i>Bsal</i>, the MRCA of the genus <i>Plethodon</i> is tolerant of <i>Bsal</i>. This highlights the variation in <i>Bsal</i>-infection outcomes across Plethodontidae. Collectively, our results suggest that Plethodontidae salamanders differ in their <i>Bsal</i> susceptibility, with some species less impacted than others, which will likely have consequences for their conservation and management. | | DiRenzo, G.

Current theory predicts that <i>Bd</i> infections are maintained through both reproduction on the host's skin and reinfection from sources outside of the host. To investigate the importance of external reinfection on pathogen burden, we infected captive-bred individuals of the highly susceptible Panamanian Golden Frog, <i>Atelopus glyphus,</i> and wild-caught glass frogs, <i>Espadarana prosoblepon,</i> with <i>Bd</i>. We housed the animals in one of three treatments: individually, in heterospecific pairs, and in conspecific pairs. For 8 weeks, we measured the <i>Bd</i> load and shedding rate of all frogs. We found that <i>Atelopus</i> had high rates of increase in both <i>Bd</i> load and shedding rate, but pathogen growth rates did not differ among treatments. The infection intensity of <i>Espadarana</i> co-housed with <i>Atelopus</i> was indistinguishable from those housed singly and those in conspecific pairs, despite being exposed to a large external source of <i>Bd</i> zoospores. Our results indicate that <i>Bd</i> load in both species is driven by pathogen replication within an individual, with reinfection from outside the host contributing little to the amplification of host fungal load. | | DiRenzo, G.

Ecology 102: e03315. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/221311500288/None/all) || dynamic occupancy models (FODOMs) are a class of state-space model in which the true state (occurrence) is observed imperfectly. An important assumption of FODOMs is that site dynamics only depend on the current state and that variations in dynamic processes are adequately captured with covariates or random effects. However, it is often difficult to understand and/or measure the covariates that generate ecological data, which are typically spatiotemporally correlated. Consequently, the non-independent error structure of correlated data causes underestimation of parameter uncertainty and poor ecological inference. Here, we extend the FODOM framework with a second-order Markov process to accommodate site memory when covariates are not available. Our modeling framework can be used to make reliable inference about site occupancy, colonization, extinction, turnover, and detection probabilities. We present a series of simulations to illustrate the data requirements and model performance. We then applied our modeling framework to 13 yr of data from an amphibian community in southern Arizona, USA. In this analysis, we found residual temporal autocorrelation of population processes for most species, even after accounting for long-term drought dynamics. Our approach represents a valuable advance in obtaining inference on population dynamics, especially as they relate to metapopulations. | | DiRenzo, G. V., Hanks, E., & D. A. W. Miller. 2022.

However, these disease metrics may be biased if lowlevel infection intensities are missed by sampling methods or laboratory diagnostic tests. These false negatives underestimate pathogen prevalence and overestimate mean infection intensity of infected individuals. Our objectives were twofold. First, we quantified false negative error rates of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>) on noninvasive skin swabs collected from an amphibian community in El Cop\u00e9, Panama. We swabbed amphibians twice in sequence, and we used a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian estimator to assess disease status of the population. Second, we developed a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously account for imperfect pathogen detection from field sampling and laboratory diagnostic testing. We evaluated the performance of the model, using simulations and varying sampling design to quantify the magnitude of bias in estimates of pathogen prevalence and infection intensity.We show that <i>Bd</i> detection probability from skin swabs was related to host infection intensity, where <i>Bd</i> infections <10 zoospores have <95% probability of being detected. If imperfect <i>Bd</i> detection was not considered, then <i>Bd</i> prevalence was underestimated by as much as 71%. In the <i>Bd</i>amphibian system, this indicates a need to correct for imperfect pathogen detection in enzootic host populations persisting with lowlevel infections. More generally, our results have implications for study designs in other disease systems, particularly those with similar objectives, biology, and sampling decisions.Uncertainty in pathogen detection is an inherent property of most sampling protocols and diagnostic tests, where the magnitude of bias depends on the study system, type of infection, and false negative error rates. Given that it may be difficult to know this information in advance, we advocate that the most cautious approach is to assume all errors are possible and to accommodate them by adjusting sampling designs. The modelling framework presented here improves the accuracy in estimating pathogen prevalence and infection intensity. | | DiRenzo, G. V., E. F. Zipkin, E. H. C. Grant, J. A. Royle, A. V. Longo, K.

Yet, effective pathogen control strategies are notoriously difficult to identify, in part because quantifying and forecasting pathogen spread and disease dynamics is challenging. Following an outbreak, hosts must cope with the presence of the pathogen, leading to host-pathogen coexistence or extirpation. Despite decades of research, little is known about host-pathogen coexistence postoutbreak when low host abundances and cryptic species make these interactions difficult to study. Using a novel diseasestructured Nmixture model, we evaluate empirical support for three host-pathogen coexistence hypotheses (source-sink, ecoevolutionary rescue, and spatial variation in pathogen transmission) in a Neotropical amphibian community decimated by <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>) in 2004. During 2010-2014, we surveyed amphibians in Parque Nacional G. D. Omar Torr\u00edjos Herrera, Cocl\u00e9 Province, El Cop\u00e9, Panama. We found that the primary driver of host-pathogen coexistence was ecoevolutionary rescue, as evidenced by similar amphibian survival and recruitment rates between infected and uninfected hosts. Average apparent monthly survival rates of uninfected and infected hosts were both close to 96%, and the expected number of uninfected and infected hosts recruited (via immigration/reproduction) was less than one host per disease state per 20m site. The secondary driver of host-pathogen coexistence was spatial variation in pathogen transmission as we found that transmission was highest in areas of low abundance but there was no support for the source-sink hypothesis. Our results indicate that changes in the host community (i.e., through genetic or species composition) can reduce the impacts of emerging infectious disease postoutbreak. Our diseasestructured Nmixture model represents a valuable advancement for conservation managers trying to understand underlying host-pathogen interactions and provides new opportunities to study disease dynamics in remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens. | | DiRenzo, G.

Investigating the potential use of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) as an anti-fungal treatment December 2020 || The disease caused by the pathogenic chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Bd), has contributed to global amphibian declines. Bd infects the keratinized epidermal tissue in amphibians and causes hyperkeratosis and excessive skin shedding. In individuals of susceptible species, the regulatory function of the amphibian's skin is disrupted resulting in an electrolyte depletion, osmotic imbalance, and eventually death. Safe and effective treatments for chytridiomycosis are urgently needed to control chytrid fungal infections and stabilize populations of endangered amphibian species in captivity and in the wild. Currently, the most widely used anti-Bd treatment is itraconazole. Preparations of itraconazole formulated for amphibian use has proved effective, but treatment involves short baths over seven to ten days, a process which is logistically challenging, stressful, and causes long-term health effects. Here, we explore a novel anti-fungal therapeutic using a single application of the ionic liquid, 1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMP-NTf2), for the treatment of chytridiomycosis. was found be effective at killing Bd <i>in low concentrations (1:1000 dilution). We tested BMP-NTf2 <i>in vivo</i> on two amphibian species, one that is relatively tolerant of chytridiomycosis (<i>Pseudacris regilla</i>) and one that is highly susceptible (<i>Dendrobates tinctorius</i>). A toxicity trial revealed a surprising interaction between Bd infection status and the impact of BMP-NTf2 on <i>D</i>. such that only 1 out of 30 frogs died following treatment (at a dose of 156.95 L/g), whereas, a lower dose (mean \u00b1 SE; L/g) was not tolerated by Bd-infected <i>D</i>. <i>tinctorius</i>, where 15 of 23 frogs died shortly upon BMP-NTf2 application. Those that tolerated the BMP-NTf2 application did not exhibit Bd clearance. Thus, BMP-NTf2 application, under the conditions tested here, is not a suitable option for clearing Bd infection in <i>D</i>. <i>tinctorius</i>. However, different results were obtained for <i>P</i>. <i>regilla</i>. Two topical applications of BMP-NTf2 on Bd-infected <i>P</i>. (using a \u00b1 SE; 9.42 \u00b1 1.43 L/g) reduced Bd growth, although the effect was lower than that obtained by daily doses of itracanozole (50% frogs exhibited complete clearance on day 16 vs. 100% for itracanozole). Our findings suggest that BMP-NTf2 has the potential to treat Bd infection, however the effect depends on several parameters. Further optimization of dose and schedule are needed before BMP-NTf2 can be considered as a safe and effective alternative to more conventional antifungal agents, such as itraconazole. | | DiRenzo, G.

While multistate mark-recapture models can produce highquality inference, these techniques are difficult to employ at large spatial and long temporal scales or in small remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens, where low recapture rates may preclude the use of mark-recapture techniques. Recently developed <i>N</i>mixture models offer a statistical framework for estimating wildlife disease dynamics from count data. <i>N</i>mixture models are a type of statespace model in which observation error is attributed to failing to detect some individuals when they are present (i.e., false negatives). The analysis approach uses repeated surveys of sites over a period of population closure to estimate detection probability. We review the challenges of modeling disease dynamics and describe how <i>N</i>mixture models can be used to estimate common metrics, including pathogen prevalence, transmission, and recovery rates while accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection. We also offer a perspective on future research directions at the intersection of quantitative and disease ecology, including the estimation of false positives in pathogen presence, spatially explicit diseasestructured <i>N</i>mixture models, and the integration of other data types with count data to inform disease dynamics. Managers rely on accurate and precise estimates of disease dynamics to develop strategies to mitigate pathogen impacts on host populations. At a time when pathogens pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, statistical methods that lead to robust inferences on host populations are critically needed for rapid, rather than incremental, assessments of the impacts of emerging infectious diseases. | | DiRenzo, G.

For example, we identify ecological and evolutionary selective forces that determine disease outcomes and transmission pathways by borrowing ideas from population and community ecology theory. We outline three topics of general interest in disease ecology: (i) the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk, (ii) individual, species, or environmental transmission heterogeneity, and (iii) pathogen coinfections. Finally, we identify specific knowledge gaps impeding the success of conservation-related decisions for disease mitigation and the future of amphibian conservation success. | | Devine, M.T., J.

Life Cycle Monitoring of Coho Salmon in Prairie Creek 2017-2020. Final Report to Fisheries Restoration Grant Program Project Number P1610520. April 2021. | Redwood Creek in norther Humboldt County, California, drains an extremely important watershed acting as a stronghold for many plant and animal species living in its pristine old-growth redwood forest. Vital to the ecology of the forest are several keystone salmonid species including Coho Salmon, Chinook Salmon, steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout. This report summarizes the cumulative work we accomplished across three years of monitoring juvenile and adult populations of Coho Salmon in Prairie Creek. The primary purpose of this project was to provide estimates of the four critical Coho Salmon population parameters needed to maintain the status of Prairie Creek as a Life Cycle Monitoring station including (1) adult salmonid redd abundance, (2) outmigrant smolt abundance, (3) freshwater survival and (4) marine survival. Each year, we PIT tagged juveniles throughout Prairie Creek in October, we conducted spawning ground surveys in Prairie Creek from November through March, we trapped and tagged smolts on their way to the ocean from March through July, and we operated several PIT tag antenna arrays year-round. Additionally, data collected in our monitoring projects enabled us to describe other life cycle attributes including early emigration analysis and overwinter growth estimation. During the three monitoring seasons, total redd estimates for Coho Salmon ranged from very low (127 in 2019-20) to high (429 in 2017-18) and outmigrant smolt abundance ranged from average (17,036 in 2018) to extremely high (34,807 in 2020). Apparent overwinter survival estimates were mostly consistent with previous years between 0.30-0.35, though a record high of 0.44 was estimated in 2019-20. We estimated smolt-to-adult return rates for the Coho Salmon smolt cohorts that emigrated in 2018 (1.06%) and 2019 (1.16%) which were consistent and fell within the expected range. Our three seasons of work from 2017-2020 extended the monitoring period in Prairie Creek to more than a decade. | | Deemer, Voichick, and M.D. Yard. 2022.

Dams change the physical template of rivers, often driving food webs toward greater reliance on aquatic primary production. Nonetheless, the effects of regulated flow regimes on primary production are poorly understood. Load following is a common dam flow management strategy that involves sub-daily changes in water releases proportional to fluctuations in electrical power demand. This flow regime causes an artificial tide, wetting and drying channel margins and altering river depth and water clarity, all processes that are likely to affect primary production. In collaboration with dam operators, we designed an experimental flow regime whose goal was to mitigate negative effects of load following on ecosystem processes. The experimental flow contrasted steady-low flows on weekends with load following flows on weekdays. Here, we quantify the effect of this experimental flow on springtime gross primary production (GPP) 90-to-425 km downstream of Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, AZ, USA. GPP during steady-low flows was 41% higher than during load following flows, mostly owing to non-linear reductions in sediment-driven turbidity. The experimental flow increased weekly GPP even after controlling for variation in weekly mean discharge, demonstrating a negative effect of load following on GPP. We estimate that this environmental flow increased springtime carbon fixation by 0.27 g C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, which is ecologically meaningful considering median C fixation in 356 U.S. rivers of 0.44 g C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and the fact that native fish populations in this river are food-limited. | | Deeley, S.M., N.J.

Despite the importance and documented loss of SAV globally, we lack consistent baseline data on SAV resources across the estuarine gradient, particularly in northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) estuaries. To understand SAV distribution in the NGOM, SAV biomass and species identity were collected at 384 sites inter-annually (Jun-Sept; 2013-2015) from Mobile Bay, Alabama to San Antonio Bay, Texas, USA. Coast-wide, SAV distribution and biomass were consistent across years, covering an estimated 87 000 ha, and supporting approximately 15.5 \u00b1 8.3% total cover with an average biomass of 24.5 \u00b1 1.9 g m<sup>-2</sup>. Differences in hydrology (i.e., precipitation, freshwater input, water depth) and exposure (i.e., wave and wind energy) manifested in unique SAV assemblages and biomass distributions across the regional (i.e., Coastal Mississippi-Alabama, Mississippi River Coastal Wetlands, Chenier Plain, Texas Mid-Coast) and estuarine gradient (i.e., marsh zones defined as fresh, intermediate, brackish, saline). Mediod SAV species were associated with combined salinity, turbidity, and depth conditions unique to different region and marsh zone combinations in the NGOM. While the presence of SAV is often used as an indicator of ecological health, identifying mediod species in aquatic habitats can also be applied to describe estuarine conditions in more detail, and develop aquatic habitat zones. Exploration and use of this type of field data could be developed as means to track, manage, and define aquatic habitats across regional and estuarine gradients. Identifying aquatic zones through a representative mediod associates SAV species with locations defined by both long-term salinity and as well as salinity variability, water depth, and exposure and is a powerful potential tool for managers and restoration decision-makers. | | DeGregorio, Wolff, and Rice. 2021.

In this study, we used game cameras to evaluate how human development and activity was related to the daily activity patterns of the nine-banded armadillo (<i>Dasyrus novemcinctus)</i> along an urban to rural gradient in Arkansas, USA during the winter of 2020-2021. We found that armadillos had substantial behavioral plasticity in regard to the timing of their activity patterns; >95% of armadillo activity was nocturnal at six of the study sites whereas between 30 and 60% of activity occurred during the day at 3 other sites. Distance to downtown Fayetteville (the nearest population center) and estimated ambient sound level (both indices of human activity) best explained the likelihood of diurnal armadillo activity with armadillos being most active during the day at quiet sites far from Fayetteville. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this activity shift may be in response to not only human activity but the presence of domestic dogs. Our results provide further evidence that human activity has subtle nonlethal impacts on even common, widespread wildlife species. Because armadillos have low body temperatures and basal metabolism, being active during cold winter nights likely has measurable fitness costs. Nature reserves near human population centers may not serve as safe harbors for wildlife as we intend, and managers should benefit from considering these nonlethal responses in how they manage recreation and visitation in these natural areas. | | DeFilippo LB, Buehrens TW, Scheuerell M, Kendall NW, Schindler DE. 2021.

Fisheries Research 106014 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.106014 October 2021 || Fishery managers often rely on forecasts of future population abundance to set allowable harvest quotas or exploitation rates. While there has been substantial research devoted to identifying environmental factors that can predict recruitment for individual populations, such correlations often degrade over time, thereby limiting their utility for management. Conversely, examining multiple populations at once to detect shared, spatially structured patterns can offer insights into their recruitment dynamics that are advantageous for forecasting. Here, we develop a population dynamics model for coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>) stocks in Washington State that leverages spatial and temporal autocorrelation in marine survival to improve one-year-ahead forecasts of adult returns. Executed in a Bayesian hierarchical integrated modelling framework, our spatiotemporal approach incorporates multiple data types and shares information among stocks to estimate key biological parameters that are informative for forecasting. Retrospective evaluation of one-year-ahead forecast skill indicated that the spatiotemporal integrated population model outperformed existing forecasts of Washington state coho salmon returns by ~25-38% on average. Our results add to a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of spatiotemporal and integrated approaches for modelling population dynamics, and the framework developed here has broad applications to the assessment and management of coho salmon in Washington State and throughout their range. | | DeBow, J., J.

In Vermont, the population declined 45% from 2010 to 2017 despite minimal hunter harvest and adequate habitat. Similarly, nearby populations recently experienced epizootics characterized by >50% mortality. Declines have largely been associated with the effects of winter ticks (<i>Dermacentor albipictus</i>), but uncertainty exists about the effects of environmental and other parasite-related conditions on moose survival. We examined patterns of moose survival among a radio-collared population (<i>n</i> = 127) in Vermont from 2017 to 2019. Our objectives were to estimate causes of mortality and model survival probability as a function of individual and landscape variables for calves (<1 yr) and adults (1 yr). Observed adult survival was 90% in 2017, 84% in 2018, and 86% in 2019, and winter calf survival was 60% in 2017, 50% in 2018, and 37% in 2019. Winter tick infestation was the primary cause of mortality (91% of calves, 25% of adults), and 32% of all mortalities had evidence of meningeal worm (<i>Parelaphostrongylus tenuis</i>). Other sources of mortality such as vehicles, harvest, predation, deep snow, and other parasitic infections were negligible. The best supported calf model included sex differences and negative effects of tick engorgement (%/week) and parasite level (roundworm and lungworm). The best supported adult model included the effect of cumulative tick engorgement (cumulative %/week), which negatively affected survival. Our results indicate that winter tick engorgement strongly affects survival, and is probably compounded by the presence of meningeal worm and other parasites. Reduced tick effects may be achieved by decreasing moose density through harvest and managing late winter habitat to minimize tick density. Management of white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) density may also affect the transmission of meningeal worm. | | DeBow, J., J. Blouin, E. Rosenblatt, K. Gieder, J. Murdoch, and T. Donovan. 2023. Birth Rates and Calf Survival in a Parasite Rich Moose Herd in Vermont, USA. Alces 58: 51-73. | || Moose (<i>Alces alces</i>) populations have recently declined across the southern portion of their geographic range in North America. In Vermont and other northeastern U.S. states, declines have been attributed to low survival rates driven primarily by winter tick (<i>Dermacentor albipictus</i>), which may also affect birth rate and survival of new calves. We radio-collared and monitored 75 female moose (38 calves and 37 adults) in Vermont from 2017 to 2020 and examined the effects of physiological conditions and spatial and temporal factors on adult birth rates. Physiological measures included fecal glucocorticoid metabolites concentrations (fGCM), which reflect stress, and urine urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio (UN:C), which proxies nutritional state. The pregnancy rate at capture across years was 0.67 (95% CI = 0.50 - 0.80), and negatively influenced by the presence of lungworm (<i>Dictyocaulus </i>spp.). Birth rates, calculated as the average number of offspring delivered per adult female, were < 1.0 overall, did not differ among years (2017-2020, LCI = 0.22, UCI = 0.86), but differed by adult age class, where rates increased with age. We further evaluated daily calf survival rates to age 60 days, the point at which calves become independent of direct care. Logistic exposure models indicated that daily calf survival increased as Julian birth date and days since birth increased (log odds = 0.0819, SE = 0.0215). The per capita independence rate (the rate at which adult females add independent calves to the population) was negatively influenced by average UN:C ratios and positively influenced by fGCM levels. Further, this rate was related to the habitat conditions in home ranges of adult females during the fall, when ticks attach to moose. Specifically, female adults whose fall home ranges were characterized by high levels of mature (canopy) evergreen forests and wetland habitats, and low levels of mixed forests and elevation, had a higher, average binomial success rate in adding an independent calf into the population than those whose home ranges consisted of high levels of mixed forest at high elevation. Our results suggest that winter ticks negatively affect fecundity, and that efforts to reduce parasite loads on individual moose (e.g., directly by reducing moose density or indirectly through habitat alteration) may improve productivity and recruitment. | | De Marco, KD, Couvillion, B, Brown S., La Peyre, MK. 2018.

Wildlife Research. doi: 10.1071/WR22094. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/227799042048/None/all) | November 2022 || Camera trapping is an effective tool for cost-efficient monitoring of rare and elusive species over large temporal and spatial scales and is becoming an increasingly popular method for investigating wildlife communities and trophic interactions. Camera trapping research targeting rare and elusive species can be hampered by low detection rates. Consequently, researchers often employ attractants in an effort to increase detection without accounting for how attractants may differentially influence detection of species across trophic levels. We evaluated the influences of a commonly used non-species-specific olfactory lure (i.e., sardines) and sampling design on detection of four species (i.e., bobcat [<i>Lynx rufus</i>], floridanus</i>]) that represented a range of foraging guilds in an agricultural landscape in southcentral South Dakota. We evaluated the influence of the lure at three temporal scales of detection (i.e., daily probability of detection, independent sequences per detection, and triggers per sequence). The influence of the lure on detection varied among trophic levels and across temporal scales. The lure tended to positively influence detection of coyotes and negatively influenced detection of bobcats. The lure also tended to positively influence detection of raccoon, an intermediate omnivore, and negatively influenced detection of eastern cottontail, an herbivorous prey. | | Daly, K.O., D.E.

Low-dose stimulation of growth of the harmful alga, Prymnesium parvum, by glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides. Harmful 130-139 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/166325960704/None/all) | November 2018 || Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are widely used around the globe. While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus\u00ae (Roundup acid equivalent (ae) l-1]. Roundup formulations differ in the ingredient (Roundup SC, ~50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10-1000 g glyphosate ae l-1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 g glyphosate l-1, but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 g l-1 influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments. | | DaRugna, O. A., M. A.

Biological Conservation, 261:109242. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/195414063104/None/all) | September 2021 || Overharvest has led to marine ecosystem degradation and declining fishery catches in many tropical communities. To allow stocks to recover and provide increased flows of food and income, reductions in fishing effort may be required. The development of Alternative Income Generating Activities can help to reduce the economic reliance of coastal communities on fishing, potentially reducing pressure on fish stocks. Here we assess the local conditions which have enabled the creation of Alternative Income Generating Activities to fishing based on marine ecotourism in Moalboal, Philippines. Importantly, while marine ecotourism typically centers around charismatic megafauna, a combination of nearshore fringing reefs, the establishment of nearshore marine protected areas and the occurrence of a massive herring aggregation provide a large tourism draw to this community. Using a combination of regional and local economic statistics and stakeholder surveys, we implement an economic valuation of the Moalboal marine ecotourism for 2018 and compare this valuation to an independent estimate of the extractive value of the herring aggregation. The Moalboal case indicates that a combination of strong community engagement in the governance of the ecotourism resource, a network of locally managed marine protected areas and the retention and distribution of economic benefits within the local community have led to a significant marine ecotourism sector. We contextualize these conditions into a set of potential enabling conditions for marine ecotourism as an Alternative Income Generating Activity to fishing to contribute insights to diversifying livelihood opportunities beyond extractive fishing for coastal communities in the tropics. | | Cummings JW, SJ Converse, DR Smith, S Morey, and MC Runge. 2018.

The longleaf pine <i>Pinus palustris</i> ecological system supports many priority at-risk species designated for review, including five species of tortoise <i>Gopherus <i>Notophthalmus perstriatus</i>. To inform status decisions and conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models to 1) identify habitat features that best predict species presence and 2) estimate the amount and distribution of suitable habitat across each species' range under current conditions. We incorporated expert judgment from Federal, State, and other partners to capture variation in ecological settings across species' ranges, prioritize predictor variables to test in models, mitigate data limitations by informing the selection of pseudo-absence points, qualitatively evaluate model estimates, and improve the likelihood that experts will trust and use model predictions for conservation. Habitat suitability for all species was strongly influenced by soil characteristics, land cover, and fire interval. Suitable habitat was distributed on known species strongholds, as well as private lands without known species records. Between 4.7% (gopher frog) and 14.6% (gopher tortoise) of the area in a species' range was classified as suitable habitat, and between 28.1% (southern hognose snake) and 47.5% (gopher frog) of suitable habitat was located in patches larger than 1 km2 (100 ha) on publicly-owned lands. By overlaying predictions for each species, we identified areas of suitable habitat for multiple species on protected and unprotected lands. These results have direct applications to management and conservation planning: partners can tailor site-level management based on attributes associated with high habitat suitability for species of concern; allocate survey effort in areas with suitable habitat but no known species records; and identify priority areas for management, land acquisitions, or other strategies based on the distribution of species records, suitable habitat, and land protection status. These results can aid regional partners in implementing effective conservation strategies and inform listing decisions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. | | Crawford, B. A., J. C. Maerz, V. C.

Scientific teams bring together individuals of varying backgrounds and expertise to work collaboratively on creating new knowledge to address these challenges. Within a scientific team, there is inherent diversity in disciplinary cultures and preferences for interpersonal collaboration. Such diversity contributes to the potential strength of the created knowledge but can also impede progress when teams struggle to collaborate productively. Facilitation is a professional practice-based form of interpersonal expertise that supports group members to do their best thinking. Although facilitation has been demonstrated to support group functioning in a wide range of contexts, its role in supporting scientific teams has been largely overlooked. This essay defines scientific facilitation as a form of interactional expertise and explains how facilitating scientific teams requires skills in managing interpersonal interactions as well as understanding how different types of disciplinary knowledge integrate in the creation of new knowledge. Next, it explains how this science facilitation expertise may be developed through metacognition. Finally, it provides examples of how scientific facilitation could be more widely incorporated into research by describing three pathways to expand the use of facilitation theory and techniques in collaborative scientific research: developing facilitation skills among scientists leading teams, using broadly trained facilitators, and using specialised science facilitators. The strengths and risks of each path are discussed, and criteria are suggested for selecting the right approach for a given team science project. | | Crane, D., M.R. from muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) fin rays and associated effects on estimates of growth.

Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 559:151840. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/237539182592/None/all) | January 2023 || Increasing prevalence of hypoxia in shallow waters of US Gulf of Mexico (GoM) estuaries can pose a serious threat to eastern oysters (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>). Their tolerance to hypoxia, however, is not well characterized, especially at elevated temperature (>30\u00b0C) typical of GoM estuaries in summer. Moreover, it is unknown whether differences in hypoxia tolerance exist between GoM oyster populations growing in estuaries differing in local environmental conditions. Wild oyster broodstocks were collected from four estuarine sites in Texas (Packery Channel, PC and Aransas Bay, AB) and Louisiana (Calcasieu Lake, CL and Vermilion Bay, VB) and their adult progenies (F1) were tested (Study 1) under continuous hypoxia (< 2.0 mg O<sub>2</sub> L<sup>-1</sup>) at 32<sup>\u00b0</sup>C. Significant differences in hypoxia tolerance were found between F1 populations with calculated median lethal time (LT<sub>50</sub>) ranging from 3.9 to 12.5 days. PC and CL oysters were the most and least tolerant populations, respectively. The study was repeated twice more (Studies 2 and 3) using PC and CL oysters, and their responses at the organismic, cellular, and biochemical levels were investigated. Valve movement was monitored, and oysters were sampled to measure hemocyte density, plasma protein, calcium and glutathione concentrations, and digestive gland alanine and succinate concentrations after either 3-5 days (Study 2) or 1-3 days (Study 3) of hypoxia exposure. From the onset of hypoxia until their death, oysters stayed opened 13-32% of the time compared to 53-64% under normoxia, but no differences between populations were detected under hypoxia. PC oyster but not CL oyster plasma glutathione concentrations increased significantly in both studies. Under longer (3-5 days) hypoxia exposure, plasma calcium and glutathione concentrations of PC oysters were significantly higher than CL oysters. These results suggest PC oysters were better able to protect tissues against acidosis and oxidative damage during hypoxia and high temperature stress than CL oysters. Overall, our results suggest that oyster populations originating from the GoM respond differently to hypoxia and high temperature stress and possess differential tolerance. | | Cox, T. L., M. J.

Online early. doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3353. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/219382773760/None/all) | [Publisher Website](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3353) | April 2021 || With the accelerating pace of global change, it is imperative that we obtain rapid inventories of the status and distribution of wildlife for ecological inferences and conservation planning. To address this challenge, we launched the SNAPSHOT USA project, a collaborative survey of terrestrial wildlife populations using camera traps across the United States. For our first annual survey, we compiled data across all 50 states during a 14week period (17 August 24 November of 2019). We sampled wildlife at 1509 camera trap sites from 110 camera trap arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across four development zones. This effort resulted in 166,036 unique detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. All images were processed through the Smithsonian's eMammal camera trap data repository and included an expert review phase to ensure taxonomic accuracy of data, resulting in each picture being reviewed at least twice. The results represent a timely and standardized camera trap survey of the USA. All of the 2019 survey data are made available herein. We are currently repeating surveys in fall 2020, opening up the opportunity to other institutions and cooperators to expand coverage of all the urbanwild gradients and ecophysiographic regions of the country. Future data will be available as the database is updated at eMammal.si.edu/snapshotusa, as well as future data paper submissions. These data will be useful for local and macroecological research including the examination of community assembly, effects of environmental and anthropogenic landscape variables, effects of fragmentation and extinction debt dynamics, as well as speciesspecific population dynamics and conservation action plans.

The goal of our study was to develop and test a monitoring strategy for nearshore marine ecosystems in remote areas that are not readily accessible for sampling. Mussel species have been used extensively to assess ecosystem vulnerability to multiple, interacting stressors. We sampled bay mussels (<i>Mytilus trossulus</i>) in 2015 and 2016 from six intertidal sites in Lake Clark and Katmai National Parks and Preserves, in south-central Alaska. Reference ranges for physiological assays and gene transcription were determined for use in future assessment efforts. Both techniques identified differences among sites, suggesting influences of both large-scale and local environmental factors and underscoring the value of this combined approach to ecosystem health monitoring. | | Corsi, M.

One method of enhancing fish habitat in these areas is to sow exposed shorelines with agricultural plants to provide structure once flooded. It remains unclear if some plants may be more suitable than others to provide effective fish habitat. To determine the fish habitat potential of various crops we performed a replicated tank experiment evaluating the selection of agricultural plants by prey and predator fishes with and without the presence of the other. We submerged diverse treatments of potted plants in outdoor mesocosms stocked with prey and/or predator fish and monitored selection of plant species, stem density, and stem height over 0.5-h trials. Prey fish selected the densest vegetation and selection was accentuated when a predator was present. Predators selected the second highest stem density and were more active when prey were present. Prey schooling was increased by predation risk suggesting that cover was insufficient to outweigh the advantages of increased group size. Our data indicates that the perception of cover quality is reciprocally context-dependent on predator-prey interactions for both predator and prey. Applications of the two most selected plant treatments in this study could enhance structural habitat for both predator and prey fishes in reservoirs, adding to their already reliable functionality as supplemental forage crops for terrestrial wildlife. | | Cope, W.R., T.J.

Using a genome Pacific walrus DNA. RADSeq was performed on genomic DNA from 192 walruses (63 males; 94 females; 35 unknown sex) whereas genome resequencing was performed on 41 individual walruses (21 males, 20 females). All read mappings were subjected to quality-based variant detection and screened for SNPs. These efforts generated a pool of 909 putative SNPs from which 217 unique TaqMan\u00ae assays were developed for validation. Ultimately, 116 validated, biallelic SNPs were combined to create a genetic tag for identifying individual walrus during the multi-year CMR project. Conversion to a OpenArray\u00ae enabled use of a high-throughput genotyping qPCR platform, which expedited accurate discrimination of individual walrus and reduced the probability of genotyping errors, thereby providing improved resolution for assessing the size and demographic rates of this population. | | Conway, C.

However, encounter probabilities are often higher for PIAs than for physical capture. If the difference is not accounted for, may be biased. Using simulations, we estimated the magnitude of bias resulting from mixed capture and detection probabilities, and evaluated potential solutions for removing the bias for closed capture models. Mixing physical capture and PIA detections (<i>p<sub>det</sub></i>) resulted in negative biases in . However, using an individual covariate to model differences removed bias and improved precision. From a case study of fish making spawning migrations across a stream-wide PIA (<i>p<sub>det</sub></i> 0.9), the coefficient of variation (CV) of () declined 39-82% when PIA data were included, and there was a dramatic reduction in time to detect a significant change in For a second case study, with only modest <i>p<sub>det</sub></i> (0.2) at randomly placed, smaller PIAs, CV( declined 4-18%. Our method is applicable for estimating abundance for any situation where data are collected with methods having different capture/detection probabilities. | | Connelly, J. W., and C. J.

Actions center on two possible adaptation strategies: a) translocations to suitable, unoccupied habitat, and b) identifying climate-resilient habitats to ensure the persistence of species. Knowledge required to implement these strategies includes understanding how microhabitat and microclimatic factors - the local environmental conditions around individual frogs influence their occupancy (distribution), abundance, and reproduction; these were estimated by focusing on four representative wightmanae</i>, <i>E. brittoni</i>, <i>E. antillensis,</i> all species but <i>E. antillensis</i> was positively and strongly influenced by moisture levels. As expected, <i>E. antillensis</i> exhibited an opposite relationship. Similarly, the reproductive activity of <i>E. coqui</i> was influenced by higher relative humidity and the presence of a chorus of other individuals. We found that our four focal species were not affected (e.g., abundance, reproduction) by the passing of hurricane Maria in September 2017, possibly because fallen debris creates conditions of increased food and shelter. Our findings help to assess habitat suitability, potential climate refuges, and inform timing for<i> </i>managed translocations. | | Coletti, H.A., L. Bowen, Wilson, S. Waters, Booz, K. Counihan, T.

Gene expression profiles in two razor clam populations: discerning drivers of population | [Publisher || With rapidly changing marine ecosystems, shifts in abundance and distribution are being documented for a variety of intertidal species. We examined two adjacent populations of Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula) in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. One population (east) supported a sport and personal use fishery, but this has been closed since 2015 due to declines in abundance, and the second population (west) continues to support commercial and sport fisheries. We used gene expression to investigate potential causes of the east side decline, comparing razor clam physiological responses between east and west Cook Inlet. The target gene profile used was developed for razor clam populations in Alaska based on physiological responses to environmental stressors. In this study, we identified no differences of gene expression between east and west populations, leading to two potential conclusions: (1) differences in factors capable of influencing physiology exist between the east and west and are sufficient to influence razor clam populations but are not detected by the genes in our panel, or (2) physiological processes do not account for the differences in abundance, and other factors such as predation or changes in habitat may be impacting the east Cook Inlet population | | Coates, T.A. and W.M.

We evaluated the utility of mechanical tree removal to restore potential basking habitat for a highly imperiled Timber Rattlesnake population in New Hampshire. We used a before-after, control-impact study to test for the effects of tree removal on environmental temperature and Timber Rattlesnake and other wildlife use of 3 potential basking sites. Mean temperatures were significantly higher and more variable post-treatment, while minimum temperatures were relatively unaffected. The number of temperature readings within the span of selected body temperatures of gravid female Timber Rattlesnakes (25.2-31.7 \u00b0C) increased post-treatment. Using time-lapse cameras, we detected rattlesnakes during 5 days at post-treatment sites but on only 1 day at a control site. Detections of potential rattlesnake prey species did not change following treatment, and few potential rattlesnake predators were detected pre- or post-treatment. Our results suggest that tree removal around potential basking sites likely improves thermal habitat quality for Timber Rattlesnakes. | | Clendenin, H.R., J. Adams, D.E. Ausband, J.A. Hayden, P.

Yet, for the federally endangered fishes Colorado Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius and Razorback Sucker Xyrauchen texanus, information about this sensitive life stage is limited. We determined species-specific age-length functions, spawning periodicity, and environmental factors related to growth and the onset of spawning by these species in the San Juan River of the Colorado River basin. Daily ages were determined from lapillar otoliths, and growth rates were calculated for subsamples of San Juan River larval Colorado Pikeminnows and Razorback Suckers collected from 2009 through 2017 and six candidate age-length functions were fit to evaluate the relationship between age and growth. Spawning periodicity estimates from the best-fit-model and published function were compared to those from observed otolith ages and differences were analyzed. The responses of spawning periodicity and growth to abiotic and temporal conditions were evaluated. For both species, spawning dates produced by otolith ages and best-fit functions were significantly different from those produced by the published functions, but not from each other. Age-length functions determined in this study enable more accurate back-calculation of ages and prediction of spawning periodicity than published functions. The spawning periodicity estimate of San Juan River Colorado Pikeminnow and Razorback Sucker were both impacted by multiple parameterizations of temperature and discharge. For both species, fish age had the biggest influence on growth. Accurate knowledge of spawning periodicity and factors affecting fish growth can improve timing of management activities to maximize benefit to Colorado Pikeminnows and Razorback Suckers in the San Juan River.<br> | | Clarfeld, L., A.

We performed an experiment using a ML model that produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in remote camera imagery (MegaDetector) to consider the impact of a ML model's performance on its ability to accelerate human labeling. Six participants tagged trail camera images collected from 12 sites in Vermont and Maine, USA (January-September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and two without assistance). We used a generalized linear mixed model to examine the influence of ML model performance and tagging method on tagging efficiency. We found that ML bounding boxes offer significant improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, we found that gains in efficiency are contingent on the ML algorithm's performance and that incorrect ML predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the production of bounding boxes when selecting a data labelling process due to the increased effort, ML bounding box-assisted tagging can offer an efficient method for labeling. More broadly, ML-assisted data labelling offers an opportunity to accelerate the analysis of trail camera imagery, but an assessment of the ML model's performance can illuminate whether the hybrid-tagging approach is ultimately a help or hinderance. | | Clare, J., S.T.

Relationship of trout growth to frequent electrofishing and diet collection in a headwater stream. North American Journal of Fisheries Management, Management Brief 42:109-114. DOI: || Research on fishes sometimes requires that individual fish be captured and subjected to invasive procedures multiple times over a relatively short time span. Electrofishing is one of the most common techniques used to capture fish and is known to cause injury to fish under certain circumstances. We evaluated the relationship of Columbia River Redband Trout <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri </i>growth rates to the number of times captured via electrofishing and gastrically-lavaged during the summer of 2018 in a mountainous, headwater stream. We captured fish between two and seven times over the course of 86 days using continuous (smooth) DC backpack electrofishing. We observed no relationship between Redband Trout growth rate and number of times captured or gastrically-lavaged. While these findings contrast with hatchery electrofishing experiments, they may represent the greater resiliency of wild fishes. However, it appears researchers can use electrofishing and gastric lavage in cold waters at least once-per-month, and potentially up to twice-per-month, without greatly affecting the growth of wild Redband Trout. | | Clancy, N.G., J. Brahney, J. Dunnigan, and P. of a diatom ecosystem engineer (Didymosphenia geminata) on stream food webs: implications for native fishes. || Stream habitat changes affecting primary consumers often indirectly impact secondary consumers such as fishes. Blooms of the benthic algae <i>Didymosphenia geminata</i> (Didymo) are known to affect stream macroinvertebrates, but the potential indirect trophic impacts on fish consumers are poorly understood. In streams of the Kootenai River basin, we quantified the diet, condition, and growth rate of trout, charr, and sculpin. In 2018, macroinvertebrate taxa composition was different between a stream with Didymo and a stream without, but trout diets, energy demand, and growth rates were similar. Trout abundance was higher in the stream with Didymo, but the amount of drifting invertebrates was higher in the stream without. In 2019, we surveyed 28 streams with a gradient of coverage. Didymo abundance was correlated only with the percent of aquatic invertebrates in trout diets and was not related to diets of charr or sculpin or condition of any species. Thus, we found no evidence for a trophic link between Didymo blooms and the condition or growth of trout, charr, or sculpin in mountainous headwater shovelnose sturgeon diet and condition: implications for shallow water habitat restoration.

Oyster-dominated eco-engineered reefs have been promoted as integral components of engineered habitats enhancing coastal resilience through provision of numerous ecological, morphological, and socio-economic services. However, the assessed 'success' of these eco-engineered oyster reefs remains variable across projects and locations, with their general efficacy in promoting coastal resilience, along with related services, often mixed at best. Understanding factors influencing the success of these eco-engineered habitats as valuable coastal management tools could greatly inform related future efforts. Here, we review past studies incorporating reef-building oysters for coastal resilience and enhanced ecosystem services. Our aims are to better understand their utility and limitations, along with critical knowledge gaps to better advance future applicability. Success depends largely on site selection, informed by physical, chemical and biological factors, and adjacent habitats and bottom types. Better understanding of oyster metapopulation dynamics, tolerance and adaptation to changing conditions, and interactions with adjacent habitats will help to better identify suitable locations, and design more effective eco-engineered reefs. These eco-engineered reefs however provide a useful tool to assist in developing coastal resilience in the face of climate change and sea level rise. | | Chipps, SR, DH Bennett, D Deslauriers and LG Rudstam. 2022.

We encourage fisheries professionals to join together to systematically evaluate every change in harvest regulations. Shared and thoughtful data collection designs and protocol standardizations, which include the recommendations made in this call-to-action, can transform every regulation application into an empirical evaluation that provides generality across locations and time periods with similar effort and cost. | | Cheruvelil, K.S., K.

In bar-built estuaries, sandbars form at the mouth of rivers during periods of low stream flow, closing access to the ocean and disrupting outmigration. We evaluated how summer residency in a leveed bar-built estuary affects the growth, survival, and recruitment of a Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) population. We performed a mark-recapture study on outmigrants to determine juvenile estuary abundance, growth, and survival. We used returning adult scales and otoliths to determine the relative abundance of summer estuary residence in spawning adults. Juveniles in the estuary grew less after mouth closure, and ultimately summer estuary residents had lower smolt-to-adult survival and contributed disproportionately less to the spawning population than fish rearing in the ocean. Mouth closure may lower food availability and deteriorate estuary conditions by reducing marine prey influx and estuary circulation. This research demonstrates the complexity of estuary dynamics and function as salmonid nurseries, particularly when considering the extensive modification of estuaries. | | Chaudoin, A. L., O. G.

However, species-environment relationships oftenvary geographically and models assuming geographically constant relation-ships may result in misleading inferences. We present the first range-wide hab-itat suitability model (HSM) for the federally threatened eastern indigo snake(Drymarchon couperi) as a case study illustrating an approach to account forknown latitudinal variation in habitat associations. Specifically, we modeledhabitat suitability using interactive relationships between minimum wintertemperature and several a priori environmental covariates and compared ourresults to those from models assuming geographically constant relationships. Wefound that multi-scale models including interactive effects with winter tempera-ture outperformed single-scale models and models not including interactiveeffects with winter temperature. Our top-ranked model had suitable range-widepredictive performance and identified numerous large (i.e.,1000 ha) potentialhabitat patches throughout the indigo snake range. Predictive performance wasgreatest in southern Georgia and northernFlorida likely reflecting more restric-tive indigo snake habitat associations inthese regions. This study illustrates howmodeling interactive effects between temperature and environmental covariatescan improve the performance of HSMs across geographically varying environ-mental gradients. | | Champine, V.

We conducted a survey of single-family households (<i>n</i> = 337) using an expanded Integrated Model of Behavioral Prediction to investigate the social-psychological drivers of individual and diffusion behavioral intentions for native plant gardening. We also examined how intentions related to actual behavior and potential moderators of the intention-behavior relationship. We found that while individual behavior-specific knowledge and attitude predict both individual and diffusion intentions, behavior-specific personal norms and self-efficacy predicted diffusion intention, and behavior-specific personal norm influenced individual intention. Contrary to theory, diffusion intentions were influenced by a combination of behavior-specific and non-specific predictors. These results suggest that to motivate diffusion intention, outreach interventions may need to enhance diffusion-specific personal norm and self-efficacy beliefs, rather than just individual behavioral perceptions. Intentions predicted indicators of actual diffusion behavior, as measured through native plant voucher use by individuals and their friends and family. However, these indicators of behavior were not predicted directly by social-psychological variables. Diffusion-specific self-efficacy and subjective knowledge appear to moderate the relationship between diffusion intentions and successful diffusion behavior. | | Chambers, S., M. L. Villarreal, O.

My primary goals were to determine whether generalities in species' responses to development have emerged, and summarize remaining gaps in knowledge. To do so, I evaluated the directionality of a wide variety of responses in relation to taxon, location, development type, development metric, habitat type, and spatiotemporal aspects.<br><b>Recent Findings:</b><br>Studies (N = 70) were restricted to the U.S. and Canada, and taxonomically biased towards birds and mammals. Longer studies, but not those incorporating multiple spatial scales, had a higher probability of detecting significant responses. Negative responses of all types were present in relatively low frequencies across all taxa, locations, development types, and development metrics, but were context-dependent. The same species often displayed distinct responses across studies or development metrics. <br><b>Summary:</b><br>The state of knowledge about wildlife responses to oil and natural gas development has developed considerably, though many biases and gaps remain. Studies outside of North America and that focus on herpetofauna are lacking. Tests of mechanistic hypotheses for effects, long-term studies, assessment of response thresholds, and experimental designs that isolate the effects of different stimuli associated with development, remain critical. Moreover, tests of the efficacy of habitat mitigation efforts have been rare. Finally, investigations of the demographic effects of development across the full annual cycle were absent for non-game species, and are critical for the estimation of population-level effects. | | Chad N.

Moreover, given that tagged fish remained upstream or downstream for periods extending months and years before returning to the fishway, and that observed patterns of passage were consistent with seasonal migratory cycles, and building on existing literature, we speculated that the fishway allows fish access to spawning habitats upstream and feeding habitats downstream. Our interpretation of the movement data provoked several comments from Pelicice, Pompeu, & Agostinho (2020) and they set various reasons by which, in their opinion, some of our conclusions may be mistaken. Their critique is threefold. First, they argue that the percentage of fish attracted into the fishway is too low to consider the fishway an effective link between the reservoir and the river downstream. We counter that without estimates of population size it is impossible to judge if 28% passage is limited; possibly absolute numbers may still be enough to maintain a viable population. Second, they assert that because receivers were located only in the fishway, it is unknown if fish that used the fishway remained near the dam, or if they continued on their migration. We counter with a brief literature review that documents <i>P. lineatus</i> migrating through reservoirs and spawning in tributaries. Third, they advocate for a broader conservation perspective and for additional research. We had already expressed in the article that fishways are only a temporary fix and that we support their use only as an element of a broader environmental management package. We agree with the need for more research but argue that procrastinating on conservation action may not be wise because we don't know if the research will be done, how long it will take, or what is the cost of waiting.

To evaluate the temporal and spatial distribution of selected contaminants of emerging concern, water samples were collected throughout 2018 and 2019 at 11 sites within the S. Platte River and surrounding tributaries with varying proximities to a major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Water samples were analyzed for pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroid hormones, and wastewater in- dicators and screened for in vitro biological activities. Multiplexed, in vitro assays that simultaneously screen for agonistic activity against 24 human nuclear receptors detected estrogen receptor (ER), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) bioactivities in water samples near the WWTP outflow. Targeted in vitro bioassays assessing ER, GR, and PPAR agonism corroborated bioactivities for ER (up to 55 \u00b1 9.7 ng/L 17-estradiol equivalents) and GR (up to 156 \u00b1 28 ng/L dexamethasone equivalents), while PPAR activity was not confirmed. To evaluate the potential in vivo significance of the bioactive contaminants, sexually-mature fathead minnows were caged at six locations upstream and downstream of the WWTP for 5 days after which targeted gene expression analyses were performed. Significant up-regulation of male hepatic vitellogenin was observed at sites with corresponding in vitro ER activity. No site-related differences in GR-related transcript abundance were detected in female adipose or male livers, suggesting observed environ- mental concentrations of GR-active contaminants do not induce a detectable in vivo response. In line with the lack of detectable targeted in vitro PPAR activity, there were no significant effects on PPAR-related gene expression. Although the chemicals responsible for GR and PPAR-mediated bioactivities are unknown, results from the present study provide i relative to short-term in situ fish exposures. | frog survival || Translocation is increasingly used to move animals of conservation concern away from sites where habitat will be destroyed(mitigation translocation), but outcomes have rarely been adequately monitored, particularly for amphibians. We used radio telemetry monitoring to assess survival and movement of 23 experimentally translocated, adult Gopher Frogs (<i>Lithobates capito</i>) at a recipient site in north-central Florida, USA. Although post-translocation monitoring was our primary goal, we also compared our results with those of 24 nontranslocated frogs that were monitored in three previous efforts, conducted at different locations and times. For both translocated and nontranslocated frogs, movement was the most important predictor of mortality, with translocated frogs having a significantly higher probability of movement and higher mortality during the first month following release. However, there was no effect of translocation on survival after controlling for probability of movement because movement was dangerous for both translocated and nontranslocated frogs. Movement by translocated frogs was likely a behavioral response to the translocation experience, whereas movement by nontranslocated frogs was associated with breeding pond visitation, which was not observed within the translocated group. Survival was high for both groups once they settled into underground refugia and movement declined. Despite the comparatively high mortality of translocated frogs immediately following release, more than half survived to the end of monitoring and remained in the vicinity of the release site, meeting an early benchmark of translocation success. | | Cassaigne, I, Thompson, RW, Medellin, RA, Culver M, Ochoa A, Vargas K, Childs JL, Galaz, M and Sanderson J. 2021.

Such strategies advocate for conservation by proxy, wherein one species is used to represent other taxa to obtain a conservation objective. The efficacy of such approaches has been rarely assessed empirically, but is predicated on concordance between the surrogate and sympatric taxa in distribution, abundance, and ecological requirements. Our objective was to identify whether the abundance of a high-profile umbrella species (Greater Sage-Grouse, <i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>, hereafter sage-grouse) was associated with the abundance of six other members of the avian community for which it is presumed to be a surrogate, including three sagebrush-obligate and three sagebrush-associated songbird species. We predicted that sage-grouse abundance would align most closely with the breeding abundance of other sagebrush-obligate birds. We used two different indices of sage-grouse abundance for comparisons: field-collected counts of fecal pellets (primarily indexing abundance in the nonbreeding season) and a spatially explicit index of breeding population size. Neither index of sage-grouse abundance was consistently predictive of co-occurring songbird abundance, with one species more abundant (Horned Lark and gramineus</i>]) where sage-grouse pellet counts were higher, and no relationship evident between songbird abundance and the spatially explicit sage-grouse population index. Ours is one of few assessments of the efficacy of sage-grouse as a surrogate species to consider abundance, and not habitat overlap alone. We suggest that the utility of sage-grouse as a surrogate species likely varies across spatial scales. Within the scale examined here (10-15 ha sites), however, indices of sage-grouse abundance were unreliable proxies for the abundance of six declining songbird species. | | Carlin, M., and A. D.

Biological Conservation. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/205803630592/None/all) | April 2021 || Spatial aspects of wildlife responses to human-induced habitat change have been examined frequently, yet the temporal dynamics of responses remain less understood. We tested alternative hypotheses for how the abundance of a suite of declining songbirds in relation to energy development changed over time. We conducted point counts at two natural gas fields during two periods spanning a decade (2008-2009 and 2018-2019), and compared the abundance of sagebrush songbirds across a gradient of surface disturbance between study periods (trend-by-time). We also assessed changes in the abundance of birds between study periods relative to additional development that had occurred (trend-over-time). We predicted that abundance responses to surface disturbance would be more negative during the second period, regardless of additional disturbance that had occurred, because of previously observed inverse relationships between surface disturbance and nest survival at our sites. Contrary to our predictions, abundance responses attenuated by the second time period for two of three species, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrasher (the latter at one energy field only). Sagebrush sparrow abundance, however, consistently decreased with surface disturbance within and between periods. Sage thrasher abundance consistently decreased with surface disturbance at one of the gas fields, and the probability of colonization by thrashers between study periods was lower where additional surface disturbance had occurred. Our results highlight the importance of revisiting wildlife responses to anthropogenic habitat changes over time, to clarify the severity and longevity of effects. | | Cantu de Leija, A., S.L.King, and T.S.

DOI# 10.1002/tafs.10177 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/151899033600/None/all) | July 2019 || range of federally endangered Humpback Chub Gila cypha has diminished largely due to habitat loss and invasive species. Optimal spawning habitat exists within the Little Colorado River (LCR), however the temperatures in the LCR are also ideal for proliferation of the invasive pathogenic Asian fish tapeworm Schyzocotyle acheilognathi. The current standard for positive identification of the parasite is necropsy and visual examination of the gut via microscopy, a methodology undesirable for assessing parasitic infection in endangered fishes. A swab taken at the anogenital pore of the fish and analysed using a novel DNA primer targeting the cestode cytochrome oxidase I subunit (COI) mtDNA gene region offers a convenient non-lethal sampling methodology. To validate the non-lethal methodology, primer sensitivity (43%) and specificity (78%) were initially calculated by utilizing captive fish exposed to the parasite and comparing the results with the lethal standard (i.e., visual examination) methodology. Subsequently, we utilized this novel non-lethal methodology to address prevalence of infection and relative infection frequency within most size classes in a wild population of Humpback Chub, as well as address possible spatial patterns and mechanisms of infection. Wild Humpback Chub were screened for infections spring and fall 2015 at two locations in the Little Colorado River. Infection prevalence across study reaches for spring and fall was 19.5% (N = 159) and 6.2% (N = 292), respectively. Relative infection frequency increased in fish measuring 75 - 250 mm, and decreased in fish measuring 250 - 400+ mm. Based on these observations, juveniles and sub-adult Humpback Chub (<200 mm) may be ideal targets for anthelminthic treatment. Elevated levels of infection near the major spawning grounds of Humpback Chub promote parasitic infection, which will continue to persist without treatment or actions to control infections. Anogenital swabs, in conjunction with PCR and primer-specific identification, offers a time efficient non-lethal method to detect parasite infections in endangered fishes. | | Campbell, J.W., S.M.Grodsky, M.

Ecology and evolution 8:10192-10205. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/159408934912/None/all) | September 2018 || Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to model the spatial structure of species in the marine environment, however, most fail to account for detectability of the target species. This can result in underestimates of occupancy, where nondetection is conflated with absence. The site occupancy model (SOM) overcomes this failure by treating occupancy as a latent variable of the model and incorporates a detection submodel to account for variability in detection rates. These have rarely been applied in the context of marine fish and never for the multiseason dynamic occupancy model (DOM). In this study, a DOM is developed for a designated species of concern, cusk (Brosme brosme), over a fourseason period. Making novel a highresolution 3dimensional hydrodynamic model, detectability of cusk is considered as a function of current speed and algae cover. Algal cover on the seabed is measured from video surveys to divide the study area into two distinct regions: those with canopy forming species of algae and those without (henceforth bottom types). Modeled estimates of the proportion of sites occupied in each season are 0.88, 0.45, 0.74, and 0.83. These are significantly greater than the proportion of occupied sites measured from underwater video observations which are 0.57, 0.28, 0.43, and 0.57. Individual fish are detected more frequently with increasing current speed in areas lacking canopy and less frequently with increasing current speed in areas with canopy. The results indicate that, where possible, SDM studies for all marine species should take account of detectability to avoid underestimating the proportion of sites occupied at a given study area. Sampling closed areas or areas of conservation often requires the use of nonphysical, low impact sampling methods like camera surveys. These methods inherently result in detection probabilities less than one, an issue compounded by timevarying features of the environment that are rarely accounted for marine studies. This work highlights the use of modeled hydrodynamics as a tool to correct some of this imbalance. | | Callan, L. M., F. A. La Sorte, T. E. Martin, and V. G. Rohwer. 2019.

American Naturalist 193: 717-724. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/146086889472/None/all) | May 2019 || Life-history theory predicts that rapid growth comes at a cost to trait quality or adult longevity. However, this predicted trade-off has been weak or absent in passerine birds that vary in their growth rates. Trade-offs associated with fast growth and short development time might be better expressed in ephemeral traits because costs associated with these traits can be recovered or eliminated when they are replaced. We examined whether shorter development time yielded lower quality nestling body feathers, an ephemeral trait. We found a strong trade-off whereby nestlings that spend more time in the nest growing slowly produced higher quality plumage across 123 temperate and tropical species. This trade-off appears largely driven by nest predation because high predation rates favor rapid nestling growth and short development times at the cost of plumage quality. Our results suggest that ephemeral traits, like nestling body feathers, which can be replaced later, have the potential to minimize other longer-term trade-offs that arise during the rapid development of multiple traits. | | Calhoun, Kendall L., et al. \"Spatial overlap of wildfire and biodiversity in California highlights gap in nonconifer fire research and management.\" Diversity and Distributions 28.3 (2022): 529-541. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/243689265152/None/all) | March 2022 || Aim <br>Global change has spurred the escalation of megafires in California over the last 20 years throughout a variety of ecosystems.

As such, invasive species management actions face three questions regarding the ultimate success of the action: (1) will the removal efforts be successful (i.e., will the invasive species remain absent), (2) will the native species respond positively to non-native species removal, and (3) how long after restoration activities can the native species be expected to reach a recovered state without further intervention. Here, we present the results of a multi-year, non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta) removal and native Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah) recovery in a small tributary in the Intermountain West, USA. We monitored trout populations for nine years prior to the onset of eradication efforts, which included two years of mechanical removal followed by two years of chemical treatment. Cutthroat trout populations were then seeded with low numbers of both eggs and juvenile trout. We monitored population demographics and estimated population growth rates and carrying capacities for both populations from long-term depletion estimate data, assuming logistic growth. Prior to eradication, brown trout populations fluctuated around their carrying capacity. Following brown trout eradication and initial seeding efforts, cutthroat trout populations have demonstrated exponential growth. Within five years, cutthroat trout have approached their estimated carrying capacity. Population projections suggest that cutthroat trout are between 70 and 80% of their carrying capacity and are likely to be at 90% of their carrying capacity within 10 years. Additionally, at least four age-classes are present including adults large enough to satisfy angling demand. These results demonstrate native trout species have substantial capacity to rapidly recover following the removal of invasive species in otherwise minimally altered habitats. While these locations are likely limited in extent individually, collectively they may serve as source populations for larger connected systems. In such cases, these source populations may provide additional conservation potential through biotic resistance. | | Budy, P., P.D. Thompson, M.D. McKell, G.P. Thiede, T. Walsworth, and M.M.

The overall goal of this study was to identify the contemporary importance of mainstem connectivity and tributaries to maintaining life history expression, population structure, and viability of a large metapopulation of Bonneville Cutthroat Trout (BCT; <i>Oncorhynchus clarkii utah</i>) persisting in the Weber River, a highly fragmented Utah river. We used a multifaceted approach including active sampling, mark-recapture, passive PIT-tag detection, otolith microchemistry, and genetics. We collected BCT in all tributaries and the mainstem, encountering age-0 fish in three tributaries, indicating successful reproduction. In tributaries, the size structure was bimodal and consisted of smaller fish deemed to be resident and larger fish deemed to be fluvial, whereas all sizes and ages ( age-1) were present in the mainstem. We identified up to eight age classes; tributaries were dominated by ages 2 and 8, and the mainstem was dominated by ages 2, 5, 6, and 7. Tributary BCT had lower growth rates than BCT in the mainstem. We observed a surprising degree of fluvial life history expression, and fish also demonstrated very complex movement patterns across their life span. Average apparent survival (33%) was within the range estimated in similar studies for BCT, and resight rate was best explained by angler management regulations. The fact that BCT in the Weber River and tributaries still reproduce successfully in most years and are still able to grow into large, fluvial fish, suggests connectivity must be occasionally available despite considerable fragmentation. Therefore, this metapopulation may need little further human intervention if barriers to fish passage could be removed and thus connectivity could be improved and represents a high priority metapopulation for conservation, thus also highlighting the utility of our approach. | | Budy, P., K.B.

In Canada, some of these fishes are depressed, while others are secure and support commercial and subsistence harvest. In the USA, for example, of the lineages of Oncorhynchus that we described, two are already extinct, five are listed as Threatened under the ESA, three are protected under Conservation Agreements or are considered 'Species of Concern', and those that remain have all undergone or are currently undergoing status assessments due to declines in abundance and distribution (Table 1). In contrast, of the four Salvelinus species we reviewed, only one is listed as Threatened under ESA, one is declining across its native range, and the other two have no range-wide legal conservation status and are considered stable. Arctic Char are even considered a sustainable food fish and are \"of least concern\" on the IUCN list.<br>Most species or sub-species face similar threats, although the most important limiting factors varied. Habitat degradation, genetic introgression, and the negative effects of non-native fishes (often by other trout) are the most influential threats to persistence. However, because all trout are obligate cold-water species, climate warming is also a ubiquitous threat. In addition, due to their extreme popularity as a game fish and recreational and economic value, trout and char enjoy broader management support than most species of fish and wildlife, particularly among those that are imperiled. As a consequence, there is a long history of trout and char management in North America. That history has changed over time from management focused on improving recreational angling opportunities to management that also emphasizes conservation and restoration of native populations. Common management strategies include hatchery propagation, harvest restrictions, habitat restoration (riparian, in-stream), improving passage and connectivity, and minimizing the impacts of non-natives (via removal, sterilization). Despite their imperiled status and persistent threats, the outlook is promising for many species, sub-species, and populations, largely because the most important limiting factors have been identified and because they are, in sum, a wildly celebrated group of fishes. | | Budy, P., G.P.

Submitted to the Transactions of the America Fisheries Society. DOI: 10.1002/tafs.10291 | <i>Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi</i> have experienced some of the most marked reductions in abundance and distribution of Cutthroat Trout. In Pyramid Lake, Nevada, USA the population of LCT has returned from the brink of extirpation, and although highly managed via stocking, is thriving, and has recently started to reproduce naturally. Our objectives were to determine: 1) if predator and prey remain tightly coupled, 2) whether LCT are food limited, and 3) the status of the LCT population with regard to the potential prey-based contemporary carrying capacity. We used a multi-faceted approach including intensive field fish sampling, bioenergetic modeling, cohort reconstruction, and comparisons of prey availability to consumption. We estimated the average population of LCT in Pyramid Lake is 1.2 million, average annual stocking is 650,000, and fish angled ranges from 5,000 - 14,000/yr (90% release rate). Driven by seasonal and size variation in consumption, individual annual consumption of LCT varied from 667 - 992 g/yr for small LCT (200 - 400 mm) and 2,388 - 3,057 g/yr for large LCT (> 400 mm). LCT are consuming on average, 14 - 63% of the standing crop of Tui Chub <i>Gila bicolor</i> annually, indicating that LCT are currently not exceeding their prey-based carrying capacity. LCT in Pyramid Lake remain tightly coupled to their primary native prey, Tui Chub, despite considerable changes to the ecosystem. This means managing for a robust population of LCT translates largely to managing for forage fish. This supply versus demand issue is a particular concern in Pyramid Lake given there is indication the density of Tui Chub is declining concordant with declining lake elevation. Given the conservation importance of this population of LCT, careful monitoring is critical; however \"predation inertia\" indicates effective short-term management in response to fluctuations in forage fishes is likely possible. | | Buderman, F.

Successful spread was associated with tolerance to increased temperature and an equilibrium lifehistory strategy. The spread of introduced fishes was negatively related to gamefish status. No effect of propagule pressure was detected.Traits linked to invasion success were consistent with the hypothesis that human landuse practices increase the invasibility of highland catchments by creating novel conditions better suited to lowland and equilibrium invaders.We found biological traits to be more useful than ecological traits in predicting invasion success and suggesting invasion mechanisms. Parental care and nest association can facilitate invasions over large spatial extents for both native and introduced fishes. Analyses of suites of traits can reveal mechanisms of invasions and tactics for controlling them; such mechanisms and tactics may be systemspecific and scaledependent. | | Buchholtz, E.K., Stronza, A., Songhurst, A., McCulloch, G. and Fitzgerald, L.A., 2020.

Connectivity analyses can incorporate species-specific landscape resistance, and therefore have the potential to be used to understand where wildlife moves and causes conflict with people. We used circuit theory to develop connectivity models for the African savanna elephant in northwestern Botswana based on step-selection functions of movement data for 15 elephants and tested whether areas of high connectivity were correlated with occurrences of crop raiding. We used government records and field assessments of crop-raiding incidents between 2010 and 2016 to quantify conflict, which we predicted would correlate with landscape connectivity. The step-selection model revealed that linear boundaries such as rivers, fences, and dune crests were barriers to movement that impacted connectivity, while high vegetation index values and distance from villages were strong positive predictors of movement. Connectivity values were positively and significantly correlated with frequency of conflict incidents (<i>p</i> < 1.5e06) over a six-year time span. However, connectivity had no predictive value for whether fields were raided (<i>p</i> < .54) or how frequently a field was raided (<i>p</i> < .77) during a single growing season. This study shows that connectivity may be a useful metric for predicting patterns of conflict occurrence over broad temporal scales, but may have limited predictive power at shorter time scales. It is crucial that conservation and conflict mitigation efforts recognize that methods may be appropriate for different purposes at different scales. | | Buchholtz, E.K., Spragg, S., Songhurst, A., Stronza, A., McCulloch, G.

Yet wildlife continues to persist in human-modified environments. While shifting patterns of wildlife landscape use in response to development is well established, less is known about how risk avoidance by animals impacts their resource access. Our research addresses this question by assessing spatial and temporal patterns in access to water resources for savannah elephants (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) relative to anthropogenic features in the Okavango Panhandle of Botswana. We combined GPS collar data from 39 elephants (2014-2018) with spatial data on permanent water sources and human development to quantify patterns of water access. We modelled a multi-scale resource selection function that showed elephants selected water access points in areas with less human development (<i>p</i> < 0.0151). Elephants visited water more evenly across day and night in areas with no buildings nearby, but shifted to a significantly more nocturnal pattern in areas of higher building density (ANOVA, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Analysing spatial and temporal patterns of elephant resource access in the context of anthropogenic features provides compelling insight into the potential consequences of human-modified landscapes on the behaviour, fitness, and persistence of threatened species and our coexistence with them. | | Buchholtz, E.K., Redmore, L., Fitzgerald, L.A., Stronza, A., Songhurst, A. and McCulloch, G., 2019.

This problem is particularly salient in areas where populations of humans and wildlife are increasing and share limited space and resources. However, few studies look at how both people and wildlife navigate shared spaces. To better examine people and wildlife within the same environment, we used methods from social science and spatial ecology to investigate how humans and elephants in Botswana utilize trees, a shared natural resource. Trees provide an opportunity to study shared resource use because they are important for people as firewood and for elephants as food and habitat. We compared tree species gathered on 49 firewood collections with the species damaged by elephants in 83 vegetation plots. We found that many tree species were damaged by elephants in ways that would generate firewood. There was also a strong overlap in the tree species that people collected and the species that elephants browsed and/or damaged. We compared spatially-explicit firewood collection locations and movement data from elephant GPS collars to model resource selection by people and elephants. Proximity to settlements was a strong driving factor for people in firewood collection, while various factors including vegetation characteristics played a role in predicting elephant movement. We found that areas where people collect firewood were negatively correlated with daytime elephant movement and positively correlated with nighttime elephant movement. We further compared the times that people collected firewood with the times when elephants were near the villages and found that people collected firewood during daylight hours when elephants were not nearby, providing further evidence of temporal partitioning. People and elephants utilized the same species of trees, and also had correlated spatial patterns of resource selection. Therefore, elephant foraging of trees provides a previously unrecognized utility to people in the form of firewood creation, and temporal partitioning allows this to occur without direct human-elephant interaction. | | Buchholtz, E.K., M.

From individual incidents and perceptions, to contemporary patterns and long-term trends, a range of information about human-wildlife conflict can help understand and manage challenges. However, many studies focus on a single data type or spatiotemporal scale. In the Western Okavango Panhandle in Botswana, people in rural farming communities share and compete for resources with a growing African savanna elephant population. Few previous studies have focused on human-wildlife interactions in this region. We assessed spatiotemporal trends in human-elephant conflict using reported conflict incidents (2008-2016), surveys of individual perceptions of conflict encompassing the late 1990s-2016, and detailed field raid assessments from 2016. We found complementary patterns among the data types at different geographic and spatial scales. We found that the number of annual HEC incidents have increased over time, although not evenly across space, with increases primarily in the northern region of the Panhandle. Crop raiding presents both chronic and acute challenges for farmers, with the amount of damage incurred per incident largely dependent on the size of elephant group involved rather than factors within the farmers' control such as guarding or types of crops grown. Our results provide a characterization of contemporary conflict incidents and long-term trends, despite scarce historical data. Combining the reporting and assessment data with surveyed local ecological knowledge offered a multidimensional understanding of human-wildlife conflict for a region where this information was lacking. It is an important precursor to effective and collaborative conflict management and mitigation. When possible, this mixed-methods approach may facilitate understanding for complex human-wildlife interactions and support the diverse communities and stakeholders involved with conflict-related challenges. | | Buchholtz, E.K., J.

Models of fire connectivity can aid in understanding and managing wildfires by analyzing potential fire spread and conductance patterns. We define 'fire connectivity' as the landscape's capacity to facilitate fire transmission from one point on the landscape to another. Our objective was to develop an approach for modeling fire connectivity patterns representing potential fire spread and relative flow across a broad landscape extent, particularly in the management-relevant context of fuel breaks. We applied an omnidirectional circuit theory algorithm to model fire connectivity in the Great Basin of the western United States. We used predicted rates of fire spread to approximate conductance and calculated current densities to identify connections among areas with high spread rates. We compared existing and planned fuel breaks with fire connectivity patterns. Fire connectivity and relative flow outputs were characterized by spatial heterogeneity in the landscape's capacity to transmit fire. We found that existing fuel break networks were denser in areas with relatively diffuse and impeded flow patterns, rather than in locations with channelized flow. This approach could be paired with traditional fire behavior and risk analyses to better understand wildfire spread as well as direct strategic placement of individual fuel breaks within larger networks to constrain fire spread. Thus, our findings may offer local- to landscape-level support for management actions that aim to disrupt fire spread and mitigate the costs of fire on the landscape. | | Buchholtz, E.K., J.

This information can be key for managing invasive grasses that threaten native ecosystems. While methods for quantifying invasive grass presence and abundance advance, few options have been explored in characterizing and comparing spatial patterns of extent and connectivity. We calculated landscape metrics and circuit-based centrality for invasive grasses using a weighted-average product (30m resolution) in the Great Basin, USA. We found variation among extent metrics (mean class and patch area, number of patches, largest patch index) and connectivity metrics (nearest neighbor, contiguity, aggregation index, centrality); most of the extent and connectivity metrics were not strongly correlated with dominant abundance class and so provided additional information at the sampled grid and local scales. We also illustrated how thresholding relevant metrics could be used to identify areas needing different management strategies, for example, where strategies could proactively protect uninvaded cores, disconnect fine fuel patches, or contain established invasions. The landscape metric approach can be applied across scales to spatially target patches locally, provide broader context within a single region, as well as to compare metrics and spatial variation in patterns among different regions. | | Buchholtz, E., Fitzgerald, L., Songhurst, A., McCulloch, G. and Stronza, A., 2020.

Although methods involving LEK have become more widespread in ecology, it remains an undervalued source of information in understanding the ecology of wildlife in the context of human-wildlife conflict. People who regularly interact with wildlife, and often with notable consequences, as is the case with human-wildlife conflict, will likely build up ecological knowledge of that species. We gathered LEK on the landscape use of the African elephant (<i>Loxodonta Africana</i>) in a region where its range overlaps with human land use and results in conflict, the western Okavango Panhandle of Botswana. We interviewed community-defined local experts and used participatory ranking activities to gather information on landscape use of elephants. The scores from the rankings were then incorporated with environmental data following resource selection function methods common in ecology. The resulting LEK-based model had high predictive ability for elephant locations when modeled at a local scale (25 km, Spearman's rho = 0.98, <i>P</i> < 0.0001). We also calculated resource selection models using elephant telemetry data combined with the same environmental data as the LEK models. These models showed a complementary pattern, with better predictive ability at the regional scale (Spearman's rho = 0.98, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) than at the local scale (rho = 0.92, <i>P</i> < 0.0031). In addition to being used for the resource selection functions, each method provided different kinds of information on elephant landscape use. Our results support the use of LEK as a tool for understanding local patterns of wildlife landscape use in the context of human-wildlife conflict, where the knowledge can be used to complement other data across scales and the use of which can itself contribute to better conservation outcomes. | | Buchholtz, E., Fitzgerald, L., Songhurst, A., McCulloch, G. and Stronza, A., 2019.

As a result, sagebrush cover and configuration have varied over space and time, influencing processes and species that rely on contiguous, connected sagebrush. Previous studies have documented changes in sagebrush cover, but we know little about how the connectivity of sagebrush has changed over time and across the sagebrush biome. We investigated temporal connectivity patterns for sagebrush using a time series (1985-2020) of fractional sagebrush cover and used an omnidirectional circuit algorithm to assess the density of connections among areas with abundant sagebrush. By comparing connectivity patterns over time, we found that most of the biome experienced moderate change; the amount and type of change varied spatially, indicating that areas differ in the trend direction and magnitude of change. Two different types of designated areas of conservation and management interest had relatively high proportions of stable, high-connectivity patterns over time and stable connectivity trends on average. These results provide ecological information on sagebrush connectivity persistence across spatial and temporal scales that can support targeted actions to address changing structural connectivity and to maintain functioning, connected ecosystems. | | Buchanan B, Sethi SA, Cuppett S, Lung M, Jackman G, Zarri L, Duvall E, Dietrich J, Sullivan P, Dominitz A, Archibald J, Flecker A, Rahm B.

However, efforts to restore connectivity are constrained by the availability of accurate dam inventories which often overlook smaller unmapped riverine dams. Here we develop and test a machine learning approach to identify unmapped dams using a combination of publicly available topographic and geospatial habitat data. Specifically, we trained a random forest classification algorithm to identify unmapped dams using digitally engineered predictor variables and known dam sites for validation. We applied our algorithm to two subbasins in the Hudson River watershed, USA, and quantified connectivity impacts, as well as evaluated a range of predictor sets to examine tradeoffs between classification accuracy and model parameterization effort. The random forest classifier achieved high accuracy in predicting dam sites (true positive rate = 89%, false positive rate = 1.2%) using a subset of variables related to stream slope and presence of upstream lentic habitats. Unmapped dams were prevalent throughout the two test watersheds. In fact, existing dam inventories underestimated the true number of dams by ~80-94%. Accounting for previously unmapped dams resulted in a 62-90% decrease in dendritic connectivity indices for migratory fishes. Unmapped dams may be pervasive and can dramatically bias stream connectivity information. However, we find that machine learning approaches can provide an accurate and scalable means of identifying unmapped dams that can guide efforts to develop accurate dam inventories, thereby informing and empowering efforts to better manage them. | | Buchalski, M.R., C.W.

We also identify a suite of candidate genes potentially under selection, driving patterns of diversity across 356 globally extant <i>B. anthracis </i>genomes. We report ten antimicrobial resistance genes and eleven different prophage sequences, resulting in the first large-scale documentation of these genetic anomalies for this pathogen. Results of random forest classification suggest genomic structure may be driven by a combination of antimicrobial resistance, geography and isolation source, specific to the population cluster examined. We found strong evidence that a recombination event linked to a gene involved in protein synthesis may be responsible for phenotypic differences between comparatively disparate populations. We also offer a list of genes for further examination of <i>B. anthracis </i>evolution, based on high-impact single nucleotide polymorphisms and clustered mutations. The information presented here sheds new light on the factors driving genomic structure in this bacterium and may act as a road map for future studies aimed at understanding functional differences in terms of <i>B. anthracis</i> biogeography, virulence, and evolution. | | Brownscombe, J.

Journal of Great Lakes Research 48:359-370. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/215528484864/None/all) | April 2022 || Coregonine fishes are important to Laurentian Great Lakes food webs and fisheries and are central to basin-wide conservation initiatives. In Lake Ontario, binational management objectives include conserving and restoring spawning stocks of cisco (<i>Coregonus artedi</i>) and lake whitefish (<i>C. clupeaformis</i>), but the spatial extent of contemporary coregonine spawning habitat and the environmental factors regulating early life success are not well characterized. In Spring 2018, we conducted a binational ichthyoplankton assessment to describe the spatial extent of coregonine spawning habitat across Lake Ontario. We then quantified the relative importance of a suite of biophysical variables hypothesized to influence coregonine early life success using generalized additive mixed models and multimodel inference. Between April 10 - May 14, we conducted 1,092 ichthyoplankton tows and captured 2,350+ coregonine larvae across 17 sampling areas, predominantly within embayments. Although 95% of catches were in the eastern basin, coregonine larvae were also found in historical south shore spawning areas. Most coregonine larvae were cisco; less than 6% were lake whitefish. Observed catches of both species across sampling areas were strongly and similarly associated with ice cover duration, but the importance of site-specific characteristics varied, such as distance to shore and site depth for cisco and lake whitefish, respectively. These results suggest that regional-scale climatic drivers and local environmental habitat characteristics interact to regulate early life stage success. Furthermore, strong regional and cross-species variation in larval distributions emphasize the importance of lake-wide assessments for monitoring both the current eastern basin populations and potential expansions into western Lake Ontario habitats. | | Brost, B.M., M.B.

Evaluations of nonnative species introductions have continually demonstrated adverse effects associated with abundance and distribution of native fishes. As such, garnering an understanding of resource selection and interactions between native and nonnative species is important for recovery efforts involving native fishes. We evaluated habitat use by two native (Largescale Sucker <i>Catostomus fish species of the Kootenai River, Idaho, in a laboratory stream system. Trials were conducted in allopatry and in sympatry with and without the presence of wood to describe and evaluate competitive interactions in the context of on-going habitat rehabilitation efforts. Competitive interactions were evident between native Largescale Sucker and nonnative Pumpkinseed concerning use of a woody structure and current velocity. Mountain Whitefish used low-velocity habitats and selected locations that were further from wood when in sympatry with Pumpkinseed. Logistic regression models containing all habitat variables provided the most support to explain the effect of interspecific competition for all species, indicating that competition is a complex process composed of multiple interactions that occur simultaneously. | | Branigan, P.

However, there are numerous modern-day issues that reduce the viability and efficacy of hunting-based management, such as fewer hunters, overabundant wildlife populations, and emerging infectious diseases in wildlife. Quantifying the drivers of recreational harvest by hunters is necessary to identify potential solutions for these issues, but this is seldom accomplished because data collection practices limit analytical applications. Additionally, managing large-scale issues, such as infectious diseases, requires collaborations across management agencies, which is challenging or impossible if data are not standardized. Here we discuss modern issues with the prevailing wildlife management framework from an analytical point of view with a case study of white-tailed deer in the Midwest. We have four aims: (1) describe the interrelated processes that comprise hunting and suggest improvements to current data collections systems, (2) summarize data collection systems employed by state wildlife management agencies in the Midwestern United States and discuss potential for large-scale data standardization, (3) assess how aims 1 and 2 influence managing infectious diseases in wildlife, and (4) suggest actionable steps to help guide data collection standards and management practices. To achieve these goals, we designed and disseminated a questionnaire to state wildlife agencies, and we report and compare their harvest management structures, data collection practices, and responses to chronic wasting disease. We hope our \"call to action\" encourages re-evaluation, coordination and improvement of harvest and management data collection practices with the goal of improving the analytical potential of these data. A deeper understanding of the strengths and deficiencies of our current management systems is critical for developing comprehensive and collaborative management and research initiatives (e.g., adaptive management) for wildlife and their diseases into the future. | | Boyd, D.

Yet, freshwater researchers often focus only on adult fishes, resulting in a limited understanding of the habitat requirements for the early life stages of freshwater fishes. The goal of this study was to quantify the larval fish microhabitat use of three fish families in Twelvemile Creek, a fifth-order tributary of Lake Hartwell (Savannah River basin) in the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. We used handheld dipnets to sample larval fishes along 20 equidistant transects spaced 10 m apart weekly from May to July 2021 along a 200 m stream reach. We also collected microhabitat data at each larval fish capture location. Most captured individuals were in the metalarval stage and were identified to the family level. A partial distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that water velocity contributed to changes in larval fish assemblage structure. Larval fishes occupied a subset of the available habitat that was characterized by low water velocity, non-<i>Podostemum</i> substrate, and shallow habitats close to the shore or bed rock structure. We also detected temporal patterns in larval fish counts, with peak Percidae and Leuciscidae counts in late July and the highest Catostomidae counts in late May-early June. Our results suggest that larval fishes select habitats with low water velocity and shallow habitats close to shore microhabitat characteristics, and that riffle-pool sequences may serve as a nursery habitat for Percidae, Catostomidae and Leuciscidae metalarvae. | | Bowen, L., Ballachey, H.

For the first time, we employed these tools to evaluate the Pacific razor clam (<i>Siliqua patula</i>), which is important both economically and ecologically, as a bioindicator species in the northeast Pacific. Our objectives were to (1) develop biomarker and gene transcription assays with which to monitor the health of the Pacific razor clam, (2) acquire baseline biomarker and gene transcription reference ranges for razor clams, (3) assess the relationship between physiological and gene transcription assays and (4) determine if site-level differences were present. Pacific razor clams were collected in July 2015 and 2016 at three sites within each of two national parks in southcentral Alaska. In addition to determining reference ranges, we found differences in biomarker assay and gene transcription results between parks and sites which indicate variation in both large-scale and local environmental conditions. Our intent is to employ these methods to evaluate Pacific razor clams as a bioindicator of nearshore ecosystem health. Links between the results of the biomarker and gene transcription assays were observed that support the applicability of both assays in ecosystem monitoring. However, we recognize the need for controlled studies to examine the range of responses in physiology and gene transcripts to different stressors. | | Bowden, J.H., A. J. Terando, V. Misra, A.

Competing objectives often constrain options for ecological restoration of large rivers whereas fewer competing objectives may exist in a subset of tributaries. Further, tributaries contribute toward building a \"portfolio\" of river ecosystem assets through physical and biological processes that may present opportunities to enhance the resilience of large river fishes. Our goal is to review roles of tributaries in enhancing mainstem large river fish populations. We present case histories from two greatly altered and distinct large-river tributary systems that highlight how tributaries contribute four portfolio assets to support large-river fish populations: 1) habitat diversity, 2) connectivity, 3) ecological asynchrony, and 4) density-dependent processes. Finally, we identify future research directions to advance our understanding of tributary roles and inform conservation actions. In the Missouri River USA, we focus on conservation efforts for the state endangered lake sturgeon, which inhabits large rivers and tributaries in the Midwest and Eastern USA. In the Colorado River, Grand Canyon USA, we focus on conservation efforts for recovery of the federally threatened humpback chub. In the Missouri River, habitat diversity focused on physical habitats such as substrate for reproduction, and deep-water habitats for refuge, whereas augmenting habitat diversity for Colorado River fishes focused on managing populations in tributaries with minimally impaired thermal and flow regimes. Connectivity enhancements in the Missouri River focused on increasing habitat accessibility that may require removal of physical structures like low-head dams; whereas in the Colorado River, the lack of connectivity may benefit native fishes as the disconnection provides refuge from nonnative fish predation. Hydrologic variability among tributaries was present in both systems, likely underscoring ecological asynchrony. These case studies also described density dependent processes that could influence success of restoration actions. Although actions to restore populations varied by river system, these examples show that these four portfolio assets can help guide restoration activities across a diverse range of mainstem rivers and their tributaries. Using these assets as a guide, we suggest these can be transferable to other large river-tributary systems. | | Bourquin, R., Moore, M. J., Orth, D. J., & Hallerman, E. M. (2023). Conservation Genetics of Clinch Dace Chrosomus sp. cf. saylori. Fishes, || Clinch Dace (Chrosomus sp. cf. saylori) is a newly recognized and yet-undescribed species of minnow with a restricted and fragmented distribution in the upper Tennessee River basin in southwestern Virginia, USA. We collected Clinch Dace from seven streams and observed variations at nine selectively neutral microsatellite DNA loci to infer population genetic processes and identify units for conservation management. Bayesian cluster analysis showed that three of the seven surveyed populations were genetically distinct, while the other four populations showed signs of recent admixture. Estimated effective population sizes and m-ratios were low within most populations, suggesting loss of alleles due to recent genetic drift. Positive F<sub>IS</sub> values, high average individual inbreeding coefficients, and high degrees of inferred relatedness among individuals suggested that inbreeding is taking place in some populations. F<sub>ST</sub> values were high, and analysis of molecular variance indicated genetic divergence among populations. These indicators suggest that Clinch Dace populations are subject to the genetic processes that are characteristic of small and isolated populations. | | Borg, B.L., Arthur, S.A., Falke, J.A., and L.R.Prugh.

Successful conservation of reptiles requires understanding both shelter site requirements and availability. The Eastern Indigo Snake (EIS; <i>Drymarchon couperi</i>) is endemic to the southeastern U.S. and is federally listed. Recovery has focused on maximizing unfragmented landscapes, with less attention on fine-scale features such as shelter sites. In the northern EIS range, Gopher Tortoise (<i>Gopherus polyphemus</i>) burrows are used extensively for shelter. EIS in peninsular Florida often shelter in tortoise burrows, they also use other shelters where tortoise burrows are scarce or absent. Solely focusing EIS survey and management efforts where Gopher Tortoises are present may overlook occupied habitats and misallocate resources. We investigated the importance of different shelter sites in central Florida using data from radio-tracked EIS. We modeled the use of shelter categories as a function of sex, season, and habitat using Bayesian multinomial Generalized Linear Models. Results showed that EIS in peninsular Florida used Gopher Tortoise burrows across all seasons and habitats. Tortoise burrow use was highest in xeric habitats and lowest in mesic habitats where burrows are most and least abundant, respectively. There was less variability in shelter site use in disturbed habitats and flatwoods. Tortoise burrow use by EIS in the cool season across sexes and habitats in our study was much lower than in southern Georgia. Our results indicate that EIS are less dependent on Gopher Tortoise burrows in peninsular Florida and that suitable habitats with few or no tortoise burrows could still provide conservation value for EIS. | H.I.A., J.C. abundance in northern Wisconsin lakes before fall electrofishing.

Although raptors are believed to satisfy their water requirements through metabolic processes, they are known to experience reduced reproductive success during periods of drought, and there is evidence of water being important for site occupancy in arid landscapes. Several raptor species have a seasonal or year-round presence in west Texas, a drought-prone, semi-arid region of the southern Great Plains. We used cameras at man-made water sources to examine species-specific timing of free water use by common raptors in this region, and to explore environmental conditions associated with water use over a 48-month period. We collected 4,549 camera trap-days of data across 4 years at man-made water sources placed for cattle. We recorded 1,182 detections of 14 species of raptors visiting these water sources. Of the 1,177 detections of raptors identified to species, 1,084 (92.1%) were of individuals perching at tanks, and 93 (7.1%) flying by tanks. Of the raptors that perched at tanks, 63.5% were drinking and 20.8% both bathed and drank. (<i>Tyto species detected. Barn Owls were detected year-round, Northern Harriers were detected from August to April, and Swainson's Hawks were detected from March to October. We found visits by Northern Harriers and Swainson's Hawks were best predicted by temperature and precipitation. Visits by Barn Owls were best predicted by drought severity. Further, we found that detections per 100 trap-days increased substantively across our 4-year study period during which the region experienced one of the worst droughts on record. Although our data does not demonstrate these raptors require free water, it does reveal an increasing use in relation to hotter and drier conditions. How this influences survival and reproduction remains unknown, but may become a pressing question, as current climate models predict the study area will experience increases in heat and decreases in precipitation. | | Boal, C.W., B.D.

Winter ticks tend to be fairly immobile throughout all life stages, and therefore their distribution patterns at any given time are shaped largely by the occurrence of moose across the landscape during the peak of two critical time periods; fall questing (when ticks latch onto a moose, which coincides with the rut) and spring drop-off (when engorged female ticks detach from moose and lay their eggs in leaf litter). We used recent land cover and lidar data within a dynamic occupancy modeling framework to estimate first-order habitat selection (use vs non-use) of female moose (n = 74) during the questing and drop-off periods. Patch (1 km<sup>2</sup>) extinction and colonization rates during spring drop-off periods were strongly influenced by habitat and elevation, but these effects were diminished during the questing period when moose were more active across the landscape. In the spring drop-off period, patches where colonization was high and extinction low (highest probability of female moose occupancy) had higher proportions of young (shrub/forage) mixed forest at greater elevations. We evaluated the fitness consequences of individual-based habitat selection (second-order habitat selection) by comparing Resource Selection Functions (RSF) for 5 females that successfully reared a calf with 5 females whose calf perished. Second-order habitat selection analyses showed adult female moose whose offspring perished selected patches during the questing period that matched the first-order selection during the spring drop-off period. In contrast, adult female moose whose offspring survived selected areas with proportions of young deciduous habitats, as well as higher proportions of mature (canopy) evergreen forests and wetlands at lower elevations, i.e., their second-order habitat selection patterns deviated from the overall patterns illuminated by the multi-season occupancy analysis. Our model coefficients and mapped results define \"hotspots\" that are likely encouraging the deleterious effects of the tick-moose cycle. Knowledge about the composition and structure of these hotspots may influence more direct (i.e. hunter harvest) and indirect (i.e. conservation, modification, or formation of habitats) management decisions. | | Blouin, J., J. DeBow, E. Rosenblatt, C. Alexander, K. Gieder, J. Murdoch, and T. Donovan. Modeling moose habitat use by age, sex, and season in Vermont, USA using high-resolution lidar and National Land Cover data. Alces 57:71-98. (<i>Alces alces</i>) populations have experienced unprecedented declines along the southern periphery of their range, including Vermont, USA. Habitat management may be used to improve the status of the population and health of individuals. To date, however, Vermont wildlife managers have been challenged to effectively use this important tool due to the lack of fine-scale information on moose space use and habitat characteristics. To assess habitat use, we combined more than 40,000 moose locations collected from radio-collared individuals (n = 74), recent land cover data, and high resolution, 3-dimensional lidar (light detection and ranging) data to develop Resource Utilization Functions (RUF) by age (mature and young adult), season (dormant and growth), and sex. Each RUF linked home range use to average habitat conditions within 400 m or 1 km of each 30 m2pixel within the home range. Across analyses, the top RUF models included both composition (as measured through the National Land Cover Database) and structure (as measured through lidar) variables, and significantly outperformed models that excluded lidar variables. These findings support the notion that lidar is an effective tool for improving the ability of models to estimate patterns of habitat use, especially for larger bodied mammals. Generally speaking, female moose actively used areas with proportionally more regenerating forest (i.e., forage < 3.0 m) and more mature forest (i.e., canopy structure > 6.0 m), while males actively used more high elevation, mixed forest types. Further, moose exhibited important seasonal differences in habitat use that likely reflect temporal changes in energetic and nutritional requirements and behavior across the year. Moose used areas with proportionally more regenerating forest (i.e., forage < 3.0 m) during the growth period and female moose had strong positive associations with lidar-derived canopy structure during the growth (but not the dormant) period. Ultimately, the resultant maps of habitat use provide a means of informing management activities (e.g., the restoration or alteration of habitats to benefit moose) and policies around land use that may contribute to population recovery. | | Blazer, V.S., H.L.

Forest Ecology and Management | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/164726335488/None/all) | April 2019 || Our current understanding of the relationship between imperiled species and forest management can benefit from global positioning system (GPS) technologies. Fauna of late-seral stage forests have historically been difficult to detect and track in rugged terrain, leading to challenges in movement characterization and conservation. We investigated movement of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) using automated GPS loggers affixed to 15 owls in the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We used > 17,000 locations from individual owls to characterize summer home-range size, movement distances, roosting habitat selection, and foraging habitat selection at four spatio-temporal scales (landscape, home range, foray, nightly). Additionally, we assessed owl use of Protected Activity Centers (PACs), which are designated by the US Forest Service to protect nesting and roosting habitat. Our results corroborated some previous findings about habitat requirements of California Spotted Owls, while also revealing nuances in space use and habitat selection. Roosting and foraging owls selected for stands with high canopy cover and large trees at multiple spatio-temporal scales, with foraging owls showing strongest selection at the largest (landscape) scale investigated. Although owls selected for PACs while foraging and roosting, PACs protected less than a quarter of foraging space use (volume of use) and fewer than half of observed roosts. Home ranges of female owls were double the size of male home ranges, and distances travelled from the nest by females were 1.3 times greater than distances travelled by males, with non-breeding females travelling farthest and visiting up to eight PACs during a season. Foraying behavior of this sort has not been documented previously in Spotted Owls. Our findings support protection of later seral stage forest attributes for both roosting and foraging California Spotted Owls. Given the selection for later seral forest attributes, strongest evidence of foraging habitat selection at the landscape scale, relatively limited habitat protection afforded by PACs and the long distances travelled by owls, habitat connectivity across the landscape is important for owl conservation, and current protected areas may not be sufficient for this wide-ranging species. | | Blakey, R.V., R.B.

Chelonian Conservation and Biology. 21 is a critically endangered freshwater turtle endemic to Central America. In the wild, these turtles are thought to be wholly herbivorous as adults and feed on a variety of vegetation; however, no studies have quantitatively assessed potential dietary differences based on biotic and abiotic factors. The purpose of our study was to describe and quantify the wild diet of <i>D. mawii</i> and assess differences based on habitat, maturity, and sex. We evaluated the stomach contents of 66 turtles legally harvested by local hunters for personal consumption throughout the country of Belize. Percent volume (by displacement) and percent frequency of each stomach item were used to calculate an index of relative importance (IRI). One algal and six plant families contributed to an overall diet composition consisting of leaves, flowers, stems, seedpods, seeds, and fruit. Rocks and invertebrates were also consumed, although we believe these to be incidental consumption. The leaves of the riparian tree <i>Inga edulis</i> were present in 73.1% of turtle stomachs and accounted for almost half of the total volume of all stomach contents combined. We used Spearman rank correlation coefficients to test the null hypothesis that there was no correlation in the rankings of stomach items (i.e. there were differences) when comparing turtles by habitat, age, and sex. There were significant differences in the ranking of food items between river and lagoon habitats, with lagoon turtles relying heavily upon the algae <i>Nitella </i>sp.; however, the stomach contents from both habitats were equally diverse (H<sub>rivers</sub> = 1.68, H<sub>lagoons</sub> = 1.64). There were no differences in IRIs between adults and juveniles or between males and females. Our results emphasize the importance of habitat in <i>D. mawii </i>diet selection and the importance of leaves from riparian plants species that are shed into their aquatic habitats. | | Bishop, N.

Journal of Zoo and Aquarium Research, 9(3), 150-156. https://doi.org/10.19227/jzar.v9i3.432 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/158590298112/None/all) | July 2021 || The Central American river turtle (<i>Dermatemys mawii</i>) is a critically endangered species that has incurred substantial losses over the last several decades due to overhunting. This species is now being considered for head-starting programs (i.e. captive breeding of turtles for wild release). However, relatively little is known about their life history characteristics, especially with respect to growth and sexual maturation. A robust knowledge of <i>D. mawii</i> life history traits is important in developing conservation management plans. Our research is the first known study to maintain hatchlings, juveniles, and adults in captivity with regular morphometric data collection. We quantified growth rates (cm yr-1) and calculated growth parameters (e.g. growth coefficients) to estimate body size and age at onset of sexual maturity in a group of wild-caught but captive-held and captive-bred <i>D. mawii</i> in Belize. Sizes at the onset of sexual maturity were inferred by segmented linear regressions that identified changes in growth rate by body size. Asymptotic sizes and growth coefficients were calculated using the Fabens method and the Wang method. Parameters from these models were then applied to a modified von Bertalanffy growth equation to estimate age at the onset of sexual matuarity. Male and female <i>D. mawii</i> begin sexual maturation at ca. 38.0 cm and 40.0 cm straight-line carapace length, respectively. We estimated ages associated with these sizes at 13.5-16.9 yrs (males) and 13.6-17.3 yrs (females). No previous literature on growth rates or age at maturation for wild or captive <i>D. mawii</i> has been reported, so our results serve as a starting point in conservation management. Given the life history trait of delayed sexual maturity (>10 years), <i>D. mawii</i> may be more sensitive to losses of the adult population. Therefore, the importance of captive breeding and head-starting programs is concomitant with protecting wild, adult populations. | | Bidder, O.R., di Virgilio, A., Hunter, J.S., McInturff, A., Gaynor, K.M., Smith, A.M., Dorcy, J. and Rosell, F., 2020.

Fish reservoir cascade. Freshwater Biology Website](https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14087) | April 2023 || The transformations caused by reservoir cascades can be severe at the reach scale, but basin-wide scale effects are less clear, although the River Continuum Concept provides a framework for predicting basin-scale effects. To determine if predictions made by the River Continuum Concept relative to the function of fish assemblages are sustained in a temperate river transformed into a reservoir cascade, we examined longitudinal trends in the distribution of traits over 23 reservoirs of the Tennessee River, USA. In all, 115 species were recorded representing 56 traits, with trait richness increasing longitudinally in a downstream direction. Trophic, reproductive, and habitat traits showed various increasing and decreasing patterns up and down the reservoir cascade. The observed gradients in trait richness and trait distributions were generally consistent with those expected in unregulated rivers, with few unexpected results. The transformation of lotic systems into lentic ones has changed habitats and sources of food and encouraged the proliferation of certain feeding (e.g., detritivores, planktivores, invertivores, piscivores), reproduction (e.g., nest phytolithophils), and habitat (slow current, lacustrine, large river) traits. In essence, reservoirs have expanded downstream habitats in an upstream direction, and thus allowed upstream expansion of species and traits that would have normally not been well represented in upper reaches of the Tennessee River basin. Nevertheless, the impounded Tennessee River has maintained much of its functional integrity, despite extensive alterations to the riverscape. We suggest that while reservoirs have been shown to have major local-scale effects on riverine fish assemblages, with access to riverine habitats, and with proactive conservation strategies, fish functional richness can remain remarkably high at the basin scale. | | Beringer, C.J., K.W.

Journal of Environmental Quality | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/203057168384/None/all) | November 2020 || Neonicotinoid pesticides can persist in soils for extended time periods; however, they also have a high potential to contaminate ground and surface waters. Studies have reported negative effects associated with neonicotinoids and non-target taxa, including aquatic invertebrates, pollinating insect species, and insectivorous birds. This study evaluated factors associated with clothianidin (1-[(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-yl) methyl]-3-methyl-2-nirtoguanidine, CTN) degradation and sorption in Missouri wetland soils to assess the potential for wetland soils to mitigate potential environmental risks associated with neonicotinoids. Solid-to-solution partition coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) for CTN sorption to eight were determined via single-point sorption experiments, and sorption isotherm experiments were conducted using the two most contrasting soils. Clothianidin degradation was determined under oxic and anoxic conditions over 60 d. Degradation data were fit to zero- and first-order kinetic decay models to determine CTN half-life (<i>t<sub>0.5</sub></i>). Sorption results indicated CTN sorption weak (average <i>K<sub>d </sub></i>= 3.58 L kg<sup>-1</sup>); thus, CTN has potential to be mobile and bioavailable within wetland soils. However, incubation results showed anoxic conditions significantly increased CTN degradation rates oxic average<i> t<sub>0.5</sub></i> = negative correlation was observed between anoxic half-life values and soil organic carbon content (r<sup>2</sup>=0.782; <i>p</i>=0.046). Greater CTN degradation rates in wetland soils under anoxic conditions suggests that managing wetlands to facilitate anoxic conditions could mitigate CTN presence in the environment and reduce exposure to non-target Ricketts. 2022.

Not all science-based conservation and sustainability initiatives that address issues facing humanity and ecosystems and global problems have gained public support. Conservation decisions and policy prescriptions are and may be based on perceptions about and experiences with the environment, local land use, and ecosystems that may not align with or be grounded in science or evidence from experts in the field. Social values, perceptions, and beliefs associated with nature play a critical role in how individuals view biodiversity conservation, sustainability, and natural resource management. This study first examines the gap between the public and scientists/experts about the state of water and land resources, wildlife and associated habitats, and aquatic biodiversity in the Smoky Hill River Watershed in western Kansas. Second, the study examines the role that values and beliefs play in shaping environmental perceptions for farmers and non-farmers. Analysis confirms that a gap between experts and farmers/non-farmers does exist, especially with respect to the state of the Ogallala Aquifer, playas on the High Plains, native fish populations and non-hunted wildlife species. Ordered-logistic regression analyses, meanwhile, indicate that farmer/non-farmer perceptions about the state of the local environment are influenced by traditional and self-interested values as well as environmental values, while less influence is found for beliefs such as religiosity and political ideology. Despite broad takeaways, results exhibited heterogeneity across the farmer and non-farmer subpopulations. If environmental professionals can't align ecological data, stakeholders values/perceptions, and policies, then the existing body of technical research and management on sustainability in natural and social sciences may be of little value.<b> </b> | | Bergh, S.M. and D.E.

The subsequent increases in stream temperature, flooding, and drought can alter the population dynamics of culturally and economically important aquatic species such as Pacific salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus</i> spp.). Modeling approaches designed to assess the vulnerability of salmon to climate change tend to focus on average environmental conditions and typically do not account for extreme events lasting days to weeks. To explore how these short-duration disturbances impact salmon populations, we developed a life cycle model that mechanistically links coho salmon (<i>O. kisutch</i>) abundance to daily streamflow and thermal regimes. Model design was motivated by two questions: 1) how does coho salmon abundance respond to short-duration floods, droughts, and elevated water temperatures in glacier-, snow-, and rain-fed streams? 2) How does the temporal resolution of streamflow and water temperature data influence modeled abundance? In our simulations, salmon populations in rain-fed streams were the most sensitive to winter floods that increased egg mortality and drought conditions that concentrated juvenile salmon in warm, isolated pools. Salmon populations in similarly sized snow- and glacier-fed streams were relatively resilient to all but the most extreme flood and drought scenarios. These findings suggest that salmon abundance in the thousands of rain-fed streams draining to coastal Alaska and British Columbia may become more variable year-to-year depending on the future frequency and severity of winter floods and summer droughts. Aggregating streamflow and temperature time series from daily into weekly and monthly averages dampened the influence of extreme events and predicted impacts on populations. Our model can be adapted to additional climate change scenario planning exercises for any salmonid-bearing stream with sufficient measurements of habitat characteristics, streamflow, and water temperature. | | Behney, A.C., R.

Throughout this book, we approach a set of unifying framing questions for disturbance ecology, including: How can disturbances be categorized in meaningful ways? How do we address scale in disturbance ecology? How does geographic context influence ecological consequences of disturbance, in the near and longer terms? In this introductory chapter, we provide an overview of disturbance ecology and the related topics of diversity and scale that are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of perturbed ecosystems. Subsequently, we outline recent advances in disturbance ecology, which have facilitated greater understanding about dynamic systems and context dependencies. These, in turn, have provided richer insights into the complex manner in which ecosystems change under stress. We survey analytical and methodological advances that are expanding the data flows available to inform disturbance ecology as well as the statistical tools available to investigate disturbance dynamics and ecosystem structure and function. Finally, we lay out four core themes threaded through the remainder of the book: 1) fundamental mechanisms related to ecological theory drive complex system behaviors, including the existence of thresholds; 2) dynamics of ecological disturbance are context-dependent and can be unpredictable, 3) antecedent conditions and the legacies of past disturbances influence contemporary ecosystem dynamics, and 4) natural and anthropogenic disturbances interact in complex ways. Summaries are provided for each of the book's remaining chapters, highlighting how that material relates to these four core themes. In sum, in this introductory chapter we seek to set a foundation for concepts to ground the remainder of the book. By highlighting constraints in past research and identifying research frontiers, we hope to provide a path towards moving the field of disturbance ecology forward, both throughout the book and beyond. | | Beatty WS, Lemons PR, Sethi SA, Everett J, Lewis CJ, Lynn RJ, Cook GM, Garlich-Miller JL, Wenburg JK.

Journal of Mammalogy 101:755-765. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/209411487744/None/all) | July 2020 || The kin structure of a species at relatively fine spatial scales impacts broad-scale patterns in genetic structure at the population level. However, kin structure rarely has been elucidated for migratory marine mammals. The Pacific walrus (<i>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</i>) exhibits migratory behavior linked to seasonal patterns in sea ice dynamics. Consequently, information on the spatial genetic structure of the subspecies, including kin structure, could aid wildlife managers in designing future studies to evaluate the impacts of sea ice loss on the subspecies. We sampled 8,303 individual walruses over a 5-year period and used 114 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to examine both broad-scale patterns in genetic structure and fine-scale patterns in relatedness. We did not detect any evidence of genetic structure at broad spatial scales, with low <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> values ( 0.001) across all pairs of putative aggregations. To evaluate kin structure at fine spatial scales, we defined a walrus group as a cluster of resting individuals that were less than one walrus body length apart. We found weak evidence of kin structure at fine spatial scales, with 3.72% of groups exhibiting mean relatedness values greater than expected by chance, and a significantly higher overall observed mean value of relatedness within groups than expected by chance. Thus, the high spatiotemporal variation in the distribution of resources in the Pacific Arctic environment likely has favored a gregarious social system in Pacific walruses, with unrelated animals forming temporary associations. | | Beatty W, Lemons P, Everett JP, Lewis CJ, Taylor RL, Lynn RJ, Sethi Wenburg JK Estimating Pacific walrus abundance and survival with multievent mark-recapture models.

Translocation is often used to mitigate human-wildlife conflict but translocated individuals may have reduced survival, which could negatively affect population growth and social acceptance of translocation as a management tool. Yet, non-translocated nuisance individuals may also have low survival due to inherent risks associated with nuisance behavior. We used a 38-year dataset of 1233 marked and translocated nuisance American black bears (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) as a model system with which to evaluate the impacts of translocation on nuisance bear survival. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to estimate annual harvest and non-harvest mortality rates and tested for effects of translocation distance and harvest rate on recapture and both mortality rates. Recapture probability increased with translocation distance but 75% of translocated bears were translocated 75 km and recapture probabilities were <0.05 across these distances. Survival was 0.43 for adult males, 0.56 for adult females, and 0.38-0.40 for yearlings. However, increasing translocation distance reduced both harvest and non-harvest mortality ( = 0.0044, 95% CI = 0.0020, 95% CI = 0.0051 to 0.0011, respectively) showing that increasing translocation distance does not negatively impact survival. Our survival estimates were generally lower than those reported for non-nuisance American black bear populations (0.67-0.83), which likely reflects risks associated with nuisance behavior, such as proximity to human dwellings, agriculture, or roads which in turn may increase harvest and/or road mortality. Our results show that translocation is a useful approach for mitigating human-bear conflict that does not always negatively affect survival. Lower survival of nuisance bears suggests that biologists should focus efforts on reducing the incidences of human-wildlife conflicts (e.g., removing anthropogenic food sources). | | Bauder, J.M., N.M.

Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence translocation success, yet the influence of release-site landscape context on the success of translocations of wildlife involved in nuisance behaviour is poorly understood. Moreover, few studies of translocated wildlife involved in nuisance behaviour have provided estimates of translocation success under different scenarios.<br><b>Aims: </b>We evaluated the role of intrinsic (age, sex) and extrinsic (translocation distance, landscape composition) features on translocation success of American black bears (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) involved in nuisance behaviour and provide spatially explicit predictions of success under different scenarios.<br><b>Methods: </b>We analysed data from 1462 translocations of 1293 bears in Wisconsin, USA, from 1979 to 2016 and evaluated two measures of translocation success: repeated nuisance behaviour and probability of returning to a previous capture location.<br><b>Key results: </b>Translocation distances ranged from 2 to 235 km (mean = 57 km). Repeated nuisance behaviour was recorded following 13.2% of translocation events (192 of 1457) and was not significantly affected by translocation distance. Bears repeated nuisance behaviour and were recaptured at their previous captures site (i.e. returned) after 64% of translocation events (114 of 178). Return probability decreased with an increasing translocation distance, and yearling bears were less likely to return than were adults. The proportions of agriculture and forest within 75 km and 100 km respectively, of the release site had positive and negative effects on return probability.<br><b>Conclusions: </b>Mangers can use bear characteristics and landscape context to improve translocation success. For example, achieving a 10% predicted probability of return would require translocation distances of 49-60 km for yearlings in low-agriculture and high-forest landscapes. In contrast, estimated return probability for adults was 38% across all translocation distances (0-124 km) and almost all landscape contexts.<br><b>Implications: </b>Our results emphasise the importance of considering the effects of landscape conditions for developing spatially explicit guidelines for maximising translocation success. | | Miller, and K.W.

State-space models (SSM) allow estimation of observation error while concordance in trends among multiple indices from different sampling methods may reflect true trends in abundance. We used multiple decades of data from roadkill surveys, nocturnal spotlight surveys, and observations from hunters along with trapper harvest data for six mesopredators in Illinois, USA, to evaluate concordance (i.e., similarity in trend direction and magnitude) across count- and harvest-based indices, while controlling for observation error using Bayesian SSM. We assumed that increased concordance among trends from different sampling methods would increasingly mirror trends in true abundance. We observed positive trends for raccoon and coyote, negative trends for gray and red fox, and stable trends for skunk, consistent with spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and abundance of these species within midwestern USA. Concordance among count-based indices and harvest-based indices adjusted for temporal changes in trapper numbers was generally high. In contrast, total annual trapper harvest often showed discordance with other trends. Sampling variability was similar across methods but was highest across the shortest time series highlighting the importance of methodologically or analytically controlling for sampling variability. Our results suggest that concordant broad-scale (e.g., statewide) trends in index data may be best used for evaluating relatively general trends and using relatively drastic changes as justification for more in-depth studies. | | Bauder, J.M., M.L. 2022. reveal equivocal evidence for intraguild suppression among sympatric canids. Biodiversity and Conservation | September 2022 || Interspecific interactions among predators can shape ecological communities across trophic levels, including among predator guilds. The strength and directions of these interactions, however, may vary spatially and temporally in regions undergoing widespread landscape changes (e.g., urbanization, agricultural production). We investigated intraguild effects of coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>), a de facto apex predator, and land-cover changes on abundance indices of red foxes (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) and gray foxes (<i>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</i>) using two long-term and independent time series: direct observations of canids by archery deer hunters (26 years) and harvest data from canid trappers (41 years) from across Illinois, USA. Abundance indices from both time series for red and gray foxes declined whereas coyote abundance indices increased, suggesting increasing coyote abundance may have led to decreases in fox population abundances. Empirical support among candidate models explaining fox declines was generally equivocal yet differed between fox species. Models including effects of coyote abundance were generally competitive for red foxes and estimated negative coyote effects even after controlling for declining farm size. The empirical support among our landscape hypotheses also varied by species despite increasing forest cover and farm size during our study. The estimated effects of coyote in our study were weaker than reported at more northerly latitudes suggesting that increasing coyote populations may not be fully responsible for observed declines in fox populations in the midwestern USA. | | Bauder, J.M., M.L.

Trapper harvest data represent valuable long-term data for evaluating patterns and trends for wildlife species at broad spatiotemporal scales. Inferring accurate trends from harvest data, however, first requires identifying and controlling for confounding factors that vary independent of abundance. We investigated trends in 43 years of trapper harvest data (1976-2018) from Illinois, USA, for red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>), gray fox (<i>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</i>), and coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) while controlling for factors that may affect trapper effort, including number of effective (i.e., successful) trappers, pelt price, gasoline price, winter unemployment, and winter weather conditions. Annual trapper harvest for red and gray foxes declined and was affected by gasoline price and winter unemployment, whereas annual trapper harvest for coyotes increased and was not strongly affected by other covariates. After adjusting for pelt price, harvest of red foxes was relatively stable, but harvest of gray foxes declined and harvest of coyotes increased. Effects of covariates on harvest per successful trapper varied by species; nevertheless, we detected an increasing trend for coyotes and decreasing trends for gray foxes and red foxes. Concordance across indices for gray foxes and coyotes was consistent with hypothesized declines for gray foxes and increases for coyotes in the midwestern United States. Trends for red foxes varied depending on how we accounted for potential confounding factors and it is unclear if these trends suggest population declines or distribution shifts to urban areas with reduced trapping susceptibility. Our results highlight the importance of understanding sources of variation in harvest data and that their effects can vary across species. | | Bauder, J.M., K.W. Stodola, T.J. Benson, C.A.

Many terrestrial mammals have undergone substantial distribution changes in recent decades; yet collecting broad-scale occurrence data for carnivores is difficult due to their low densities and cryptic behaviors. Carnivore observations from community (i.e., citizen) science programs can be a potentially valuable approach for understanding changes in carnivore distributions over long time periods.<br>Objectives. We used 18 years of bobcat (<i>Lynx rufus</i>) observations collected by archery deer hunters (participants) across Illinois, USA, to estimate spatiotemporal patterns in occurrence and determine how landscape features influenced patterns of recolonization.<br>Methods. We developed Bayesian spatial and non-spatial multi-scale dynamic occupancy models to estimate county-level occupancy, persistence, and colonization and participant-level occupancy. We modeled county-level parameters as a function of multiple <i>a priori</i> landscape covariates and compared model performance using cross-validation.<br>Results. Our non-spatial occupancy model had greater predictive support than our spatial occupancy model. Mean annual statewide county-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.43 to 0.83 while mean annual participant-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.07-0.28. Bobcats were primarily restricted to southern Illinois during the early 2000s but by 2018 occurred throughout western and southern Illinois. Landscape covariates had relatively weak effects on model parameters.<br>Conclusions. Our study illustrates how community science observations analyzed with hierarchical occupancy models can be used to model spatiotemporal changes in species distributions. Bobcats have recolonized much of Illinois, but this colonization was not strongly mediated by county-level landscape features at the scales we measured. | | Bauder, J.M., K.W. Stodola, T.J.

Many factors besides abundance can cause variation in trapper harvest, including socioeconomics, weather, and motivation. The relationships between these extrinsic factors and trapper harvest may change temporally, which may obscure the causal understanding of variation in trapper harvest. We tested for changes in the relationships between pelt price and trapper numbers, and pelt price and harvest per trapper for raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) in Illinois, USA, from 1976-2018 while controlling for other socioeconomic (gasoline price, unemployment) and weather (temp, snow depth) factors. The annual raccoon harvest showed no clear trend, whereas the number of raccoon trappers declined markedly from approximately 1976-1990 in conjunction with pelt prices, after which the number of trappers remained relatively stable and were not significantly affected by pelt price. In contrast, harvest per trapper increased markedly during the 1990s and showed a significant negative relationship with pelt price pre-1990 but a positive relationship post-1990. We propose that declines in pelt prices resulted in a loss of less experienced or economically incentivized trappers, whereas contemporary trappers may continue trapping primarily for non-economic reasons. Our study highlights the potential for using non-linear relationships between trapper harvest data and socioeconomic covariates to help understand the influences of temporal variation in trapper harvest data. | | Bauder, J.M., H.C.

For example, habitat heterogeneity may affect the spatial distribution of resources leading to larger home ranges where resources are spatially dispersed or, conversely, smaller home ranges where resources are concentrated or abundant. Other landscape features may lead to smaller home ranges by constraining or restricting animal movements. Understanding the relative importance of these two processes is increasingly important given the prevalence of anthropogenic features across contemporary landscapes. We test the relative importance of habitat heterogeneity and movement restriction on the home range size of a wide-ranging, habitat and dietary generalist, the federally threatened eastern indigo snake (<i>Drymarchon couperi</i>). We used data from 83 radio-tracked individuals in a multi-scale analysis of home range size as a function of multiple landscape features representing land cover and habitat heterogeneity. We found that home range size was negatively correlated to habitat heterogeneity (i.e., the standard deviation of normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) and urban intensity. Smaller home ranges in areas with high habitat heterogeneity and low urban intensity likely reflected reduced resource dispersion through the concentration of diverse foraging habitats. Home ranges were smallest in urban landscapes which, combined with previously documented avoidance of urban habitats by eastern indigo snakes, suggests that urban land cover restricts home range size. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering both the influence of resource dispersion and movement barriers in understanding animal space use. Moreover, we highlight the need to consider the potential role of anthropogenically subsidized resources (e.g., prey, shelter sites) to understand variation in eastern indigo snake home range sizes within urban areas. | | Bauder, J.M., C.S.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting members of the family Cervidae, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), and the first positive CWD case in a wild Ohio deer was recorded in 2020. While landscape genetics approaches are increasingly utilized to better understand potential pathways for CWD spread in white-tailed deer, little is known about genetic structure of white-tailed deer in Ohio. The objectives of our study were to evaluate spatial genetic structure in white-tailed deer across Ohio and compare the support for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by landscape resistance (IBR) models in explaining this structure. For genetic data we used microsatellite genotypes from 619 individuals from 24 counties across Ohio genotyped at 11 loci and a 547-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region from the same individuals. We used spatial and non-spatial genetic clustering tests to evaluate genetic structure in both types of genetic data and empirically optimized landscape resistance surfaces to compare IBD and IBR using microsatellite data. Non-spatial genetic clustering tests failed to detect spatial genetic structure while spatial genetic clustering tests indicated subtle spatial genetic structure. IBD models consistently outperformed IBR models including land cover, traffic volume, and streams. Our results indicated widespread genetic connectivity of white-tailed deer across Ohio and negligible barrier effects of landscape features. These patterns likely reflect some combination of minimal resistive effects of landscape features on white-tail deer movement in Ohio and the effects of regional recolonization or translocation. We encourage continued CWD surveillance in Ohio, particularly in the proximity of confirmed cases. | | Bauder, J.M., A. Cervantes, A. Avrin, L. Whipple, and M.L. Allen. 2021.

For example, coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>) have expanded their range across North America and into many urban areas making it important to understand factors influencing broad-scale patterns of occurrence. We used citizen science data in the form of coyote observations by archery deer hunters from throughout the state of Illinois to evaluate factors affecting coyote detection and occupancy. Our statewide participant-level occupancy estimate (0.63) was 58% greater than our na\u00efve occupancy estimate (0.40) while detection probability was <0.25, highlighting the importance of using modeling frameworks that account for imperfect detection when modeling occupancy of cryptic species with low detection rates. Time period (AM/PM) had the largest effect on detection of coyotes, with detections greater in the AM. The number of hours hunted (analogous to effort) also impacted coyote detection, with more hours hunted increasing coyote detections. In contrast, none of the landscape covariates examined had strong effects on coyote occupancy. While coyote ubiquity and generalist habitat use may at least partially explain our results, we suspect it also is because the landscape covariates were measured at the county level, as more precise participant location data were unavailable, whereas participants effectively surveyed a much smaller area. Since scale affects the strength and direction of species-habitat relationships, this scale mismatch is likely an important limitation when using many sources of citizen scientist observations to infer species-habitat relationships for widespread generalist species when precise participant location data are unavailable. | | Bauder, J.

However, few studies have evaluatedmethodological approaches for selecting spatial scales in landscape genetics analyses,in part because of computational challenges associated with optimizing landscaperesistance surfaces (LRS). We used the federally threatened eastern indigo snake(Drymarchon couperi) in central Florida as a case study with which to compare the importanceof landscape features and their scales of effect in influencing gene flow. Weused genetic algorithms (ResistanceGA) to empirically optimize LRS using categoricalland cover surfaces, multiscale resource selection surfaces (RSS), and four combinationsof landscape covariates measured at multiple spatial scales (multisurfacemultiscale LRS). We compared LRS where scale was selected using pseudo-andfulloptimization. Multisurface multiscale LRS received more empirical support than LRSoptimized from categorical land cover surfaces or RSS. Multiscale LRS with scale selectedusing full optimization generally outperformed those with scale selected usingpseudo-optimization.Multiscale LRS with large spatial scales (1200-1800m) receivedthe most empirical support.

Nonetheless, the two have historically been seen as separate, with reason elevated in association with masculinity and emotion (especially nurturing emotion) dismissed or delegitimated in association with femininity. These associations can be situated in a broader, dualistic, and hierarchical logic used to maintain power for a dominant male (White, able-bodied, upper class, heterosexual) human class. We argue that emotion should be affirmed by conservationists for the novel and essential insights it contributes to conservation ethics. We consider the specific example of compassion and characterize it as an emotional experience of interdependence and shared vulnerability. This experience highlights conservationists' responsibilities to individual beings, enhancing established and widely accepted beliefs that conservationists have a duty to protect populations, species, and ecosystems (or biodiversity). We argue compassion, thus understood, should be embraced as a core virtue of conservation. | | Bassing, S.B., D.E. Ausband, M.S. Mitchell, P. Lukacs, A. Keever, G. Hale, and L. Waits. 2019.

The risk of Hg contamination is driven by factors that regulate Hg loading, methylation, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification. In remote locations, with infrequent access and limited data, understanding the relative importance of these factors can pose a challenge. Here, we assessed Hg concentrations in an apex predator fish species, lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>), collected from 14 lakes spanning two National Parks in southwest Alaska, U.S.A. We then examined factors associated with the variation in fish Hg concentrations using a Bayesian hierarchical model. We found that Hg concentrations in lake water were uniform and very low. Conversely, Hg concentrations in lake trout were variable and, in some lakes, very high, exceeding Alaska's human consumption threshold at half of our study sites. Additionally, model results indicated that fish age and, to a lesser extent, body condition best explained variation in Hg concentration among fish within a lake, with Hg elevated in older, thinner lake trout. Other factors, including plankton methyl Hg content, fish species richness, volcano proximity, and glacier loss, best explained variation in lake trout Hg concentration among lakes. Collectively, these results provide evidence that multiple, hierarchically nested factors control fish Hg levels in these lakes. | | Bartley, M.L., E.M. Hanks, E.M. Schliep, P.A. Soranno, and T.

Their biphasic nature makes them dependent on aquatic and terrestrial habitats; as wet-skinned ectotherms, they are vulnerable to a range of environmental threats, including climate change. Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is becoming warmer and drier, and some wetlands important to amphibians have diminished. Continued climate change is predicted to reduce snowpack, soil moisture, and forest cover. We used data from models of future climate and vegetation cover to mechanistically model how climate change might affect the movements of Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) across the landscape of three test areas in YNP for the years 2050 and 2090, compared to 2000 as a baseline. Least-cost path analysis produced mixed results: for 2050 and 2090, physiological costs of movement increased in one test area and decreased in another; they were mixed in the third. These changes generally reflect the preference by toads for more open forests. Estimating costs for other species of YNP amphibians produced more negative results. For Columbia Spotted Frogs (Rana luteiventris) and Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) (both more aquatic and less adapted to terrestrial habitats), movement costs increased by about 2-15X.Reduced frequency or duration of rain events might limit the nocturnal movements of Western Tiger Salamanders(Ambystoma mavortium). Climate change may not have negative impacts on all amphibians throughout YNP, but increased movement costs for terrestrial habitats will accentuate effects of drying wetlands in at least parts of YNP. Land management actions that preserve habitat structure of both forest and low shrub cover may help mitigate continued drying conditions of climate change. | | Barrile, G.M., 2023.

The unidirectional movement of animals between breeding locations (i.e., breeding dispersal) has profound implications for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. In spatiotemporally variable environments, individuals are expected to adjust their dispersal decisions in accordance with fitness prospects in a given breeding patch.<br>2. A paucity of empirical work limits our understanding of the ability of animals to depart from low quality breeding patches and settle in high quality breeding patches (i.e., adaptive breeding dispersal). We examined the capacity of individuals to respond to stochastic changes in habitat quality via adaptive breeding dispersal in a pond-breeding amphibian.<br>3. We conducted <i>Anaxyrus boreas boreas</i> (<i>n</i> = 1100) that breed in beaver ponds in western Wyoming, USA. During early spring of 2017, an extreme flooding event destroyed several beaver dams and resulted in the loss of breeding habitat. We used multi-state models to investigate how temporal changes in pond characteristics influenced breeding dispersal and determined whether movement decisions were adaptive with respect to prospects for reproductive fitness.<br>4. Boreal toads exhibited adaptive breeding dispersal; individuals more often departed from low quality breeding ponds (without successful metamorphosis) and settled in high quality breeding ponds (with successful metamorphosis). Movement decisions were associated with pond characteristics altered as a result of beaver dam destruction, including decreases in pond depth and increased emergent vegetation. Individuals were more likely to depart from shallow ponds with high vegetation cover and settle in deep ponds with low vegetation cover. Similarly, the probability of metamorphosis was greater in deep ponds with low vegetation cover, suggesting boreal toads may use pond depth and vegetation cover as cues to assess the fitness prospects of a breeding patch and adjust movement decisions accordingly.<br>5. We demonstrate that stochastic variability in environmental conditions and habitat quality can underpin dispersal behavior in amphibians. Our study highlights the mechanistic linkages between habitat change, movement behavior, and reproductive success, which is critical to our understanding of how wild animals respond to rapid environmental change. | | Barrile, G.M., A.D.

We employed structural equation models to determine whether the effects of climatic variation on Bd prevalence were direct or mediated through effects on breeding phenology and multi-state models to explore the interplay of grazing, weather, and Bd infection on adult survival. Higher winter snowpack was linked with shorter spring breeding seasons, which were associated with lower Bd prevalence. Boreal toads infected with Bd suffered increased mortality, but only at relatively cool temperatures. Although cattle grazing created warmer microclimates, likely by reducing vegetation cover, grazing-induced habitat changes did not scale up to influence adult survival. Our results suggest that boreal toads in cooler environments face increased risk of disease-induced mortality, possibly because infected individuals are not able to elevate body temperature to reduce or clear infection. More generally, we demonstrate that host-pathogen dynamics can be shaped jointly by independent and interactive effects of livestock grazing, breeding season length, and climatic variation. Future investigations of wildlife responses to disease therefore may benefit from considering anthropogenic land use and climatic regimes, including the effect of weather on host phenology. | | Barrile, G.

Acoustic recordings of the environment can produce species presence-absence data for characterizing populations of soundproducing wildlife over multiple spatial scales. If a species is present at a site but does not vocalize during a scheduled audio recording survey, researchers may incorrectly conclude that the species is absent (\"false negative\"). The risk of false negatives is compounded when audio devices have sampling constraints, do not record continuously, and must be manually scheduled to operate at preselected times of day, particularly when research programs target multiple species with acoustic availability that varies across temporal conditions.<br><br>2. We developed a temporally adaptive acoustic sampling algorithm to maximize detection probabilities for a suite of focal species amid sampling constraints. The algorithm combines usersupplied species vocalization models with sitespecific weather forecasts to set an optimized sampling schedule for the following day. To test our algorithm, we simulated hourly vocalization probabilities for a suite of focal species in a hypothetical monitoring area for the year 2016. We conducted a factorial experiment that sampled from the 2016 acoustic environment to com pare the probability of acoustic detection by a fixed (stationary) schedule versus a temporally adaptive optimized schedule under several sampling efforts and monitoring durations.<br><br>3. We found that over the course of a study season, the probability of acoustically capturing a focal species (given presence) at least once via automated acoustic monitoring was greater (and acoustic capture occurred earlier in the season) when using the temporally adaptive optimized schedule as compared to a fixed schedule.<br><br>4. The advantages of a temporally adaptive optimized acoustic sampling schedule are magnified when a study duration is short, sampling effort is low, and/or species acoustic availability is minimal. This methodology presents the opportunity to maximize acoustic monitoring sampling efforts amid constraints. | | Balantic, C., and T. M. Donovan. 2019.

However, false negatives and false positives produced by automated detection systems can compromise the utility of these data for researchers and land managers, particularly for research programs endeavoring to describe colonization and extinction dynamics that inform land use decisionmaking. To investigate the suitability of automated acoustic monitoring for dynamic occurrence models, we simulated underlying occurrence dynamics, calling patterns, and the automated acoustic detection process for a hypothetical species under a range of scenarios. We investigated an automated species detection aggregation method that considered a suite of options for creating encounter histories. From these encounter histories, we generated parameter estimates and computed bias for occurrence, colonization, and extinction rates using a dynamic occupancy modeling framework that accounts for false positives via small amounts of manual confirmation. We were able to achieve relatively unbiased estimates for all three state parameters under all scenarios, even when the automated detection system was simulated to be poor, given particular encounter history aggregation choices. However, some encounter history aggregation choices resulted in unreliable estimates; we provide caveats for avoiding these scenarios. Given specific choices during the detection aggregation process, automated acoustic monitoring data may provide an effective means for tracking species occurrence, colonization, and extinction patterns through time, with the potential to inform adaptive management at multiple spatial scales. | | Balantic, C., and T.

Ecological research and management programs are increasingly using autonomous monitoring units (AMUs) to collect large volumes of acoustic and/or photo data to address pressing management objectives or research goals.

Over the 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries, most historical stocks of Atlantic Sturgeon were depleted by human activities. Estimating recruitment for the remaining populations is challenging due to sampling constraints, limited age data, and natural variability. However, recruitment estimates could inform recovery efforts. The objectives of this study were to compare two modeling approaches to estimate recruitment of age-1 Atlantic Sturgeon and provide an updated index of abundance across more than a decade of sampling in the Altamaha River, GA. First, we constructed capture histories of river-resident juveniles, using capture-mark-recapture data collected from 2008-2020, and assigned ages based on length-frequency analysis. Second, we compared more traditional Huggins closed population models and a recent nonlinear extension of Huggins models - vector generalized additive models (VGAMs) - to estimate abundance of age-1 fish. Both model types suggested similar yearly age-1 abundance estimates, which varied from 163 in 2017 to 3,839 in 2010, but the VGAMs provided more direct interpretation for factors that might affect capture probability (e.g., sampling effort, temperature, fish length). This study indicates that the Altamaha River Atlantic Sturgeon population has remained relatively stable over the past decade, and provides a long-term baseline which will better allow managers to assess the effects of either future restoration actions or environmental disturbances on the population.</sup> | | Baebler, E.

Fecal material is a readily available source of DNA, and various methods exist for collecting fecal samples for DNA preservation. In particular, swab methods offer considerable promise, but their utility in real-world field contexts remains relatively untested. We systematically compared multiple genetic fecal sampling methods across all stages of data collection and analysis, including sampling in the field, DNA extraction in the lab, and identification of individuals using microsatellite genotyping. We collected 112 fecal samples from black-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus columbianus</i>) in the field in Mendocino County, California, across a range of sample conditions of unknown age. We systematically compared the efficiency, ease, and genotyping success of three methods for field collection and storage of ungulate fecal samples: whole pellets in ethanol, whole dry pellets in paper envelopes, and cotton swabs in buffer. Storage method, sample condition, and their interaction predicted genotyping success in the top binomial GLMMs. We found that swabbing pellets resulted in the greatest percentage of individually identifiable genotypes (81%, compared to 60% for dry samples and 56% for ethanol), despite lower DNA concentrations. While swabbing pellets requires a greater time investment in the field, the samples are easier and safer to store and transport, and subsequent labwork is more efficient as compared to whole-pellet collection methods. We, therefore, recommend the swab method for most contexts. We provide additional recommendations and field protocols based on subsequent collection of 2284 swab samples for a larger monitoring study of the deer population, given that this large number of samples spanned a range of sample conditions and time spent in storage. | | Avila, B.W., D.L.

Two important salmonid pathogens are <i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> and <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> that cause whirling disease and bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), respectively. Innate disease resistance is a potential option for reducing disease-related mortality in hatchery-reared rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>, Walbaum). Two experiments were conducted to assess pathogen resistance of first-generation (F1) rainbow trout created by crossing <i>M. cerebralis</i>- and <i>F. psychrophilum</i>-resistant strains. In the first experiment, we exposed two rainbow trout strains and one F1 cross to six treatments: control (no exposure), mock injection, F. psychrophilum only, <i>F. psychrophilum</i>. Results indicated that the F1 cross was not resistant to either pathogen. In the second experiment, we exposed five rainbow trout strains and four rainbow trout crosses to <i>F. psychrophilum</i>. The second experiment indicated that at least one rainbow trout cross was <i>F. psychrophilum</i>-resistant. Achieving dual resistance may be possible using selective breeding but only some multigenerational strains are suitable candidates for further evaluation. | | Austin, L.V., A.S. Silvis, M.S.

BioScience. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/259553273856/None/all) | August 2023 || Gray wolf<i> </i>(<i>Canis lupus</i>) recovery and conservation has been an unprecedented success over the last 30 years in the United States (U.S.). Unprecedented success yields unprecedented challenges, however. As populations expand, wolves will colonize more human-dominated landscapes and face numerous challenges such as fragmented habitats, barriers to dispersal, and increased encounters with humans, pets, and livestock. In such areas, conflicts between humans and wolves will increase. We summarize several major scientific and social challenges that wolf conservation, recovery, and management will face in the coming years. Additionally, we suggest actions to help address each challenge. Future wolf conservation in the U.S. will be affected by the ability of managers to 1) predict colonization and dispersal dynamics, 2) reduce hybridization and disease transmission, 3) mitigate and deter wolf-livestock conflicts, 4) harvest wolves sustainably while satisfying diverse stakeholders, 5) ensure that urbanization or disinterest in nature do not reduce tolerance for wolves, and 6) engage diverse stakeholders in wolf conservation to avoid management by ballot initiative or legislative and judicial decrees. | | Ausband, D.E., and J.

Many carnivore populations persist at relatively low densities, public interest is high, and the need for rigorous data is great. Recent advances in trail camera technology provide an unprecedented opportunity for biologists to monitor rare species economically. Few studies, however, have conducted rigorous analyses of our ability to estimate abundance of low-density carnivores with cameras. We used remotely triggered trail cameras and a space to event model to estimate gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) abundance across three study areas in Idaho, USA, 2016-2018. We compared abundance estimates between cameras and noninvasive genetic sampling that had been extensively tested in our study areas. Estimates of mean wolf abundance from camera and genetic surveys were within 22% of one another and 95% CI's overlapped in 2 of the 3 years. Camera surveys were less than half the cost of genetic surveys once initial camera purchases were made. Our results suggest that cameras can be a viable method for estimating wolf abundance across broad landscapes. | | Ausband, D.E. 2022. Offspring sex ratios are male-biased reflecting sex-biased dispersal in Idaho, USA, wolves. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 76: doi.org/10.1007/s00265-022-03243 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/232836202496/None/all) | September 2022 || Offspring sex ratios can vary widely across species and the reasons for such variation have long intrigued ecologists. For group-living animals, predicting offspring sex ratios as a function of group and environmental characteristics can be challenging. Additionally, mortality of group members can upend traditional theory used to explain offspring sex ratios observed in populations. Gray wolves (<i>Canis lupus</i>) in Idaho, USA, are an excellent study species for asking questions about offspring sex ratios given their group-living behavior and persistent exposure to human-caused mortality. I hypothesized that offspring sex ratios would be influenced by characteristics of individuals, groups, and populations. I generated genotypes for 419 adult and 400 pup wolves during 2008-2018. There was a significant male-bias in litters of wolf pups with nearly 12% more male pups born than females. The individual, group, and population variables I considered did not have significant associations with offspring sex ratios. Local resource competition helped explain offspring sex ratios in wolves in my study system, but not local resource enhancement theory. Although female helpers have been shown to help slightly more than males, offspring sex ratios did not favor the helping sex suggesting that the overall benefit of female helpers may have been negligible in wolf groups during my study. Three wolf groups consistently overproduced males, the dispersing sex, suggesting that habitat quality was poor on their territories. The male-biased offspring sex ratios observed throughout this population reflect sex-biased dispersal in wolves in Idaho. Such a pattern suggests breeding females may be reducing local resource competition (e.g., mates and successful reproduction) by producing more males than females. | | Ausband, D.E. 2022. Inherit the kingdom or storm the castle? Breeding strategies in gray wolves. Ethology. 128:152-158. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/217861834752/None/all) | January 2022 || <br>1. Breeding opportunities are inherently limited for animals that live and breed in groups. Individuals use various strategies to secure breeding positions in such populations ranging from inheritance within their group to dispersing to an existing group or establishing a new group. Turnover in breeding positions can have marked effects on groups of cooperative breeders, particularly social carnivores.<br>2. We generally know little about how breeding vacancies are filled and what factors might influence an individual's ability to successfully fill a vacancy.<br>3. I used data from gray wolves to ask whether breeding vacancies were filled by individuals from within groups or by adoptees from outside the group. I hypothesized sex, group size, and genetic relatedness would influence how breeding vacancies were filled.<br>4. Across 37 breeding vacancies, females were three times more likely than males to inherit breeding positions within their group. Group size did not influence whether a breeding vacancy was filled by an adoptee or inherited by an individual from within the group. Genetic relatedness, however, was 30% higher in groups when females were adopted into breeding positions than when they inherited breeding positions from within groups.<br>5. Female wolves appear to bide their time waiting for a breeding position thus, they may be expected to show more helping behavior than males in their natal groups. Increased body size can be advantageous for males to secure a breeding position in a new group thus, males may act selfishly and consume more food and provision pups or help less in their natal group. Dispersing and monopolizing a breeding position is not the only avenue to increased fitness, however. Male wolves can also gain fitness benefits from extra-pair paternity while waiting for breeding vacancies to open elsewhere as has been observed in this population. Because of their strong reliance on dispersal to secure a breeding position, male wolves appear to be the primary vector promoting genetic diversity in populations of gray wolves. | | Ausband, D.E. 2022. Genetic diversity and mate selection in a reintroduced population of gray wolves.

As some wildlife populations become smaller, conserving genetic diversity will be a conservation challenge. Many imperiled species are already supported through population augmentation efforts and we often do not know if or how genetic diversity is maintained in translocated species. I wanted to know if genetic diversity remained high in a population of gray wolves > 20 years after reintroduction. Additionally, I wanted to know if a potential mechanism for such diversity was individuals with below average genetic diversity choosing mates with above average diversity. Further, I hypothesized that mated pairs with above average heterozygosity would have increased survival of young. Females with below average heterozygosity did not choose mates with above average heterozygosity and pup survival was not higher for mated pairs with above average heterozygosity. The dominant variables predicting pup survival were harvest rate and years pairs were mated. Ultimately, genetic diversity (i.e., heterozygosity) was 7% higher > 20 years after reintroduction. The mechanism for maintaining such diversity does not appear related to individuals preferentially choosing more genetically diverse mates, however. | | Ausband, D.E. 2021. Wolf use of humanmade Some animals use humanmade objects for building and constructing nests or shelter and even for play. Gray wolves (<i>Canis lupus</i>) gather and use humanmade objects discovered in their natural environment. Gathering humanmade objects is a peculiar behavior particularly when there is no immediately apparent benefit to survival or reproduction. I opportunistically documented 46 different types of humanmade objects with plastic bottles and aluminum cans being the most common item found at wolf pup-rearing sites. Many objects were made of materials that appeared suitable to alleviate pain in teething pups. For some objects, however, it was not immediately obvious that they would alleviate teething pain due to their unpliable material. Additionally, such objects were quite rare in wolves' natural environment although it was not uncommon to find them at pup-rearing sites. Rare humanmade objects may provide a novelty that stimulates pups more than common objects. I hypothesize that objects used by wolf pups 1) alleviate pain from teething, and 2) provide adults respite from energetic pups. The latter is an important distinction because it implies the benefit of object play is to the adults and not the juveniles per se. Gathering novel objects that occupy energetic and hungry pups may influence the overall ability of social carnivores to leave young unattended while they hunt, to rest upon their return, and ultimately rear young successfully. | | Ausband, D.E. 2019.

Standard methods for estimating demographic parameters from noninvasive genetic samples are inefficient because lower-quality samples cannot be used, and they assume individuals are identified without error. We introduce the genotype spatial partial identity model (gSPIM), which integrates a genetic classification model with a spatial population model to combine both spatial and genetic information, thus reducing genotype uncertainty and increasing the precision of demographic parameter estimates. We apply this model to data from a study of fishers (<i>Pekania pennanti</i>) in which 37% of hair samples were originally discarded because of uncertainty in individual identity. The gSPIM density estimate using all collected samples was 25% more precise than the original density estimate, and the model identified and corrected three errors in the original individual identity assignments. A simulation study demonstrated that our model increased the accuracy and precision of density estimates 63 and 42%, respectively, using three replicated assignments (e.g., PCRs for microsatellites) per genetic sample. Further, the simulations showed that the gSPIM model parameters are identifiable with only one replicated assignment per sample and that accuracy and precision are relatively insensitive to the number of replicated assignments for high-quality samples. Current genotyping protocols devote the majority of resources to replicating and confirming high-quality samples, but when using the gSPIM, genotyping protocols could be more efficient by devoting more resources to low-quality samples. | | Aubin, G.R., C.C.

North American Journal of Fisheries Management. .doi:10.1002/nafm.10844 | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/236860524544/None/all) | September 2022 || Brook Trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) have been widely introduced across the western U.S. where the species competes with and often replaces native salmonids. Non-native Brook Trout are difficult to eradicate; thus, complementary removal strategies are needed to manage invasive populations. One novel methodology is the M<sub>YY</sub> integrated pest management approach, which couples partial removal of a wild Brook Trout population with the stocking of M<sub>YY</sub> Brook Trout. If M<sub>YY</sub> fish survive to reproduce with wild female Brook Trout, their progeny will be 100% male, which will shift the sex ratio and theoretically extirpate the population. However, the effectiveness of the approach depends on the survival and reproduction of M<sub>YY</sub> fish relative to the surviving wild conspecifics. From 2018-2020, we annually removed 50% of the wild Brook Trout populations from three streams and replaced with fingerling M<sub>YY</sub> Brook Trout (mean TL = 94 mm, range = 61-123 mm). Annual survival for M<sub>YY</sub> and wild Brook Trout was similar in Leandro Creek (M<sub>YY</sub> 0.63 and wild 0.63) and Rito de los Pi\u00f1os (M<sub>YY</sub> 0.37 and wild 0.46), but lower in Placer Creek (M<sub>YY</sub> 0.28 and wild 0.75). We evaluated the reproductive success of M<sub>YY</sub> Brook Trout by comparing sexually mature M<sub>YY</sub> fish during the spawning season to hybrid (M<sub>YY</sub> x wild) F<sub>1 </sub>progeny produced in 2019 and 2020. By the second spawning season (2020), M<sub>YY</sub> fish comprised 59.8%, 50.4%, and 34.5% of the milt producing Brook Trout, which resulted in 55.1%, 33.3%, and 0% hybrid progeny in Leandro Creek, Rito de los Pi\u00f1os, and Placer Creek, respectively. We demonstrated M<sub>YY</sub> fish exhibit similar vital rates compared to wild conspecifics; however, differences among streams highlights unforeseen variables that influence M<sub>YY</sub> survival and reproduction. The study offers promising results of the M<sub>YY</sub> approach to eradicate unwanted Brook Trout populations. | | Anthony, CR, LJ Foster, CA Hagen, and KM Dugger. 2021.

Here, we demonstrate that eDNA approaches also have the capacity to detect intraspecific diversity in the nuclear genome, allowing for assessments of population-level genetic diversity and estimates of the number of genetic contributors in a sample. Using a panel of microsatellite loci, we evaluated intraspecific genetic diversity in the round goby (<i>Neogobius melanostomus</i>) using eDNA samples from experimental mesocosms. First, we tested the similarity between eDNA and individual tissue-based estimates of allele frequencies. Subsequently, we used a likelihood-based DNA mixture framework to estimate the number of unique genetic contributors in mesocosm eDNA samples and in simulated mixtures of alleles. Allele frequencies from eDNA accurately reflected allele frequencies from genotyped round goby tissue samples, indicating nuclear markers can be reliably amplified from water samples under controlled conditions. DNA mixture analyses were able to estimate the number of genetic contributors from eDNA samples and simulated mixtures of DNA from up to 58 individuals, with the degree of positive or negative bias dependent on the filtering scheme of low-frequency alleles. This study is the first to document the application of eDNA and multiple amplicon-based methods to obtain intraspecific nuclear genetic information and estimate the absolute abundance of a species in mesocosms. With proper validation, this approach has the potential to advance non-invasive survey methods to characterize populations and broadens the application of eDNA methodologies to inform population-level management objectives. | | Andres K, Sethi SA, Duskey E, Lepak JM, Rice AN, Estabrook B, Fitzpatrick K, George E, Marcy-Quay B, Paufve M, Perkins K, Scofield AE.

Journal of Animal Ecology 90: 685-697. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/234377922560/None/all) | March 2021 || Fragmentation within urbanized environments often leads to a loss of native species diversity; however, variation exists in responses among-species and among-populations within species.We aimed to identify patterns in species biogeography in an urbanized landscape to understand anthropogenic effects on vertebrate communities and identify species that are more sensitive or resilient to landscape change.We investigated patterns in species richness and species responses to fragmentation in southern Californian small vertebrate communities using multispecies occupancy models and determined factors associated with overall commonness and sensitivity to patch size for 45 small vertebrate species both among and within remaining non-developed patches.In general, smaller patches had fewer species, with amphibian species richness being particularly sensitive to patch size effects. Mammals were generally more common, occurring both in a greater proportion of patches and a higher proportion of the sites within occupied patches. Alternatively, amphibians were generally restricted to larger patches but were more ubiquitous within smaller patches when occupied. Species range size was positively correlated with how common a species was across and within patches, even when controlling for only patches that fell within a species' range. We found sensitivity to patch size was greater for more fecund species and depended on where the patch occurred within a species' range. While all taxa were more likely to occur in patches in the warmer portions of their ranges, amphibians and mammals were more sensitive to fragmentation in these warmer areas as compared to the rest of their ranges. Similarly, amphibians occurred at a smaller proportion of sites within patches in drier portions of their ranges. Mammals occurred at a higher proportion of sites that were also in drier portions of their range while reptiles did not differ in their sensitivity to patch size by range position. We demonstrate that taxonomy, life history, range size and range position can predict commonness and sensitivity of species across this highly fragmented yet biodiverse landscape. The impacts of fragmentation on species communities within an urban landscape depend on scale, with differences emerging among and within species and populations. | | Amburgey SM, AA Yackel Adams, B Gardner, SJ Converse. 2021. Validation of camera abundance for unmarked populations. Ecological Applications 31: e02410. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/209107281920/None/all) | October 2021 || Estimates of species abundance are critical to understand population processes and to assess and plan management actions. However, capturing and marking individuals for abundance estimation can be economically and logistically prohibitive, particularly for cryptic species. Camera traps can collect data at temporal and spatial scales necessary for estimating abundance, but the use of camera traps comes with limitations when target species are not uniquely identifiable (i.e., \"unmarked\"). Abundance estimation is particularly useful in the management of invasive species, and herpetofauna are being recognized as some of the most pervasive and detrimental invasive species. However, the use of camera traps for these taxa comes with additional challenges with relevancy across multiple taxa. It is often necessary to use lures to attract animals in order to obtain sufficient observations, yet lure-attraction can influence species' landscape use and potentially induce bias in abundance estimators. We investigated these challenges and assessed the feasibility of obtaining reliable abundance estimates using camera trapping data on a population of invasive brown treesnakes (<i>Boiga irregularis</i>) in Guam. Data were collected using camera traps in an enclosed area where snakes were subject to high-intensity capture-recapture effort, resulting in presumed abundance of 116 snakes (density = 23/ha). We then applied Unmarked Spatial Capture-Recapture (USCR), Random Encounter and Staying Time, Space to Event, and Instantaneous Sampling estimators to photo-capture data to estimate abundance and compared estimates to our presumed abundance. We found that all estimators for unmarked populations performed poorly, with inaccurate or imprecise abundance estimates that limit their usefulness for management. We further investigated the sensitivity of these estimators to increasing lure attraction (i.e., violating the assumption that animal behavior is unchanged by sampling) and camera density. Increasing lure attraction and camera density both resulted in higher abundance estimates, with the USCR estimator particularly sensitive to changing camera density while other estimators were more sensitive to increasing lure attraction. Each estimator rarely recovered truth or suffered from convergence issues. Our results indicate that, when limited to unmarked estimators and the use of lures, camera traps alone are unlikely to produce abundance estimates with utility to managers. | | Amburgey SM, AA Yackel Adams, B Gardner, B Lardner, AJ Knox, SJ Converse. 2021. Tools for increasing visual encounter probabilities for invasive species removal: a case study of brown treesnakes. Neobiota 70: 107-122. | |[Abstract](/coopunits/publication/222427895808/None/all) | December 2021 || Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) are essential to identifying and decisively responding to the introduction or spread of an invasive species, thus avoiding population establishment and improving the probability of achieving eradication. However, detection can be challenging at the onset of a species invasion as low population densities can reduce detection probability and conceal the true extent of the situation until the species is well established. This is doubly challenging if the invading species displays cryptic behavior or is nocturnal, thus further limiting opportunities for its discovery. Survey methods that maximize a searcher's ability to detect an incipient population are therefore critical for successful EDRR. Brown treesnakes (<i>Boiga irregularis</i>) on Gu\u00e5han are a classic cautionary example of the dangers of not detecting an invasion early on, and the risk of their introduction to other islands within the Marianas, Hawai'i and beyond remains. Nocturnal visual surveys are known to detect brown treesnakes of all sizes and are the primary detection tool used by the Brown Treesnake Rapid Response Team, but detection probability remains low in complex forest habitats. As such, we investigated the use of two potential enhancements to nocturnal visual surveys - a live mouse lure and spray scent attractant - that may create hotspots of increased detection probability during surveys. We found that, while brown treesnake detection probabilities were low for all surveys, visual surveys conducted on transects with live mouse lures resulted in detection probabilities that were 1.3 times higher than on transects without live mouse lures. Conversely, the spray scent attractant did not increase the probability of detecting brown treesnakes compared to transects without scent, and in fact had detection probabilities that were 0.66 times lower, though the reasons for this phenomenon are unclear. Unlike scent attractants, live mouse lures likely provide both visual and olfactory cues that attract brown treesnakes to transects and thus provide more opportunities to detect and capture them. These enhancements were trialed on Gu\u00e5han, where prey populations are depressed. It remains unclear whether live mouse lures will be as effective for EDRR applications in prey-rich settings. | | Alves, F., N. Queiroz, P.G.R. Jodice. 2023.

While hydropower is a potentially low emissions source of renewable energy, some hydropower projects produce high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit electricity generated (\"carbon intensity\"). We develop a basin-wide computational optimization framework to quantify the potential carbon intensities of 158 existing and 351 proposed hydropower dams in the Amazon basin. Results indicate carbon intensities of upland dams (median = 37 kg CO2eq MWh-1, 100-year horizon) may be comparable with solar and wind energy, whereas some lowland dams (median = 175 kg CO2eq MWh-1, 100-year horizon) may exceed carbon intensities of fossil-fuel power plants. Our analysis framework indicates that low-carbon expansion of hydropower may benefit from optimization-based planning, where basin-scale analysis that considers GHG emissions along with multiple social and ecological decision indicators associated with dams may advance sustainable energy development in regions where new hydropower is contemplated. | | Almeida R, Fleischmann A, Br\u00eada JPF, Cardoso DS, Angarita H, Collischonn SA, Shi Q, Gomes C, Flecker AS.

While dams are typically designed considering historic river discharge regimes, climate change may induce large-scale alterations in river hydrology. Here we analyze how anticipated future climate change may affect river hydrology, electricity generation, and economic viability of >350 potential hydropower dams across the Amazon, Earth's largest river basin and a global hotspot for future hydropower development. Midcentury projections for the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios show basin-wide reductions of river discharge (means, 13 and 16%, respectively) and hydropower generation (19 and 27%). Declines are sharper for dams in the Brazilian Amazon, which harbors 60% of the proposed projects. Climate change may result in more frequent low-discharge interruption of hydropower generation and less frequent full-capacity operation. Consequently, the estimated minimum electricity sale price for projects to break even more than doubles at many proposed dams, impacting anticipated costs of proposed hydropower relative to alternative energy sources such as wind and solar. | | Allison, A.Z.T., A.

Animals caught and released are often not included in CPUE metrics and their inclusion may create more accurate indices of abundance. We used 21 years of detailed harvest records for bobcat (<i>Lynx rufus</i>) in Wisconsin, U.S.A., to calculate CPUE and 'actual CPUE' (ACPUE; including animals caught and released) from bobcat hunters and trappers. We calibrated these metrics to an independent estimate of bobcat abundance and attempted to create simple but effective models to estimate CPUE and ACPUE using harvest success data (i.e., bobcats harvested/available permits). CPUE showed virtually no relationship with bobcat abundance across all years, but both CPUE and ACPUE had stronger, non-linear, and negative relationships with abundance during the periods when the population was decreasing. Annual harvest success strongly predicted composite ACPUE and CPUE from hunters and trappers and hunter ACPUE and CPUE but was a poorer predictor of trapper ACPUE and CPUE. The non-linear, and sometimes weak, relationships with bobcat abundance likely reflect the increasing selectivity of bobcat hunters for trophy animals. Studies calibrating per-unit-effort metrics against abundance should account for population trajectories and different harvest methods (e.g., hunting and trapping). Our results also highlight the potential for estimating per-unit-effort metrics from relatively simple and inexpensive data sources and we encourage additional research into the use of per-unit-effort metrics for population estimation. | | Allen, M.L., L.M. Elbroch, J.M. Bauder, and H.U. Wittmer. 2023. Food caching by a solitary large carnivore reveals the importance of intermediate-sized prey. Journal of Mammalogy. 104:457-465. doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyad013 Pumas (<i>Puma concolor</i>) are solitary large carnivores that exhibit high energetic investments while hunting prey that often take multiple days to consume. Therefore, pumas should behave in a way to maximize their energetic gains, including using caching, which is a behavior used by many mammal species to preserve and store food or to conceal it from conspecifics and scavengers to limit their losses. Yet pumas do not always cache their kills. In order to understand caching behavior, we used variables associated with the kills such as prey mass, search time, climate, and habitat to test 20 ecological models (representing four a priori hypotheses: food perishability, resource pulse, consumption time, and kleptoparasitism deterrence) in an information-theoretic approach of model selection to explore factors related to the caching behavior. Models were run with information from tracked radio-collared pumas in California over a 2.5-year period and identified a total of 352 kills. Overall, we documented pumas caching 61.5% of their kills, including 71.6% of Black-tailed Deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus columbianus</i>), their primary prey in the study area. The model with a quadratic effect of adjusted mass of prey on puma caching probability had all of the empirical support (<i>w</i> = 1.00). Specifically, pumas were most likely to cache intermediate-sized prey, such as yearling and adult female deer, and also fed from cached kills for longer periods of time. Larger prey may be too large to easily cache, making it less energetically efficient\u2014while small prey can often be consumed quickly enough to not require caching. This suggests that intermediate-sized prey may be the optimal size for caching, allowing a puma to feed for multiple days while not greatly increasing energetic output. The hypotheses we tested were not mutually exclusive and pumas caching their prey may occur for several reasons; nevertheless, our study demonstrated that pumas use caching to extend their foraging time and maximize energetic gains when preying on intermediate-sized prey. | | Allen, Olson, B.

Species-specific data are commonly lacking for species in geographic areas with little research and species perceived to have insufficient charisma or economic importance. Despite their widespread distribution across central and North America and status as a furbearing mammal, little is known about the ecology of Grey Foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus compared to other species of furbearing mammals. To understand what is known about this species, especially factors affecting population dynamics, we performed a systematic review of the scientific literature. We found 234 studies about Grey Foxes, with studies increasing substantially over time but with geographic gaps in the Great Plains and most of Mexico and central America. Most studies we reviewed examined relative abundance or occupancy (n= 35), habitat associations (n= 30), primarily as part of larger mammalian community studies, or spatiotemporal effects of other mammalian carnivores (n= 19), predominately Coyote Canis latrans. Grey Foxes were primarily forest-associated although associations with specific forest communities or anthropogenically disturbed habitats varied among studies. Multiple studies across ecoregions reported this fox as among both the most- and least-abundant mammalian carnivore. The inter-specific effects of Coyote were often, but not exclusively, negative and were likely mediated by landscape composition and human development. Importantly, very few studies examined population-effects of coyotes on Grey Foxes. Studies of population trends, demographics, and space use of Grey Foxes were comparatively rare and small inter- and intra-study sample sizes limited our ability to infer broader patterns. We suggest multiple avenues for future research to better understand the population status of this species throughout their range. | | Alford, S.L. and A.W. Walters. 2021.

Often agencies look to sister agencies in neighboring states when crafting goals for their own freshwater resources. Herein, we review agency goal themes relying on publicly available documents and guided by earlier literature. We test whether goals exhibit geographic patterns presuming that differences and similarities in climate, natural resources, and people determine, to various degrees, the goal themes across the U.S. We identified nine distinct goal themes but found that they do not form clear geographic patterns, inconsistent with a similar analysis conducted in the 1970s. What seems apparent is that since the 1970s agency goals have diversified and regionalism in goals has vanished. We suggest that changes in perspectives and communication technology, as well as provisions within nationwide funding mechanisms have led to goals becoming more homogenous across the U.S. and more diverse within each agency. | | Aldridge CA, Norris DM, Hatcher HR, Coppola G, Colvin ME, Miranda LE. 2022.

The retention and dimensional change of brush piles after installation is important information that can be used to maximize the effectiveness of this management action. We evaluated the retention and dimensional change of 70 eastern red cedar <i>Juniperus virginiana</i> and bald cypress Taxodium distichum brush piles in an embayment of a drawdown reservoir up to four annual cycles of submergence and exposure. We used satellite imagery to supplement our onsite measurements of retention. We also examined spatial patterns of brush pile retention and dimensional change. Brush piles were lost at 10% per year, and their volume was lost at 14% per year. We compared our rates of brush pile retention and dimensional change with those from a holdout data set of 50 brush piles. Estimates between data sets did not differ statistically. Spatial patterns of retention and dimensional change coincided with morphological features in our study area, suggesting that retention and dimensional change is influenced by variable physical forces (e.g., wave action and flow) at installation locations. Our estimates of brush pile retention and dimensional change can be used to generally sustain desirable brush densities. For example, to maintain a fixed total volume of brush in our study embayment, roughly 23% of the total brush volume installed would need to be replaced annually. Similar research in reservoirs managed for other purposes is needed, as length and cycle of inundation could lead to variable rates of retention and dimensional change. Additionally, advancements into computer-assisted detection and volume estimation could reduce the time and effort needed to monitor brush piles. | | Albanese, G., and D. Haukos. 2019.

Across the vast landscapes traversed by many migratory herds, habitats are being altered by development with unknown consequences for surfing. Using a unique long-term tracking dataset, we found that when energy development occurs within mule deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>) migration corridors, migrating animals become decoupled from the green wave. During the early phases of a coalbed natural gas development, deer synchronized their movements with peak green-up. But faced with increasing disturbance as development expanded, deer altered their movements by holding up at the edge of the gas field and letting the green wave pass them by. Development often modified only a small portion of the migration corridor but had far-reaching effects on behaviour before and after migrating deer encountered it, thus reducing surfing along the entire route by 38.65% over the 14-year study period. Our study suggests that industrial development within migratory corridors can change the behaviour of migrating ungulates and diminish the benefits of migration. Such disruptions to migratory behaviour present a common mechanism whereby corridors become unprofitable and could ultimately be lost on highly developed landscapes. | | Aikens, Wave-like patterns of plant phenology determine ungulate movement tactics.

Tracking resources that change across space and time is predicted to be a fundamental driver of animal movement. For example, some migratory ungulates (i.e., hooved mammals) closely track the progression of highly nutritious plant green-up, a phenomenon called \"green-wave surfing\". Yet general principles describing how the dynamic nature of resources determine movement tactics are lacking. We tested an emerging theory that predicts surfing and the existence of migratory behavior will be favored in environments where green-up is fleeting and moves sequentially across large landscapes (i.e., wave-like green-up). Landscapes exhibiting wave-like patterns of green-up facilitated surfing and explained the existence of migratory behavior across 61 populations of four ungulate species on two continents (n = 1,696 individuals). At the species level, foraging benefits were equivalent between tactics, suggesting that each movement tactic is fine-tuned to local patterns of plant phenology. For decades, ecologists have sought to understand how animals move to select habitat, commonly defining habitat as a set of static patches. Our findings indicate that animal movement tactics emerge as a function of the flux of resources across space and time, underscoring the need to redefine habitat to include its dynamic attributes. As global habitats continue to be modified by anthropogenic disturbance and climate change, our synthesis provides a generalizable framework to understand how animal movement will be influenced by altered patterns of resource phenology. | (2020).

Despite concerns about the effects of climate change on migratory species and the critical role of plant phenology in mediating the ability of ungulates to surf, little is known about how drought shapes the green wave and influences the foraging benefits of migration. With a 19 year dataset on drought and plant phenology across 99 unique migratory routes of mule deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>) in western Wyoming, United States, we show that drought shortened the duration of spring green-up by approximately twofold (2.5 weeks) and resulted in less sequential green-up along migratory routes. We investigated the possibility that some routes were buffered from the effects of drought (i.e., routes that maintained long green-up duration irrespective of drought intensity). We found no evidence of drought-buffered routes. Instead, routes with the longest green-up in non-drought years also were the most affected by drought. Despite phenological changes along the migratory route, mule deer closely followed drought-altered green waves during migration. Migrating deer did not experience a trophic mismatch with the green wave during drought. Instead, the shorter window of green-up caused by drought reduced the opportunity to accumulate forage resources during rapid spring migrations. Our work highlights the synchronization of phenological events as an important mechanism by which climate change can negatively affect migratory species by reducing the temporal availability of key food resources. For migratory herbivores, climate change poses a new and growing threat by altering resource phenology and diminishing the foraging benefit of migration. | | Aikens, E.O., Bontekoe, I., Blumenstiel, L., Schlicksupp, A., and Flack, A.

For migratory animals, however, appropriately timing birth on one seasonal range may be constrained by events occurring during other parts of the migratory cycle. We investigated how the use of capital and income resources may facilitate flexibility in reproductive phenology of migratory mule deer in western Wyoming, USA, over a 5-yr period (2015-2019). Specifically, we examined how seasonal interactions affected three interrelated life-history characteristics: fetal development, birth mass, and birth timing. Females in good nutritional condition at the onset of winter and those that migrated short distances had more developed fetuses (measured as fetal eye diameter in March). Variation in parturition date was explained largely by fetal development; however, there were up to 16 d of plasticity in expected birth date. Plasticity in expected birth date was shaped by income resources in the form of exposure to spring green-up. Although individuals that experienced greater exposure to spring green-up were able to advance expected birth date, being born early or late with respect to fetal development had no effect on birth mass of offspring. Furthermore, we investigated the trade-offs migrating mule deer face by evaluating support for existing theory that predicts that births should be matched to local peaks in resource availability at the birth site. In contrast to this prediction, only long-distance migrants that paced migration with the flush of spring green-up, giving birth shortly after ending migration, were able to match birth with spring green-up. Shorter-distance migrants completed migration sooner and gave birth earlier, seemingly trading off more time for offspring to grow and develop over greater access to resources. Thus, movement tactic had profound downstream effects on birth timing. These findings highlight a need to reconsider classical theory on optimal birth timing, which has focused solely on conditions at the birth site. | | Ahrestani, F.S, M.A. Ternent, M.J.

In addition to the data from the survey of private land-owners, the statistical models tested by the SSF approach assessed the influence that housing density, land use type, slope, elevation, and aspect had on movement by the 31 GPS-collared bears monitored in 10-day periods prior to, during, and after the annual bear hunting season in 2010-2012. We analyzed resource selection for each of these three periods by pooling data across study sites and years, and found that the bears selected for: forested lands in all three periods; grasslands in the pre-hunt and hunting periods; east and south facing slopes in the pre-hunt and hunting periods; flatter terrain in the pre-hunt, but steeper terrain the hunting period; and private properties in the post-hunt period that did not permit hunting. Selection of private properties by bears in the post-hunt period suggests that increasing hunting on private properties may be a viable management option. The selection of forest habitats in all three periods is consistent with need for bears to fatten up with fallen mast from trees just before the den for the winter. | | Adler PH, J Barzen, E Gray, A Lacy, RP Urbanek, and SJ Converse. 2019.

In cases where species declines have occurred and gone undetected to conservation managers, habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss are often the largest contributors. River fragmentation often results in altered flow regimes, which is considered the primary variable determining riverine habitat availability. Blue Suckers <i>Cycleptus elongatus</i> are associated with riffle and run habitat, a habitat type that is especially impacted when river flows are altered. The objective of this research was to identify the extent of suitable habitat and mobility for Blue Sucker in the Colorado River, Texas. To understand habitat selection and use, Blue Suckers (N = 49) were surgically implanted with combined acoustic radio transmitter tags. During 2015-2017, thirty-eight attempts were completed to relocate individuals using mobile tracking. Optimized hotspot analysis identified three river reaches critical for Blue Sucker that accounted for 20% of the study area. Blue Sucker used these locations year-round including during spawning. Habitats used by Blue Sucker were composed of gravel, cobble, boulder, and bedrock typically in riffle and run habitat. Additionally, mobility, as measured by home range size, increased as riffle density decreased. The larger home ranges were presumably to find suitable habitat to complete aspects of their life history. The results of this study suggest that suitable habitats are limited throughout the fragmented riverscape. Conservation action in the form of habitat construction or increased stream connectivity through barrier mitigation could have positive impacts on the future of Blue Sucker in the lower Colorado River, Texas. | | Abrahms, B.R.

To track resource waves, animals may rely on proximate cues and/or memory of long-term average phenologies. Although there is growing evidence of resource tracking in terrestrial migrants, such drivers remain unevaluated in migratory marine megafauna. Here we present a test of the green wave hypothesis in a marine system. We compare 10 years of blue whale movement data with the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom resulting in increased prey availability in the California Current Ecosystem, allowing us to investigate resource tracking both contemporaneously (response to proximate cues) and based on climatological conditions (memory) during migrations. Blue whales closely tracked the long-term average phenology of the spring bloom, but did not track contemporaneous green-up. In addition, blue whale foraging locations were characterized by low long-term habitat variability and high long-term productivity compared with contemporaneous measurements. Results indicate that memory of long-term average conditions may have a previously underappreciated role in driving migratory movements of long-lived species in marine systems, and suggest that these animals may struggle to respond to rapid deviations from historical mean environmental conditions. Results further highlight that an ecological theory of migration is conserved across marine and terrestrial systems. Understanding the drivers of animal migration is critical for assessing how environmental changes will affect highly mobile fauna at a global scale. | | Abrahms, B., Aikens, E. O., Armstrong, J.

However, a theoretical framework to understand when and where resource tracking should occur, and how resource tracking should lead to emergent ecological patterns, is lacking. We present a framework that unites concepts from optimal foraging theory and landscape ecology, which can be used to generate and test predictions on how resource dynamics shape animal movement across taxa, systems, and scales. Consideration of the interplay between animal movement and resource dynamics not only advances ecological understanding but can also guide biodiversity conservation in an era of global change. | | Abrahms B, CS Teitelbaum, T Mueller, and SJ Converse. 2022.

Hydropeaking intensity and dam proximity limit aquatic invertebrate diversity in the Colorado River Basin. || River biodiversity is threatened globally by hydropower dams, and there is a need to understand how dam management favors certain species while filtering out others. We examined aquatic invertebrate communities within the tailwaters 0-24 km downstream of seven large hydropower dams in the Colorado River Basin of the western United States. We quantified aquatic invertebrate dominance, richness, abundance, and biomass at multiple locations within individual tailwaters and across the basin and identified biological community responses associated with dam operations and distance from dam. We found that each tailwater was dominated by 3-7 invertebrate taxa, accounting for 95% of total abundance. Half of these dominant taxa were non-insect, non-flying species and thus were unavailable to terrestrial consumers. Consistent with previous studies, aquatic insects and sensitive taxa were negatively associated with hydropeaking intensity (magnitude of daily flow fluctuations associated with hydropower generation), which limits the composition and potentially the quality of the invertebrate food base. While total invertebrate abundance and biomass did not change with increasing distance downstream from dams, insect and sensitive taxa richness, abundance, and biomass all increased, suggesting that impacts of hydropeaking are most acute immediately downstream of dams. Our results demonstrate that tailwaters experiencing hydropeaking support high abundances of aquatic invertebrate, but the diversity of these communities is low. | | Abernethy, E. F., J. D.

Habitat fragmentation can be especially detrimental in freshwater populations, whose dispersal is already constrained by the river network structure. Aquatic insects, for instance, are generally limited to two primary modes of dispersal: downstream drift in the aquatic juvenile life stages and flight during the terrestrial winged adult stage. Yet the impacts of large hydropower dams can make rivers uninhabitable for incoming (drifting) juvenile insects, with remaining refugia found only in tributaries. The ability of adult aquatic insects to traverse such river stretches in search of suitable tributary habitat likely depends on factors such as species-specific dispersal ability and distance between tributaries. To explore the intersection of natural and human-induced habitat fragmentation on aquatic insect dispersal ability, we quantified population genetics of three taxa with varying dispersal (Veliidae: <i>Rhagovelia distincta</i>), throughout tributaries of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. Using 2bRAD reduced genome sequencing and landscape genetics analyses, we revealed a strong pattern of isolation by distance among mayfly populations. This contrasts with caddisfly and water strider populations, which were largely panmictic. Analysis of thousands of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms showed that realized dispersal ability may not be accurately predicted by species traits for these widespread species. Principal components analysis revealed a strong division between caddisfly populations upstream and downstream of Havasu Creek (279 km through the 390 km study reach), suggesting that the geography of the Grand Canyon imposes a dispersal barrier for this species. Our use of genetic tools in the Grand Canyon to understand population structure has enabled us to elucidate dispersal barriers for aquatic insects. Ultimately, these data may be useful in informing effective conservation management plans for understudied organisms of conservation interest. | | Abbott, K.M., A.H. Roy, K.M. Houle, and K.H.

Taming the February 2022 || Developing a better understanding of species responses to temperature change via behavior, and the factors affecting the extent of behavioral responses, is a critical and timely endeavor given the rapid pace at which the climate is changing. Young of altricial songbirds are particularly sensitive to temperature, and parents may modulate temperatures at nests via selection of nest sites, albeit to a largely unknown extent. We examined whether sagebrush-obligate songbirds that reproduce within an open ecosystem with wide temperature fluctuations and span a range of body sizes, selected nest sites on the basis of temperature. We further investigated whether predation risk and ambient conditions modulated temperature-based choices. We placed temperature loggers at nest sites and in unused but available niches and shrubs along a known predation-risk gradient and used nearby weather stations to determine ambient temperatures. Brewer's Sparrows and Sagebrush Sparrows, the two smaller-bodied birds, selected nest sites that were warmer and less variable relative to available sites, whereas Sage Thrashers generally did not select nest sites on the basis of temperature. Both Brewer's Sparrows and Sage Thrashers increased selection for cooler nest sites relative to available sites with increased ambient temperatures during the prospecting period. None of the three species altered nest-site selection with respect to temperature in response to ambient temperature variability or our index of nest predation risk. The microhabitat characteristics that most influenced temperatures at nests varied across species. Our results suggest that songbirds can modulate temperatures at nests to some extent, and such responses can vary depending on the conditions experienced prior to nest initiation. Responses varied across species, however, likely reflecting different physiological tolerances. The extent to which breeding birds will be able to continue to proximately influence temperature via nest site choices likely will depend on the extent and rate of future climatic shifts. | | McInturff, A., Xu, W., Wilkinson, C.E., Dejid, N. and Brashares, J.S., 2020.

Water scarcity drives ecological bottlenecks in continental migration networks supporting greater sandhill cranes. Ecosphere 12(6): || Preserving avian flyway connectivity has long been challenged by our capacity to meaningfully quantify continental habitat dynamics and bird movements at temporal and spatial scales underlying long-distance migrations. Waterbirds migrating hundreds or thousands of kilometers depend on networks of wetland stopover sites to rest and refuel. Entire populations may rely on discrete wetland habitats, particularly in arid landscapes where the loss of limited stopover options can have disproportionately high impacts on migratory cost. Here, we examine flyway connectivity in water-limited ecosystems of western North America using 108 GPS tagged greater sandhill cranes. Bird movements were used to reconstruct wetland stopover networks across three geographically unique sub-populations spanning 12 US-Mexican states and Canadian provinces. Networks were monitored with remote sensing to identify long-term (1988-2019) trends in wetland and agricultural resources supporting migration and were evaluated using centrality metrics as a measure of stopover site importance to flyway connectivity. Sandhill crane space-use was analyzed in stopover locations to identify important ownership and landscape factors structuring bird distributions. Migratory efficiency was the primary mechanism underpinning network function. A small number of key stopover sites important to minimizing movement cost between summering and wintering locations were essential to preserving flyway connectivity. Localized efficiencies were apparent in stopover landscapes given prioritization of space-use by birds where the proximity of agricultural food resources and flooded wetlands minimized daily movements. Model depictions showing wetland declines from 16-18% likely reflect a new normal in landscape drying that could decouple agriculture-waterbird relationships as water scarcity intensifies. Sustaining network resilience will require conservation strategies to balance water allocations preserving agricultural and wetlands on private lands that accounted for 67-96% of habitat use. Study outcomes provide new perspectives of agroecological relationships supporting continental waterbird migration necessary to prioritize conservation of landscapes vital to maintaining flyway connectivity. | | DeGregorio, B.A., J.H.

Understanding the effects of climate change via disturbance on pristine arctic lakes; multi-trophic level response and recovery to a twelve-year, low-level fertilization experiment. To be submitted to Limnology and Oceanography, Special Issue on \"Nonlinear dynamics, resilience, and regime shifts in aquatic climate change-driven disturbance on lake ecosystems can be subtle; indirect effects include increased nutrient loading that could impact ecosystem function. We designed a low-level fertilization experiment to mimic persistent, climate change-driven disturbances (deeper thaw, greater weathering, or thermokarst failure) delivering nutrients to arctic lakes. We measured responses of pelagic trophic levels over 12 years in a fertilized deep lake with fish and a shallow fishless lake, compared to paired reference lakes, and monitored recovery for six years. Relative to pre-fertilization in the deep lake, we observed a maximum pelagic response in chl <i>a</i> (+201%), dissolved oxygen (DO, -43%), and zooplankton biomass (+88%) during the fertilization period (2001-2012). Other responses to fertilization, such as water transparency and fish relative abundance, were delayed, but both ultimately declined. Phyto- and zoo-plankton biomass and community composition shifted with fertilization. The effects of fertilization were less pronounced in the paired shallow lakes, because of a natural thermokarst failure likely impacting the reference lake. In the deep lake there was (a) moderate resistance to change in ecosystem functions at all trophic levels, (b) eventual responses were often non-linear, and (c) post-fertilization recovery (return) times were most rapid at the base of the food web (2-4 years) while higher trophic levels failed to recover after 6 years. The timing and magnitude of responses to fertilization in these arctic lakes were similar to responses in other lakes, suggesting indirect effects of climate change that modify nutrient inputs may affect many lakes in the future. | | Budy, P.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 79: 1-16. Reservoirs are one example of novel ecosystems which have developed into popular sport fisheries; these systems are also becoming seasonal refuges for migratory birds including piscivorous species such as the American white pelican (<i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchos</i>).

Greater than 85% of the pelican diet samples consisted of Utah sucker ardens</i>), 6% were Utah chub (<i>Gila atraria</i>) and 3% contained cutthroat trout. We estimated pelicans consumed \u00a3 2,600 individual cutthroat trout (~ 1% of population) in contrast to over 42,000 sucker, 19,000 chub, and > 6,000 crayfish. Bird-related mortality rate ranged 1 - 6% for PIT-tagged adult cutthroat trout and 4 - 16% for stocked subadult cutthroat trout. Pelicans primarily consume abundant non-game fish, thus any management action taken to control pelican predation would need to be carefully weighed against the benefits of non-game fish removal and the protected status of pelicans. | | Yirka, L.M., J.

Here we leverage an unprecedented landings time series from the Amazon, Earth's largest river basin, together with theoretical models to examine (i) taxonomic and trait-based signatures of exploitation in inland fish landings, and (ii) implications of changing biodiversity for fisheries resilience. We find multispecies exploitation typical of diverse inland fisheries results in a hump-shaped landings evenness curve. Along this trajectory, the sequential replacement of abundant and large species with faster growing and smaller species can maintain harvest for a period of time. But, continued biodiversity depletion reduces the pool of compensating species and consequently diminishes fisheries resilience. Importantly, higher biodiversity can delay fishery collapse. We conclude that a hump-shaped trajectory in landings evenness could characterize multispecies inland fisheries and aid in assessing their sustainability. | "}
