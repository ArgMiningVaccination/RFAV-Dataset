Full Spectrum Hemp Oil Full-spectrum hemp oil is a remedy that contains more than one cannabis plant extract. These extracts can include terpenes, essential oils, cannabinol, cannabidiol, and other cannabinoids. However, taking [ cannabidiol (CBD](https://www.healthline.com/health/your-cbd-guide)) for immune support will not get you high. Instead, it's used to help alleviate illness symptoms, aches and pains, and sleeplessness. While benefits have [ been observed](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319475%23effects), there is not enough research available yet to back up these observations conclusively. However, many herbalists swear by using cannabis or hemp oil for overall health and well-being. 2. Quercetin Forming part of the plant pigment group known as flavonoids, Quercetin is typically present in vegetables, fruit, grains, and nuts. When used in a supplement, it is more commonly [ extracted from the buds and dried flowers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1990793118080092) of the Japanese pagoda tree. The substance is said to have powerful antioxidant properties. This means it helps to balance free radicals, which have been noted to cause aging as well as various inflammation and other chronic health issues. It's an essential addition when you're taking herbs for immune system health. 3. Black Seed Oil Black seed oil has been used for decades in folk medicine. It is often used to boost weight loss and support brain health and conditions like asthma, high cholesterol, and skin irritations. These benefits and uses of the seed are detailed as far back as 1025 AD in [ The Canon of Medicine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Canon-of-Medicine) by Avicenna. It is also spoken about in other Ayurvedic chronicles.

Men should consume about 90 mg of vitamin C a day, and women should have 75 mg. It's best to get your daily dose directly from your diet, doctors will advise, but if you feel you need a boost, you can take vitamin C supplements as well. 7. Vitamin D Vitamin D [ plays various roles](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/%23:~:text=It%2520is%2520a%2520fat%252Dsoluble,control%2520infections%2520and%2520reduce%2520inflammation.) in the body when it comes to overall health and well-being.

The aromatic herb is excellent for [ digestion and blood circulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341159/). These two bodily functions are also at the core of healthy immune responses, so ginger is considered one of the best herbs for immune system health. Ginger contains shogaol and gingerol, which are strong compounds that stimulate blood circulation and provide overall benefits for the rest of the body. It is also very effective in preventing and alleviating the symptoms of colds and flu. You can find ginger in several manufactured immune-boosting herbal products. It's also delicious in its raw form. Try a steaming cup of ginger, lemon, and honey tea to treat a chill. Echinacea Also called purple coneflower, Echinacea is believed to be one of the most effective herbs for immunity and overall health. It forms part of the daisy family and is native to Europe and North America. It is an ancient remedy for overall well-being used by both Native Americans and Europeans. Like ginger, vitamin C, and vitamin D, it is also a powerful cold and flu preventative treatment and is still widely used for this purpose today. There are several species of Echinacea. Each variety acts on the body in different ways. There are also various ways of preparing the substance, impacting its activity. When the spring tops of the flowers are harvested, they are rich in [ polysaccharides](https://biologydictionary.net/polysaccharide/). These compounds help to support basic wellness. In the fall, they are rich in alkylamides. These compounds are what support foundational immune responses in the body. Oregano Oregano has been used since ancient Greek times and across Europe through the ages. It has been used for its perceived positive impact, especially on [ respiratory health](https://www.healthline.com/health/oregano-oil-for-cold), as well as overall health and well-being. Oregano preparations are often rich in thymol and carvacrol, which have highly effective respiratory support properties. As one of the most readily available immune-boosting herbs, oregano can be used in your cooking every day, or you can take it in a supplement form as part of your general well-being regime. You can get a highly concentrated oregano oil for extra support when you need it. Olive Leaf The properties of olive oil for antiaging and health support are widely drawn upon, but the leaf of the olive tree may also have powerful antioxidants. The Ancient Greeks and Egyptians used the olive tree for all kinds of health benefits. It was also revered as a symbol of peace, wisdom, and longevity in these ancient cultures. The olive tree typically grows in hot, unforgiving climates. The leaves are evergreen, and they produce antioxidants to help the plant cope with its harsh habitat. The leaves have also long been used to support overall immune health, as well as [ cardiovascular and glycemic well-being](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/505508), and stable body temperature. Grindelia Also frequently used by the Native Americans, Grindelia is said to be an excellent herb for supporting the respiratory system. It helps to soothe and repair issues in an [ irritated respiratory system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7848105/). The Grindelia flowers have a sticky sap, which is used to create syrups and other supplements to help alleviate any respiratory issues. It is still widely used today by modern herbalists and is one of the most well-known immune-boosting herbs. Goldenseal Goldenseal is one of the most iconic American herbs for immunity. It was also used commonly by the Native Americans in previous centuries. It was brought into mainstream culture by the eclectics during the 19th century when they learned about its properties from the Native Americans. The herb is believed to have several benefits for bodily health and is said to support the [ respiratory and gastrointestinal tract,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119334/) thus improving respiratory and digestive processes in the body. Goldenseal almost went extinct due to over-harvesting in the 1800s. Programs by the [ United Plant Savers](https://unitedplantsavers.org/) (UPS) have managed to stabilize Goldenseal populations in their natural habitats in the US. Still, it is best to limit the use of Goldenseal to times when you most need it. That is, if you have a respiratory irritation flare-up, for example. The herb is often combined with Echinacea, which forms a highly effective combination of herbs for immune system boosting. Maitake Maitake has an established history in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and ancient Japanese medicine. The mushroom's fruiting bodies have betaglucans, which are said to [ support overall well-being](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1534735412473642) at a cellular level and treat diseases such as cancer. Maitake grows perennially on hardwood, oak, and maple tree boughs and branches. Translated from Japanese, the plant is known as the \"dancing mushroom.\" The Japanese also call it the \"hen of the woods.\" It is quite palatable and thus is sought after for both its flavor and medicinal properties. Reishi Reishi has long been used in ancient Chinese medicine as a health-boosting tonic and adaptogen. It has formed part of China's medicinal tradition for over 2000 years. Reishi is known for promoting healthy responses to stress. It is also believed to balance and [ support the good health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/) of many of the body's organs and has been used to balance the cardiovascular system and support liver and respiratory health and function. The plant is still used for these purposes today, as it is rich in betaglucan polysaccharides and is highly effective as an immune support substance. The substance is also known as \"Ling Zhi\", which translates to \"spiritual mushroom\". In nature, the mushroom grows on hardwood tree branches and stumps. Luckily, Reishi is also very easy to cultivate and is thus one of the most sustainable herbs for immunity.
