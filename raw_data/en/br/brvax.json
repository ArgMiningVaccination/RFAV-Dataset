It's Simple When it comes to defining what is organic and what is natural, many of us find ourselves in a quandary. Even more confusing is the fact that we don't appear to know whether herbal or Ayurvedic is the same thing? And then what are natural products, exactly? Distinguishing between these product classes is not an easy task. As a result, you would be left with a lot of confusion because so many of the products and their meanings overlap with each other. Here's a look at how to simplify this to make it easier for you to understand the difference between natural, ayurvedic, organic, and herbal. Herbal The term \"herbal,\" which was first used between 1510 and 1520, derives from the Medieval Latin word herblis, which meant \"belonging to grass or herbs.\" Plant extracts such as roots, leaves, and many others are used to make herbal remedies that draw on the plants' intrinsic characteristics to create a medicine. In general, herbal products are utilised at home to treat various ailments. If a product has the label \"100% Herbal\" on it, this indicates that the product is made from plants or extracts of plants. Pesticides may be used to help plants thrive, but otherwise, it is chemical-free. Additionally, it can be utilised as a therapeutic aid to improve one's general well-being. In most cases, it is safe to use provided the specified doses are adhered to; nevertheless, in certain circumstances, it may be hazardous with other ingredients. Always consult an expert before going down this road. Since herbal items are made from plants and are used for their medicinal properties, the option of growing these plants chemically or organically in a natural environment is often explored. Ayurveda Ayurveda, a natural system of healing, originated in India over 3,000 years ago. Based on the three primary dosha types, Vata, Kapha, and Pitta, Ayurvedic medicine is able to identify a person's body type and personality to get them the correct course of treatment. It's one of the oldest [ holistic](https://nesarabynicky.com/blogs/news/holism-holistic-wellness-a-new-approach-to-a-healthy-life) (\"whole-body\") treatment modalities in the world. It is founded on the idea that health and wellness are dependent on a delicate balance of the mind, body, and spirit. Its primary objective is not the elimination of sickness but rather the promotion of healthy living. Treatments, on the other hand, can be tailored to address specific health issues. These products are made with diverse local botanicals and herbs. Ayurvedic products, on the other hand, also have heavy metals like sulphur, gold, silver, tin, copper, and mercury, and may even contain animal extracts in them. Is Ayurveda 100% natural and safe? There is no simple answer to this because Ayurvedic products may contain hazardous quantities of metals. Ayurvedic items can only be manufactured in India if the manufacturer has received an [ Ayush licence](https://ayush.gov.in/) from the Indian government. Organic [Organic products](https://nesarabynicky.com/blogs/news/a-3-step-easy-guide-to-transition-to-organic-skin-care-products), which are mostly farmed without the use of pesticides or chemicals, have become a popular choice for many consumers. The term \"Organic\" refers to a labelling requirement for any food or agricultural product that has been produced using approved techniques. These methods include any biological, cultural, and mechanical practises that aid in the restoration of ecological balance and the preservation of biodiversity. Also, when it comes to organic products, irradiation, synthetic fertilisers, and genetic engineering are not allowed. As a result, no genetically modified ingredients are included in organic products. If a product claims to be organic, it will never be subjected to animal testing unless it is mandated by law. To confirm that a product is truly organic, one should always check for product certifications. Generally, it is expected that any product labelled as organic has at least 70 percent organic ingredients. Natural A product labelled as Natural is primarily made out of plants, animal extracts, and everything else that isn't made in a lab. Even so, there may be traces of chemical fertilisers and pesticides that were used to change and improve the growth of some plants. When something is advertised as \"natural,\" it's usually because it doesn't contain any synthetic chemicals like artificial sweeteners, colourant additions, preservatives, or scent additives of any kind. It's always a good idea to double-check [ the ingredients on a product label](https://nesarabynicky.com/blogs/news/your-quick-glossary-of-common-skin-terminologies-natural-ingredients) before making a purchase of any kind. Natural products may only include one percent of natural components because there is no clear definition of what constitutes \"natural\". FAQs about Herbal, Ayurvedic, Organic and Natural Skincare Is natural and organic skincare the same thing? When it comes to skincare, natural and organic are not interchangeable terms. The term \"natural\" refers to products that contain substances found in nature, such as plants and minerals. Plant-based ingredients are also used in organic products; however, unlike \"Natural,\" organic ingredients are farmed without pesticides or synthetic fertiliser. Nevertheless, you should always confirm that the organic items you purchase are [ certified](https://nesarabynicky.com/pages/the-certifications). Are organic and herbal skincare products the same? No. Organic and herbal skincare products are also derived from plants, but they differ in two important ways. Firstly, organic materials are grown without the use of toxic pesticides and fertilisers, whereas herbal substances may include these contaminants. Secondly, organic products have to meet a number of purity standards set by the [ government](https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/organic/organic_contents/national_programme_for_organic_production.htm), while herbal products do not. Is there a difference between natural and Ayurvedic skincare? Yes! Plants and minerals are used to make natural beauty products. They can help to improve the texture and appearance of your skin. Ayurveda, on the other hand, is India's traditional medical system. As an alternative type of treatment, and has the potential to treat a wide variety of illnesses and common skin conditions. Are organic and Ayurvedic skincare the same? Everyone assumed that anything labelled \"ayurvedic\" also had to be \"organic,\" but this isn't the case. Ayurvedic skincare products contain formulations influenced by ayurvedic scriptures, whereas [ organic skincare products](https://nesarabynicky.com/collections/all) have ingredients manufactured from certified sustainable production. The advantages of each of these vary depending on the customers' requirements. Someone who feels the urge to discipline their life with the good old Indian way of life can benefit from an ayurvedic product. Whereas, organic products are great for persons with extremely sensitive skin, as well as those who want to take an environmentally responsible approach that will benefit not only themselves but also those around them. The narrow line between Ayurveda and organic products can be eliminated if we all become eco-conscious and practise some discipline in our lives by adopting ayurvedic inspired products created in an organic way. Takeaway Unless they contain hazardous chemical additives, all forms of nature-based products are good. As a result, it's always a good idea to examine the ingredient list on labels and confirm that the product you're using is chemical-free. Furthermore, certification by an established regulatory authority that guarantees its purity is essential. Remember, every skin and body type reacts differently to a specific product. As a result, each person's experience with it will be unique. The easiest way to find what works best for you is to try and test them and choose what suits you best. "}
