A 25-page limit was specified for the Program Narrative. The correct number is 30 pages. This change has been made. U.S. Department of Justice OMB No. 1121-0329 Office of Justice Programs National Institute of Justice The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is pleased to announce that it is seeking applications for research on illegal prescription drug markets to examine the utility of policies, practices, and resources available to law enforcement for major crime deterrence, prosecution, and other market intervention measures. This solicitation has two objectives: policy analysis of criminal diversion of prescription medication laws, and Prescription Dr ug Monitoring Program optimization for law enforcement. This project furthers the Department's mission by supporting research on alcohol and other drugs in the context of the criminal justice system to promote effective law enforcement, court, and corrections responses to illegal drug markets, and criminal behavior related to illicit drug use. Research on Illegal Prescription Drug Market Interventions Eligibility In general, NIJ is authorized to make grants to, or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with, States (including territories), units of local government (including federally- recognized Indian tribal governments as determined by the Secretary of the Interior), nonprofit and for-profit organizations (including tribal nonprofit or for-profit organizations), institutions of higher education (including tribal institutions of higher education), and certain qualified individuals. For-profit organizations must agree to forgo any profit or management fee. Foreign governments, foreign organizations, and foreign institutions of higher education are not eligible to apply. Deadline Applicants must register with Grants.gov prior to submitting an application. (See \"How to Apply,\" page 8.) All applications are due by 11:59 p.m. on May 17, 2012.

In June 2010, Congress launched a bi-partisan Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse to raise awareness of abuse and to work toward innovative and effective policy solutions incorporating treatment, prevention, law enforcement, and research. The U.S. General Accounting Office testified before Congress in October 2011 on prescription drug abuse, estimating more than $148 million in Medicare fraud. 2 The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) responded to this emerging threat with the 2011 Prescription Drug Plan, which proposes reductions in prescription drug abuse through education, monitoring, proper disposal, and enforcement. Under enforcement, ONDCP recommends the Bureau of Justice Assistance's (BJA's) Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), which supports State-level education, legislation, prescription monitoring, and interstate information sharing. PDMPs are now operational in 35 States and in planning in 13 additional States. Drug prescribers, dispensers, and law enforcement use the information to identify prescription drug diversion and interdict illegal drug market activity. For more information on BJA's PDMP, visit www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/grant/prescripdrugs.html . ONDCP's Plan identifies NIJ as an agency that will further program goals by encouraging research on PDMP to determine current effectiveness and identify ways to improve effectiveness. This is consistent with the U.S. Department of Justice's Strategic Plan 2012-2016 to combat the threat, trafficking, and use of ill egal drugs and diversion of licit drugs. This NIJ solicitation seeks applications to research illegal prescription drug markets under two objectives: (1) policy analysis of criminal diversion of prescription medication laws, and (2) PDMP optimization for law enforcement. Authorizing Legislation: Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (sections 201 and 202); Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2012. Deadlines: Registration and Application Applicants must register with Grants.gov prior to submitting an application. OJP encourages applicants to register several weeks before the application submission deadline. The deadline to apply for funding under this announcement is 11:59 p.m. eastern time on May 17, 2012. See the \"How to Apply\" section on page 8 for details. 1 See presentation on trends in nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals at www.nij.gov/topics/drugs/marke ts/adam/crane-presentation.pdf . 2 See report on Medicare Part D: Instances of Questionable Access to Prescription Drugs at www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-104T . NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 4 Eligibility Refer to the title page for eligibility under this program. Project-Specific Information NIJ's drugs and crime portfolio supports research on alcohol and other drugs in the context of the criminal justice system to promote e ffective law enforcement, court, and corrections responses to illegal drug markets and criminal behavior related to illicit drug use. This project falls under the market disruption area of NIJ's portfolio, which funds research to identify and evaluate strategies to disrupt drug markets at different levels and by type of market (see www.nij.gov/nij/topics/drugs/welcome.htm for more information). The focus of this project is on illegal prescription drug markets to examine the utility of policies, practices, and resources available to law enforcement for major crime deterrence, prosecution, and other market intervention measures. Specifically, this soli citation has two objectives: policy analysis of criminal diversion of prescription medication laws, and PDMP optimization for law enforcement. Policy Analysis of Criminal Divers ion of Prescription Medication Laws Up to $1 million is available to fund up to four awards under this objective. Requests for single jurisdiction studies may not exceed $250,000, and multisite studies may not exceed $500,000. NIJ seeks applications to study federal and State criminal diversion of prescription medication laws that establish definitions and punishments intended to target \"rogue pain clinics,\" illegal Internet pharmacies, drug theft, illicit pre scribing by physicians, and doctor shopping. The broad question is whether these laws are effective in supporting the activities of law enforcement, including prosecutors and task forces. As demonstrated by NIJ's grant to study methamphetamine precursor chemical laws and regulations, 3 one needs to examine the interpretation and implementation of these drug laws to assess their deterrent and prosecution potential. The policy analysis may assess any relevant law and/or regulation in any jurisdiction(s). It must examine both quantitative information on criminal case trends and qualitative information on policy implementation and case investigation. The examination of actual cases, such as before and after recent policy change, is valuable, but NIJ recognizes the need to protect specific information pertaining to open investigations. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDM P) Optimization fo r Law Enforcement Up to $1 million is available to fund up to four awards under this objective. Requests for single jurisdiction studies may not exceed $250,000, and multisite studies may not exceed $500,000. NIJ seeks applications to examine the utility of PDMP information to law enforcement, including prosecutors and task forces, and how States can optimize the quality and flow of this sensitive information. Given the investigative and prosecut ion functions of law enforcement, what is the most useful information in terms of variables collected, data quality and freshness, and reporting formats? How is information used to achieve shor t-term (e.g., case building) and long-term (e.g., case disposition) outcomes? In consideration of protecting health record security, what are the 3 For more information on Controlling Methamphetam ine Precursors: From Po licy to Practice, see . NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 5 most efficient methods to promote appropriate information access, storage, and sharing by authorized law enforcement representatives? The proposed project may focus on any State(s) and must include: a needs assessment; a review of extant PDMP data structure; protocols for law enforcement access; development of clear recommendations for data and protocol modifications; and a comparison evaluating recommended modifications versus extant data and protocols. Additional Project Goals, Objectives and Deliverables In their applications, researchers must: State research questions that correspond clearly to proposed methods, data collection, analysis, and report plans. Detail how qualitative and quantitative research methods will be applied, and how the collected information will be compiled and analyzed. Describe potential data resources, and how those will be assessed to address potential validity and reliability concerns. Attach letters of commitment from each of the sites proposed, indicating consent to participate in this research project and to allow access to relevant information resources. Attach a project timeline of no more than 24 months, beginning January 2013 and including data and written deliverables 90 days prior to the grant end date, and a briefing in the final month. Amount and Length of Awards NIJ anticipates that up to a total of $2 million may become available for up to eight awards made through this solicitation. All awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and to any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law. Please note: All applicants under this solicitation must comply with Department of Justice regulations on confidentiality and human subjects' protection. See \"Other Requirements for OJP Applications\" at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/funding/other_requirements.htm . What will not be funded: 1. Provision of training or direct service. 2. Proposals primarily to purchase equipment, materials, or supplies. (The budget may include these items if they are necessary to conduc t applied research, development, demonstration, evaluation, or analysis.) 3. Work that will be funded under another specific solicitation. 4. Proposals that do not contain a research component or do not respond to the specific goals of this solicitation. Budget Information Limitation on Use of Award Funds for Employee Compensation; Waiver With respect to any award of more than $250,000 made under this solicitation, federal funds may not be used to pay total cash compensation (salary plus bonuses) to any employee of the award recipient at a rate that exceeds 110% of the maximum annual salary payable to a member of the Federal Government's Senior Executive Service (SES) at an agency with a NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 6 Certified SES Performance Appraisal System for that year. The 2012 salary table for SES employees is available at www.opm.gov/oca/12tables/indexSES.asp . Note: A recipient may compensate an employee at a higher rate, provided the amount in excess of this compensation limitation is paid with non-federal funds. (Any such additional compensation will not be considered matching funds where match requirements apply.) The limitation on compensation rates allowable under an award may be waived on an individual basis at the discretion of the Director of the National Institute of Justice. An applicant requesting a waiver should include a detailed justification in the budget narrative of its application. Unless the applicant submits a waiver request and justification with the application, the applicant should anticipate that OJP will request the applicant to adjust and resubmit its budget. The justification should include the particular qualifications and expertise of the individual, the uniqueness of the service being provided, the indivi dual's specific knowledge of the program or project being undertaken with award funds, and a statement explaining that the individual's salary is commensurate with the regular and customary rate for an individual with his/her qualifications and expertise, and for the work to be done. Minimization of Conference Costs No OJP funding can be used to purchase food and/or beverages for any meeting, conference, training, or other event. Exceptions to this restriction may be made only in cases where such sustenance is not otherwise available (i.e., extremely remote areas), or where a special presentation at a conference requires a plenary address where there is no other time for sustenance to be obtained. Such an exception would require prior approval from OJP. This restriction does not apply to water provided at no cost, but does apply to any and all other refreshments, regardless of the size or nature of the meeting. Additionally, this restriction does not impact direct payment of per diem amounts to individuals in a travel status under the organization's travel policy. Updated Department of Justice and OJP guidance on conference planning, minimization of costs, and conference cost reporting will be forthcoming and will be accessible on the OJP website at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/funding/funding.htm . Costs Associated with Language Assistance (if applicable) If an applicant proposes a program or activity that would deliver services or benefits to individuals, the costs of taking reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to those services or benefits by individuals with limited English proficiency may be allowable costs. Reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to services or benefits may include interpretation or translation services where appropriate.

Acquire a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. In general, the Office of Management and Budget requires that all applicants (other than individuals) for federal funds include a DUNS number in their applications for a new award or renewal of an existing award. A DUNS number is a unique nine-digit sequence recognized as the universal standard for identifying and keeping track of entities receiving federal funds. The identifier is used for tracking purposes and to validate address and point of contact information for federal assistance applicants, recipients, and subrecipients. The DUNS number will be used throughout the grant life cycl e. Obtaining a DUNS number is a free, one-time activity. Obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 866-705-5711 or by applying online at www.dnb.com . A DUNS number is usually received within 1-2 business days. 2. Acquire or renew registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. OJP requires that all applicants (other than individuals) for federal financial assistance maintain current registrations in the CCR database. An applicant must be registered in the CCR to successfully register in Grants.gov. The CCR database is the repository for standard information about federal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and subrecipients. Organizations that have previously submitted applications via Grants.gov are already registered with CCR, as it is a requirement for Grants.gov registration. Note, however, that applicants must update or renew their CCR registration annually to maintain an active status. Information about CCR registration procedures can be accessed at www.ccr.gov . 3. Acquire an Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) and a Grants.gov username and password . Complete the AOR profile on Grants.gov and create a username and password. The applicant organization's DUNS number must be used to complete this step. For more information about the registration process, go to www.grants.gov/applicants/get_registered.jsp . 4. Acquire confirmation for the AOR from the E-Business Point of Contact (E-Biz POC). The E-Biz POC at the applicant organization must log into Grants.gov to confirm the applicant organization's AOR. Note that there can be more than one AOR for the organization. 5. Search for the funding opportunity on Grants.gov.

Data archiving plan (see descriptive paragraph below). Data Archiving Plan: Applications for NIJ research funding must include a brief plan to comply with data archiving requirements. The plan should be one or two pages in length and include a description of the proposed data management and archiving process including confidentiality protections and level of effort associated with meeting archiving requirements. Associated tasks should be reflected in the proposed project budget and budget narrative sections of the application. In most instances, NIJ requires that data resulting from funded research be submitted as grant products or deliverables for archiving with t he National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) ( www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/archive.jsp ). The purpose of the Data Archiving Plan is to demonstrate recognition by applicants that data sets resulting from the proposed research are required to be submitted as grant products for archiving according to special grant conditions. Along with other grant products, special conditions require that all research data be submitted 90 days before the end of the project period. Some amount of grant award funds are typically withheld for submissi on of research data along with the final report and other products/deliverables. The plan should be submitted as an appendix labeled, \"Data Archiving Plan.\" The number of pages used for the plan will not count against the narrative page limit. The plan should provide brief details about the proposed archiving process including submission of these files: qualitative and quantitative data, final technical reports, instrumentation and data collection forms, and the privacy certificate and informed consent protocols including protections for confidentiality (where applicable). The focus of the Data Archiving Plan is to describe how the grant data products will be prepared and documented so as to allow reproduction of the project's findings as well as future research that can extend the scientific value of the original project (See: www.icpsr.umich.edu/files/ICPSR/access/dataprep.pdf ). Specifically, the Data Archiving Plan includes: Information regarding data formats (quantit ative/qualitative/spatial) and software with which data will be collected, entered into a database, stored, analyzed and transferred. Standard commercial software or software typically acceptable to NACJD should be identified for use in the proposed data collection (www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/archiving/deposit-nij-data.jsp ). A description of procedures by which the applicant plans to collect data along with anticipated units of analysis (e.g., individuals, locations), level of analysis and other NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 13 identifiers for each data file that will be submitted upon completion of the funded research.

Contact information for the Principal Investigator in the event other researchers should need more information about the study or the data. 3. Budget Detail Worksheet and Budget Narrative a. Budget Detail Worksheet A sample Budget Detail Worksheet can be found at www.ojp.gov/funding/forms/budget_detail.pdf . If the budget is submitted in a different format, the budget categories listed in the sample budget worksheet should be included. For questions pertaining to budget and examples of allowable and unallowable costs, see the OJP Financial Guide at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/financialguide/index.htm . b. Budget Narrative The Budget Narrative should thoroughly and clearly describe every category of expense listed in the Budget Detail Worksheet. Proposed budgets are expected to be complete; reasonable and allowable; cost effective; and necessary for project activities. The narrative should be mathematically sound and correspond with the information and figures provided in the Budget Detail Worksheet. The narrative should explain how all costs were estimated and calculated and how they are relevant to the completion of the proposed project. The narrative may include tables for clarification purposes but need not be in a spreadsheet format. As with the Budget Detail Worksheet, the Budget Narrative should be broken down by year. NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 14 Cofunding: A grant made by NIJ under this solicitation may account for up to 100 percent of the total cost of the project. The application should indicate whether it is feasible for the applicant to contribute cash, facilities, or services as non-Federal support for the project. The application should identify generally any such contributions that the applicant expects to make and the proposed budget should indicate in detail which items, if any, will be supported with non-Federal contributions. If a successful application proposes a voluntary match amount, the match amount incorporated into the OJP-approved budget becomes mandatory and subject to audit. 4. Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (if applicable) Indirect costs are allowed only if the applicant has a federally approved indirect cost rate. (This requirement does not apply to units of local government.) A copy of the rate approval should be attached. If the applicant does not have an approved rate, one can be requested by contacting the applicant's cognizant Federal agency, which will review all documentation and approve a rate for the applicant organization or, if the applicant's accounting system permits, costs may be allocated in the direct cost categories. If DOJ is the cognizant Federal agency, obtain information needed to submit an indirect cost rate proposal at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/funding/pdfs/indirect_costs.pdf . 5. Tribal Authorizing Resolution (if applicable) If an application is being submitted by either (1) a tribe or tribal organization or (2) a third party proposing to provide direct services or assistance to residents on tribal lands, then a current authorizing resolution of the governing body of the tribal entity or other enactment of the tribal council or comparabl e governing body authorizing the inclusion of the tribe or tribal organization and its membership should be included with the application. In those instances when an organization or consortium of tribes proposes to apply for a grant on behalf of a tribe or multiple specific tribes, then the application should include a resolution (or comparable legal documentation, as may be applicable) from all tribes that will be included as a part of the services/assistance provided under the grant. A consortium of tribes for which existing consortium bylaws allow action without support from all tribes in the consortium (i.e., without authorizing resolution or other enactment of each tribal governing body) may submit a copy of its consortium bylaws with the application in lieu of tribal resolutions (or comparable legal documentation). 6. Other Standard Forms Additional forms that may be required in connection with an award are available on OJP's funding page at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/funding/forms.htm . For successful applicants, receipt of funds may be contingent upon submission of all necessary forms. Note in particular the following forms. a. Standard Assurances Applicants must read, certify, and submit this form in GMS prior to the receipt of any award funds. b. Certifications Regarding Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters; and Drug-Free Workplace Requirements NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 15 Applicants must read, certify, and submit in GMS prior to the receipt of any award funds. c.

Affordability and cost-effectiveness of proposed products, when applicable (e.g., purchase price and maintenance costs for a new technology or cost of training to use the technology). Relevance of the project for policy and practice in the United States Higher quality applications clearly explain the practical implications of the project. They connect technical expertise with criminal justice policy and practice. To ensure that the project has strong relevance for policy and practice, some researchers and technologists collaborate with practitioners and policymakers. The application may include letters showing NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 16 support from practitioners, but they carry less weight than clear evidence of the applicant's understanding of how policymakers and practitioners can best use and benefit from the proposed work. While a partnership may affect State or local activities, it should also have broader implications for other communities nationwide. Dissemination Strategy \u201410% 1. Well-defined plan for the grant recipient to disseminate results to appropriate audiences, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. 2. Suggestions for print and electronic products that NIJ should consider developing for practitioners and policymakers. 3. If applicable, a clear strategy leading to the adoption into practice of any equipment or software. Research Independence and Integrity Regardless of a proposal's rating under the criteria outlined above, in order to receive funds, the applicant's proposal must demonstrate research independence, including appropriate safeguards to ensure research objectivity and integrity. For purposes of this solicitation, research independence and integrity pertains only to ensuring that the design, conduct, or reporting of research funded by NIJ grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts will not be biased by any financial interest on the part of the investigators responsible for the research or on the part of the applicant. In the appendix dealing with research independence and integrity, the applicant must explain the process and procedures that the applicant has put in place to identify and manage potential financial conflicts of interest on the part of its staff, consultants, and/or subrecipients. It must also identify any potential organizational financial conflicts of interest on the part of the applicant with regard to the proposed research. If the applicant believes that there are no potential organizational financial conflicts of interest, the applicant must provide a brief narrative explanation of why it believes that to be the case. Where potential organizational financial conflicts of interest exist, in the appendix the applicant must identify the safeguards the applicant has put in place to address those conflicts of interest. Considerations in evaluating research independence and integrity will include, but may not be limited to, the adequacy of the applicant's efforts to identify factors that could affect the objectivity/integrity of the proposed staff and/or the organization in carrying out the research, development, or evaluation activity; and the adequacy of the applicant's existing or proposed remedies to control any such factors. Review Process OJP is committed to ensuring a fair and open process for awarding grants. NIJ reviews the application to make sure that the information presented is reasonable, understandable, measurable, and achievable, as well as consistent with the solicitation. Peer reviewers will review the applications submitted under this solicitation that meet basic minimum requirements. NIJ may use either internal peer reviewers, external peer reviewers, or a combination, to review the applications under this solicitation. An external peer reviewer is an NIJ-2012-3094 OMB No. 1121-0329 Approval Expires 02/28/2013 17 expert in the subject matter of a given solicit ation who is NOT a current DOJ employee. An internal reviewer is a current DOJ employee who is well-versed or has expertise in the subject matter of this solicitation. Applications that meet basic minimum requirements will be evaluated, scored, and rated by a peer review panel. Peer reviewers' ratings and any resulting recommendations are advisory only. In addition to peer review ratings, considerations for award recommendations and decisions may include, but are not limited to, underserved populations, geographic diversity, strategic priorities, past performance, and available funding. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), in consultation with NIJ, conducts a financial review of applications for potential discretionary awards to evaluate the fiscal integrity and financial capability of applicants; examines proposed costs to determine if the Budget Detail Worksheet and Budget Narrative accurately explain project costs; and determines whether costs are reasonable, necessary, and allowable under applicable federal cost principles and agency regulations. All final award decisions will be made by the Director of the National Institute of Justice, who also may give consideration to factors including, but not limited to, underserved populations, geographic diversity, strategic priorities, past performance, and available funding when making awards. Additional Requirements Applicants selected for awards must agree to comply with additional legal requirements upon acceptance of an award. OJP strongly encourages applicants to review the information pertaining to these additional requirements prior to submitting an application.
