During our time together we will celebrate Beltane with Sacred Cacao, ancient stories, rituals, and a soul journey. Beltane honors Life. It represents the peak of Spring and the beginning of Summer. Earth energies are at their strongest and most active. All of life is bursting with potent fertility. And so, ask what is bursting in you? A Cacao Ceremony is an opportunity to connect to yourself and open your heart. Because of cacao's ability to increase your connection to your inner self and your heart, it will support you in any transformational shift you are working towards. Whatever your path, the intention is yours to set, and the cacao allows you to the insight and awareness to move towards that goal. Jim Wert will share some profound stories with you. Stories have the power to change the world and change us. The art of storytelling has been a key part of human culture as far back as we know. Christel's guided Soul Journeys offer an opportunity to meet a guide or an ancestor, a power animal or the Cacao Deva. You will be gently held in this experience as you allow your Soul to gently speak to you. Get ready for a one of a kind experience and let your heart open wide.
