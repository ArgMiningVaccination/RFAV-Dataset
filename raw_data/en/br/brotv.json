In order to rule against Pfizer (PFE), the vaccine maker in the case, and find in favor of those who believe -- wrongly -- that [vaccines cause autism](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10997&page=1), the justices will literally have to ignore the facts in front of them. Nonetheless, that is what they might do. [The Associated Press reported](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iyPneKLMVfnZgpbuLsKZM-luzJEwD9IQAPB00?docId=D9IQAPB00): Several justices appeared sympathetic to the parents' claims. [Justice Sonia Sotomayor was one who offered hope](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101012-711625.html)for the Bruesewitz family, whose daughter Hannah Bruesewitz became autistic after she was injected with diphtheria\u00e2\u20ac\"pertussis\u00e2\u20ac\"tetanus vaccine: Justice Sonia Sotomayor was particularly vocal in questioning whether vaccine makers would have a motivation to look for safer vaccines if they faced no threat from lawsuits.Chief Justice [John Roberts -- a former Pfizer shareholder -- was on the other side](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-12/vaccine-makers-get-mixed-reception-from-u-s-justices-over-injury-lawsuits.html), noting that if every parent who claims their child's autism was caused by vaccines could sue then the companies that make them would go out of business and leave America without any protection from diseases eradicated long ago: \"It doesn't take too many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the other side of your calculus,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said to the lawyer representing the parents.That threat is real. Irrational fear of vaccines has already led to a [resurgence of whooping cough](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/10/11/whooping-cough-epidemic-blame-the-anti-vaccination-movement/?partner=yahootix)in California and Michigan that has sickened nearly 6,000 children and killed nine babies. As Bloomberg's story points out, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz have not proved that Pfizer's vaccine caused Hannah's problems. Rather, they argue that Wyeth -- the company that made the vaccine, later acquired by Pfizer -- could have made a safer product. Unfortunately for the Bruesewitzes, [there's a hole in that argument](http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/supremes-hear-debate-over-vaccine-court/2010-10-12): Wyeth (now owned by Pfizer) says that's not so, because the newer version wasn't FDA-approved for years afterward.Vaccine cases don't go to regular court the way other drug injury cases do because of a historic compromise between those who believe vaccines make children ill and the companies that make the inoculations. In that compromise, a special federal vaccine court was set up. If your child has one of the symptoms on the court's list, you can get compensation without having to prove that the vaccine actually caused the damage. If the symptoms are not on the list, you have to prove the vaccine caused the injury. As this [recent ruling](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-5004.pdf) shows, the evidence being brought in these cases is thin stuff. The plaintiffs argued: ... testing done by Unigenetics Ltd. Laboratory in Dublin, Ireland (\"Unigenetics\") that reported successful use of the polymerase chain reaction technique (\"PCR\") to identify and amplify measles virus genetic material from the blood and intestinal tissue of autistic children who had received the MMR vaccine, including Michelle Cedillo.Sounds pretty good except, as the ruling later points out, other labs failed to replicate Unigenetics' results -- a sure sign that something was wrong. A defense expert testifed that Unigenetics was in fact incompetent: He testified to problems with the laboratory notebooks, which, in his view, had been improperly altered after the fact, in perhaps, a fraudulent manner. He observed that the laboratory was not accredited, declined to participate in a quality control program, and that no independent assessment of the laboratory's work was ever performed. He also noted that on two occasions, not involving Michelle Cedillo, technicians failed to perform a necessary step in the protocol, yet still reported positive results -- an impossible result which can only be explained by contamination.The Bruesewitz case hinges on [a complicated piece of law](http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/why-the-supreme-court-could-side-with-autism-activists-in-fight-vs-vaccines/5975), and the court is conservative, so it may indeed go their way. If it does, federal trial judges will have their work cut out for them, applying a law that insists the facts are irrelevent.
