Revised: Jun/24/2021 4 Administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly. CONTRAINDICATION Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescribing Information) . WARNINGS Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine . Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html ). Myocarditis and Pericarditis Reports of adverse events following use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine under EUA suggest increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly following the second dose. Typically, onset of symptoms has been within a few days following receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms, but information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. The decision to administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to an individual with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis should take into account the individual's clinical circumstances. The CDC has published clinical considerations relevant to myocarditis and pericarditis associated with administration of the ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html ). Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions reported in a clinical trial following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, axillary swelling/tenderness, fever, swelling at the injection site, and erythema at the injection site. (See Full EUA Prescribing Information) Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Revised: Jun/24/2021 5 Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.

To the extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to ModernaTX, Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS and ModernaTX, Inc. In clinical studies, the adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older were pain at the injection site (92.0%), fatigue site (14.7%), and erythema at the injection site (10.0%). Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overall, 15,419 participants aged 18 years and older received at least one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in three clinical trials (NCT04283461, NCT04405076, and NCT04470427). The safety of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351 participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age and older. Overall, 52.7% were male, 47.3% were female, 20.5% were Hispanic or Latino, 79.2% were White, 10.2% were African American, 4.6% were Asian, 0.8% were American Indian or Alaska Native, Revised: Jun/24/2021 13 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 2.1% were other races, and 2.1% were Multiracial. Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Solicited Adverse Reactions Data on solicited local and systemic adverse reactions and use of antipyretic medication were collected in an electronic diary for 7 days following each injection (i.e., day of vaccination and the next 6 days) among participants receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=15,179) and participants receiving placebo (n=15,163) with at least 1 documented dose.

Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported following administration of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine had a median duration of 1 to 3 days. Grade 3 solicited local adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. Solicited systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported by vaccine recipients after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. Unsolicited Adverse Events Participants were monitored for unsolicited adverse events for up to 28 days following each dose and follow-up is ongoing. Serious adverse events and medically attended adverse events will be recorded for the entire study duration of 2 years. As of November 25, 2020, among participants who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (vaccine=15,185, placebo=15,166), unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 23.9% of participants (n=3,632) who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 21.6% of participants (n=3,277) who received placebo. In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Lymphadenopathy-related events that were not necessarily captured in the 7-day e-diary were Revised: Jun/24/2021 17 reported by 1.1% of vaccine recipients and 0.6% of placebo recipients. These events included lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, lymph node pain, vaccination-site lymphadenopathy, injection-site lymphadenopathy, and axillary mass, which were plausibly related to vaccination. This imbalance is consistent with the imbalance observed for solicited axillary swelling/tenderness in the injected arm. Hypersensitivity adverse events were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection site urticaria, which are likely related to vaccination. Delayed injection site reactions that began >7 days after vaccination were reported in 1.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo recipients. Delayed injection site reactions included pain, erythema, and swelling and are likely related to vaccination. Throughout the same period, there were three reports of Bell's palsy in the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine group (one of which was a serious adverse event), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group which occurred 17 days after vaccination. Currently available information on Bell's palsy is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of adverse events (including other neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious Adverse Events As of November 25, 2020, serious adverse events were reported by 1.0% (n=147) of participants who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 1.0% (n=153) of participants who received placebo, one of which was the case of Bell's palsy which occurred 32 days following receipt of vaccine. In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2, and the median follow-up time for all participants was 9 weeks after Dose 2. There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination. There was one serious adverse event of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior history of severe headache and nausea requiring hospitalization. This event occurred 1 day after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination. There were no other notable patterns or imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Revised: Jun/24/2021 18 6.2 Post-Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis 8 REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS See Overall Safety Summary (Section 6) for additional information.

Email Revised: Jun/24/2021 20 10 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with other vaccines. 11 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 11.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy. Women who are vaccinated with Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the registry by calling 1-866- MODERNA (1-866-663-3762). Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine- associated risks in pregnancy. In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (100 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or postnatal development were reported in the study. 11.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 11.3 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been assessed in persons less than 18 years of age. Emergency Use Authorization of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than 18 years of age. 11.4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine included participants 65 years of age and older receiving vaccine or placebo, and their data contribute to the overall assessment of safety and Revised: Jun/24/2021 21 efficacy. In an ongoing Phase 3 clinical study, 24.8% (n=7,520) of participants were 65 years of age and older and 4.6% (n=1,399) of participants were 75 years of age and older. Vaccine efficacy in participants 65 years of age and older was 86.4% (95% CI 61.4, 95.2) compared to 95.6% (95% CI 90.6, 97.9) in participants 18 to <65 years of age [see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18)] . Overall, there were no notable differences in the safety profiles observed in participants 65 years of age and older and younger participants [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1)] . 13 DESCRIPTION Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is provided as a white to off-white suspension for intramuscular injection. Each 0.5 mL dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains 100 mcg of nucleoside- modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: a total lipid content of 1.93 mg (SM-102, polyethylene mg tromethamine hydrochloride, 0.043 mg acetic acid, 0.20 mg sodium acetate trihydrate, and 43.5 mg sucrose. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. 14 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 14.1 Mechanism of Action The nucleoside-modified mRNA in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19. 18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA A Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in participants 18 years of age and older is ongoing in the United States (NCT04470427). Randomization was stratified by age and health risk: 18 to <65 years of age without comorbidities (not at risk for progression to severe COVID-19), 18 to <65 years of age with comorbidities (at risk for progression to severe COVID-19), and 65 years of age and older with or without comorbidities. Participants who were immunocompromised and those with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. Participants with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but with positive laboratory results indicative of infection at study entry were included. The study allowed for the inclusion of participants with stable pre-existing medical conditions, defined as disease not Revised: Jun/24/2021 22 requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 3 months before enrollment, as well as participants with stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A total of 30,420 participants were randomized equally to receive 2 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine or saline placebo 1 month apart. Participants will be followed for efficacy and safety until 24 months after the second dose. The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Set) included 28,207 participants who received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073), and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. In the Per- Protocol Set, 47.4% were female, 19.7% were Hispanic or Latino; 79.5% were White, 9.7% were African American, 4.6% were Asian, and 2.1% other races. The median age of participants was 53 years (range 18-95) and 25.3% of participants were 65 years of age and older. Of the study participants in the Per-Protocol Set, 18.5% were at increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to at least one pre-existing medical condition (chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or HIV infection) regardless of age. Between participants who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions. Efficacy Against COVID-19 COVID-19 was defined based on the following criteria: The participant must have experienced at least two of the foll owing systemic symptoms: fever (38\u00baC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s); or the participant must have experienced at least one of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia; and the participant must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized) positive for SARS- CoV-2 by RT-PCR. COVID-19 cases were adjudicated by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. The median length of follow up for efficacy for participants in the study was 9 weeks post Dose 2. There were 11 COVID-19 cases in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine group and 185 cases in the placebo group, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.1% (95% confidence interval of 89.3% to 96.8%).
