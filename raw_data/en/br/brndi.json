All of the programs offered at SWIHA are designed to prepare students to begin in entry-level positions in their chosen Holistic Healthcare fields. Lifelong learning is modeled and encouraged through our various choices of continuing education classes.

We believe we are spiritual beings having a human experience. While we do not subscribe to or endorse any particular dogma or doctrine, we openly acknowledge the divine presence in our lives. We embrace prayer, mediation, divine inspiration, intuition and the great mystery of life.

Shortly thereafter, SWIM sought to offer a career-training program in massage therapy and was granted licensure by the Arizona State Board of Post-Secondary Education in May 1993. The focus of the program at that time was on classic Swedish massage and a deep therapeutic modality known as Myotherapy . Myotherapy was the flagship program. Inspired by a passion for highly intuitive, deep rehabilitative work, KC Miller soon initiated and designed an entire Massage Therapy Program. The name of the school was changed in May 1996 to Southwest Institute of Healing Arts (SWIHA) to more accurately reflect the wide variety of Holistic Health and Wellness careers offered at the college. To increase the high standards of the school, SWIHA was granted accreditation by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education & Training (ACCET) in August 2003. Life Coaching, Hypnotherapy, and Polarity Life coaching, Hypnotherapy, and Polarity are staple SWIHA courses. Life Coaching Foundations is included as a general education course in our Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare as well as a part of some of our diplomas. Life Coaching is an ongoing partnership that helps people produce fulfilling results in their personal, professional, and spiritual lives. Through the process of coaching, clients deepen their learning, improve their performance, and enhance their quality of life. Students come to change their own lives or learn to assist others in their transformation. SWIHA is one of the only educational institutions to offer a residential Hypnotherapy training program. The science of hypnotherapy is the actualization of the mind-body connection, a foundational concept at SWIHA. The hypnotherapy program is designed to prepare the student for a private practice in hypnotherapy; however many students complete this program as a core specialty track in one of our larger programs. Other students complete the hypnotherapy program to enhance personal growth, to improve their self-understanding and communication skills. Graduates are eligible to join the American Board of Hypnotherapy. Polarity Therapy Polarity Therapy has been an integral part of the SWIHA curriculum since 1993. Polarity is a natural healing system combining the wisdom of the ancients with discoveries of quantum physics and weaves them into tools for ultimate health. Polarity asserts that the key to vitality and consciousness lays in our vibrational-state, the fundamental frequency of our energy. Polarity is designed as a four-fold system, which includes hands-on bodywork, exercise/stretching postures, and an energetic approach to nutrition/cleansing and communication skills. After completion of the Associate Polarity Practitioner (APP) or Registered Polarity Practitioner (RPP), an application may be made to the American Polarity Therapy Association for national certification. Yoga Blending the highest intentions of Eastern and Western philosophy and practice, our life-changing and career- elevating programs guide students through a deep exportation of the roots, practice and development of yoga as a path to self-realization. Our programs, including the 200 & 600-hour Yoga Teacher Training and the 800-hour Yoga Teacher Training / Yoga Therapist programs allow successful graduates to become registered as Yoga teachers through the internationally-recognized Yoga Alliance\u00ae Organization. Spirit of Yoga is SWIHA's yoga teacher training center. Additionally, we offer a state of the art yoga studio open to the public and hold workshops, events, seminars, and gatherings which celebrate the personal-spiritual connection inherent within the practice of yoga. 10 Associate of Occupational Studies Degree Program In the tradition of growth and development, SWIHA added its first Associate of Occupational Studies (AOS) degree program in 1997, which was Holistic Health Care. In keeping with the trends in holistic healthcare, an additional AOS program was added in 2000 known as Mind- Body Transformational Psychology. Now, in aligning with the times, SWIHA offers one degree program, Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare, with several concentrations to choose from. The concentrations offer select specialized tracks in Polarity, Yoga Teacher Training, Hypnotherapy, Life Coaching, and various modalities of bodywork. Our programs offer great versatility in scheduling and diversity of courses, which makes it possible for students t o specialize in the areas of greatest interest. The Associate of Occupational Studies (AOS) degree is founded on the principles put forth by the American Holistic Health Association (AHHA). The goal is to promote holistic health as an approach to creating wellness, which encourages individuals to: \u00b7 Balance and integrate the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of health \u00b7 Establish respectful, cooperative relationships with others and the environment \u00b7 Make wellness-oriented lifestyle choices \u00b7 Actively participate in health decisions and healing process The degree is designed to give students a broad foundation of classes integrating the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of health. The Mind-Body Transformational Psychology Concentration is focused on the mental and spiritual aspects of healing. It emphasizes the connection of mind, body, and spirit and views all possible aspects of health and happiness. The Mind -Body Transformational Psychology Concentration teaches that health and happiness are ongoing processes. The majority of the students in this Concentration choose Polarity, Hypnotherapy, Life Coaching, or Spiritual Studies as their emphasis. The Professional Massage Practitioner, Advanced Bodywork, and Western Herbalism Concentrations are an approach to life. Rather than focusing on illness or specific parts of the body, these concentrations consider the whole person and how he/she interacts with his/her environment. The goal is to achieve maximum well-being. With either Concentration, students choose two or more areas of specialization that will ultimately help clients make wellness-oriented choices. Students choose their destiny - it is not prescribed. ** The AOS degree is specifically designed with entrepreneurial emphases. Approximately 75% of the students enrolled in the AOS degree dream of owning their own businesses. Although employment cannot be guaranteed, every effort is made to support your goals and dreams. The SUCCESS CENTER is committed to placement assistance and entrepreneurial support. Online Classes Southwest Institute of Healing Arts offers select online courses, in addition to the 600-hour Mind-Body Wellness Practitioner diploma and our Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare with a concentration in Mind Body Wellness Transformation Psychology. We believe in leveraging the expanding capabilities of online education to broaden our ability to touch lives, heal bodies, and free souls.

Their entry-level training will include: self-empowerment, death and dying, developmental stages, growth and trauma, chemical dependency, various religious belief systems, alternative lifestyles, professional boundaries, and ethical communication. Many of our graduates become licensed massage therapists also with an elevated awareness of the mind body connection or become independent consultants in their area of expertise. These practitioners earn from $ 35.00 to $75.00 a session. Other graduates go into the mental health care field. Entry-level positions such as intake or support counselors can range from $ 15 to $20 per hour. As with all of the degree programs and many of the diploma programs at SWIHA, you choose a specialty that best expresses your 'gifts'.

It can be a stand-alone curriculum for students desiring an entry- level position into Holistic Health and Wellness facilities or it can be an entree into one's own practice. Researchers in the New England Journal of medicine tell us that Americans spend more than $10 billion a year on alternative therapies - considerably more than on traditional medicine. This growing field offers opportunities to learn a broad spectrum of therapies such as Nutrition, Massage, Herbalism, Polarity and Hypnotherapy. Holistic Health Care workers are now entering into the field of elder care, hospice care, and private practice. Entry- level career opportunities will include an enhanced holistic health care practice as a massage therapist, support group facilitation for eating management groups, employment in health food stores as consumer educators, and patient educators in health clinic settings. Graduates can find employment opportunities in management and sales in retail/wholesale situations where there are positions ranging from $12 to $20 per hour, often plus a commission. Group facilitators are paid $30 or more per hour, and as entrepreneurs they average $45-$60 per session, especially if also licensed as a massage therapist Code Course Clock Hours Credit Hours Pre- Requisite BC 200 Basic Fin ance 16 1.00 BC 105 Busin ess Writing 15 1.00 BC 550 P$ Life Coaching - An Int roduc tion 20 1.25 CC 302 Mast ery Skills fo r Practit ioners 30 2.00 HN 101 Nutrition - Fundam Hol istic Nutrition & We llness 30 2.00 BC 401 Public S peaking 15 1.00 CC 250 Psycholo gy Th eories - Honoring the Mast ers 30 2.00 BC 250 Statistical Researc h Project 16 1.00 BC 402 Seminar & Presentation 15 1.00 NC 120 Stress Managem ent 15 1.00 HH 500 Sustainability & Conscio us Living 15 1.00 BC 410 Writing fo r Publication 15 1.00 AOS GENERAL E DUCATION REQUIREMENT S SUBTOTA L 232 15.25 SM 150 Ayurveda - Int 30 Busin ess Deve Ent repreneur ial Suppor t 48 1.25 SC 455 Exercise We llness & Introduction to Yoga 30 2.00 AOS CORE CO URSES SUBTOTA L 108 5.25 MT 115 Anatomy 60 4.00 BC 302 Busin ess Practices fo r Massage T herap ists 12 0.75 CC 100 Communication Sk ills fo r Practitio ners I 15 1.00 CC 101 Communication Sk ills fo r Practitio ners II 15 1.00 CC 100 MT 530 CPR Certification 4 0.25 BC 301 Ethics for Massage Therapists 8 0.50 MT 521 First Aid 8 0.25 MT 151 Kinesiology - Anatomica l Applicati ons 36 2.25 MT 115 SC 415 Pathology - BW 40 2.50 MT 500 Physiology 60 4.00 BC 110 SOAP Notes 6 0.25 PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE CORE CO URSES SUBTOTA L 264 16.75 MT 200 Swedish Massage* 40 1.25 EV 003 Massage C linic Or ientation ** - - MT 750 Massage C linic - S uperv ised MT 750 75 1.50 MT 200 o r Licensed PC 850 Cranial Unwinding I 20 1.00 TE 220 Deep Tissue Sculpting 24 0.75 MT 200 o r Licensed MT 400 Myotherap y - 7 Step Release 40 1.25 MT 200 or Licensed TE 560 Reflexology - Introduction ** 8 0.25 PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE HA NDS-ON CO URSES SUBTOTA L 207 6.00 CHOOSE 16.75 CREDITS OF SPECIALTIES AND/OR ELECTIVES *Please see advisor for lis t of available elective choices that will compliment your chosen s pecialty.

At Southwest Institute of Healing Arts (SWIHA), our comprehensive 200-hour Cranial Unwinding program will lead the way. This program may be taken to fulfill part of your primary specialty requirements within some of our degree or diploma programs, to enhance your professional status, or simply to further your own personal growth and development through continued education. In this program, you will learn how to read the \"story\" of the body, identify areas where issues are held, and follow the natural priorities for healing as directed by the client's own physiology. Powerful healing transformations are often experienced by both the client and the practitioner. Once successfully completed, you will be awarded a Certificate of Excellence showing completion of200 hours of specialization in the field of Cranial Unwinding. \"Cranial Unwinding,\" also known as \"Craniosacral Therapy,\" is based on the research of osteopathic physician John Upledger, founder of the Upledger Institute. The craniosacral rhythms are at the core of the body's pulse, and learning to palpate and balance them is like discovering the ebb and flow of the ocean. With gentle manipulations of the skull and spine, restrictions of nerve passages can be eased or released. Cerebrospinal fluid can once again move freely, restoring balance and promoting healing throughout the body. Cranial unwinding honors the body's own innate healing ability. Subtle, palpatory skills are used to get into harmony, resonance and rapport with the client, while maintaining healthy boundaries. The idea is to develop a relationship that is completely non-invasive and client centered. This grounded, therapeutic modality is perfect for the individual who seeks to connect and harmonize the fluid nature of the body on both the physical and emotional levels.

Medical Massage is 'result-oriented', and the treatment is specifically directed to resolve conditions that have been diagnosed and prescribed by a physician. The therapist may use a variety of modalities or procedures during the treatment, but will focus only on the areas of the body related to the diagnosis and prescription. Medical Massage Practitioner of America (MMPA) further believes that \"all forms of massage therapy can be therapeutic when applied by a skillful and knowledgeable therapist; therefore, medical massage is not limited to any particular specific technique.\" The medical benefits of \"friction\" were first documented in Western culture by the Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 B.C. Today, massage therapy is being used as a means of treating painful ailments, decompressing tired and overworked muscles, reducing stress, rehabilitating sports injuries and promoting general health. This is done by manipulating the soft tissue of the body including fascia and skin, muscles, and lymphatic system of the body in order to improve circulation and remove waste products from the muscles and their supporting systems. Massage therapy may help cancer patients cope with the stress, anxiety, fatigue, pain, and sleeping difficulties associated with a cancer diagnosis. The medical community widely embraces this alternative form of cancer therapy for its mind-body healing benefits. Unlike conventional medicine, massage therapy addresses the psychological self, not just the body.

In this program, you will become efficient in connective tissue evaluation and release, enabling you to assist people who suffer from chronic muscular holding patterns with resulting pain and dysfunction. The term \"myofascia\" refers to the muscles' connective tissues. By learning to tune into - and work with - the neuronet matrix of the myofascia, you will develop a master's touch. Once successfully completed, you will be awarded a Certificate of Excellence showing completion of 100 hours of specialization in the field of Energetic Myofascial Massage. \"Energetic Myofascial Massage\" was designed by experienced nurse and massage therapist, Pam Field. She discovered how to read her clients' tissues and intuitively know the appropriate pressure, direction and technique for the most beneficial effect. She named this effective, innovative method of healing massage \"Tissue Talk\" - and it is essentially just that. Each layer of body tissue requires different mobilization techniques: subcutaneous tissue, fascia, myofascia , tendons, joints and bone. The practitioner's touch can range from energetic to light to deep pressure. Movement and stretching are combined with massage - an approach that is easier for both the client and the therapist because you work with the natural release patterns of each layer instead of using force to try to relax the muscles Code Course Clock Hours Credit Hours Pre-Requisite EL 112 Myofascial Energe tic M assage 20 0.50 MT 200 or Licensed EL 118 Myofascial Energe tic - A dv.

The Reflexology practitioner applies pressure to the feet, hands, ears, etc. with specific thumb and finger techniques without the use of oils and lotions. By pressing or stimulating a specific zone or area, the flow of energy, blood, nutrients and nerve impulses is restored and the zone is balanced.

The term \"Reiki\" is a combination of two Japanese characters - Rei which means \"spiritual\" or \"sacred\" and Ki which means \"energy.\" In the West, Reiki is most often described as universal life force energy - an unseen force that gives us life and flows through us. Furthermore, it is believed that when this life force energy is low or depleted, we are more likely to suffer stress and dis-ease. When it is high, we are more likely to be joyful and healthy. Reiki is administered by a \"laying on of hands\" and can have remarkable healing effects. A treatment may feel like a warm, glowing radiance flowing through and around you. Although Reiki training involves learning symbols and techniques, the healing ability itself is not \"taught\" in the usual sense. It is transferred to the student by a Reiki Master during an \"attunement,\" allowing the student to tap into the unlimited supply of universal life force energy. SWIHA offers both Traditional and Transformational Reiki programs. Traditional Reiki is based on traditions that have been handed down for generations. Transformational Reiki is a newly evolved way of teaching this healing art, incorporating an awareness of elements from Native American and world ceremonies into the student's training. Transformational Reiki includes sounding, chanting and accelerated revelation of the sacred symbols.

The Sanskrit word Yoga means 'union' or 'one pointed awareness' and Nidra means 'sleep.' In Yoga Nidra , the body, mind and intellect are completely relaxed while one appears to be sleeping. The consciousness is actually functioning at a deeper level and the subconscious and unconscious realms of the mind open up. The subconscious and the unconscious mind are the most powerful forces in the human being. In Yoga Nidra you learn how to access these powerful forces to gain knowledge, cure disease, increase creativity and realize your true self. Yoga Nidra is a highly powerful ancient meditation technique originated from the Tantras. Practically, it is the scientific way to eliminate the root causes of negatives and stresses with in people's lives. Yoga Nidra comprises the secrets of total transformation while giving a true, positive direction to our lives through eliminating the root cause of all negativities such as stress related disorders, aliments like hypertension, depression, insomnia, asthma, digestive disorders, etc. Yoga Nidra is a more efficient and effective form of psychic and physiological rest and relaxation than routine sleep. A single hour of Yoga Nidra is as restful and refreshing as four hours of conventional sleep. By making Yoga Nidra a part of your daily life, you not only relax completely, but restructure and reform your whole personality from within. This process of transformation is not only quicker than the other systems which work on an external basis only, but the results are also more reliable and permanent.

The curriculum offers students an extensive base of classes, using the Ayurvedic Theory as the educational foundation. We believe that by integrating the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of health and beauty, graduates will begin their career as a more skilled and confident practitioner. The program provides an \"Educational Approach to Wellness and Beauty\" focusing on a person's inner-beauty versus the more traditional teaching of glamour and superficial surface beauty. Students will be trained to integrate a full range of holistic services based on a \"conscious touch\" philosophy. SWINA's aesthetics program provides a unique \"whole body wellness\" approach with emphasis on nutrition, self-care education and retail product opportunities. After completion of this diploma, the student is prepared for licensure through the Arizona State Board of Cosmetology and an entry-level position. Compensation for an independent aesthetics practitioner is approximately $25 to $65 per session in Arizona.

Students come here for the sheer delight of personal achievement, to acquire credit for continuing education or to complete classes toward one of our certificate or diploma programs. Students may also pursue an Associate of Occupational Studies Degree (AOS). To enroll in a certificate, diploma or degree program, the student must speak in person or on the phone with an Admissions Coach or Coordinator. A potential student's first experience on-campus will be a tour of the facilities with an Admissions Coach. A discussion of SWIHA and SWINA's retention and placement rates, total tuition, fees, supplies, and book costs may take place in the first appointment or at the time of enrollment. Each individual's one on one time with an Advisor is catered to their specific need s. These specific needs are aptly identified by our Admissions Coaches, who have been dually-trained as Life Coaches. ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS ADMISSIONS POLICY On-Campus students who enroll at SWIHA or SWINA must be able to maintain a professional and therapeutic approach and sense of self, and must be able to present that to other students and/or potential clients by providing a safe environment an d process. This is as true for our online courses as it is for our traditional ones. Therefore, SWIHA and SWINA reserve the right to refuse admission to or cancel the enrollment of any student deemed unable to maintain a therapeutic level of professionalism. It is our desire to graduate students who bring an elevated expertise and awareness to the healing community and to their chosen profession. Applicants for our degree and diploma programs are required to have proof of a High School Diploma, General Equivalency Diploma (GED), or College Degree. Students who enroll on or after July 1, 2012 under the Ability to Benefit (ATB) provision are no longer eligible for federal student aid. This includes both ATB tests and the six-credit alternative. As of July 1, 2012, students must have a high school diploma or GED, or have been home schooled in order to be eligible for Title IV aid. ATB students who enroll prior to July 1, 2012 will be aid-eligible under the current federal regulations. Applicants for our Certificate of Excellence programs are not entitled to Federal Student Aid Title IV funding because these programs are avocational in nature and taken for personal development or continuing education purposes. Therefore, proof of a High School Diploma, General Equivalency Diploma (GED), or College Degree are not required to enroll. We may consider tests with passing scores from the following examination agencies toward the equivalency of a high school diploma: ACT Proficiency Examination Program (PEP), the Regents' College Examinations, the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) program and College-level Examination Program (CLEP), the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Educational Support (DANTES, Subject Standardized Testing (DSST) or Institution developed tests. Applicants to SWIHA Massage programs who do not have a high school diploma or equivalency certificate and who will not use financial aid during any part of their enrollment can be admitted with the intention of receiving a high school diploma or recognized equivalent prior to graduating in order to meet the Arizona State law of licensure. Students who have completed the program but have not received their high school diploma or recognized equivalent are not eligible for graduation or licensure until obtained. A felony conviction or mental instability may disqualify individuals from being eligible to be a licensed bodyworker and/or massage therapist in certain states. SWIHA's Master Massage program, Professional Massage Practitioner program and Associate's Degree with a concentration in the Professional Massage Practitioner diploma program meets the requirements of the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy to be a licensed Massage Therapist in the state of Arizona (LMT). Final decisions for licensure in the state of Arizona are made by the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy and therefore SWIHA can not guarantee licensure. Nor can SWIHA guarantee licensing in other states or countries. All students are encouraged to research the requirements of the state they hope to practice bodywork and/or massage in. 79 Individuals under the age of 18, but not younger than 17, may be accepted to a certificate, diploma, and/or degree program with written consent of a parent or legal guardian. All potential students are required to provide picture identification; i.e. driver's license, passport, etc. Application fees paid in full are preferred at the time of enrollment. These fees are $25 for a Certificate of Excellence and $75 for a diploma or degree program. Because each student is unique, applicants are encouraged to write a narrative answering questions provided on their pre - application form as to the reason they want to study in their particular chosen field. This is reviewed with an Admissions Advisor during an admissions appointment prior to enrollment. Online students are required to have a computer that meets the hardware and software specifics as detailed on the Technic al Requirements Agreement form. Online students will receive information for downloading and installing the Online Learning Management software at no charge during the week before their courses begin to use for the duration of their chosen program of study.\" Additionally, students who are considering online courses must also have strong self-motivation and self- discipline to be successful. Applicants to the online programs are asked to complete an Online Learner Readiness Assessment to help them determine if learning in a technology rich environment is a good fit for them. Applicants will work with an Online Success Coach to improve their skills in the areas where they scored below a certain disclosed threshold before they begin their online coursework. Students wishing to incorporate online courses into their on-campus program may do so by registering for one online course within their program first. The student may register for more online courses within their on - campus program after successfully completing their first online course. Successful completion includes a grade of 2 or better, with no outstanding homework or assignments, and/or by approval of staff. SWINA's NATURAL AESTHETICS EDUCATOR program also requires a valid aesthetics or cosmetology license, as well as proof of one-year work experience in the field. 80 DISCRIMINATION POLICY SWIHA and SWINA does not discriminate against any student, faculty, or staff member for reason of race, religion, gender, sexual preference, age, disability, citizenship, national origin, or political philosophy. Rejection of an applicant is limited to occurrences which would prevent the applicant from completing the program requirements or finding gainful employment in the field of study. Students must be able to provide a safe healing environment and process for their fellow students and prospective clients. POLICY ON PROVISION OF SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SWIHA and SWINA recognizes the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. We strive to ensure that students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations wherever necessary. Students have the responsibility to self-disclose and request accommodations a minimum of two months prior to the start of a program. To request accommodations, and allow management the opportunity to discuss ways in which SWIHA can best support you, please send written requests to the Executive Director of SWIHA for on-campus or online programs. Accommodation requests for SWINA should be submitted in writing to the Executive Director of SWINA. SPECIAL NEEDS Applicants with special needs should put in writing their request for accommodations to the Executive Director for SWIHA programs, and to the Executive Director of SWINA for Natural Aesthetics programs. STUDENT COMPLETION RATE SWIHA and SWINA are required to publish student completion rates on all vocational programs. These rates represent the percentage of a given cohort of certificate, diploma or degree seeking undergraduate students who graduate from the College. The College publishes the student completion rate annually as required by the United States Department of Education and the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET ). TRANSFER CREDITS Students from schools accredited by the United States Department of Education recognized agencies including the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and institutions approved by the state in which students are located are welcomed. In addition, we will consider transfers from providers recognized by the American Council on Education Center (ACE) for Adult Learning and Education Credential programs. We also accept other industry certifications, including, but not limited to; First Aid, CPR, National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork and Yoga Alliance. Students desiring to transfer credits must provide documentation of successful completion of the course(s) verifiable through transcripts or certificate of completion from recognized providers. Classes to be transferred must have been completed with a \"C\" or better. Education older than ten years may not be accepted for transfer credits. All transcripts received from other providers will become part of a student's permanent record. In addition, we may request a demonstration of competencies or more information, such as course descriptions, from the previous provider for the courses for which credit is being requesting. Education transferred in for the sake of credit must be no older than ten years from the date of enrollment. A transfer form detailing each course to be considered for transfer will be completed at the time of Admissions. Students may be asked to provide an official course catalog from the originating institution that includes the courses in question. The Executive Director, Director of Education, Director of Student Operations, Student Services Manager or Lead must sign the transfer form to approve all outside transfers into a program at the time of enrollment. Courses accepted in as transferred will be entered as complete and will have no effect on the grade point average achieved at Southwest Institute of Healing Arts. A transfer fee of $2.00 per clock hour is assessed. If classroom hours are not provided, the following conversion will be used: 81 1 credit equals 15 hours of lecture, 1 credit equals 30 hours of lab/hands-on, or 1 credit equals 45 hours of clinic/externship/internship. In the event a student opts to transfer in credits at a time other than during the admissions process, a copy will be given t o the Academic Advisor, which will be passed on to the Executive Director, Director of Education, Director of Student Operations or Student Services Manager or Lead to approve of the transfer. The Financial Aid department is then notified of any additional transfer credits, at which time Awarded Aid is reevaluated and when necessary the appropriate refunds are made. Completed SWIHA or SWINA courses may be transferred in without a fee at the time of enrollment or at any time within the course of the student's program. Students are encouraged to transfer credits in closer to the beginning of their program in order to prevent a change in their tuition balance or requirements. All other enrollment fees and contract conditions will apply. Potential students wishing to discuss their transfer options are encouraged to set up an appointment with an Admissions Coach before enrolling. Any time after enrollment, current students are to meet with their Academic Advisor in order to discuss the possibilities of transferring in credits. Students may transfer no more than 50% of the hours/credits required for any diploma program or degree. The exception to this would be: VA Benefit, SWIHA Personal Development or SWIHA Continuing Education courses, and Massage/Natural Aesthetics/Cosmetology licenses. A competency exam may be required upon transfer hours into one of the Natural Aesthetics and/or Laser programs to ensure the student's knowledge base. A charge of $100 could be assessed. TEST OUT Those wishing to test out of core course or general education requirements such as anatomy, physiology, finance, etc. because their education is past 10 years old may do so by taking a College Level Examination Program (CLEP) test through a community college and submitting the passing documentation for their file. Again, the transfer fee will apply. Credit will not exceed credit hours offered at SWIHA. An admission representative will initially review all documentation and then submit the request to the Executive Director, Director of Education, Director of Student Operations or Student Services Manager or Lead, if applicable, for final approval. 82 PROGRAM SCHEDULES SWIHA offers students a unique opportunity to design their program specialties, electives, and most clinic hours to fit into their individual life schedule. There are recommended schedules to complete a program within a designated time period, especially if the student is applying for financial aid.* The majority of the programs are designed to have open-entry- open-exit capabilities for the students. Therefore the student can enter and rotate into the current track at any time throughout the year, at the earliest start date. SWINA offers the same flexibility by offering day and evening classes, but with a standard block scheduled. The student may choose a full-time, part-time or personal development/continuing education schedule. (Note: Students wishing to access Title IV Financial Aid must comply with the attendance requirements of that program, which is full-time.) SWIHA and SWINA's websites and class calendar provides start and end dates for courses in the programs and the specific electives choices available. All electives may not be offered all the time or in every program. Start dates are also available in Student Services. Believing in the Montessori Method of learning, a vast collection of our courses has been designed without pre-requisites. The majority of the Primary Specialties/Certificates of Excellence are scheduled on a rotating basis, which allows the student to enter at the beginning of any course. Massage, Hypnotherapy, Life Coaching, and Western Herbalism are designed so students start with the basic course and then continue into the more advanced work. 83 CONSUMER INFORMATION NOTICE Institutions that participate in Title IV Federal Financial Aid Programs are required to disseminate consumer information to potential and currently enrolled students. The disclosure is intended to outline consumer information that you have the right to request and review.

Cash and credit cards are accepted and financing is available to qualified enrolled students. A student's admissions advisor will explain the various payment options. Any student accounts that are passed due and in default may be turned over to an outside collection agency. Students may also be responsible to pay all finance charges and collection costs up to 50% of the outstanding balance at the time the account is placed with an agency. In addition, any attorney fees, court costs and other costs incurred by SWIHA during the collection process may be passed on to the student. Our intention is to offer financing opportunities to students so they may fully follow their destined path. However, commitments to these payments are fully expected. The agreement to pay SWIHA for an in-house payment plan is as follows: Students who become delinquent on payments will have ten days to bring their account current. A $25.00 charge for each NSF check will be assessed. If the school receives one NSF check, each subsequent payment must be paid by cashier's check, money order, or cash. DISSEMINATION OF INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INFORMATION Information about SWIHA and SWINA's available financial assistance may be obtained from the Financial Aid Department during regular business hours. Financial Aid is available for students who qualify. Students, who have enrolled in an eligible program and wish to apply for financial assistance, must speak or meet with the Financial Aid department. SWIHA and SWINA participate in the Federal Stafford Student Loan Programs and Federal Grant Programs based on the student's needs analysis, which is determined by completing and submitting a Financial Application (FAFSA) to the Department of Education. Students are required to submit their financial aid applications on an award year basis. Priority consideration for receipt of financial aid funds administered by the Financial Aid Office shall be given to students who submit all required documentation by the assigned deadline. Once the FAFSA has been processed and received at the school, it is the student's responsibility to contact t he Financial Aid Office to schedule a financial aid interview. Those scheduling an enrollment appointment with Admissions will automatically be scheduled for a Financial Aid appointment afterward if they have completed their FAFSA. SWIHA/SW INA participates in the Federal Financial Aid Programs, which includes the Federal PLUS Loan, the Federal Pell Grant, and the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant. In order to qualify and maintain eligibility for the program, the student must apply for financial aid, consistent with the published requirements for the aid program, and adhere to the college policies and regulations governing each program. Students receiving federal loans and grants have varying rights and responsibilities. These rights and responsibilities include the ability to appeal financial aid decisions and the requirement to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Other outside agencies are sometimes able to help students pay for their education. Neither SWIHA nor SWINA provide the applications for these other resources, but will readily assist in any documentation that they may need. Some examples are Arizona Department of Veteran Services, Vocational Rehabilitation, Tribal Funding, and employee reimbursement. Some scholarships are available from the Lifelong Learning Corporation. For more information about applying for these scholarships, contact Arizona Private School Association, 202 W. McDowell, Suite 273 Phoenix, AZ 85004 (606) 254- 5199. Students may utilize the option of setting up individual payment plans for students who are unable to receive aid in paying for school. These payment plans can be arranged at the time of enrollment with the Admissions Advisor or with Student Services. The program must be paid in full, with no outstanding fees, in order to receive a certificate, diploma, degree or official transcript. 85 ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL AID CLOCK-HOURS TO CREDIT-HOURS The Carnegie Unit is used in measuring the credits earned for academic standards and financial aid awarding. SWIHA'S ASSOCIATE DEGREE OF HOLISTIC HEALTHCARE: A clock hour consists of 50 minutes of classroom instruction for every hour of class time. Semester credit hours are determined by the following table (credits are rounded off to the lower quarter with no class being less than .25): \u00b7 at least 15 clock hours = 1 credit for a science or theoretical class \u00b7 at least 30 clock hours = 1 credit for hands-on/experiential lab classes \u00b7 at least 45 clock hours = 1 credit for externship or clinic hours The Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare includes the choice of several concentration options. Many of these options derive directly from the same program structure of the independent diploma programs offered at SWIHA and SWINA. Therefore, the majority of the classes from the diploma program accounts for the 60 credits within the Associate Degree, while 15.25 core credits are general education requirements specific to the Degree. SWIHA/SWINA'S DIPLOMA PROGRAMS: Credit for diploma programs is measured in credit-hours that are converted from clock-hours. One clock-hour is equal to 60 minutes of classroom, Lab or extern/internship time with a minimum of 50 minutes of instructional time. The conversion of 30 clock hours is equal to at least one credit hour (30/1 ). WORK EXCHANGE PROGRAM Students have the opportunity to participate in the Do Your Dream program on a limited, temporary basis (in house work- exchange program). On occasion SWIHA has special mailings, filing, data entry, events, telephoning, etc. that requires short - term assistance. These opportunities are open to students on a work-exchange basis which allows the student to exchange every hour worked for the cost of tuition. Students may pay up to 50% of their Financial Aid gap in this manner. Students in the Yoga Teacher Training 200-hour Certificate of Excellence program may also use this option to pay 25% of their total cost of tuition. Students who are interested in this type of temporary work must first seek eligibility with Financial Aid, even if they are not planning on using, nor eligible for Financial Aid (EX: Yoga Teacher Training 200 hour Certificate of Excellence). Once eligibility is determined by Financial Aid, the student will be sent to the Success Center to learn about the Do Your Dream program. The student will then complete all necessary paperwork if deemed eligible. FFEL DEFFERMENTS Students who are currently enrolled in an eligible program may be eligible to have their current and prior federal loan payments deferred. Semi-monthly enrollment data is submitted electronically to the National Student Loan Database as required by the Department of Education. This electronically reported student status data is required by lenders to make appropriate deferment decisions. In addition to in-school deferments, students may be eligible for loan deferments based on periods of volunteer service or service in the Peace Corps. Borrowers must formally request a deferment though the procedures established by the holder of their loan(s). You may review additional information regarding deferments in the 'Financial Aid' section of this catalog. All policies and statistics can be obtained by accessing the following: www.swiha.edu 86 STUDENT DELINQUENCY POLICY In the event a student misses a scheduled tuition payment she or he is notified within 30 days so arrangements can be made to make up the payment. If a student does not make up the payment by the agreed to date, or continues to miss tuition payments, she or he may be suspended from classes or withdrawn from the program until a resolution is made. Class suspension may interfere with a student's satisfactory academic progress that could lead to further disciplinary action or termination from the program. If student fails to make payments when due, and the account may be sent to a licensed collection agency. VETERANS AND THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS SWIHA/SWINA has a pro-rata refund policy for all Veterans and their eligible dependents. Any unused portion of a paid tuition and or fees will be refunded to Veterans not completing the program. For example: An approved program consists of 100 days and a Veteran who has paid for the entire program only attends fifty days. Fifty percent of this prepaid tuition or 50 days of tuition will be refunded. APPLICABLE REFUND POLICIES The College Refund Policies are in accordance with state and accrediting bodies' applicable laws and regulations. The tuition refund policy generally applies to students who are withdrawn from the school. A review of detailed information regarding tuition refund policies is located in the 'Refund Policy' Section of the Catalog or on the back of the enrollment agreement. The College follows the Federal Return of Title IV Funds provisions for federal aid recipients. Under these provisions, when a recipient of Federal Student Financial Aid Funds (FSA) withdraws from the College, the College must determine the amount of FSA funds earned as of the student's last day of attendance. If the total amount of funds earned is less than the amount disbursed, funds will be returned to the appropriate FSA Programs. If the total amount of FSA funds earned is greater than the total amount of funds disbursed, the difference between these amounts may be treated as a post-withdrawal disbursement. A review of detailed information regarding the FSA return provision is in the SWIHA Catalog or on the back of the enrollment agreement. 87 COST OF ATTENDANCE The college establishes standard student budgets as a basis for awarding federal student financial aid funds. These budgets a re not intended to represent exact living expenses that will be incurred, but represent average expenses. The cost of attendance (COA) includes average living expenses and established book and supplies, tuition and fee charges. The average monthly living expenses estimates used in the federal cost of attendance are indicated in the tables below. In addition to the costs represented in those tables, students will also be responsible for a monthly tuition cost based on their chosen program of study. .

The class calendar provides the start and end dates for all courses in the programs and the specific elective choices available. All electives may not be offered all the time. STUDENT SUPPORT Students in programs of 600 hour or more begin their academic journey with a New Student Orientation. Orientations are scheduled and relayed to the student at the time of Admissions. SWIHA ORIENTATIONS for on-campus students is available at the beginning and end of every month with varying times for flexibility. ONLINE ORIENTATIONS are self-paced and to be completed prior to the student's first class. SWINA ORIENTATIONS are conducted within the classroom the first few days of the student's program. On-campus and Online program students at SWIHA are also scheduled a First Advisement with their Academic Advisor at the time of Admissions. The First Advisement takes place within the first month of the student's course of study. The First Advisement allows the Academic Advisor to review student policies and procedures discussed at New Student Orientation, as well discuss more in depth the expectations of their program and the policies. Academic Advisors are available for appointments to review a student's academic selection throughout one's program. However, administration is proud to have an open door policy. Students are encouraged to contact staff at any time for support or concerns. The Faculty Manager, Director of Education, and/or Executive Director of Online Education are available to discuss questions, concerns and feedback regarding instructors. SWIHA on-campus students may speak to the Director of Student Operations and/or the Executive Director of SWIHA On - Campus should they feel their concerns have not been adequately addressed within a particular department.

Types of advisements include: \u00b7 Attendance \u00b7 Academic \u00b7 Financial \u00b7 Behavioral Advisement levels are: \u00b7 Documented conversation \u00b7 Warning \u00b7 Probation \u00b7 Suspension* \u00b7 Withdrawal Once a student has been placed on Probation, he or she may not incur any other policy infractions or advisements until the probation period has ended. In the event an infraction occurs, the student will be suspended. Probation periods last for 30 days; probation periods and standards of conduct will be communicated by Student Services to students who are placed on probation. If a student on probation does not follow these guidelines, he or she will be put on suspension. * Length and degree of suspension will be determined by school official. Student Services will determine the appropriate level of on-campus/off-campus suspension. STUDENT RECORDS - SWIHA SWIHA Students may review their academic and financial records at any time. SWINA students may review their academic and financial records by submitting a blue request form to the Student Services mailbox located outside the administrative offices. Student records are not released to any other individuals without the written consent of the student (P.L.93-380, Sec. 438FERPA). Inquiries made as to the enrollment or graduation status of a particular student by offices or agencies directly involved with the academic or professional industry will be released without written consent of the student. Students receive two official transcripts at the time of graduation. Any additional official transcripts are available at $10 each. Students may request unofficial transcripts at no extra charge. Student records are kept permanently. Students also have the right to request records be corrected which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. This request must be made in writing to the Director of Student Operations, Director of Online Operations, or Executive Director of SWINA. If the school determines the record in question is accurate, and should not be amended, the eligible student then has the right to a formal meeting with appropriate administration. After the meeting, if administration still deems the record as accurate, the student has the right to place a statement with the record stating his or her view about the contested information. 91 NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS UNDER FAMILY EDUCATION RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) Compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 (amended in January 1975 and appearing in its final form in July 1976) is strictly maintained. The Privacy Act defines requirements, which are designed to protect the privacy of students concerning their records maintained by the College. The information pertaining to a student's records shall not b e released to a third party without written authorization of the students, judicial order, or a lawfully issued subpoena. Education records are all records the college maintains regarding a student. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. (An \"eligible student\" under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution.) These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day Southwest Institute of Healing Arts (the \"school\") receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the school decides not to amend the record as requested, the school will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before the university discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The school discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by Southwest Institute of Healing Arts in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of Southwest Institute of Healing Arts who performs an institutional service of function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for Southwest Institute of Healing Arts. Upon request, the school also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Southwest Institute of Healing Arts to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202 FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from students' education records, without consent of the student, if the disclosure meets certain conditions found in \u00a799.31 of the FERPA regulations. Except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the student, \u00a799.32 of FERPA regulations requires the institution to record the disclosure. Eligible students have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures. 92 CHANGE OF ADDRESS It is important students notify Student Services when a change of address occurs. It is imperative the correct address, e -mail and telephone number for each student at all time is on file. Upon graduation, it is mandatory that students who have Federal Family Loans through Title IV funding keep their current address and phone number on file. ATTENDANCE If an on-campus SWIHA and SWINA student is out of attendance for over 14 days he or she will be considered out of compliance with the attendance policy and will be withdrawn from his or her program. If an online SWIHA student has not submitted work for over 14 days they will be considered out of compliance with the attendance policy and will be withdrawn from their program. In the event that a student's education schedule is interrupted, the student must communicate with a Student Services Academic Advisor to determine whether the student needs to re-establish the student's completion date or whether the student needs to officially withdraw from the program and re-enroll at a future date. Student attendance and punctuality is held in high regard to prepare students to enter into the workforce. As an institution committed to the success of each graduate; students are expected to arrive for class on time; as would be expected in a working environment. When a student arrives late to on-campus classes, they not only miss important material, but disrupt the instructor and other students. Therefore, attendance is tracked in 15 minute intervals and all time missed from a class will be calculated and applied to a students' overall attendance requirements . Time missed will be documented and subtracted from the total attendance for the course in the event a situation arises when a student must be tardy to start class or exit a class early due to extenuating circumstance. The time missed will be documented and subtracted from the total clock hour attendance for the course ensuring that no less than 90% attendance for SWIHA On-Campus students and 90% attendance for SWINA students are completed to earn credit for that course. Each class hour will consist of an average of 50 minutes of academics and a ten-minute break. Faculty may make changes to this schedule if the break time will interfere with the curriculum content. The maximum time frame for completion of a program shall not exceed 1.5 times the normal duration of the program. The Student Services Academic Advisor does incremental evaluations. ATTENDANCE - SWIHA POLICY 90% attendance of each course is required to receive a passing grade (2, equivalent to a C) for all courses beginning on or after February 1, 2012. Students will need to partake in make-up options should 90% attendance not be acquired in the initial attempt. Those with a final course grade of 1 (equivalent to a D) or higher are eligible for these make - up opportunities. Those with a final course grade of 0 (equivalent to an F) are required to retake the course in its entirety to receive a passing grade. Students should contact the student service office or their academic advisor regarding make-up forms and make-up eligibility. ATTENDANCE - ONLINE POLICY Attendance for Online courses is credited to students when they respond to discussion board questions. Homework assignments, response posts, and activity in other areas of the course will not create positive attendance. For classes meeting between 1 and 4 hours per week, a student must post at least one original reply to a discussion question. For classes meeting between 5 and 8 hours per week, students must post at least two original replies to discussion questions. Attendance is monitored and recorded by the Online Student Services advisor or delegated Online Specialist. Attendance is recorded on the Online Course checklist as well as in Diamond D. In the event a student falls below the 90% attendance requirement, he/she will be required to make -up this time by attending an appropriate make-up class. 93 ATTENDANCE- SWINA POLICY 90% attendance of each course is required to receive a passing grade of 2 (equivalent to a C) for all courses beginning on or after February 1, 2012. Students will need to partake in make-up options should 90% attendance not be acquired in the initial attempt. Those with a final course grade of 1 (equivalent to a D) or higher are eligible for make-up opportunities. Those with a final course grade of 0 (equivalent to an F) are required to retake the course in it's entirety to receiving a passing grade. Please speak to Student Services for more details on ways to make-up attendance hours ABSENT/TARDY REQUIREMENTS - SWINA New Processes - Instructors will begin attendance roll call at the beginning of every class. The student's initials and time of arrival will be required for those on the roster who enter after roll call has been taken. Students leaving early are to sign out and include the time of their departure. Those who leave class early and do not sign out with their instructor will only receive credit for being in attendance for one ( 1) hour. Roll call will be taken silently by the Instructor at the end of the class. Those students not in attendance who did not sign out with an early departure will only receive credit for being in attendance for one (1) hour. Students arriving late from breaks will be documented as such by the Instructor and will a ect the student's nal attendance. APPROVED EXCUSED ABSENCE REQUEST- SWIHA Students who have unforeseen circumstances occur may apply for 10% of their absence in a course to be excused. Those whose 10% is approved as an excused absence may then receive a passing grade in the course by obtaining 80% attendance. Unforeseen circumstances include illness, hospitalization, death in the family, military leave and other circumstances deemed beyond your control by the Director of Student Services, Director of Education, and/or Executive Director. All 10% excused considerations are to be given to Student Services no later than 24-hours after the completion of the nal class of the course you are wishing to have the absence excused. Attendance 79%-60%, excused or unexcused, will require a student to make- up attendance hours. Those with 59% attendance or less are not eligible for make - up opportunities and will need to retake the course in its entire ty. APPROVED EXCUSED ABSENCE REQUEST-SWINA Students who have unforeseen circumstances occur may apply for their absence in a course to be excused. Excused absences may not exceed 10% of each course/block hours. Unforeseen circumstances include illness, hospitalization, death in the family, military leave and any other circumstances deemed beyond your control by Director of Education, and/or Executive Director(s). All 10% excused considerations are to be submitted no later than 24 hours after the completion of the nal class of the course/block you are wishing to have the absence excused. All requests are to be given to Student Services. Please speak to Student Services for more details on ways to make-up attendance hours. Those with 59% attendance or less are not eligible for make- up opportunities and will need to retake the course in its entirety. ROLL CALL-SWIHA Instructors or Class Assistants will begin attendance roll call at the beginning of every class. Students whose names are not on the roster and have a Blue Attendance Slip, Make -up Form or Guest Pass will be asked to sign the roster with the time of arrival/departure. The student's signature and time of arrival will be required for those on the roster who enter after roll call has been taken. Students who arrive late to class after the instructor has taken roll call need to sign in on the attendance roster and indicate their arrival time. It is the student's responsibility to ensure his/her late arrival time is clearly documented . Students who arrive late and do not sign the attendance roster will be marked \"Absent\" for the class meeting. Attendance is the student's sole responsibility. Students leaving early are to sign out and include the time of their departure. Those who leave early and do not sign out for class will only receive credit for being in attendance for one hour. Roll call will be taken silently by the Instructor or Assistant at the end of the class. Those not in attendance, who did not sign out with an early departure, will only receive credit for being in attendance for one hour. Students arriving late from breaks will be documented as such by the Instructor or Assistant and will a ect the student's nal attendance. 94 COMPENTENCY TIMELINE-SWIHA Competencies are considered opportunities, tests, check -o s, etcetera completed in class. Homework is not considered a competency because it is performed outside of the classroom. Students who are absent or do not complete a competency during class time have up to 60 days from the end of their course to fulll this requirement and receive a grade. Students who complete the competency after 60 days from the end of their course will receive either a passing (2 = equivalent to a 70% or 'C') or failing grade (0 =equivalent to 0% or 'F'). Once a competency has been passes, the passing grade is the final grade. Student cannot retake a competency in order to improve their grade. CLOCKING HOURS - SWINA In order to receive attendance credit a SWINA student must clock in and out upon arriving, during breaks that exceed 30 minutes, and upon leaving. Students must also sign attendance sheets for each day in class an d/or clinic. Any additional time clocked before or after class or clinic will not be counted towards total hours. VERIFYING HOURS - SWINA Clocked hours of attendance are posted daily for the day prior. Students are expected to review and initial posted hours each day in order to verify hours were clocked properly. Any discrepancies should be reported to student services on a Blue Request Form within seven (7) days of the date in question. After seven (7) days, attendance is considered final. Requests may be denied for students who repeatedly forget to clock in or out. LEAVE OF ABSENCE A student is granted a first leave of absence (LOA) up to sixty-days (60) at a time. Students needing additional time for unforeseen circumstances may request an extension not to exceed a maximum of one hundred- eighty days (180) within any 12-month period or \u00bd the published length of the program which ever is shorter, which the student is not considered withdrawn and no refund calculation is required. Unforeseen circumstances may include: military reasons, circumstances covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, jury duty, or other unforeseen circumstances. The total period of time of all LOA's will not be considered as time elapsing for maximum timeframe purposes. The leave of absence will not involve additional charges to the student by the institution. A leave of absence will be considered an approved leave of absence if the school determines that there is reasonable expectation that the student will return. In addition, the student must follow SWIHA and SWINA's policy in requesting the leave of absence by providing a written, signed and dated request to the student service department prior to the leave. If unforeseen circumstances prevent a student from providing a signed request, the student may submit the LOA within fourteen (14) days of their last day of attendance. The LOA start date will begin the day following the student's last date of attendance and will be used to count the number of days in the leave. The count should be based on the number of days between the last date of attendance (LDA) and the re - entry date. The initial LDA is used when determining the start date for the 12- month period. Students are not required to make their monthly institutional cash payments, however, if the student would like to continue to make their payment, they may do so by mailing the payment to the accounts receivable department. Student's returning from a leave of absence will be permitted to complete the coursework they began prior to the LOA. Students are responsible for ensuring that they are scheduled appropriately upon return to meet attendance policies. Students are responsible for contacting the Financial Aid Department for information pertaining to the effect that their failure to return from the leave may have on student loan repayment terms, including the exhaustion of some or all of their grace period. A student on an approved leave of absence will be considered enrolled at the institution and would be eligible for an in- school deferment for his or her student loans. If a student does not return from an approved leave of absence on or before their scheduled date of return as written on the official leave of absence form, their withdrawal date and beg inning of their grace period will be the last date of attendance. 95 MAXIMUM TIME FRAME SWIHA All program requirements must be met within a maximum time frame of 1.5 times the normal program length, as measured in calendar time. Time spent on an approved leave of absence is not counted against the maximum time frame. MAXIMUM TIME FRAME SWINA Effective January 16th, 2012, Students who do not complete their program by their estimated graduation date (found on your enrollment contract), will: Meet with Student Services to sign a Maximum Time Frame Letter (this letter will inform the student of the latest date possible for the student to finish their program). Students exceeding their Maximum Time Frame will be dropped from their program) continue to report to their scheduled clinic shift, however students will not be booked with clients (priority clinic shifts will be issued to \"junior\" students as clinic shifts are limited) attend mandatory \"Study-Hall\" during a students' normal clinic shift Need to bring make-up items from a previous block to work on, or an assignment will be issued to the student by the Instructor. Each assignment will be turned into the Instructor at the end of the designated clinic shift, in order to receive credit for that shift. This policy will supersede previous versions located within your Student Handbook. This addendum will further assist in strengthening the overall development of its students. ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL AID CLOCK-HOURS TO CREDIT HOURS SWIHA utilizes the Carnegie Unit in measuring the credits earned for academic standards and financial aid awarding. SWIHA's Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare: A clock hour consists of 50 minutes of classroom instruction for every hour of class time. Semester credit hours are determined by the following table (credits are rounded off to the lower quarter with no class being less than .25 ): at least 15 clock hours = 1 credit for a science or theoretical class at least 30 clock hours = 1 credit for hands-on/experiential lab classes at least 45 clock hours = 1 credit for externship or clinic hours The Associate Degree of Holistic Healthcare includes the choice of several concentration options. Many of these options derive directly from the same program structure of the independent diploma programs offered at SWIHA and SWINA. Therefore, the majority of the classes from the diploma program accounts for the 60 credits within the Associate Degree, while 15.25 core credits are general education requirements specific to the Degree. 96 SWIHA/SWINA DIPLOMA PROGRAMS Credit for diploma programs is measured in credit-hours that are converted from clock-hours. One clock-hour is equal to 60 minutes of classroom, Lab or extern/internship time with a minimum of 50 minutes of instructional time. The conversion of 30 clock hours is equal to at least one credit hour (30/1). GRADING POLICY Students are required to maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (70%) in order to receive credit for a course. A syllabus with course requirements will be handed out at the first meeting for each new course. Online students will find their syllabus in the main course conference, in the First Class course management system. Progress will be measured using multiple assessment methods, including but not limited to: written evaluations, class observation, hands-on check-off evaluations, tests (opportunities). Approved recipients (ex: licensed massage therapists) will receive massages for the hands-on check-off evaluations in massage and bodywork courses in the classroom. Students will receive regular feedback on their strengths and ways in which they can improve their session through client and instructor feedback. This feedback could be written, verbal, or as appropriate for each course. Also, regardless of course completion, if after a hands- on check-off evaluation an instructor recommends the student repeat/audit the course, the student will need to retake the noted class/ es or arrange tutoring for the material. After completing additional classes or tutoring, the student will need to complete the check-off again to show competency. Students in online classes will be evaluated on their participation in the discussion board, professionalism in their communication, and knowledge demonstrated through the discussion board and independent project activities. Online students must complete all course requirements prior to the end of the course, and are ineligible for submitting make-up work after the course has ended. Online students are advised to check their course syllabus and confirm all grading criteria with their instructor. If the course is a program requirement, a grade of 2.0 (70%) must be obtained; if the course is an elective, the student can choose to substitute another course with the permission of the Student Services Academic Advisor. Failure to complete the minimum requirements 2.0 (70%) for any required or core course will necessitate the student's repeating that course or doing appropriate make up to demonstrate competency and increase the grade. Upon successful completion of the course make-up, if the student had previously received a 1, the highest grade will be reflected on the student's transcript and the lower grade will be dropped. Courses in which a student earns 0 credits will remain on the student's transcript permanently and impact the student GPA. Students participating in Title IV funding will not be eligible for funding if they are not in compliance with the Grade Point Average policy at each evaluation point. 97 GRADING SCALE A student's grade point average (GPA) is calculated by multiplying the grade points earned in each course by the clock hours awarded for the course. The total grade points are then divided by the total cock hours earned to arrive at the cumulative overall GPA. 4 = equivalent to an A = 90 - 100%, 4 grade points: Outstanding effort, a mastery of the subject area, excellent standard of work. 3 = equivalent to a B = 80 - 89%, 3 grade points: Extra effort reflecting mastery of a subject area, with high standard of work. 2 = equivalent to a C = 70 - 79%, 2 grade points: Competent in subject area with acceptable standard of work. 1 = equivalent to a D = 69% - 60% - 1 grade point, will be required to make-up work to bring grade to an acceptable standard: Subject area is well below average. (Note: I-D was a code previously used on transcripts to define the same standard .) 0 = equivalent to an F = 59% and below - 0 grade points, will be required to re-take the class to earn a passing grade. The 0 will remain on the student's transcript, even after the class has been re-taken and the student has received a passing grade. INC = Incomplete, No Credit Students who are withdrawn either voluntarily or involuntarily must abide by the standard Make -up/Tutorial Policy in order to receive credit for incomplete courses. Courses that a student chooses to drop may count as credits attempted or credits achieved and will have an impact on the GPA. Courses that a student chooses to drop within the first four hours of a course, will not count as credits attempted or credit s achieved and will have a 0.00 value toward the GPA. Students who drop their course after the first four hours will receive a '0' on their transcript. SATISFACTORY ACADEMMIC PROGRESS (SAP) POLICY FOR SOUTHWEST INSTITUE OF HEALING ARTS ON-CAMPUS AND ONLINE Applicable to every student enrolled in diploma and degree programs, the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) ensures that students make satisfactory progress towards successful completion of their academic programs. The evaluation points contained in the policy are meant to identify problems for which actions of early intervention and/or remediation can be taken. Most critical to this policy is a student's ability to enroll in and complete courses on a consistent manner. This ability is measured in two ways: Cumulative grade-point-average (GPA) of 2.0 or better, and the pace at which the student earns hours/credits towards program completion. Failure to complete courses successfully for any reason may negatively affect academic progress. Failing, dropping or not completing courses could result in the loss of financial aid. In order for a student to graduate, the minimum requirements are a GPA of 2.0 and completion of the program in no more than 150% of the published length of the program. Students who exceed their estimated graduation date are placed on automatic probation and will work with the Academic Advisor to establish an academic plan to ensure program requirements are met before the program's maximum timeframe. Students in Certificates of Excellence programs are obtaining their education for personal development purposes only and have declared no intention for gainful employment at the time of enrollment. Therefore, Satisfactory Academic Progress Reports are not necessary or completed for these individuals. 98 EVALUATION POINTS FOR SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROCESS: PROGRAMS 1 ACADEMIC YEAR IN LENGTH OR LESS 1. 75 hours into the program 2. Midpoint of the program 3. Expected graduation date of the program Students receive notification of their progress in writing at each evaluation point with an attached transcript. Additionally, students may obtain their grade reports from the Student Services Office upon request at any time. All program requirements must be completed within a timeframe of 1.5 times the normal program length. If SAP is not being met at any of the evaluation points, the student will be placed on an academic warning or academic probation, until the next evaluation point. Students may be terminated from their program if they do not improve upon their attendance or academic accomplishments during the warning/probation period. Students will be notified of their status in writing.

Additionally, students may obtain their grade reports from the Student Services Office upon request at any time. All program requirements must be completed within a timeframe of 1.5 times the normal program length. If SAP is not being met at any of the evaluation points, the student could be placed on an academic warning or academic probation, until the next evaluation point. Students may be terminated from their program if they do not improve upon their attendance or academic accomplishments during the warning/probation period. Students will be notified of their status in writing. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO MEET SAP POLICY WARNING: Students will be placed on a warning for failure to meet academic, attendance, student conduct standards, or non -payment of tuition. Students will be notified in writing if they are placed on a warning. The warning will remain in effect until the next evaluation point, or as deemed necessary by the Administration, however it will not exceed a payment period. The terms and conditions will be specified per situation based on the student's individual needs to achieve academic success. Students who fail to successfully pass the warning period may be placed on an additional warning period, probation, or terminated from the program. PROBATION: Students may be placed on probation for failure to meet academic, attendance, student conduct standards, or non-payment of tuition. Students will be notified in writing if they are placed on probation. The probation will remain in effect until the next evaluation point, or as deemed necessary by the Administration, however it will not exceed a payment period. The terms and conditions will be specified per situation based on the student's individual needs to achieve academic success. Students who fail to successfully pass the probation period may be placed on an additional probation period or terminated from the program. TERMINATION: In the event of termination, the student will be notified in writing and the Refund Policy shall prevail. APPEALS : Students may appeal a determination that they are not meeting the SAP Policy by submitting a letter in writing, to the Administration, specifically the Director of Student Operations, within three business days of receiving the notification. To be included with the letter should be substantiating documentation from the student as to why s/he failed to meet SAP and what has changed the student's situation that will allow him/her to meet SAP by the next evaluation period. The Administration w ill review the appeal within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal and notify the student in writing of the decision. All appeal decisions are final. In the event that the appeal is approved, the student shall be allowed to continue classes at the discretion of the Administration and the student will be held to the terms of an academic plan in lieu of a warning or probation. Any further breach of the rules or interference with the orderly conduct of the school may be cause for immediate termination without appeal. ACADEMIC PLAN: Upon a successful appeal, the Administration will develop an academic plan that the student will follow to ensure that s/he is able to meet SAP by a specific time, and may require more SAP evaluations than by the next payment period. ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF SAP: Factors that may also effect a student's ability to meet SAP include, but are not limited to; Incomplete grades, course withdrawals, course repetitions, non-credit course work, transfer of credit from other institutions. Please note, the same requirements are applied to transfers from one program to another within SWIHA/SWINA and must be cumulative. SWIHA/SWINA will count transfer hours which are accepted toward completion of a student's program as both hours attempted and hours completed. 100 SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR SOUTHEWEST INSTITUTE OF NATURAL AESTHETICS (SWINA) - BRANCH CAMPUS Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is a measurement of a student's qualitative and quantitative performance based on grade point average (GPA), attendance, and total hours required to clock within the maximum time frame allotted. This is our way of ensuring that each graduate has mastered the minimum learning requirements to support gainful employment when they are finished with their studies. SWINA students must have a 2.0 (70%) or better and a minimum of 90% attendance in each individual block in order to graduate. Blocks prior to January 1, 2012 were required a minimum of 80% attendance in each individual block. Various opportunities are offered to students to make up or retake the needed courses in order to raise proficiency. SAP is evaluated at the completion of each block, at which time students will receive notification of SAP or USAP (Unsatisfactory Academic Progress) with an attached report of their progress. In the event that a student is not making SAP, they will be notified in writing and may be placed on academic probation. If the student does not show attendance or academic improvement during their probationary period they may be withdrawn from the program. Students may remain eligible for financial aid during their probationary period. All program requirements must be completed within a maximum time frame of 1.5 times the normal program length, as measured in calendar time. Time spent on an approved leave of absence is not counted against the maximum time frame. MAXIMUM TIME FRAME SWINA Effective January 16th, 2012, Students who do not complete their program by their estimated graduation date (found on your enrollment contract), will: Meet with Student Services to sign a Maximum Time Frame Letter (this letter will inform the student of the latest date possible for the student to finish their program). Students exceeding their Maximum Time Frame will be dropped from their program) This policy will supersede previous versions located within your Student Handbook. This addendum will further assist in strengthening the overall development of its students. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO MEET SAP POLICY: Warning: Students will be placed on a warning for failure to meet academic, attendance, student conduct standards, or non - payment of tuition. Students will be notified in writing if they are placed on a warning. The warning will remain in effect until the next evaluation point, or as deemed necessary by the Administration, however it will not exceed a payment period. The terms and conditions will be specified per situation based on the student's individual needs to achieve academic success. Students who fail to successfully pass the warning period may be placed on an additional warning period, probation, or terminated from the program. PROBATION: Students may be placed on probation for failure to meet academic, attendance, student conduct standards, or non -payment of tuition. Students will be notified in writing if they are placed on probation. The probation will remain in effect until the next evaluation point, or as deemed necessary by the administration, however it will not exceed a payment period. The terms and conditions will be specified per situation based on the student's individual needs to achieve academic success. Students who fail to successfully pass the probation period may be placed on an additional probation period or terminated from the program. TERMINATION: In the event of termination, the student will be notified in writing and the Refund Policy shall prevail. 101 APPEALS : Every student has the right to appeal termination, probation, or any concerns in regards to their academic standing t o the Executive Director of the division and/or Director of Student or Online Operations. The appeal must be submitted in writing within three business days of notification and include supporting documentation as needed. To be included with the letter should be substantiating documentation from the student as to why s/he failed to meet SAP and what has changed the student's situation that will allow him/her to meet SAP by the next evaluation period. Administration will respond within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal request and notify the student in writing of the decision. All appeal decisions are final. Students reinstated upon appeal are on a probationary status until the next increment of evaluation and must meet the terms outlined in the letter granting the appeal. Any further breach of the rules or interference with the orderly conduct of the school may be cause for immediate termination without appeal. ACADEMIC PLAN: Upon a successful appeal, the Administration will develop an academic plan that the student will follow to ensure that s/he is able to meet SAP by a specific time, and may require more SAP evaluations than by the next payment period. ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF SAP: Factors that may also effect a student's ability to meet SAP include, but are not limited to; Incomplete grades, course withdrawals, course repetitions, non-credit course work, transfer of credit from other institutions. Please note, the same requirements are applied to transfers from one program to another within SWIHA/SWINA and must be cumulative. SWIHA/SWINA will count transfer hours which are accepted toward completion of a student's program as both hours attempted and hours completed. PROBATION If a student does not comply with the SAP, academic or behavioral standards of SWIHA or SWINA, they will be referred to their Academic Advisor, Director of Student or Online Operations, or Assistant Executive Director for counseling and placed on a probationary period as appropriate. SWIHA and SWINA uphold no tolerance for inappropriate/unsafe behavior in class (traditional or online). No student is allowed on campus if under the influence of intoxicating or mind altering substances. A student may be put on a one-incident probation period until all courses are completed or up to a month probation restricted completely from the campus, or from all online courses. 102 CANCELLATION OF A STUDENT FROM A PROGRAM -ONLINE Content (Policy language and/or procedural steps) the cancel policy has three components and applies to those students starting in a program. The policy is reviewed at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks. Each of these is detailed below. After the first week of class, if a student has not posted into any of their classes they will be withdrawn from the program and considered a \"no start.\" These students will have an opportunity to re-enroll at the next online start. After the first two weeks of classes, if a student does not have a minimum of one post in each week of each of their program classes, they will be cancelled from their program. These students will have an opportunity to re-enroll at the next online start. After 5 weeks from the start of an ONLINE program, a student must meet the following conditions: 1. 14 -day attendance policy compliance 2. Completed courses have an earned grade of 2 (\"C\") or better 3. A passing grade is being earned in currently running courses If a student is not meeting the above requirements after 5 weeks, their student advisor will evaluate their overall academic performance, then meet with them to determine which of the following options they will pursue: 1.To complete make-up work to comply with the requirements stated above before they reach their 100th earned course hour* ---If the requirements are not met prior to reaching their 100th earned course hour*, the student will be removed from their program with an opportunity to restart at a later date after completing a required complimentary Life Coaching session from SWIHA's resident Life Coach 2 . To be dropped from the program to restart at a later date after a required complimentary Life Coaching session from SWIHA's resident Life Coach *Note: after reaching 60% attendance in any course, the complete hours associated with that course are considered earned - therefore one can earn more hours than they have actually attended. CORRECTIVE ACTION In the event that corrective action is needed, a student advisement form will be issued. Areas which could be addressed are attendance, academic progress, financial responsibility, and/or behavioral modification. Student does not complying with academic or behavioral standards will be referred to the appropriate Academic Advisor, Director of Student or Online Operations, Director of Education or Executive Directors for coaching and will be issued an advisement form as appropriate. SWIHA and SWINA upholds no tolerance for inappropriate/unsafe or unethical behavior in class. No student is allowed on campus if under the influence of intoxicating or mind altering substances. A student may be put on a one-incident probation period until all courses are completed or up to a month probation restricted completely from the campus. Other advisements are based on the following scale: \u00b7 Warning #1 \u00b7 Warning #2 \u00b7 Probation \u00b7 Suspension \u00b7 Withdrawal 103 MAKE-UP WORK - SWIHA ON-CAMPUS Make- up is defined as attending the same class that was missed at a later date, (i.e., if class #4 of Anatomy was missed, then the make-up would be made in another class #4 of a later schedule Anatomy class). If there are no scheduled classes appropriate for a make-up, the student may be required to arrange a tutoring session with the instructor or teaching assistant, or complete an appropriate make- up assignment. When tests, assignments or hands-on evaluations are missed for required core classes, the student must complete them prior to graduation. A student must pick up a Make-up Form in Student Services before entering the classroom. Student Services will print out the classes within that course that were missed. This form must be verified and signed by the Instructor and returned with the daily attendance sheet to the Student Service Department in order to input the date the make-up was completed. (See our Tutoring policy if a similar class is not offered in time before student's completion.) MAKE-UP WORK - SWINA Students who are required to make up academic work or classroom hours must meet with the Director of Education to determine an appropriate action plan. This may include, but is not limited to: Attend an appropriate make-up class approved by the Instructor / Director of Education or schedule additional clinic floor time as approved by the Director of Education. When tests, assignments or hands-on evaluations are missed, the student has until the end of the next block to make them up. Failure to make up work in the allotted time may result in a requirement to repeat the block. Students will receive a make-up form from Student Services. It is the students' responsibility to have an instructor/clinic supervisor sign off on all make up work. In order to receive credit, students must return the completed make up form to Student Services. MAKE-UP WORK - ONLINE Make- up work for online classes is available at the discretion of the instructor. All make-up work must be submitted to the course conference by the end of the course. If extenuating circumstances exist, please contact your student advisor to petition for a deadline extension. Students with an I-D grade in an online class are required to make-up work by contacting the online student advisor. 104 TUTORING Tutoring is defined as a time arranged by the student and instructor/teaching assistant when the course material will be covered on an individual basis. Tutoring may be done to complete a course, raise a grade or to deepen the student's knowledge and skills and may be required in the case that a student is unable to schedule a make-up prior to graduation. Tutoring must be done on school grounds unless and off-campus tutoring session has been approved by the director of Education and the Director of Student Services, In order to schedule and confirm tutoring, please complete the following steps 1.Speak with the desired teacher to make tutoring date and time arrangements 2.Confirm these arrangements by paying for your scheduled tutoring time 24 hours in advance in Student Services by phone or in person. 3.Student Services will contact the teacher to confirm the scheduled date and time upon receipt of payment. 4.There is a 24-hour cancellation fee of the full tutorial amount if Student Services is notified less than 24 hours in advance of the scheduled tutoring date and time. *This policy remains the same for those making tutoring arrangements within less than 24 hours. The student must obtain the tutoring form from the Student Service Department and pay the tutoring fee before they can begin a tutoring session. After the session, the tutoring instructor must verify and sign this form, and return it to Student Services for the student to receive credit. The fee for attending a tutoring session is $25.00 per hour, which must be paid in the Student Service Department prior to attending the class. One to five students from the same class may attend the same make- up session and share this fee, providing the class content is appropriate for all. If the incomplete course work is not made up before graduation, an incomplete grade will be recorded on the student's transcript. Conversion of classroom hours into tutoring hours: \u00b7 Theory classes: 1 hour of tutoring = 4 hours class time. \u00b7 Hands-on classes: 2 hours of tutoring = 4 hours class time. \u00b7 No more than 40% of a class can be completed through tutoring or make-up assignments. (See Make-Up policy for attending a similar class at no charge .) Online students who wish to deepen their knowledge and skills through synchronous tutoring with their instructor should contact their student advisor. After payment has been received, the student advisor or student services representative will notify both the instructor and student so an appropriate time may be scheduled. Please Note: Tutoring time for online classes may only be utilized to deepen student understanding of a topic. It may not be utilized to make -up for missed assignments, or completed for academic credit after the course has ended. ADDING OR DROPPING CLASSES ON-CAMPUS program students of 600-hours or more must take their required courses as indicated on their schedule.* On- campus program and continuing education students may add or drop an elective course by completing an Add/Drop form in Student Services. ONLINE students may obtain this form by contacting their Online Academic Advisor. *Exceptions may be made by the student's academic advisor due to unforeseen extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control. Students must contact their academic advisor for final approval and re- scheduling. Course registration simply requires the completion of an \"add form\" in Student Services for continuing education or personal development students. 105 CLASS SUBSTITUTIONS Appropriate classes may be substituted for those printed in the calendar or handbook when necessitated by issues such as schedule changes, need to upgrade, current new techniques, modalities, or teacher availability. Please see student services for more information. AUDITING CLASSES SWIHA Students who successfully complete the course on the first attempt and who have paid in full for the class are welcome to audit most courses at any time to further their understanding of the material according to the following guidelines: 1.Standard priced classes may be audited at no charge for no credit on a space available basis. * 2.Standard priced classes previously taken at SWIHA may be audited for full credit at half the current tuition price on a space available basis. * 3.Premium priced classes may not be audited at no charge without prior permission of the instructor and the Education Coordinator 4.Courses taught by specialty instructors may only be taken for credit at half price, see student services for specific courses that fall under this guideline. 5.Supply fees must be paid at the time of registration when auditing a course and are non-refundable. 6.Online Courses are only eligible to audit for credit at this time. *Space available is defined as adequate physical space in the classroom and a student ratio, which does not put the class into an attendee count that requires an assistant solely for the auditing student(s). AUDIT FOR NO CREDIT (AUN) SWIHA students who have successfully completed a course with a passing grade, and who have paid in full for the course, are welcome to audit the same course at any time to further their understanding of the material according to the following guidelines: Students may register to audit courses on a space available basis. Space available is defined as adequate physical space in the classroom and a student ratio which does not put the class into an attendee count that requires an assistant solely for the auditing student(s).

Supply fees must be paid at the time of registration when auditing a course. Supply fees are non-refundable and are not issued to the student outside of class time. Students who do not attend the first class of the course will be dropped from the course. Online Courses are only eligible to audit for credit at this time. COURSE CANCELLATIONS Students are encouraged to register for classes early. Classes are subject to cancellation if six students are not registered and confirmed three days in advance of a course start date. If this should happen, SWIHA will refund all money paid by the student in the cancelled course. SWIHA reserves the right to suspend, cancel or postpone a class or classes after training has begun in the event of an occurrence that unavoidably limits the use of school facilities such as fire, flood, storm, war, or civil disorder. In such cases a pro-rata refund will be made of any fees or tuition prepaid by the student, unless the student elects to continue the training in a later class. If a class is cancelled and a student arrives without being notified of the cancellation, Student Services may offer the student any class being offered at the same time or a credit for a future class. Highest priority is given to rescheduling and satisfying the needs of the students. 106 GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS-SWIHA ON-CAMPUS/ONLINE 1. A final cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. 2.

The Campus Safety Policies cover issues concerning alcohol and drug use, crime prevention, the reporting of crimes, sexual assault, and other related matters. The Campus Crime Statistics cover crimes reported to the College over the previous three calendar years that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by the College, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY PROGRAM SWIHA is committed to the care and nurturing of our students during their educational experience. Students seeking help for chemical dependency problems will be treated with consideration and confidence. Confiding in an administrator regarding substance abuse issues is very different from using these substances while on campus. Students who are caught using, selling, or distributing illegal substances or alcohol while on campus will be immediately placed on probation or expelled. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAM Drug and alcohol abuse affects the workplace, as well as, our homes, our schools, and our community. The U.S. Department of Education requires colleges to implement a drug prevention and awareness program for their students and employees. Consumption of alcohol or drugs while attending class, or meeting with campus personnel is prohibited. This offence may be subjected to disciplinary action. SAFE CAMPUS POLICY GENERAL HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY SWIHA and SWINA are committed to a campus environment free from any form of discrimination and sexual harassment of any student or employee. This includes all online discussion conferences and course areas. Discrimination on the basis of gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, physical, developmental or emotional differences, or sexual orientation or sexual harassment including intimidation, or coercion will not be tolerated. Violation of SWIHA harassment, discrimination, or sexual harassment policies shall subject the offending parties to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination (faculty and staff) or expulsion (students). Retaliation for reporting such conduct will not be tolerated, the party(s) participating in the retaliation will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination (faculty and staff) or expulsion (students). Sexual harassment is an unlawful infringement of your right to attend school or work in an environment free from unlawful sexual conduct and pressure. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We strongly prohibit unlawful sexual harassment of applicants, students or any other person on or off our campus. Harassment of students can affect any student, regardless of sex, race, or age. Sexual harassment can threaten a student's physical or emotional well-being, influence how well a student does in school, and make it difficult for a student to achieve his or her career goals. Moreover, harassment, including sexual harassment is illegal --Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits discrimination, including sexual harassment. Preventing and remedying sexual harassment at SWIHA is essential to ensuring a nondiscriminatory, safe environment in which students can learn. Therefore, we encourage any student who believes he or she is being harassed in any way to immediately notify the Director of Education, or the Director of Student Operations. Any report of such behavior will be handled with utmost respect and confidentiality . If you have any questions about our policy, please request a full copy of it from a Student Advisor, the Director of Education or the Director of Student Operations. 109 REVISION POLICY SWIHA and SWINA reserve the right to revise and add to all policies as is deemed necessary and appropriate. Programs may be cancelled or postponed, instructors may change, and tuition rates may be adjusted during a student's program of study. Tuition rates published in the catalog at the time a student signs his or her enrollment contract will be honored for the selected program for the life of the contract. STUDENT/TEACHER RATIO We preserve an instructor/student ratio of the following to maintain a sound, educational learning process: SWIHA's student to teacher ratio on-campus is: \u00b7 Lecture = 50 students for 1 instructor \u00b7 Lab (Hands-on) = 15 students for 1 instructor. One assistant for each additional 16 students. \u00b7 SWIHA's student to teacher ratio online is approximately 20 students for one instructor. \u00b7 SWINA's student to teacher ratio is: \u00b7 Lecture = 40 students for one instructor \u00b7 Lab (Hands-on) = 20 students for one instructor. CONTINUING EDUCATION - SWINA SWINA Students are encouraged, but not required, to register for the various continuing education (CE's) courses that SWINA offers.

(All such relationships are prohibited for the duration of program enrollment; certificate, diploma or degree) . If a student is not in a program (i.e. Personal Development or Continuing Education), the prohibition remains in effect for the duration of the course or sequence of courses a student is registered for. Personal Dual relationships include: hiring students for work in your personal business or organization, bartering work for trade or intern hours with students currently registered in SWIHA programs, paying for referrals, socializing off campus in non-related environments including unsanctioned class parties, or any romantic (dating), sexual or social relationship. Additionally, attending lunch/dinner breaks off campus with students is prohibited. Instructors may see registered students as clients or patients professionally for services or treatment, provided the student is not enrolled in a course the instructor is teaching at the time of services. The only exception is when the services are specifically required and the interruption of such services would be detrimental to the student, or if such sessions are required as part of the student's course of study. (Example: The American Polarity Therapy Association requires that students receive sessions from their professional instructors in order to become eligible for membership in AMPTA). This policy applies to all students regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, or student consent to dual relationship. Any instructor choosing to create or allow a professional dual relationship with a student must fully disclose the costs and/ or fees and provide the same level of care they would provide for other patients or clients. Ultimately, instructors are responsible for upholding the standard of conduct/ethics as set forth by any governing or regulating agency that provides oversight to his/her occupation regarding dual relationships with clients and/or students.

This clinic is a vital part of the massage training. This practical experience is conducted on campus under the watchful eye of the Clinic Manager, Clinic Staff and other licensed massage therapists in the clinic, who guide the students with encouragement and individual training. Staff input decreases with time, until the student is conducting him/herself as a self-directed therapist. This clinic is open to the public to experience quality massage, bodywork, and energy work at a nominal fee. CLINICAL INTERNSHIP - SWINA In order to better prepare our graduates with real life experience, SWINA operates a full time aesthetics clinic.

Financial Aid is only available for approved programs. Financial Aid eligibility may require full time enrollment. RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS According to the Federal Student Aid Handbook, \"Title IV funds are awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded.\" Federal regulations [HEA Section 484B, 485(a)(1)(F), 34 CFR 668.22] require when a student withdraws, ceases attending, or is administratively withdrawn the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that the student was originally scheduled to receive. According to these regulations, the College and the student are allowed to retain only the amount of Title IV (federal) financial aid that is earned. The College is required by Federal regulation to determine the amount of Title IV grant or loan assistance (Federal Pell, FSEOG, Federal Direct Stafford Loan, and Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan) that the student earned as of the student's withdrawal/last day attended. The unearned portion of the Title IV aid must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program(s). This policy applies to students who complete 60% or less of the payment period for which they received Federal Title IV aid. A student who drops a class but still completes one or more classes does not qualify for the Return of Title IV Funds policy. The term \"Title IV aid\" refers to the following Federal financial aid programs: Unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford loans, Federal PLUS (Parent) loans, Federal Pell Grants, and Federal SEOG (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant). To conform to the policy, the College must determine the student's last day of attendance. For Title IV purposes, the last date of academic attendance is one of the following: the date the formal withdrawal process begins, the date the student otherwise gives official notice of intent to withdraw (e.g., letter, withdrawal form, in -person), or the last documented date of attendance in an academically-related activity (e.g., documented attendance in a class or lab or submission of an assignment in an on -line course ). The calculation required determines a student's earned and unearned Title IV aid based on the percentage of the payment period completed by the student. The percentage of the period that the student remained enrolled is derived by dividing the number of days the student attended by the number of days in the period. Calendar days (including weekends) are used, except institutional holidays and approved leaves of absence are excluded. Breaks of at least 5 days are excluded from both the numerator and denominator. 118 Clock hour programs Total number of clock hour's completed/Total number of clock hours in the payment period. Credit hour programs Total number of calendar day's completed/Total number of calendar days in the payment period. Until a student has passed the 60% point of an enrollment period, only a portion of the student's aid has been earned. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60% point is considered to have earned all awarded aid for the enrollment period. E arned aid is not related in any way to institutional charges . In addition, the College' s refund policy and Return to Title IV Fu n d s procedures are independent of one another. A student who withdraws from a course may be required to return unearned aid and still owe the college for the course. The responsibility to repay unearned Title IV aid is shared by the College and the student. For example, the calculation may require the College to return a portion of Federal funds to the Federal Title IV programs. In addition, the student may also be required to return funds based on the calculation. A student returns funds to the Federal Stafford loan programs based on the terms and conditions of the promissory note of the loan. A student who receives a Federal Pell Grant may be required to repay 50% of the funds received. Federal regulation requires that Title IV financial aid be used to cover only the length of time the student was enrolled before withdrawal, dismissal, or ceasing attendance. Disbursed funds for the purpose of this policy include funds disbursed and retained by the institution for allowable charges. Allowable charges are defined as tuition charges, books and other institutional fees. The College will return Title IV funds to the Title IV grant or loan assistance allocated among the Title IV programs in the following order of return: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan 3. Federal Direct PLUS Loan 4. Federal Pell Grant 5. Federal SEOG Post-withdrawal Disbursements These disbursements will be made in accordance with Federal Regulations. If a student is due a post- withdrawal disbursement, the disbursement must be made from available grant funds before available loan funds. The disbursement must be made within 90 days of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. After the eligible post -withdrawal disbursements are credited to the student's outstanding current semester charges, the institution must follow specific steps, outlined in Federal Regulations. Timeframe for the Return of Title IV Funds to the Federal Programs Return of Title IV Funds process will begin as soon as possible after it is determined that a student has withdrawn or ceased attendance. The College must determine the withdrawal date for a student who withdrew without providing notification no later than 30 days after the end of the semester. The College must return funds no later than 45 days after the date the College determined that the student withdrew. 119 OWNERSHIP & ADMINISTRATION Founder & Owner KC Miller, HHCP, LMT, APP, CHT, LC Owner Brian P.

AUXILIARY CLASSROOM A classroom site, geographically apart from and operated and supervised by the main or branch campus, at which instruction in one or more training programs is offered. An auxiliary classroom operates under the same ownership/authority and administrative policies and procedures as the accredited main campus and may or may not have its own faculty; however, the number and duties of administrative personnel are limited, and may include a receptionist or site supervisor. Enrollment activities and student support services, such as counseling, placement, or financial aid processing, are provided at the main or branch campus. AVOCATIONAL INSTITUTION A post-secondary institution that offers courses/programs designed exclusively for personal or professional development and enhancement. BRANCH CAMPUS A full-service facility, geographically apart from, but under the direction of the main campus, at which complete continuing education and training programs are offered. A branch operates under the same ownership/authority and administrative policies and procedures as the accredited main campus, but has comprehensive on-site administrative and support services including its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization, and its own budget. CLASSROOM EXTENSION A classroom site, geographically apart from, yet in close enough proximity for adequate oversight (usually not more than five miles) by the main or branch campus, at which instruction in one or more training programs is offered. A classroom extension operates under the same ownership/authority and administrative policies and procedures as the accredited main/branch campus and may or may not have its own faculty; however, the number and duties of administrative personnel are limited, but may include a site supervisor. Enrollment activities and student support services, such as counseling, placement, or financial aid processing, are provided at the main or branch campus. Classroom extensions are generally used as temporary sites (no more than 12 months) in order to allow an institution time to accommodate an overflow of students at the main or branch campus or are due to unique facility requirements for a specific program of study. COURSE A defined instructional unit which may be offered as a component of a program of study or as a stand-alone unit for personal and professional development. EXTERNSHIP/INTERNSHIP/PRACTICUM Training-related work or practical experience which is: (1) formally part of a program; (2) based upon a preplanned outline of experience/skills to be acquired; (3) an application of previously studied knowledge and skills; (4) formalized through a signed agreement between the institution and site; (5) systematically supervised by a qualified individual at the institution and the externship site; and (6) evaluated by both the on-site supervisor and the institution's staff member based on established criteria. 151 INSTITUTION A clearly defined, appropriately authorized entity, which has or seeks accreditation, and conducts activities within the scope of the accrediting authority of ACCET. INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION A term that describes the extent of ACCET's grant of accreditation of an entity, including all education and training activities of the institution that are within the scope of ACCET's accrediting authority. By contrast, the term \"programmatic accreditation,\" which is not offered by ACCET, refers to the accreditation that is granted to a program rather than an institution as a whole.
