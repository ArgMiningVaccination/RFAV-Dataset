Key Facts The new rule, which will take effect on Sept. 20, will require people to show a vaccine card, QR code or photo of their vaccine card or take a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours of the start of the event to enter. Event organizers will not be allowed to permit people who attest to taking the Covid-19 vaccination to enter the event without proof. The rule will apply to what California calls \"mega events\" with 1,000 or more people in attendance, which includes conventions, conferences, expos, sporting events and concerts. Event organizers will need to inform people of the rules on their website, ticketing and other forms of communications, so people are aware before the event. The new rule will remain in place until Nov. 1, and the state will reassess closer to that date to see if an extension is needed.
