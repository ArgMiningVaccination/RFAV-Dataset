Michelle at Lotus Naturopathy & Massage has been one of those things. The way she consults is like you've been friends for a very long time... I feel completely at ease and feel that Michelle is only interested in what is going to improve my quality of life. I can't thank her enough!\" - Troy (Sydney) \"Had a massage with Kate last month and it was one of the best remedial massages I've had since moving to the coast 5 years ago. I've been trying to find a remedial massage therapist ever since moving up and just had never quite found one that got it quite right for me. Kate listened to what I wanted and stayed away from the areas I didn't want her to go near (which everyone else just ignores) all in all I couldn't be happier. - Nick (Central Coast) \"Michelle has been helping with my weight loss journey and it has been a great experience, I feel the healthiest I have been in a long time and the weight is coming off. Michelle is very supportive and the program is very personalised to help you achieve your goals. I also had my 1st massage with Kate recently, what a relaxing experience and just what I needed, can't wait for my next one. Highly recommend.\" - Jennifer (Central Coast) \"Professional service and great advice. Living remote I am glad I can access a superb practitioner, and herbal remedies here's to being well!\" - Peter (Mid-North Coast) \"Very personable asnd professional experience. Highly recommend! Thank you Michelle your work is amazing!\" - Ray (Central Coast) \"Thank you Kate for an amazing massage. The added cupping was a great way to release a lot of tension without being left feeling tender. Highly recommend Lotus naturopathy & massage. \" - Jodie (Central Coast) \"Michelle is a brilliant Naturopath who has helped my son and I with a number of health problems that our regular doctors and specialists were unable to resolve. These problems included identification of gut and digestive issues that led to significant pain and discomfort and behavioural problems with my son, healthy management of mental health issues, strengthening my immune system as a preventative measure due to a gene mutation which has put me at a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and helping me with healthy weight gain. Michelle conducts an extremely thorough analysis to drill down to identify the root cause of any underlying health problems. My family can't recommend Michelle enough!\" - Tiffany (Central Coast) So where to begin...I started seeing Michelle a year ago for treatment (recommended by my physio) to my back with 2 slipped discs. Could barely stand let alone walk around. A year on, walking, running and riding again with little to no pain. She is very passionate and knowledgeable about the treatment she gives you. Being massage and naturopathy/ nutrition. Highly Recommendable. Happy to fit you in on week days and well as weekends to suit. You won't be disappointed in her friendly service. - Paul (Jerrys Plains) Our Location Lotus Naturopathy & Massage is located at Shop 4, 53 Pacific Highway, Ourimbah.
