[Nina Kahn](/profile/nina-kahn-10191473)and [Brittany Beringer](/profile/brittany-beringer-81255567) Using crystals for their spiritual and healing properties is a fun way to connect with the earth's energy. But it can be daunting to figure out the spiritual meaning of [crystals](https://www.bustle.com/p/5-crystals-for-stress-relief-how-to-use-them-to-feel-more-zen-18799729) when there are so many to choose from, especially if you're relatively new to the crystal healing game.

Choosing crystals based on their color can help you support whatever intentions you have for working with crystals. Because every color in crystal healing has its own associations, a purple crystal's meaning will be totally different than a pink crystal's meaning. The color symbolism of crystals generally correlates with that of other esoteric practices, such as [color magic](https://www.allure.com/story/color-magic-witchcraft-meanings-guide) or the traditional eastern [system of the chakras](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-balance-your-chakras-according-to-spiritual-experts-18222357). In these practices, different colors relate to different aspects of your physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. \"Each lightwave and subsequent color tone has a different frequency it naturally emits light from,\" [Mariah K. Lyons](https://www.instagram.com/mariahklyons/?hl=en), a crystal healer and founder of crystal footwear brand [ASTARA](https://astaracollective.com/pages/about-astara), tells Bustle. \"Some are slower and denser lightwaves, and some are quick and faster lightwaves and frequencies. The frequency of the color will then correspond to the same energetic tone of the energetic centers of the body, known as [chakras](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-balance-your-chakras-according-to-spiritual-experts-18222357).\" Chakras, or energetic centers in the body, also correspond with a specific color \u2014 so the hue of your crystal babies does play a role in its overall utility. According to Lyons, aligning the tint of your gemstone with its analogous chakra color can help supercharge your intentions. \"Each chakra corresponds to a different color frequency, so crystals that resonate within that color frequency will help to balance and harmonize that particular energetic center,\" explains Lyons. You don't need to be an expert in any spiritual study in order to make your own educated guess about a crystal color meaning.
