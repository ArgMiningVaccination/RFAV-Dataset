I had to get stitches and the dr gave me a tetanus shot as well. It's been 11 years since my last one! My question is, am I at risk for getting tetanus since I got a steroid shot 24 hours earlier? To my understanding, the steroid shot weakens the immune system response! I told the dr I got a steroid injection 24 earlier, and he still gave me tetanus. Please help calm me down!

Dickinson](/Expert/1457212-Gordon-M-Dickinson)Infectious Disease Specialist Miami, FL You do not state your age, but you have had one tetanus shot and probably even others in childhood. So, I doubt you are at much risk if you did not get the shot now. And while the steroid shot may dull your response, I do not think you have any worry, especially not from a wine fence! "}
