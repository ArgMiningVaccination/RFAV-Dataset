Penfold, Secretary V'Ella Warren, TreasurerTHE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON www.washington.edu/home/about.html2 THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 3 Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-assisted institutions of higher education on the Pacific coast. From its original site on a 10-acre tract of wooded wilderness that is now located in downtown Seattle, the campus has grown to comprise 703 acres of trees, landscape, and buildings. Located between the shores of Lake Washington and Lake Union, it is in a residential section of the city that long has been considered oneof the most attractive in the nation. Two additional campuses, one south of Seattle in Tacoma, and one north in Bothell,were opened in 1990. Enrollment at the University in autumn quarter 2001 was almost 40,000, including its campuses in Bothell and Tacoma, of which 29,000 were undergraduates and the balance were in professional and graduate programs. Almost 90 per-cent of the undergraduates enter as freshmen from Washington high schools or as transfer students from Washingtoncommunity colleges or other colleges and universities in the state. The grade-point average for the regularly admittedfreshman class entering in autumn quarter 2001 was 3.63. In 2001, the full-time teaching faculty of the Universitynumbered 3,400 members. Mission Statement Founded 4 November 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the Pacific coast. The University is comprised of three campuses: the Seattle campus is made up of seventeen schools and colleges whose faculty offer educational op portunities to students ranging from first-year undergraduates through doctoral-level candidates; the Bothell and Tacoma campuses, each developing a distinctiv e identity and undergoing rapid growth, offer diverse programs to upper-division undergraduates and to graduate students. The primary mission of the University of Washington is the preservation, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge. The Unive rsity preserves knowledge through its libraries and collections, its courses, and the scholarship of its faculty. It advances new knowledge through many forms of research, inquiry, and discussion; and dis- seminates it through the classroom and the laboratory, scholarly exchanges, creative practice, international education, and pub lic service. As one of the nation's out- standing teaching and research institutions, the University is committed to maintaining an environment for objectivity and imag inative inquiry and for the original schol- arship and research that ensure the production of new knowledge in the free exchange of diverse facts, theories, and ideas. To promote their capacity to make humane and informed decisions, the University fosters an environment in which its students ca n develop mature and independent judgment and an appreciation of the range and diversity of human achievement. The University cultivates in its students both cr itical thinking and the effective articula- tion of that thinking. As an integral part of a large and diverse community, the university seeks broad representation of and encourages sustained par ticipation in that community by its stu- dents, its faculty, and its staff. It serves both non-traditional and traditional students. Through its three-campus system and through educational outreach, evening degree and distance learning programs, it extends educational opportunities to many who would not otherwise have access to them . The academic core of the University of Washington is its College of Arts and Sciences; the teaching and research of the Univers ity's many professional schools provide essential complements to these programs in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural and mathematical sciences. Progra ms in law, medicine, forest resources, oceanography and fisheries, library science, and aeronautics are offered exclusively (in accord with state law) by the Universi ty of Washington. In addition, the University of Washington has assumed primary responsibility for the health science fields of dentistry and public health, and o ffers education and training in medicine for a multi-state region of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The schools and colleges of architecture and urban planning, busi ness administration, education, engi- neering, nursing, pharmacy, public affairs, and social work have a long tradition of educating students for service to the regi on and the nation. These schools and col- leges make indispensable contributions to the state and, with the rest of the university, share a long tradition of educating u ndergraduate and graduate students towards achieving an excellence that well serves the state, the region and the nation. Board of Regents February 1981; revised February 1998 President's Message A university is a community of scholars and artists, a place where faculty and students communicate with each other to enrich human understanding. Universities have played an essential role in societies for hundreds of years, promoting learning and culture, generating new knowledge, and training pro-fessionals in specialized callings. The University of Washington is one of thefinest universities in the world. It is also an exciting place to be, with a lively interplay of teaching, research, and public service. Its contributions to the state, the nation, and the world willcontinue to grow as we face the challenges of the twenty-first century. Richard L.

An adviser in the Gateway Center assists them indesigning a program of studies to meet general requirements and provides them with information about possible major fields of study. Advising also pro- vides the following: assistance in exploring academic options; information aboutdegree programs; pre-professional advising for such areas as medicine, den- tistry, and law; options for students on academic probation; preliminary career counseling; and a wide range of information on registration, course offerings,degree requirements, and administrative procedures. Freshman Interest Groups depts.washington.edu/figs/ A Freshman Interest Group (FIG) is a group of 20 to 25 new UW freshmen with similar academic interests who are enrolled in the same schedule of classesduring their first quarter on campus. All FIGs include a schedule of courses which meet general education requirements and are suitable for students newUNDERGRADUATE STUDY 7 UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 8 to university studies. FIGs are a great registration option for students interested in joining a supportive and friendly learning community which helps them getoff to a good start at the UW. In one of their shared courses, FIG students come together with an undergraduate peer instructor for a weekly seminar called General Studies 199: The University Community. This class introduces FIG stu-dents to various aspects of the UW community, including an exploration of University resources and opportunities, and academically related skill develop- ment. Freshman Seminars depts.washington.edu/leader/2_building/ freshman_seminars.html The Freshman Seminar Program offers first-year students access to small, dis- cussion-oriented classes that many UW students may not experience until theyare juniors or seniors. Distinguished UW faculty members teach these seminars on a topic of personal or professional interest. Freshman Seminars provide an intimate setting for engaging discussion between students and the professor.These seminars are particularly appropriate for students who want a first look at an unfamiliar field of study. Internships and Volunteering depts.washington.edu/leader/4_learning/index.html Internships and volunteer opportunities engage students in challenging experi- ences in the community and can help clarify values and life goals, assist inexploring career interests, and lay the foundation for a lifelong commitment to public service. Students who are interested in receiving information about vol- unteer opportunities and internships in the public sector (community-basedorganizations, government agencies, and educational institutions) can sub- scribe to an email list. New Student Orientation depts.washington.edu/nsp/orientation/orientation.html Orientation is the opportunity to get ready for life at the UW before classes actu- ally begin. Incoming students come onto campus for one to three days and areintroduced to campus life by student orientation leaders. Orientation offers stu- dents the opportunity to hear firsthand about the experiences of current stu- dents, as well as about strategies to help them make the most of their time atthe UW. In addition, students register for classes, learn about different degree programs, make connections with other students, and begin to explore the wealth of campus resources and opportunities. Pipeline Project www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/pipeline/ The Pipeline Project links undergraduate students with educational and service opportunities within the Seattle Public Schools. The Pipeline Project recruits,trains, and places students as volunteer tutors in the schools throughout the academic year. Working with the Carlson Center, Pipeline provides school- based service learning placements for a wide range of classes. Elementary,middle, and high school classrooms become a laboratory where UW studentshave the opportunity to work with younger students, applying classroom les- sons to the tutoring or mentoring experience. Each quarter, Pipeline offers EDUC 401 seminars where students tutor or work in the schools from 2 1/2 to 5 hoursper week as well as attend a bi-weekly seminar on current educational topics. Pipeline also offers students the opportunity to spend spring break in a rural community to work on literacy projects with local schoolchildren. Undergraduate Research Program www.washington.edu/research/urp/ The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) facilitates research experiences for undergraduates with UW faculty members in all the disciplines. URP staffassist students in planning for an undergraduate research experience, identify- ing faculty mentors and projects, defining research goals, presenting and pub- lishing research findings, obtaining academic credit, and seeking funding fortheir research. URP maintains a listing of current UW research opportunitiesand other national programs and opportunities on the program Web site. Scholarships www.washington.edu/students/ugrad/scholar/ The Undergraduate Scholarship Office serves as a clearinghouse of informa- tion on merit-based scholarships for current UW students. Scholarship informa-tion and services are made available through the Undergraduate ScholarshipOffice Web site, a listserv, quarterly workshops, and individual advising appoint-ments. The Office also serves as the nominating office for national scholarshipcompetitions. For these awards, the Office organizes the campus process to identify and assist student applicants to prepare for national competitions. Service Learning depts.washington.edu/leader/3_service/index.html Offered as an integral component of many UW courses, service learning pro- vides a unique opportunity for students to combine course work with communi-ty service. In a service learning course, students can choose a pathway allow- ing for work in the community while engaging in specially designed academic course work. Service learning can provide an enriching perspective on coursereadings and assignments as students learn more about the subject, them- selves, and the world. Transfer and Returning Student Interest Groups depts.washington.edu/nsp/trig/trig.html Transfer and Returning Student Interest Groups (TRIGs) create small learning communities to help incoming transfer and returning students navigate theUniversity. Each TRIG brings a small number of students with similar interests together in one or two academic courses and a 1-credit seminar led by an expe- rienced UW undergraduate. TRIGs are available for students who have chosena major as well as for students who have yet to decide on a major. The Halbert and Nancy Robinson Center for YoungScholars Guthrie Annex 2 Director Kathleen Noble depts.washington.edu/cscy/ The Halbert and Nancy Robinson Center for Young Scholars at the University of Washington is a national leader in recognizing and serving the needs of gifted young college and pre-college students. The Center is the gateway through which academically talented students can enter the UW after two or fewer years of secondary school through the Transition School/Early Entrance Program andthe UW Academy for Young Scholars. It promotes these young UW scholars through mentoring, advising, and support services during their pre-college and undergraduate years, and conducts longitudinal follow-up studies to monitorand refine program activities. The Center also creates and pursues knowledgeabout the expressions and challenges of giftedness and disseminates this knowledge through courses, scholarly forums, community activities, and in- service programs for K-12 school personnel. University Honors Program 211 Mary Gates Hall Director Ana Mari Cauce depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/ The four-year University Honors Program features special advising, honors courses, honors sections of regular courses, faculty/student colloquia, andopportunities for independent study. It provides expanded opportunities for undergraduate education to those students who show exceptional intellectual promise. To be considered for admission to the University Honors Program at entrance, students must apply to the Honors Program when they submit their Application for Undergraduate Admission to the University. Selection is based on high school records, test scores, an essay, and recommendations from the second-ary school. Students also may seek admission based on their academic per-formance during their freshman year at the University. When an honors student is accepted into a department that offers an honors curriculum, usually by the junior year, that student is graduated \"With College Honors\" in the appropriate discipline. Students who are not members of theUniversity Honors Program, but who demonstrate exceptional abilities in a par-ticular field of study may, at the invitation of their department, participate in adepartmental honors curriculum and receive a degree \"With Distinction\" in the major field. By special arrangement, it is possible for students to complete adegree \"With College Honors\" in departments not offering a formal honorsoption. Intercollege Programs The following programs, described in detail in other sections of the catalog, areadministered by the Office of Undergraduate Education. General Studies 171 Mary Gates Hall Adviser David Sayrs www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/ gen_studies.html General Studies provides students an opportunity to obtain an individually designed interdisciplinary degree through the College of Arts and Sciences.Students may also pursue a major in one of several existing interdisciplinary programs. Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree are shown in the Arts and Sciences section of this catalog Center for Quantitative Science 306 Mary Gates Hall Director B. Bruce Bare depts.washington.edu/cqs/ The Center for Quantitative Science in Forestry, Fisheries, and Wildlife is an intercollege academic unit sponsored by the Office of UndergraduateEducation, the College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences, and the College of Forest Resources. The Center offers courses in mathematics and statistical methods as applied to problems in biology, ecology, the environment, andrenewable-resource management for undergraduate students. The faculty of the Center includes members of the College of Forest Resources and the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, as well as other units. The quantitative sci-ence minor is designed to give undergraduates majoring in biology, ecology,the environment, and renewable-resource management programs a thorough grounding in relevant statistical and mathematical modeling methodology. Program on Africa 274 Mary Gates Hall Associate Director Sandra Chait depts.washington.edu/poa/ The Program on Africa activi-ties at the UW. It aims to foster an interest in the African continent and its Diaspora, with the ultimate goal of involving knowledgeable, well-trained, andcommitted students and graduates in Africa's political, cultural, medical, tech- nological, and economic future. PoA offers undergraduate students a minor inAfrican Studies with courses drawn from disciplines as varied as fisheries, anthropology, social work, history, public health, art, and music. Program on the Environment 274 Mary Gates Hall Directors John M. Palka Craig ZumBrunnen depts.washington.edu/poeweb/ The Program on the Environment (PoE) fosters and promotes interdisciplinary environmental education at the UW by linking scholars active in environmentalfields from across the University to build a trans-disciplinary network of educa- tors, students, and researchers. PoE offers an undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies, a minor in Environmental Studies, and three graduatecertificate programs. The program provides students knowledge in four domains of inquiry: natural sciences; social sciences; law, policy, and management; and ethics, values, and culture. PoE merges these fields through rigorous course-work and hands-on learning to provide a unique opportunity for students andfaculty to explore complex environmental issues from multiple perspectives. Undergraduate Majors www.washington.edu/students/ugrad/advising/majmenu.html To graduate from the UW, students must complete one of the majors listed below. In many cases, the student need not make a final choice until the begin-ning of the junior year, although programs with considerable mathematics and science (e.g., engineering and premedicine) include lock-step requirements that must be started early on if the student expects to finish in four years. Students can enter some majors directly (e.g., those in Ocean and Fishery Sciences, most in Forest Resources, and some in Arts and Sciences), but most students start out as premajors. As premajors, they take courses to fulfill gener- al requirements and admission requirements for the major. Many majors requireone or two years of pre-admission course work, although a few require more. Admission to many majors is competitive, which means students may not be accepted even if they complete all the prerequisite course work, depending ontheir grades and other factors. The General Catalog shows requirements for all majors, but students should see an adviser to ask about changes, course sequences, or new options. Satisfactory Progress www.washington.edu/students/reg/satprog.html Students admitted to the University to pursue baccalaureate degrees are expected to make satisfactory progress toward the attainment of the degreeand are expected to enter a major and to graduate after completion of a rea- sonable number of credits. By the time undergraduate students have completed 105 credits, they must either be accepted in their major or have their premajor status extended tem-porarily by an adviser. Extensions are normally granted only to students whoare in the final phases of completing admission requirements for a major to which they have a reasonable chance of acceptance. Students who do not either declare a major or have their premajor status extend- ed by the time they have earned 105 credits will have a \"hold\" placed againstregistration for the following quarter. Students must normally graduate with their first baccalaureate degree by the time they have completed 30 credits beyond the credits required for the firstdegree or concurrent degrees. Departmental advisers may grant extensionsbeyond the 30-credit limit. Postbaccalaureate students are expected to be either preparing for admission into a degree program, seeking an additional baccalaureate degree. Studentsadmitted as \"postbaccalaureate undeclared\" must declare a major by the timeUNDERGRADUATE STUDY 9 UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 10 they have earned 30 credits beyond their last degree, and once a degree objec- tive has been declared, must make progress toward that degree as evidenced by the courses they have completed satisfactorily. Advisers may grant exten-sions beyond the 30-credit limit. The Faculty Council on Academic Standards may terminate a student's enroll- ment if the student demonstrates lack of academic progress as evidenced by excessive course repeats, course drops, or University withdrawals and cancel-lations. The student may be reinstated with the approval of the student's college and the council. EOP students may be reinstated in consultation with the Office of Minority Affairs.

Freshman Admission www.washington.edu/students/uga/fr/ A freshman applicant is one who has not attempted college course work after leaving high school . This classification includes participants in the Washington State Running Start Program as long as they do not enroll in another degree-seeking program after leaving high school and before enrolling at the UW. Admission Policy The University offers admission to those applicants who will most benefit fromand contribute to the University's educational resources. In selecting the fresh- man class, the University does not make its admission decisions solely on the basis of past academic accomplishments. Important academic objectives arefurthered when classes are composed of students with diverse talents, skills, interests, and backgrounds. Admission is competitive, which means that there are more applicants who meet the minimum qualifications than the University can accommodate. Applicantsare evaluated on the rigor of their curriculum; their grades and test scores; activ-ities or accomplishments; educational goals; living experiences, such as grow- ing up in an unusual or disadvantaged environment; family educational back- ground and socioeconomic status; special talents; and cultural awareness. Thelist is not exhaustive, and the factors are not of equal weight; moreover, no sin- gle factor is sufficient to confer admission.

These requirements, summarized in the box above, are known as the core subject requirements . The table on page 14 summarizes the number of years of study required in each core subject. Almost all successful applicants will have satisfied these requirements through high school course work, which is generally defined as course work completed in grades 9-12. Because these are admission \u2014not graduation\u2014requirements, they must be completed before enrolling at the UW. For applicants whose high school preparation is insufficient in anysubject, there are several ways to satisfy a core requirement before enrolling at the University.In general, five quarter credits (or three semester credits) of college-level course work at a college or university count as the equivalent of one year of high school study. Applicants should contact Admissions if they have taken or are planningto take a course in high school that is not mentioned here but may satisfy one of the core subject requirements. Minimum Grades in Core Courses A passing grade is the minimum to meet a core requirement. This includes a Pass (in a course taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis) or a D. There are additionalgrade requirements in Mathematics. Selecting the Freshman Class The top half of eligible applicants are admitted based on academic perform-ance (grades and test scores). The remainder is selected after comprehensivereview. The remainder of the freshman class is selected after a comprehensive review. Both academic and personal elements are considered in this review. While com- mitment to intellectual development and academic progress continues to be ofprimary importance, the Personal Statement forms an integral part of the review. Academic Performance The applicant's academic performance, as measured by grades and testscores, is a major factor in the admission decision. No student with a cumula-tive high-school grade-point average (GPA) below 2.00 will be considered for admission. An unweighted GPA based on a 4.00 scale is calculated for every appli- cant. Applicants for freshman admission are required to submit scores from the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT I) or the American College Test (ACT). Students unable to provide test scores may include, along with the rest of their application file, a petition to be considered without scores. If an applicant submits scores from more than one sitting of the same test (March and October SAT I), or scores from different tests (SAT I and ACT),the highest combined score from a single test date will be used. The best mathematics score from one test date will not be combined with the best verbal score from another test date. Freshman Comprehensive Review The following elements are among those considered in the FreshmanComprehensive Review: completion of a substantial number of academic courses beyond the required minimum; a challenging senior-year curriculum; enrollment in honors, Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate courses; enrollment in college and university courses while in high school; academic awards; school and community activities; educational and economic disadvantage, cultural awareness, and personal adversity; grade trends; persistent evidence of an unusually competitive grading system in the high school; and documented evidence of exceptional artistic talent. Participants in Dual Credit Programs: Running Start Program and College in the High School TheRunning Start Program allows 11th- and 12th-grade students to enroll in certain colleges for college credit. College in the high school , which may go under names such as dual enrollment or dual credit, allows high school stu-dents to take college courses at their local high school and receive college credit. Students who matriculate (enroll to earn a degree) at another college or university after leaving high school are not considered freshman applicants. Admission Policy Dual-credit applicants are evaluated for admission on the basis of high schooland college grades, admission test scores, and supplemental materials. They must satisfy UW core subject requirements for admission by complet- ing the appropriate high school or college courses. See page 14 for a com- plete discussion of these requirements. Whether high school or college grades weigh more heavily in the admission decision depends on the number of transferable credits completed and onfile in the Admissions Office by the application closing date (January 15 for autumn quarter). If a significant number of transferable college credits are on file\u201440 or more\u2014the college grades are more likely to have the greaterimpact on the admission decision. Due to the early freshman closing date of January 15, it is unlikely that Running Start students will qualify under the terms of the Direct Transfer Admission Agreement. Application Procedures Use the freshman application, electronic or paper. Apply by the January 15 freshman application closing date for summer (degree status) or autumn, regardless of the number of college credits you have taken or will have taken . Academic Planning Running Start students will benefit from recognizing this tension: in many aspects of the admission and transfer process, they are considered as highschool applicants while in other ways they are treated as transfer students. Applicants who will complete a significant number of college credits are well advised to begin academic planning, to make the most of Running Start credit.Many of the pages in Transfer Admission & Planning , especially the section on Academic Planning, will be helpful. Keep in mind that you have established a college record. Grades you earn now could affect admission to your intended major. If you anticipate earning an associate degree through Running Start, you will be expected to declare a major at the end of your first quarter at the UW. See Satisfactory Progress Policy, page 9.UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 13 ENGLISH 4 MATHEMATICS 3 SOCIAL SCIENCE 3 FOREIGN LANGUAGE 2 SCIENCE 2 THE ARTS 12 ACADEMIC ELECTIVES 12UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 14 High School Core Subject Requirements If taken in high school: If made up through college course work:* Four years of study are required, at least three of which must be in composition and literature. One of the four years may be satisfied bycourses in drama as literature, public speaking, debate, journalisticwriting, business English, or English as a Second Language (ESL).(English courses taken in foreign countries are considered ESL,except those taken in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.) Courses that are generally not acceptable include those identified as remedial or applied (e.g., acting, basicEnglish skills, developmental reading, library, newspaper staff, reme-dial English, review English, vocabulary, yearbook/annual).For the composition/literature component, generally any course with an English or Writing prefix is acceptable. (However, courses such asdevelopmental or speed reading, vocabulary, or remedial English arenot acceptable.) One of the four years may be satisfied by a collegecourse in speech, drama as literature, journalistic writing, business English, ESL, or engineering/technical writing. Three years of mathematics study are required, at the minimum level of algebra, geometry, and advanced (second-year) algebra.(Preferably, the second year of algebra included a component of intro-ductory trigonometry, but this is not mandatory.) More advanced math-ematics courses are recommended, such as trigonometry, mathemat- ical analysis, elementary functions, and calculus. Arithmetic, pre-alge- bra, business mathematics, and statistics courses will not counttoward the requirement. An algebra course taken in the eighth grademay satisfy one year of the requirement if second-year algebra iscompleted in high school.If your high school preparation in mathematics was insufficient, you must complete one of the courses listed below: A course in intermediate algebra. At UW Educational Outreach, as well as at many community colleges in Washington, MATH 098 (for-merly 101) is the necessary course. The course must be completed with a grade of \"C\" (2.0) or better, even though it does not transfer to the UW as college credit and the grade earned in the course innot used in computing the transfer GPA. A course in trigonometry or its equivalent. The course must be com- pleted with a grade of \"C\" (2.0) or better. MATH 107 (Mathematics: A Practical Art) or its equivalent. The course must be completed with a grade of \"C\" (2.0) or better. Mathematics courses with intermediate algebra as a prerequisite (except statistics courses). This includes any higher-level mathcourse such as elementary functions, calculus, and beyond. Three years of study are required in history or in any of the social sci- ences, e.g., anthropology, contemporary world problems, economics,geography, government, political science, psychology, sociology.Credit awarded for student government, leadership, community serv-ice, or other applied or activity courses will not count toward the requirement.Courses in the social sciences-e.g., anthropology, economics, ethnic studies, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology- will count toward the requirement. Two years of study are required, so that the applicant completes the second full year of study in a single foreign language. The two yearsmust be in sequence, with no repetition of any prior term of study. Anynatural language that has been formally studied may be used to satis-fy this requirement, including American Sign Language (ASL, the lan- guage of the deaf community), and languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. However, neither computer \"languages\"nor forms of deaf signing aside from ASL are acceptable. A foreign-language course taken in the eighth grade may satisfy one year of therequirement if the second-year course is completed in high school.For admission, each quarter of language in college is considered equivalent to one year in high school. Applicants who have never stud-ied a foreign language will need to complete 10 quarter credits (twoterms) of a single foreign language. However, an applicant who stud- ied French for one year in high school needs to complete only the sec- ond quarter (e.g., FRENCH 102) or the second semester of a first-yearlanguage sequence. Of course, a student may prefer to begin with101 to refresh his/her memory. The foreign-language admission requirement will be considered satisfied for students from non-English-speaking countries who en tered the United States educational system at the eighth grade or later. Applicants who believes they have acquired sufficient knowledge of a foreign lan- guage without formal study should contact the Office of Admissions to arrange for an examination. Applicants who have a documented disability that would interfere significantly with the study of a foreign language may petitio n to substitute course work about a foreign culture for the language requirement. ASL course work as well as proven proficiency with this langu age are accept- ed by the UW as meeting foreign-language requirements. Consult with an Admissions counselors for further information. Two years of science are required, of which one full year-both semes- ters in the same field-must be completed in the basic principles ofbiology, chemistry, or physics, with a laboratory experience. The sec-ond year of science may be completed in any course that satisfies thehigh school's graduation requirement in science. Two years of agricul-tural science are equivalent to one year of science.College science courses with a lab will count toward the laboratory science portion of the requirement. Any course in astronomy, atmos-pheric science, biological structure, biology, botany, chemistry, envi-ronmental science (but not environmental studies), genetics, geology, oceanography, physical anthropology, physical geography, physics, or zoology will count toward the second-year requirement, as will intro-ductory courses in biological or physical science. One-half year or one trimester of study is required in the fine, visual, or performing arts, to be chosen from art appreciation, band, ceramics, choir, dance, dramatic performance and production, drawing, fiberarts, graphic arts, metal design, music appreciation, music theory,orchestra, painting, photography, print making, and sculpture.Courses generally not acceptable include architecture, color guard,creative writing, drafting, drill team, fashion design, interior design,sewing, speech, woodworking, and yearbook.Two quarter credits (2 semester credits) chosen from any of the fol- lowing subjects will satisfy the requirement: art, art history,cinema/filmmaking, dance, music, and photography; any course indrama except drama-as-literature courses. Courses in architectureare generally not acceptable, except for those in architectural history. Electives are courses in the six subject areas (defined above) in which you have completed more than the minimum number of year s. One-half year of study is required, to be chosen from the six subject areas defined above.Two quarter credits or 1.5 semester credits chosen from the six sub- ject areas described above count toward this requirement. *In general, 5 quarter credits (or 3 semester credits) at the college level count as the equivalent of one year of high school study.Transfer Credit Policy www.washington.edu/students/#TRANSFER The UW grants full transfer credit for dual-credit courses if they are college level, recorded on a college transcript, and satisfy UW transfer credit policies, as specified in the Academic Credit section of this catalog. Scholarships Students in dual-credit programs are eligible for consideration for freshman scholarships, no matter how many college credits they have or will have com- pleted, as long as they graduate from high school before enrolling at the UW.

University Admission Policy Admission to the University of Washington is competitive, which means that there are more applicants who meet the minimum qualifications than theUniversity can accommodate. Transfer applicants are evaluated and ranked ontheir completion of core subject requirements, their grades and test scores,and supplemental factors. Admission to the University of Washington is competitive, which means that there are more applicants who meet the minimum qualications than theUniversity can accommodate. Transfer applicants are evaluated and ranked on their completion of core subject requirements, their grades and test scores,and supplemental factors. Priority is given to students applying for the third or junior year. The University's policy is to offer admission to those applicants who are most able to benefit from and contribute to the University's educational resources.The University does not make its admission decisions solely on the basis of pre- dicted academic performance. Important academic objectives are furthered by classes composed of students having talents and skills derived from diverse backgrounds. Factors that contribute to this diversity include but are not limited to cultural awareness; activities or accomplishments; educational background and goals;living experiences, such as growing up in an unusual or disadvantaged envi- ronment; and special talents. This list is not exhaustive, and the factors are not of equal weight; moreover, no single factor is sufficient to confer admission.Furthermore, no factor will confer admission on an academically unqualified applicant. Personal Statement All transfer applicants should submit a Personal Statement. Although technical- ly not required of applicants qualifying for admission under the Direct TransferAgreement, it is strongly recommended. Complete instructions for the Personal Statement are provided on the Web site or in Transfer Admission & Planning . Pathways to Transfer Admission All transfer students must satisfy the core subject requirements, described above under Freshman Admission and in the table on page 13). Next, theUniversity will consider applicants for admission through one or more of three pathways: theDirect Transfer Agreement pathway, for applicants from Washington community colleges thepathway for applicants to competitive professional programs from Washington community colleges, and thecomprehensive review pathway , for all other applicants. The Admissions staff, in reviewing an application, will do everything possible to find a successful pathway for each applicant; the applicant does not have toidentify a pathway on the application. At the same time, applicants can maxi- mize the chances of being admitted by becoming familiar with the criteria of each pathway and then working toward the one that is most compatible withone's situation (e.g., state residency, choice of major, GPA). The three pathways are described below. Exceptions are discussed on page 20, Applicants Seeking Special Admission Through an Appeal. The Direct Transfer Agreement Pathway for Transfers from Washington Community Colleges The Direct Transfer Agreement is an admission policy for residents of the state attending Washington community colleges. The Direct Transfer Agreement ensures admission only to premajor status in the College of Arts and Sciences but does not promise admission to any other school or college nor to any particular major or professional field of study withinthe University. (See page 24, Associate Degree Agreement with Washington Community Colleges.) To qualify for admission under the Direct Transfer Agreement, an applicant must meet allof the following criteria: be classified as a resident of Washington State, transfer directly from a Washington community college, complete all core subject requirements by the time of matriculation at the UW (i.e., the point at which the student enrolls for the purpose of earning adegree), complete an approved academic associate degree at a Washington com- munity college, and earn a Transfer GPA of at least 2.75 in all transferable academic course work at the time the first associate degree was completed and at the time ofadmission. The GPA includes course work completed at all colleges attend- ed.(See page 17 for a detailed discussion of the Transfer GPA.) UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 15UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 16 sion decision earlier if they submit materials that qualify them through the Admission Index or Comprehensive Review pathway. Maintaining DTA Eligibility An applicant will notqualify for admission under the Direct Transfer Agreement if: after obtaining the associate degree, the applicant enrolls in a degree-earn- ing status at a four-year institution\u2014including UW Bothell, UW Tacoma, or the Evening Degree Program, the applicant fails to complete the associate degree before matriculating at the UW, the Transfer GPA is below 2.75 at the time the application is submitted or the first associate degree is awarded, or after completing the associate degree, the applicant continues to enroll at a community college or enrolls at a four-year college or university as a non- matriculated student, and the Transfer GPA drops below 2.75. The DTA and the Major The DTA ensures admission to premajor status in the College of Arts andSciences but does not promise admission to any other school or college nor toany particular major or professional field of study within the University. Application Timeline If an applicant plans to complete the associate degree after admission butbefore enrolling at the UW, only one quarter of course work may be in progress. Example: An applicant expects to complete the associate degree in spring 2003 and intends to enroll at the UW autumn 2003. The applicant must submit tran- scripts through winter 2003. Recommendation:Step 1: In January 2003, submit application, high school transcript, and an ini- tial set of college transcripts showing grades through autumn 2002. This will start an application file and give Admissions staff time to review the application. Step 2: In late March or early April, ask the community college to send Admissions an updated transcript showing winter 2003 grades. Why DTA Applicants Should Submit Test Scores and a Personal Statement They may fail to meet all the terms of the Direct Transfer Agreement, for instance, by falling below the minimum Transfer GPA of 2.75. Because only one quarter of course work may be in progress (see Application Timeline, above), DTA applicants may be notified of an admis- \"How Does the UW Make Admission Decisions?\" Some universities require transfer students to complete a minimum number of credits before transferring. The UW has no such sti pulation. However, as the table below demonstrates, the basis for the admission decision changes with the number of transferable college credits an applicant h as completed. This table attempts to answer four related questions:1. At what point is my high school GPA no longer a factor in the admission decision?2. Does Admissions need a high school transcript from every transfer applicant?3. Does Admissions need test scores from every transfer applicant?4. Will my chances for admission change if I complete additional transfer credits? 1Transferable quarter credits: attempted for college-level academic courses at regionally accredited colleges and universities. Credits attempted but not successfully completed, i.e., those for which a grade of \"F\" was earned, will be included in the GPA calculation. Quarter credits: offered at institutions on a quarter system; one semester credit = 1.5 quarter credits. Vocational-technical credit: The UW transfers up to 15 credits earned in vocational-technical/occupational programs only if the y are included as part of a Washington community college aca- demic associate degree. These credits will not be used in the calculation of the Transfer GPA. 2Graded credits: credits taken for a grade (not pass/fail or satisfactory/not satisfactory) in college-level academic courses at regionally accredited institutions. Credits earned in vocational- technical programs do not count as graded credit. (See Restrictions on Transfer Credit, p. 22) for a list of other courses not considered academic course work and therefore not included in the computation of graded credit.) 3All applicants are urged to submit test scores: see page 17 for details. However, applicants with high Transfer GPAs may not ne ed test scores to be considered for admission. 4Transfer GPA must be at least 2.75. A.A. holders, see Direct Transfer Agreement, page 24.

However, neglecting to submit scores that may have been required or, if not required, could possibly have resulted in a higher AI, will definitely hurt anapplicant's chances for admission. Applicants often assume that test scores, like the high school transcript, are required only of freshman applicants. Although an admission decision can sometimes be made without scores, applicants should assume that they are, in fact, required. Even applicants expecting to qualify under the Direct Transfer Agreement may benefit from having test scores on file. The bottom line is that submitting scores only ensures that an application will be complete; test scores will never work against an applicant. Institutional SAT I and ACT The Office of Educational Assessment (OEA) offers a locally-scored Institutional SAT I and ACT for transfer applicants, either those who did not take an admis-sion test while in high school or those who wish to improve their score. Space is limited, and students are urged to register early for the desired test date. The nonrefundable test fee is $45. The exam is only for admission to the UW. The OEA will not forward scores to other universities. Students who expect to participate in intercollegiate athletics may not use the Institutional SAT I to qualify for eligibility. They must take the SAT I or ACT on a national testing date; contact OEA (206-543-1170 oroea@u.washington.edu) or the test center nearest you for a schedule. The Transfer GPA This is how the UW computes the Transfer GPA, which is used in computing theGPA portion of the Admission Index and the cumulative GPA for Direct Transferapplicants. All transferable academic courses, from all regionally accredited colleges the student has attended, in which the student has received grades between 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale. Although the UW uses a decimal scalefor grading students in its own courses, transfer grades are not converted to a uniform decimal scale. Instead, Admissions uses the grade assignment of the home institution whether, for example, 3.3 or 3.5 for B+. All transferable academic credit from two-year colleges, even if the student has earned more than 90 transferable credits from two-year colleges. (SeeTransfer Credit, Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit.) The Office of Admissions does not include in the Transfer GPA: Courses receiving no credit: Courses considered by the UW to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly 101), Intermediate Algebra Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teach preparation for a ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills Lower-division military-science courses English as a Second Language V ocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of \"Incomplete\" (unless changed to \"F\" at home institution) Courses recorded with a grade of \"Pass\" or \"Satisfactory\" PE activity credits in excess of 3 quarter credits. The Transfer GPA and Admission to Majors The Transfer GPA is used only for determining admissibility to the University . Some undergraduate programs at the University, such as business administra-tion or engineering, have selective admission policies. When they review tran-scripts, they may calculate the GPA differently; for example, some departmentsuse only courses in the major field or the GPA earned in the last 45 credits.The Pathway for Applicants to Competitive Professional Programs from WashingtonCommunity Colleges Some UW professional programs require a pattern of course work that differs markedly from that required for the associate degree. In such cases, transferstudents may face difficult choices, especially when they have progressed as far as they can at the community college. In order to enable such students at Washington community colleges to transfer to the UW, the Office of Admissions assigns to these students the same admission priority it gives to associate degree holders. Washington community college students who are state residents will be given priority for UW admission, in the same manner as that specified in the DirectTransfer Agreement, if they have: completed at least 90 credits, completed all core subject requirements, earned a Transfer GPA of 2.75 or higher from all colleges attended, and a re admitted to professional programs with selective admission criteria (e.g., business, engineering, nursing). This priority will be granted regardless of the applicant's Admission Index (see below). The Comprehensive Review Pathway In the comprehensive review, Admissions staff considers many factors, includ- ing grades, test scores, and supplemental academic and personal factors.Priority is given to students applying for the third or junior year. To determine an applicant's competitive standing for admission, the UW first assigns an Admission Index (AI) for each applicant. The AI is based on two fac- tors\u2014GPA and test scores\u2014with GPA being the predominant factor. The Indexranges from a low of 0 to a high of 100. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 is required. Beyond that, however, there is no one GPA that will guarantee admission, and in fact, to be competitive, appli-cants must present Transfer GPAs that are considerably higher . See below for a discussion of the Transfer GPA. Applicants needing more information areencouraged to contact Admissions for counseling. A small number of highly competitive applicants may be admitted based on their AIs. Remaining applicants are evaluated based on their AIs and a com- prehensive review. The Personal Statement is a vital part of this review. These academic and personal factors are considered in the comprehensive review: p reparation for an academic program at the UW and potential to complete a UW degree in the major of choice; documented academic or artistic awards and achievements; educational and economic disadvantage and personal adversity (as reflect- ed in the Personal Statement, family income, and educational background); evidence of a need to enroll at the UW; cultural awareness (as reflected in the Personal Statement); community service, leadership, and work experience; improved grades after an extended absence from college or evidence of a new maturity in approaching college work. Test Scores Applicants for transfer admission, except those qualifying under the Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA), are required to submit scores from one of the follow- ing tests: Scholastic Assessment Test I (SAT or SAT I), American College Test (ACT), or W ashington Pre-College Test (WPCT) if WPCT taken by June 1, 1989. When students submit scores from more than one test or multiple scores from the same test, Admissions always uses the highest combined score from a sin- gle test date. The best mathematics score from one test date will not be com- bined with the best verbal score from another test date. All transfer applicants, including those applying under the DTA, are urged to submit test scores. Because the minimum Admission Index (AI)\u2014and thereforeUNDERGRADUATE STUDY 18 Admission to the Major Transfer applicants are strongly urged to begin academic planning early in their college career and to contact directly the program(s) they are interested in well before applying for admission to the University. All of the majors available at the UW are listed on page 10, organized by school/college. Majors marked with a symbol have admission requirements beyond those required for admission to the University. There are three types of departmental admission policies at the UW:Open. These majors are open to applicants at the time of admission to the UW or any time thereafter. Minimum Requirements. These majors have minimal admission require- ments, such as completing 10 credits of introductory courses with a cumu- lative GPA of 2.50. Majors in this category generally admit all applicants who meet the minimum requirements, without any further screening or selec- tion. However, some of these majors may make exceptions, depending on the number of applicants they receive for a given quarter. Many of the majorswith minimum requirements also require that new students enroll at the UW before applying to their program. Competitive. These majors have competitive admission standards, which fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the number of applicants.Fulfilling University admission requirements does not guarantee admission to a specific department or program. The degree of competitiveness varies greatly from major to major. In addition, some of these majors require thatnew students enroll at the UW before applying to their program. An appli-cant who declares one of these majors on the admission application but is not admissible to it may be required to enter the UW as a premajor to com- plete the college courses required for admission to the major of choice. Applicants to majors marked with a symbol on page 10 should file a University application and submit all other necessary materials at least six weeks before the departmental deadline, to allow time for the department to request any sup- plementary information from the applicant. In most cases, applicants must alsofile a separate application with the department. Complete information on depart- mental admission requirements and procedures may be obtained from the appropriate department.

International stu-dents are neither U.S. citizens, nor refugees nor immigrants to the United States. Admission to the University of Washington is highly competitive for degree seek- ing (matriculated), undergraduate, international students. This means there are more applicants who meet all of the minimum admissions requirements than theuniversity can accommodate. In recent years, the UW has only been able to offer admissions to about half of all qualified applicants. All international student applications for a given year are reviewed and com- pared to determine which applicants have the strongest academic records andthe highest qualifications. Admission criteria for either summer or autumn quar- ter degree-seeking applicants are exactly the same. Admission will be offered to as many highly qualified students as space allows. Students who have notmet all of the minimum admissions criteria will not be considered for admission. International Freshman and Transfer Applicants To be eligible for consideration, applicants: Must have completed at least 12 years of primary and secondary school, equivalent to 12 years of school in the U.S. The final four years of second-ary school, equivalent to 9th through 12th grade in the U.S., must include adequate academic preparation in six core subject areas (see Core Subject Requirements, page 13). Must have attained school marks or examination scores that place them in thetop 15 percent of students successfully completing secondary school in their country, or present a university or college record of high quality (at least a B average is recommended). Must demonstrate basic proficiency in the English language. Exception: Only those applicants whose country of origin is Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom will be presumed to be proficient and will not be required to submit scores. Students who were born in a nativeEnglish-speaking country but were educated in a non-native English-speak- ing country will, however, be required to satisfy the English proficiency requirement. The minimum examination scores for admission consideration are:T est of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL) Computer-based 207 Paper-based 540 UW-administered MLT 85 % Advanced Placement International English Language (APIEL) AP4 Previous ESL or English composition courses, even when taken in the United States will not satisfy the English proficiency requirement for admission. Students who score high enough to be considered for admission but not as high as the scores listed below are required to take a sequence of one to fiveremedial courses in the Academic English Program (AEP), beginning with their first quarter at the UW. Students who have been admitted to the UW will be required to register for AEP courses unless they submit exam scores high enough to place them out of the requirement prior to registering for regularclasses at the UW. Computer-based APIEL AP4 A diagnostic exam is available to determine the appropriate level at which to start AEP course work within the sequence. Students who do not take the diag-nostic exam will be required to register for the first level in the series of AEPcourses. An extra fee is charged for each AEP course in addition to regulartuition. At least one AEP course will be required each quarter until all mandato-ry AEP classes are satisfactorily completed. Students required to take AEP must register for AEP first to be eligible to register for their other classes.Students must provide proof of sufficient funds for education in the U.S., including tuition, fees, expenses, and housing. If the student is required to take Academic English Program (AEP) courses, there will be an additional fee foreach AEP course, up to a maximum of five courses. Total estimated costs are shown on the Statement of Financial Responsibility but are subject to increase without notice. International students and their families or sponsors must assume all responsi- bility for student expenses. Financial assistance from the UW is not available tointernational students. Therefore, it is extremely important that all applicants review their expenses before deciding whether to apply for admission. International Postbaccalaureate Applicants Postbaccalaureate applicants are those who, before enrolling at the UW, have completed or will have completed a bachelor's degree considered equivalent to a U.S. degree. Postbaccalaureate is an undergraduate matriculated status for students wishing to pursue further undergraduate course work, either a sec- ond bachelor's degree or preparation for graduate or professional school. Postbaccalaureate admission is highly competitive and based on two factors: postsecondary scholastic achievement and the supplemental statement, described below. Fewer than twenty international postbaccalaureates were admitted in 2001. To be eligible for admission consideration, postbaccalaure- ates must meet the criteria described for freshmen and transfers above, with two exceptions: (1) They are exempt from the core subject requirements.(2) Those who earned a firstbachelor's degree in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom are exempt from the English pro- ficiency requirement. Admission for Summer Quarter Only (Nonmatriculated Status) International students wishing to study temporarily at the UW without seeking a bachelor's degree may enter only in the summer quarter and are notpermitted to continue at the University after that quarter. If you wish to apply for summer quarter admission, you must submit the application form and the $35 applica-tion fee before June 1 . After that date, applications must be submitted in per- son. Academic credentials are not required for summer quarter admission. See the Educational Outreach section of the catalog for more information aboutSummer Quarter. The University cannot provide I-20 forms or give other assistance in obtaining F-1 visa status for nonmatriculated enrollment in summer quarter. Such students must have F-1 status already through enrollment at another U.S. college or uni-versity, or be able to enter the United States on a visitor's visa or other nonstu-dent visa.

Postbaccalaureate is an undergraduate, matriculated (degree) status at the UW. It is reserved for students who are working toward asecond bachelor's degree, or preparing for entrance to graduate or profession- al school. This status includes UW undergraduates who anticipate earning their first bachelor's degree at the UW and wish to pursue a second degree here. Only a small number of applicants are admitted every quarter as postbaccalau- reate students because the University's primary commitment is to undergradu- ates who are completing their first bachelor's degree. A student who is inadmis- sible as a postbaccalaureate may still take advantage of many educational opportunities at the UW by enrolling as a nonmatriculated (non-degree) student through UW Educational Outreach (see Educational Outreach section of this catalog). Admission Policy All postbaccalaureate applicants must submit a Statement of Purpose (dis- cussed below) at the time of application to the University. The Statement of Purpose is required regardless of GPA. An application submitted without the statement will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed. Undergraduate GPA In calculating the cumulative undergraduate GPA, the Office of Admissions usesall grades earned at accredited four-year colleges and universities prior to the completion of the first bachelor's degree. Grades from community college course work, graduate study, or any course work taken after the first bachelor's degree are not included when the Office of Admissions calculates the GPA forroutine admission. Such work can be considered in the review of the Statement of Purpose. Choice of Major All postbaccalaureate applicants must indicate on the admission applicationtheir intended major or goal for postbaccalaureate study (examples: History,Accounting, premed, preparation for grad school in psychology). Applicants who do not indicate a choice of major will not be considered further. Admission in Winter and Spring Quarters Admission to the University is more strictly limited in winter and spring quartersthan in summer (degree status) and autumn quarters. UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 20 Statement of Purpose Statements of Purpose are reviewed by the Postbaccalaureate Review Committee (PRC). Decisions are made on a rolling basis: the earlier an appli- cant's supplemental file is complete, the earlier the file will be reviewed. Theapplicant will be notified in writing of the final decision after evaluation of tran- scripts and the Statement of Purpose. What to Include in the Statement of Purpose Applicants should answer the following questions in their Statements of Purpose: Why are you pursuing further studies? How did you reach the decision to go into your particular field? What are your long term academic and profes- sional goals? Be as specific as possible. If you are preparing to enter a second undergraduate, graduate, or profes- sional program (such as medical, dental, or law school), what courses doyou intend to take? If, on the other hand, you are ready to begin work in your major immediately, you do not need to list all of the courses comprising the major. For how many quarters do you plan to enroll? Why is it necessary for you to enroll at the UW? Do other four-year universi- ties or community colleges offer what you need at this time? Can you meet your goal as a nonmatriculated student, attending classes through UW Educational Outreach? (If you are planning to take specific courses inpreparation for a graduate or professional program, be aware that accessto courses in a particular quarter is not guaranteed.) If you are seeking admission to an undergraduate program with selective admission criteria: are you assured departmental admission? Your state- ment will be strengthened by a letter of support from the department.Applicants preparing for graduate school should meet with an adviser in the department for an assessment of their chances for future admission. Please be aware that postbaccalaureate applicants who are not accepted to their major of choice will not be admitted to the University. If you feel your undergraduate GPA is low: why might it be an unreliable indicator of your academic potential? Those students with postbaccalaure-ate course work on record, be it from a community college, four-year school, or graduate program, may use this opportunity to point out subsequent high performance if it is relevant to their academic plans at the UW. Format of the Statement of Purpose The Statement of Purpose will be evaluated as part of the admission decision;content as well as form (spelling, grammar, punctuation) will be considered. The Statement of Purpose should be submitted on 8.5\" x 11\" plain white paper; there is no special form. It should be 2-4 pages in length. Double-space your lines, and use only one side of each sheet. Put your name at the top of each page, and attach the pages to your application. Letters of Recommendation Applicants may submit letters of recommendation. The Office of Admissionssuggests that an applicant submit no more than three, judiciously selected andpreferably from faculty who can attest to academic promise in the applicant'sintended field of study. Letters of recommendation that will be arriving under separate cover should be listed in the Statement of Purpose and addressed to: PRC Coordinator, University of Washington, Office of Admissions, Box 355852, Seattle, WA 98195-5852.

It is the responsibility of the Office of Admissions to apply these standards consistently and fairly. The faculty recognizes, however, that exceptions are warranted inunusual circumstances. Applicants who have been denied may write a letter of petition requesting spe- cial consideration if they believe there are extenuating circumstances not explained in their application file, or if they believe an error has occurred in the initial evaluation. Petitions are normally submitted after the initial review of the application file has been completed; they are reviewed by the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards. Immigrant Applicants Whose First Language Is Not English www.washington.edu/students/uga/fr/reqs/details/esl.htm (freshmen) www.washington.edu/students/uga/tr/reqs/details/esl.htm (transfers) Applicants whose first language is not English or who have attended school in a non-English speaking country should consult the Web site or request from the Office of Admissions Pamphlet 3: Guidelines for Applicants Whose First Language Is Not English. This information describes alternate routes to satisfy- ing (a) the core subject requirements for admission in English and foreign lan- guage and (b) the English proficiency requirement for graduation at the UW. Applicants with Home Schooling www.washington.edu/students/uga/fr/reqs/details/ homeschool.htm Students are increasingly being schooled at home. In recognition of this trend, the Office of Admissions provides the following guidelines to assist home- schooled applicants to become eligible for admission consideration. Home- schooled students are encouraged to contact Admissions for counseling assoon as they begin their college-preparatory curriculum. Core Subject Requirements Home-schooled students must complete study in each of the core subject areasdescribed on page 13 and provide a transcript that includes course title or sub- jects studied, duration of study, content, and assessment of performance or grade. Preferably, courses completed at home will be transcripted by a nationalagency. Home-schooled students must additionally furnish documentation to validate learning in core subjects not completed at a high school. Documentation can be scores from SAT II subject tests, ACT subscores, Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams, or college course work. For more informa-tion on which exams will be used to evaluate learning in each core subject area, contact Admissions. Admission Criteria Many home-schooled students take courses such as science or foreign lan- guage at a high school and therefore have a transcript. However, to the extentthat graded course work completed at a high school is missing, greater weightwill be placed on scores from college admission tests, such as ACT and SAT I,and on the personal statement in making an admission decision.Recommendations of private instructors or tutors are helpful when accompa- nied by a description of the instructor's professional qualifications. Portfoliosare not required Returning Former Students A returning undergraduate or professional student who has not been enrolledfor more than one quarter is required to complete and file a Returning FormerStudent Re-enrollment Application by the application deadline. A student is eli- gible to apply as a returning former student only when returning in the same classification as when previously enrolled. Students applying for a new catego-ry (e.g., postbaccalaureate, professional, or graduate) must complete the appropriate application for that category. A returning undergraduate or profes- sional student is required to pay a $35 application fee by the closing date.Returning former students who have been away from the University less thantwo quarters have the highest priority for readmission. A student previously enrolled in an academic program with restricted enrollment or special admis- sion requirements should consult his or her adviser about procedures for read-mission. Returning nonmatriculated students are enrolled only for summer quar- ter. The closing dates for returning former student applications are: autumn, July 1; winter, November 1; spring, February 1; summer, June 1. A returning student must pay a nonrefundable enrollment confirmation deposit of $100 by the date indicated in the offer of readmission. The Procedures and Fees section of this catalog contains additional information about registration, tuition, and fees. Nonmatriculated Students www.washington.edu/students/conted Many students find their educational needs met through nonmatriculated (non- degree) enrollment. Matriculated status is reserved for students who have metcompetitive admission standards and who are enrolled primarily for the pur- pose of earning a degree. For more information about nonmatriculated enroll-ment, consult the Educational Outreach section of this catalog. Auditors Individuals who wish only to audit University courses should apply for admis-sion with nonmatriculated standing. (See the Educational Outreach section ofthis catalog.) Attendance in courses as an auditor is by consent of the instruc- tor involved and is conditioned by the extent to which space is available. Permission to audit is ordinarily granted for lecture classes only. An auditor maynot participate in class discussion or laboratory work, and the auditor's registra- tion may be canceled at the discretion of the instructor. No record of audited courses is kept. Regular tuition and fees are charged. To receive credit for anaudited course, the student must register for the class for credit in a subse-quent quarter. Other Application Forms Financial Aid Application for financial aid is a process entirely separate from application for admission. Interested students should contact the University's Office of StudentFinancial Aid, 105 Schmitz; 206-543-6101; or the counselors at their own school for information about financial aid availability. International students are not eli- gible for financial aid. Additional information on financial aid appears in theStudent Services section of this catalog. University Housing Space in University housing is limited, and admission to the University does notautomatically reserve residence hall space. Additional information on studenthousing appears in the Student Services section of this catalog.UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 21 UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 22 Academic Credit Credit The basic rule for determining academic credit is 1 credit represents a total stu- dent time commitment of 3 hours each week in a 10-week quarter, or a total of 30 hours in a quarter. Total time includes time spent in class, if any; time devot- ed to individual conference with instructors; time devoted to reading or otherstudy, problem solving, writing, laboratory work, exercises, or any other activity required of the student. A specified number of credits must be earned for a degree. There are three basic types of credit: Residence credit is academic credit earned in courses offered by the UW through the quarterly Time Schedule and other approved courses offered by UW Extension. To gain residence credit, students must register for such cours-es during the official registration period. Extension credit or credit earned through examination is credit earned by com- pleting courses offered as extension courses or credit earned through special examinations. Such courses are not included in the UW grade-point average. No more than 90 total extension credits, including a maximum of 45 credits from other institutions, may be counted toward the baccalaureate degree. Ordinarily,extension and independent (correspondence) study credits may not be applied toward the final year. Transfer credit is credit earned at another institution that is accepted by the University as being applicable toward satisfaction of degree requirements. Quarter Credit Versus Semester Credit Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit. The UW awards quarter credit. To convert quarter credits to semester credits, multiply by two-thirds. To convert semester to quarter credits, multiply by 1.5. For example, a student who earns 30 credits at an institution on a semes- ter calendar would have earned 45 quarter credits at the UW. Alternative Credit Options The UW does not award general credit for work or life experience. However, two avenues exist for obtaining credit under select circumstances. Once enrolled at the UW, students may explore the possibility of obtaining departmental approval for transfer of credit earned through course work taken at an unaccredited institution. Contact Admissions. Students may arrange to challenge specific UW courses via credit by exam- ination if the same knowledge has been gained through independent studyoutside a formal educational setting. See Earning Credit by Special Examination section below.Both situations require a formal approval process and a $25 fee per course. In addition, students often earn credits from internships and community serv- ice, but these experiences are always tied to a specific UW course offering andinvolve an academic component. Transfer Credit www.washington.edu/students/uga/transfer/trcrweb.html To students pursuing a first bachelor's degree, the Office of Admissions awards transfer credit according to the guidelines discussed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject credits earned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is University policy to accept credits earned at institutions fullyaccredited by their regional accrediting association, provided that such credits have been earned through university-level courses (see exceptions below) appropriate to the student's degree program at the University. The UW subscribes to the statewide Policy on Inter-College Transfer and Articulation Among Washington Public Colleges and Universities, endorsed by the public colleges and universities of Washington as well as the State Boardfor Community and Technical College Education, and adopted by the Higher Education Coordinating Board. The policy deals with the rights and responsibil- ities of students and the review and appeal process in transfer credit disputes. The Transfer Guide www.washington.edu/students/uga/transfer/course_equiv.html The online Transfer Guide for Community Colleges in Washington, updated on a continuing basis, contains a list of course equivalencies for all community andtechnical colleges in Washington. The equivalencies tables show how academ- ic courses taken at these Washington colleges transfer to the UW. In prepara- tion to transfer, prospective UW students are urged to use the tables for aca-demic planning, to maximize the transfer of credit and the applicability of courses toward their intended major, especially for majors with extensive prerequisites. Another Web-based resource for students is the WashingtonCourse Applicability System (WACAS), available at www.washington.edu/ students/uga/tr/planning/wacas/. Transfer Credit Evaluation The Office of Admissions completes a course-by-course evaluation of transfer credit after an admitted student pays the $100 Enrollment Confirmation Deposit(see p. 31) and shortly before the student's orientation session or advising and registration date. The information recorded on the transfer credit evaluation\u2014including the trans- fer of credits and the Transfer GPA\u2014becomes part of the student's permanentrecord at the UW. If a student applies to an academic program with additional admission requirements, transfer course work and the Transfer GPA will be con- sidered. The evaluation is not an official transcript. The official UW transcript\u2014which is sent to other institutions, employers, etc.\u2014does not include the Transfer GPA or a detailed listing of the transfer credit the UW awarded; it merely lists the other colleges the student has attended and the total number of transfer creditsawarded. Transfer grades are not included in the UW GPA. Postbaccalaureate students are not awarded transfer credit; they receive no transfer credit evaluation from the Admissions Office. Students working toward a second baccalaureate degree should consult with their academic adviser to learn how credit from other universities may apply toward their UW degree. Restrictions on Transfer Credit Community College Credit A maximum of 90 credits from community college course work may be applied toward the credits required for the bachelor's degree. Allof the credits trans- ferred from two-year colleges may be used toward graduation requirements,but a student must still complete at least 90 credits of course work at the UW or at another baccalaureate-granting institution (see also senior-residency require- ment, below). Extension Credit from Other Schools Extension credit, including correspondence courses, validated courses, orcredit by exam earned at other schools, may not exceed 45 credits. Militarycredit, discussed below, is also included in the 45-extension-credit limit. Foreign Language Courses Students who have completed two or more years of a high school foreign lan-guage receive no college credit for an entry-level course (e.g., FRENCH 101) in the same language when that course is completed after matriculation at the University. Transfer students who complete such a course before matriculationat the UW are eligible to receive transfer credit. Military Credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFIand DANTES may not exceed 30 credits and are included in the 45-extension-credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted, and credit will not be awarded until after the student has enrolled. Scores received in such course work are not included in the transfer GPA. No credit is awarded for MOS. Native Language First-year (elementary) or second-year (intermediate) foreign-language credit isnot granted either by examination, by course completion, or by the AdvancedPlacement program in a student's native language. \"Native language\" is defined as the language spoken in the student's home during the first six years of his or her life andin which he or she received instruction through the seventh grade. Out-of-Sequence Courses In mathematics or foreign languages credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced-level course has been completed.For example, students will not be awarded credit for SPAN 102 if it was taken after SPAN 103. Overlapping Content If a department considers two of its courses to have overlapping content, cred- it will be awarded for only one. For example, credit is granted for either PHYS 114 or PHYS 121. Other departments in which such overlapping courses occurinclude Astronomy, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Earth and Space Sciences, Linguistics, Statistics, and foreign languages. Restrictions of this kind are noted in the General Catalog, usually as part of the course description. Physical Education No more than 3 quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Restricted Transfer Credit Transfer credit will not generally be awarded for vocational or technical cours- es. However, a maximum of 15 quarter credits will be awarded in transfer forcollege-level vocational-technical courses when they have been allowed as electives within the 90 credits comprising an academic associate degree from a Washington community college. Courses in this category are those whichwould ordinarily provide specialized training for an occupation (e.g., allied health, bookkeeping, electronics, or physical therapy assistant). When allowed, these credits will apply only toward the elective credit component of a bac-calaureate degree at the UW. Such courses are not included in the TransferGPA and will not be awarded until the official qualifying degree transcript is on file. ROTC Credits Credits earned in first- and second-year military training courses may not be counted in the basic 180 credits that are required for graduation. Up to 18 cred-its of third- and fourth-year courses may count, depending on the restrictions of the UW school/college from which the student graduates. Final-Year Residency Requirement The University generally requires that at least the last 45 credits of a baccalau- reate degree be completed in residence at the UW. Courses Receiving No Credit The University reserves the right to deny credit for courses that are not compat- ible with those offered in its baccalaureate degree programs. Some generalcategories of courses never receive transfer credit. Examples include: courses below college level (usually numbered below 100) repeated courses or courses with duplicate subject content course work earned at an institution that did not hold at least candidacy sta- tus with its regional accrediting association when the course work was taken courses that provide instruction in a particular religious doctrine mathematics courses considered below college level, including basic math, business math, and beginning and intermediate algebra courses offered for non-credit continuing-education unitsexaminations offered by the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) remedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution's first Freshman Composition course)* courses providing instruction in English as a Second Language (100-level or above)* remedial courses in any ROTC courses* non-academic/vocational-technical courses* *Up to 15 credits may be awarded for courses numbered 100 and above if included as electives within an academic associate degree from a Washington community college. See also the sections on Restricted Transfer Credit and Direct Transfer Agreement. Appeal Procedure If not all courses transfer as the student had anticipated, and the academicadviser cannot explain the discrepancy, the student should consult an admis-sion specialist in the Office of Admissions. Further appeal can be directed to the UW Transfer Officer in the Admissions Office. Class Standing A student's class standing is determined by the total number of transfer credits awarded by the UW, not by the number of years of college study or completionof an associate degree. The following table lists the required credits for each class:Freshman 0-44 Sophomore 45-89 Junior 90-134Senior 135 or more Satisfying UW graduation requirements depends not only on the number of credits completed (a minimum of 180) but also on completion of all college and major requirements. Applying Transfer Credit to Degree Requirements Before a student first registers for classes at the University, s/he should meetwith an academic adviser to plan a program of study. The adviser determineshow the transfer credits shown on the evaluation may be used to meet UW degree requirements. For example, Admissions awards a student 120 transfer credits, but only 100 of those credits can be applied toward graduation require-ments for a student's degree program. Credits that do not apply to specific requirements may still be used as electives\u2014if any electives are needed\u2014 toward meeting the minimum UW credit total required for graduation.UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 23 UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 24 The Associate Degree Agreement with Washington Community Colleges Many community college students who plan to transfer to the University ask about the advantage of earning an associate degree before they transfer. Thereare two separate agreements that may benefit such students. Both agreements apply only to students with academic-transfer (as opposed to vocational-tech-nical) associate degrees, and only to those whose degrees are from community colleges in Washington. TheDirect Transfer Agreement assures students of priority consideration for admission to the UW. (See Transfer Admission on page 15 for a complete dis- cussion). Admission under the Direct Transfer Agreement does not guaranteeadmission to any specific program within the University. The other agreement, called the Associate Degree Agreement , affects how courses from the community college apply toward graduation requirements from some colleges/schools at UW. To qualify for the agreement, a student mustcomplete all the requirements for the associate degree before regular admis- sion to UW; earlier enrollment as a nonmatriculated student in summer quarter, UW Extension, or UW correspondence courses, however, is allowed. Unlike theDirect Transfer Agreement, the Associate Degree Agreement may also apply to students who have matriculated at another four-year institution between earning the associate degree and transferring to the UW. Benefits of the Associate Degree The primary benefit is that students may count transfer courses toward Areas ofKnowledge (formerly distribution) requirements if the community college count-ed them, even if the courses are not listed as counting for Areas of Knowledge in the UW Transfer Guide . Humanities courses will count for Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts; social-science courses for Individuals & Societies; and natu- ral-science courses for the Natural World. (Note: Completing the Areas ofKnowledge requirement does not automatically mean that an applicant has ful- filled the core subject requirements. See pages 13-14 for the discussion of admission core subject requirements.) There are three possible pitfalls, howev-er: No more than 15 credits in the student's major department may be counted for Areas of Knowledge. Some courses will not be counted for both Areas of Knowledge and profi- ciency (e.g., for a student in the College of Arts and Sciences who has only one foreign language, the first year of that foreign language would not count for Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts, because it must be used for the for-eign-language proficiency requirement instead). A course that does not transfer for credit (e.g., intermediate algebra) does not count toward graduation requirements. Many students with associate degrees have earned fewer than the required credits in each of the three Areas of Knowledge (the Natural World, Individuals & Societies, and the Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts), and thus will be com-pleting the requirements at the UW. Students are not exempted from other spe- cific general-education requirements of their UW school/college. Bachelor Degree Planning Students often assume that work on a major does not begin until the junior year. It is important to investigate the requirements of any intended major. Some com-munity colleges have associate-degree options that allow students to earn the A.A. or A.S. degree while fulfilling the requirements of specific UW majors. Lacking those options (and depending on the likelihood of being admitted with-out recourse to the Direct Transfer Agreement), students may sometimes be better off not earning the associate degree, particularly for programs outside the College of Arts and Sciences, such as engineering or business, that havevery specific prerequisites. In some cases, it may even be better to transferwith fewer than 90 credits. For example, students planning to major in certain languages may need to start earlier than their junior year if course work is avail- able only at the UW. Students in some pre-professional programs such as pre-medicine or predentistry will probably not need to transfer early, but they should talk with an adviser at the UW late in their freshman year. Earning Credit by Special Examination With departmental approval, regularly admitted and currently enrolled students may \"challenge a course,\" by special examination to gain credit without beingenrolled in specific courses. 1. For independent study.2. For work completed with private teachers.3.For work completed in unaccredited institutions if a formal examination is deemed necessary by the chair of the concerned department(s). (In somecases, credit may be validated without an examination. Students who wish to validate credit should inquire at the Office of Admissions.) The following restrictions apply:a.No one may take a credit examination for a course in which he or she has previously registered. b.All credits earned by examination are counted as extension credit and if earned at the UW, are included in the 90-extension-credit maximum that may be applied toward the baccalaureate degree. (Transfer extension cred- it is limited to 45 quarter credits.) No credit is allowed by examination if the grade earned is less than 2.0. Grades earned are not included in the GPA. c.No student shall receive credit by examination for a course for which the student would not be eligible to receive credit if the course were taken in residence, e.g., SPAN 202 if credit already awarded for SPAN 203. d. No student is permitted to repeat any examination for credit.e. No student shall receive credit by examination for lower-division courses in the student's native language. (Some language departments have more restrictive policies. Consult the individual language department for details.) f. Credit by examination is not acceptable for application toward an advanced degree in the Graduate School. A student who wishes to qualify for credit by examination must apply to the Graduation and Academic Records Office for a certificate of eligibility no later than Friday of the second week of the quarter. The student presents the form to the instructor and chair and/or dean for signed approval. It is then returned tothe Graduation and Academic Records Office. Signed forms and payment of$25 for each course to be challenged must be submitted by Friday of the sec- ond week of the quarter. Examinations are administered by the Office of Educational Assessment during the fifth week of the quarter. No student is permitted to take more than two examinations in 3-, 4-, or 5-credit courses, or more than three examinations in 1- or 2-credit courses in one day. If the student plans to take more examinations in a given quarter, an additional day may be permitted and arrangements made with the Office of EducationalAssessment. Credit for Beginning College Study at an Advanced Level A student who begins college study in the third quarter of the second-year University language sequence may receive 5 credits for the second quarter of thesecond-year course, provided the third-quarter course is successfully complet- ed. Similarly, a student who begins college study with an upper-division course in a language (other than courses in English translation or in conversational prac-tice) may be granted 10 credits for the second- and third-quarter courses of thesecond-year sequence, provided that course is successfully completed. A student who is placed by examination at the level of MATH 125 or higher receives additional credits upon completion of the advanced course. If the stu- dent's first University mathematics course is MATH 125, credit for MATH 124 isgiven. A student whose first mathematics course is MATH 126 is given credit for both MATH 124 and 125. A student who is placed by examination at the level of CSE 143, may upon suc- cessfully completing the course, receive credit for CSE 142. A student must apply for advanced standing credits at the Graduation and Academic Records Office after having completed the advanced course. Advanced Placement Program (College Board) www.washington.edu/students/uga/fr/reqs/details/apcredit.htm Students who complete college-level work in high school may receive credit or placement, or both, at the University on the basis of performance on anAdvanced Placement examination.

University Placement Tests Information concerning mathematics, chemistry, and foreign-language place- ment tests is included with the offer of admission or in the leaflet on registrationinstructions, which is mailed to applicants upon receipt of their enrollment con- firmation. Additional information on recommended tests may be obtained from the appropriate college or departmental advising office. Testing information isalso available at the Office of Educational Assessment, 453 Schmitz. Grading System The UW uses a numerical grading system, with certain exceptions in the schoolsof Dentistry, Law, and Medicine. Instructors may report grades from 4.0 to 0.7 in0.1 increments and the grade 0.0. The number 0.0 is assigned for failing work or unofficial withdrawal. Grades in the range 0.6 to 0.1 may not be assigned. Grades reported in this range are converted by the Office of the Registrar to0.0. Numerical grades may be considered equivalent to letter grades as fol- lows: Lowest passing grade.E 0.0 Failure or Unofficial Withdrawal. No credit earned. Additional information on grades and scholarship rules may be obtained from the Graduation and Academic Records Office, 264 Schmitz. The following letter grades also may be used: N Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a final grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses num- bered 600, 601, 700, 750, and 800. I Incomplete. An Incomplete is given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond thestudent's control. To obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student should never reregister for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. An Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to the grade of 0.0 by the Office of the Registrarunless the instructor has indicated, when assigning the Incomplete grade, that a grade other than 0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not com-pleted. The original Incomplete grade is not removed from the permanentrecord. An instructor may approve an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by writing to the Graduation and Academic Records Office no later than the lastday of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade wasassigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters,must be received before the Incomplete has been converted into a failing grade.In no case can an Incomplete received by an undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after a lapse of one year. S Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An Sgrade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or above for undergraduates. The grade Smay not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Office of the Registrar. Courses sograded can only be used as free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a University, college, or department course requirement. Sis not computed in GPA calculations. NS Not-satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduates is converted to NS.NSis not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. CR Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750, and 800. The minimum performancelevel required for a CRgrade is determined, and the grade is awarded directly, by the instructor. CRis not computed in GPA calculations. NC Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750, and 800. The grade is awarded direct-ly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. W Official withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the sev- enth week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the weekof the quarter is recorded with the Wwhen a course is dropped. It is not com- puted in GPA calculations. HW Grade assigned when an undergraduate is allowed a hardship withdraw- al from a course after the fourteenth calendar day of the quarter. It is not com-puted in GPA calculations. Nontraditional Grading Options Credit/No Credit-Only as a Course Option With appropriate departmental review and approval, a course may be offered on a credit/no credit-only basis. The standard for granting credit in credit/nocredit-only courses under this option is the demonstration of competence in the material of the course to the instructor's satisfaction. Satisfactory/Not-Satisfactory Grading Option Students may select the S/NS grading option for courses through the end of the seventh week of the quarter. No more than 25 satisfactory/not-satisfactory cred-its may apply toward an undergraduate degree. Such courses may not be used to satisfy University, college, or departmental course requirements (i.e., may be applied only to the elective component of a degree). Veterans receiving benefits should check with the Office of Special Services regarding nontraditional grading options. It should be noted that the possibility of future objective evaluation of the stu- dent's total academic record is reduced by the extent to which the record includes course work that is evaluated by a grading system other than thenumerical system. A student should be aware that he or she may jeopardizefuture educational opportunities, particularly for graduate or postbaccalaureate study, when other systems of performance evaluation are used. Grade-Point Average (GPA) The University's cumulative GPA includes both credits granted for courses taken in residence at the UW and DL-suffix courses taken through UW EducationalOutreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for UWEO course work that is not residence credit, transfer courses and credit, and the grades for credit by examination. These latter grades do not affect the University cumu-lative GPA. Computation of GPA The GPA for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative gradepoints by the total graded credits attempted for courses taken in residence at the University. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade pointsis then divided by the total graded credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactory grades are printed on the per- manent record as an Sand do not count in the quarterly or cumulative GPA, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades,NS, do not count in the quarterly and cumulative GPA and do not count as cred- its earned toward graduation.

EXAMPLE 2 Grade Course Credits Grade pointsENGL 121 5 2.3 = 11.5 OCEAN 101 5 0.0 = 0.0SPHSC 100 3 2.7 = 8.1 ART 121 5 I= 0.0 Total credits earned toward graduation 8Total graded credits attempted 13 19.6 GPA = 19.6 \u00f7 13 = 1.51 The student attempted 18 credits, but only 13 are graded, because the Incomplete (I)is not computed in the GPA. The 0.0 for OCEAN 101 is computed in the GPA, but no credit is awarded toward graduation. If the work in ART 121 is not made up by the end of the next quarter, the I is converted to a numeric grade and the GPA is recomputed. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic department offering the course, an under- graduate may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade are computed in the GPA but credit is allowed only once. Veterans receiv- ing benefits must receive approval from the Office of Special Services before acourse is repeated. Grading Procedures Change of Grade Except in case of error, no instructor may change a grade that he or she hasturned in to the Registrar. Grades cannot be changed after a degree has beengranted. Grade Appeal Procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded must first dis-cuss the matter with the instructor. If the student is not satisfied with the instruc-tor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the chair of thedepartment, or in a nondepartmental college, to the dean, with a copy of theappeal also sent to the instructor. The chair or dean consults with the instructorto ensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbi-trary or capricious. Should the chair believe the instructor's conduct to be arbi-trary or capricious and the instructor declines to revise the grade, the chair (or the dean in a nondepartmental school or college), with the approval of the vot- ing members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member, or mem-bers, of the faculty of that department to evaluate the performance of the stu- dent and assign a grade. The dean and Provost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal are recorded in written form for deposit in a departmentor college file. Grade Reports Grades are not mailed. Students may view their academic record through MyUWat myuw.washington.edu. Scholarship Low Scholarship Academic Warning An undergraduate student whose GPA falls below 2.00 in his or her first quarterat the University receives an academic warning. If a cumulative GPA of at least2.00 for courses earned in residence at the University is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academic probation. Probation and Dismissal for Low Scholarship An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the first quarter at the University, when an academic warn-ing is issued) in which his or her cumulative GPA falls below 2.00. The student remains on probation until the cumulative GPA is raised to at least 2.00. If this requires more than one quarter's work, the student must maintain a quarterly GPA of at least 2.50 each succeeding quarter or the student is dropped for low scholarship. Reinstatement A student who has been dropped under low-scholarship rules is readmitted to the University only at the discretion of the dean of the school or college to whichreadmission is sought. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules re-enters on academic probation. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the University, and the student may not use grades from othercolleges or universities to raise his or her UW GPA. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 GPA for the following quarter's work or a cumulative UW GPA of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student isremoved from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or better is reached. Senior in Final Quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, butwhose work in what would normally be his or her final quarter places him or heron probation, does not receive a degree until removed from probation. A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in his or her last quarter results in his or her being dropped for low schol-arship, does not receive a degree until readmitted and removed from probation.UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 27 UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 28 Dean's List Quarterly Dean's List The quarterly Dean's List includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate entries regarding inclusion on the Dean's List are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual Dean's List The Annual Dean's List high-scholarship award is recorded on the academic transcript of students who have achieved a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or morenumerically graded credits each quarter for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring). Students enrolled for four quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) must satisfy the conditions outlined above and attain a quarterly GPA of3.50 or better in the fourth quarter, if enrolled for 10 or more credits. Students who are on the Annual Dean's List receive a certificate. Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors ( summa cum laude, magna cum laude, cum laude ) are awarded only to recipients of a first baccalaureate degree. These honors areearned by those students who have completed no fewer than 90 residence credits at this institution. At least 60 of the 90 credits must have been acquired on a graded basis. The University's Honors Committee determines annually the grade-point require- ment for each baccalaureate honor. In recent years, approximately ten percent of the students have been awarded baccalaureate honors. Credits earned by correspondence courses are not counted toward honors eligibility. Freshman Medal, Sophomore Medal, Junior Medal, President's Medal The Freshman Medal is awarded to the sophomore having the highest scholas- tic standing for the first year of his or her course. To be eligible, students must have completed at least 36 graded credits in residence at the University. The Sophomore Medal is awarded to the junior having the highest scholastic standing for the first two years of his or her course. To be eligible, students musthave completed at least 40 credits in residence at the University. The Junior Medal is awarded to the senior having the highest scholastic stand- ing for the first three years of his or her course. To be eligible, students must have completed at least 40 credits in residence at the University. The President's Medal, which is conferred at commencement, recognizes the graduating senior who has the most distinguished academic record. Only stu-dents who have earned at least 90 credits in residence at the University may be considered. Honorary Societies In addition to the honors discussed above, students with distinguished aca- demic records may participate in several University-wide honorary societies,described below, and specific college or school honorary societies. Information concerning specific college or school honorary societies appears in the respec- tive sections of this catalog. Golden Key National Honor Society. A national, nonprofit academic honors organization founded in 1977 for the purpose of recognizing and encouraging scholastic achievement among students from all academic fields. Membership is by invitation only. Mortarboard . A national college senior honor society whose membership is based on scholarship, leadership, and service. The local Tolo chapter wasfounded in 1909 and became part of the national organization in 1925. Students of junior standing apply winter quarter for selection in spring quarter. Phi Beta Kappa. A national collegiate honorary society, founded in 1776, with the Washington Alpha Chapter established in 1914. Phi Beta Kappa recognizes distinguished scholarship, especially in the acquisition of an education in the liberal arts and sciences. Students are elected to membership on the basis ofGPA and breadth of education. Additional information on honorary societies may be obtained from academic advisers and the respective campus representatives.Graduation Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or postbaccalaureate students with a degree application onfile in the Graduation and Academic Records Office may register on the firstday of Period I for their final two quarters. Students who postpone their gradua-tion may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular sen-ior or postbaccalaureate priority day. When students have used their GraduatingSenior Priority for two quarters, their registration priority reverts to the regularsenior or postbaccalaureate schedule. See the quarterly Time Schedule for cur- rent information. Filing an Application for Baccalaureate Degree A student should file a written application for his or her degree with the Graduation and Academic Records Office, 264 Schmitz, two to three quartersbefore the expected date of graduation. The absolute deadline for filing an application is Friday of the third week of the quarter in which the student intends to graduate. It is the student's responsibility to apply for a degree or certificate, because degrees are not automatically awarded when requirements have been satisfied. Application forms and diploma cards are available in the major departments. The signature of the department head or of an authorized adviser must appear on the application in the space provided for \"Signature of major adviser.\" If thestudent's major is in a college other than Arts and Sciences, the signature of the dean or a designated representative is required. The student is also required to sign the application. Departmental advisers should notify the Graduation and Academic Records Office of any changes made to the courses and credits listed on the applica- tion. If an applicant is ineligible to graduate because of a deficiency, the Graduation and Academic Records Office will notify the student. University Requirements for Baccalaureate Degree To graduate, a student must meet University, college or school, and depart- mental requirements. Only University requirements are listed in this section.Requirements of colleges, schools, and departments appear in the section per- taining to the college, school, or department concerned. Scholastic Standards Required To be eligible for the baccalaureate degree, a student must earn a cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all work done in residence at the University. Thegraduation GPA is computed when the student has completed all work for the degree and includes only credits earned while in residence at the University. Credits Required To be eligible for graduation from the University with the baccalaureate degree, a student must satisfy all other specific requirements and must offer a minimumof 180 academic credits. University General Education and Proficiency Requirements The University has adopted minimum general education and proficiency requirements. Individual schools and colleges may establish general education and proficiency requirements in excess of University requirements. Consult the undergraduate program section of each school or college for specific gradua-tion requirements. Limitation on ROTC Credits Credits earned in first- and second-year military training courses cannot becounted in the basic 180 credits required for graduation. Some third- and fourth-year courses may count, depending on the student's college or school. Limitation on Physical Education Activity Credits No more than 3 physical education activity credits can apply toward a degree.Final-Year Residence Requirement To be recommended for a first or subsequent baccalaureate degree, a student must complete 45 of his or her final 60 credits as a matriculated student in resi- dence at the University of Washington campus where the degree is to be earned. The granting of exceptions to this rule is the responsibility of the deanof the college or school awarding the degree. If an exception is granted, the student still must present a minimum of 45 credits taken in residence as a matric- ulated student to be awarded a UW degree. Effective Date for Graduation Requirements If fewer than ten years have elapsed since a student's admission into her or hismajor program, she or he may choose to graduate under the major program requirements in effect at the time of admission, or under any subsequent require- ments. The choice shall be subject to approval of the student's departmentalchair and dean, according to the procedures established in Section 23-48 of the Faculty Code. If the student wishes to obtain a degree after a lapse of more than ten years from the date of admission to the major program, she or he must meet therequirements in effect at the time of graduation unless permission to use earlier requirements is granted, either as a general policy or expressly for the individ- ual student, by the department, school, or college whose requirements are in question. These provisions do not apply to the requirements for teaching certificates, which are prescribed by the College of Education at the time the certificate is to be granted. Waiver of Graduation Requirements A request for waiver of college or University graduation requirements is peti- tioned to the college graduation committee, which refers the petition to the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards if an all-University require- ment is involved. These petition forms are available at the Graduation andAcademic Records Office or the advisory office. A student should see his or her academic adviser to initiate a petition. Because the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards meets only quarterly, petitions involving Universityrequirements should be filed early in the quarter. An exemption from an all-University graduation requirement that is granted by the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards becomes void at the end of two calendar years from the date such exemption is granted if all degree requirements have not been completed within that period. Graduation Requirements for ROTC Students As a prerequisite for graduation from the University, students accepted for the third- and fourth-year advanced ROTC program must complete the advanced program unless excused or dismissed from this requirement by regulations pre- scribed by the Secretary of the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, whoever hasthe authority in the individual case. Two Majors or Two Degrees Second Baccalaureate Degree A second baccalaureate degree may be granted, but a student must earn a minimum of 45 credits beyond the number required for the first baccalaureate degree. These credits usually must be earned in residence, with the granting of exceptions to the residency rule being the responsibility of the college or schoolawarding the degree. Students working for a second baccalaureate degree arenot registered in the Graduate School. The student must achieve at least a 2.00 cumulative GPA in the credits required for the second degree. Degrees with Two Majors Some colleges allow a baccalaureate degree with two majors. The student's application for such a degree must show both majors and be approved by the advisers of both departments. Both majors appear on the transcript and both must be either Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degrees. Two Baccalaureate Degrees Concurrently Two baccalaureate degrees, associated with different majors, may be granted at the same time, but the total number of academic credits earned must be atleast 45 credits in excess of the number required for the first baccalaureatedegree.Academic Minors www.washington.edu/students/ugrad/advising/minorreg.html Degrees with Minor. Departments, schools, and colleges are authorized to pro- vide a course of study leading to an undergraduate academic minor.Requirements are within the purview of the department, school, or college. The minor shall consist of no fewer than 25 credits. Interdisciplinary minors are acceptable. Completion of the minor will appear on the permanent record. Requirements for Teaching Certification The College of Education offers professional programs approved by the StateBoard of Education leading to teaching and other certificates. Additional infor-mation appears in the College of Education section of this catalog, or the stu- dent may write to the Office of Teacher Education, 211 Miller, Box 353600. Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of spring quarter. During April of each year, commencement information is sent to each studententitled to participate the following June (i.e., those who graduated the previous August, December, or March and those who anticipate graduating in the cur- rent June and August). Diploma Distribution Diplomas are available 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned.UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 29 30 Procedures and Fees The University and its colleges and schools reserve the right to change the fees, the rules, and the calendar regulating admission and registration; the instruc-tion in and the graduation from the University and its various divisions; and any other regulations affecting the student. The University also reserves the right to withdraw courses and programs at any time. It is the University's expectation that all students follow University regulations and procedures as they are stated in the General Catalog. Appeals may be filed with the student's dean or with the Vice President for Student Affairs in nonacademic matters. Students are expected to observe the standards of con- duct contained in the Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-120). Registration www.washington.edu/students/reg/regelig.html Instructions for registration are available on MyUW (myuw.washington.edu) in the Student Personal Services menu by selecting Registration. Notification isemailed to each student quarterly with information about registration for the next quarter. Registration Period I www.washington.edu/students/reg/addpolicy.html Designed to accommodate currently registered matriculated students and stu- dents eligible to register under the Quarter Off Eligibility Policy, Registration Period I occurs during the latter half of the quarter preceding the quarter for which the student is registering. However, currently enrolled students register-ing for autumn quarter do so in spring quarter. Registration Period II Registration occurs after Registration Period I closes and is intended primarilyto accommodate new and returning students. Continuing students who fail toregister during Registration Period I may register during this period. Students who have not completed their initial registration by the end of this period (update and selection of address information, insurance/optional charges, and ASUWmembership) are charged a Late Registration Fee. Registration Period III All students may register or make course changes during this period. Droppedcourses do not appear on the transcript. Students are charged a Change ofRegistration service fee for registration changes made after Period III. One fee is charged for all changes occurring during the same day. A tuition forfeiture is charged for total credit reductions after Period III if applicable. See FeeForfeiture section. Late Add Period All students may register or make registration changes during this period. Alladded courses require an entry code or faculty number. A Change ofRegistration service fee is charged. Unrestricted Drop Period www.washington.edu/students/reg/wdpolicy.html Courses dropped during this period will not appear on the transcript. A Change of Registration fee is charged. Late Course Drop Period (Annual Drop) Students may drop one course each academic year (autumn through summerquarters) after the fourteenth calendar day of the quarter through the seventh week of the quarter. A course drop will be recorded on the transcript with a W followed by the number of the week of the drop (W3-W7). A Change ofRegistration service fee is charged. Credits Required for Full- or Half-Time Status Requirements www.washington.edu/students/reg/regpol.html Some agencies require that a student have full-time status to receive maximum benefits. To be classified as a full-time student by the University, an undergrad-uate or professional student must register for and complete at least 12 creditsper quarter and a graduate student must register for and complete at least 10 credits per quarter. To be classified as a half-time student by the University, anundergraduate or professional student must register for at least 6 credits per quarter and a graduate student must enroll for at least 5 credits per quarter. Restrictions on Attending Classes www.washington.edu/students/reg/regpol.html No person, other than a faculty member attending informally with the approval of the instructor, may attend a University course in which that person has notbeen registered. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name is on the official class list from the Office of the Registrar. An unregistered student may attend through the fourteenth calendar day of the quarter if the stu-dent is on an official wait list for the course. Adding Courses/Permission Guidelines www.washington.edu/students/reg/regopt.html For reasons of public safety and instructional quality, it is important to limit course enrollment to the approved classroom capacity. The Office of theRegistrar monitors course enrollment and accepts student registration in fully enrolled courses according to the following guidelines: 1. Through the second week of the quarter, departments may choose to over- load courses up to 115% of the room capacity to offset anticipated studentcourse drops and withdrawals as demonstrated by past registration activity. Students must secure entry codes from instructors or departments to add closed courses. However, if enrollment is at 115% of room capacity, regis- tration requests are denied. Students should be informed when receivingentry codes to overload courses that registration is not guaranteed if enroll-ment exceeds 115% of room capacity. If centralized room-capacity records do not correctly reflect the actual seat- ing capacity, notification should be made to the Room Assignments/Time Schedule Office in the Office of the Registrar. 2.

Office of Minority Affairs www.oma.washington.edu Fostering diversity is the ongoing work of the entire University, but it is a special responsibility of the Office of Minority Affairs (OMA). To this end, OMA provides a variety of services to undergraduates from underrepresented and economi- cally and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. These services include a statewide Recruitment and Outreach Office whose staff provides assistance with the admissions and financial aid process in high schools and communitycolleges throughout Washington state. Through its Counseling Center, OMA offers academic advising, financial aid advocacy, housing assistance, and otherservices related to life on campus. OMA's services are available mainly to stu- dents who, following admission, are invited to become members of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). Participation in EOP is limited to stu-dents who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, with priority given to Washington state residents. OMA's other services, described below, are open to EOP participants and other students as resources permit. OMA's Instructional Center (IC) offers wide-ranging academic assistance to students in the Educational Opportunity Program and to others as staffing, time,and space permit. The IC maintains drop-in centers for mathematics, writing, reading and study skills, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology, the natural sciences, and foreign languages. Students are assisted in a variety of settings,such as group instructional workshops, review sessions, adjunct courses, cred- it and non-credit classes, and one-on-one tutorials. Student Support Services (SSS) is a counseling and instructional-assistance program for selected UW undergraduates who meet the program's economicand educational eligibility requirements. SSS helps students adjust to campus, as well as encourages and assists them in discovering and taking advantage ofthe UW's many academic and personal opportunities. SSS also provides tutori- al and academic-support workshops to help students move successfully toupper-division courses or into the Early Identification Program's graduate-schoolpreparation services. The Early Identification Program (EIP) is a graduate- and professional-school preparation program for qualified students interested in earning advanceddegrees. The McNair Achievement Program is a federally funded scholarship program designed to encourage and prepare low-income and first-generationcollege students and underrepresented students in graduate education, for the Ph.D. degree. Through their advising and academic-enrichment services, EIP and McNair encourage students to aim for doctoral degrees and faculty careers.These services include an introduction to the research process, research oppor- tunities in collaboration with faculty mentors, scholarships and internships, access to special seminars and workshops, as well as advice and assistancewith the graduate school admissions and financial aid process. The Ethnic Cultural Center (ECC) is a facility for student-organized events and activities. Twenty-two of the University's student organizations use the ECCas their center of activity. The staff of the Center offers students opportunities for the development of organization and leadership skills through the planning and implementation of cultural, social, and student-government programs. TheEthnic Cultural Center complex also maintains an outstanding theatre which provides opportunities for students interested in participating in or creating on- stage productions and other events. Outreach to Middle and High Schools. The Office of Minority Affairs collabo- rates widely with other UW pre-college partnership programs to strengthen theUniversity's diversity \"pipeline\" from the K-12 schools. OMA itself maintains sev- eral middle- and high-school outreach programs whose aim is to increase the number of students who are taking college-prep classes by the ninth grade,improve the academic performance and the college-going rates of underrepre- sented and disadvantaged students. These services offer UW students a vari- ety of volunteer, UW-credit, or paid opportunities. Upward Bound provides strong academic and other college-readiness services for selected Seattle highschool students from Seattle's Nathan Hale, Cleveland, and Franklin High Schools who are from low-income or first-generation college families. The Office of Minority Affairs is a partner with middle schools and community organiza-tions in the Yakima Valley and Seattle in the management of college-readiness Gear Up programs. The Early Scholars Outreach Program helps students begin preparation for college while they are still in middle school. Educational Talent Search offers counseling and encouragement to middle- and high- school students in targeted western and eastern Washington schools. It focus-es particularly on the transition from high school to postsecondary education. OMA, working with UW students and several Seattle high schools, provides inner-city students with tutoring, mentoring, and classroom assistance throughtheOMA High School Tutor/Mentor Program. OMA in partnership with the Seattle School District offers a Middle College High School Program experi- ence on campus to a selected group of non-traditional high school students. The office of the Vice President for Minority Affairs and many of OMA's services are located on the third floor of Schmitz Hall. For information about OMA's pro- gram locations and services, call 206-685-0774.41 THE UNIVERSITY THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH 42 The Office of Research Acting Vice Provost for Research Malcolm R. Parks Associate Vice Provost for Research E. James Davis Director, Grant and Contract Services Carol A. Zuiches www.washington.edu/research/ The Office of Research provides a range of services in support of scholarly and scientific inquiry at the University of Washington. The Vice Provost forResearch works with faculty to establish appropriate research policies, develop research-related initiatives, increase resources available for research, and guar- antee that the successes of faculty and the public benefits of research pro-grams are widely known and understood. The Office of Research cooperates with the Graduate School and other units within the University that depend on or are affected by the research and graduate education activities of UW faculty.The Office of Research also serves as a point of contact with the public and pri- vate sectors on issues relating to research, including the solicitation of corpo- rate research support. The Office of Research works with the Office ofIntellectual Property and Technology to facilitate the transfer of research dis- coveries, and the promotion of economic development. The two main service organizations within the Office of Research are the Office of Grant and ContractServices and the Office of Technology Transfer. The Office of Grant and Contract Services (GCS) reviews and approves all proposals to outside agencies for support of UW research. The Director of GCS is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions for grants and contracts in consultation with the principal investigator and appropriate UW administra-tors. All grant and contract awards received by the University are communicat- ed to GCS, which maintains a historical record of grant activity. GCS is also responsible, through its Human Subjects Division, for managing the human sub- jects review process at the University in cooperation with University's Human Subjects Review Committees. Funding for UW Research External Support for Research and Training is fundamental to the UW's estab- lished role as one of the nation's leading research institutions. During fiscal year2001, the University received roughly $707 million in grant and contract support for a wide array of research and training programs. Since the late 1960s, the University has ranked among the top five institutions in the United States in thereceipt of federal research awards. About 80 percent of the University's grant and contract funds comes from federal agencies, most of the remainder com- ing from foundations, industry, and other private sources. These funds areawarded in response to faculty-initiated, University-approved proposals for funds to support specific projects in accord with the University's research, edu- cation, and public-service goals. Grant and contract funding supports about5,900 full- and part-time employees and provides significant opportunities forstudents who work with faculty members in the conduct of research as a vital component of their education. In addition to federal research funding, corporations provide an increasing amount of funding for research. Last year, the UW received more than $44 mil-lion in corporate research awards. Private gifts to the University total more than $103 million per year and also add significantly to the opportunities of students and faculty to pursue research interests. Internal Support for Research at the UW is based in part on the principle of directing revenue that arises from UW research discoveries back into theUniversity's research enterprises. The Office of Research administers theRoyalty Research Fund (RRF), which is derived from the UW's central share ofroyalty and licensing income negotiated by OIPTT and the Washington Research Foundation with companies that commercialize University technolo-gies. The goal of the RRF is to stimulate additional scholarly initiatives, to encour-age faculty to explore new directions in research and scholarship, and toimprove the environment for intellectual endeavors at the University. Proposalsmust demonstrate a high probability of generating important new scholarlymaterials or resources, significant data or information, or essential instrumenta- tion resources that are likely to lead to external funding or that might lead to anew technology. Special Facilities In support of scholarship, research activities, and regular academic offerings,the University maintains a wide range of special facilities that provide uniqueeducational opportunities. The following list is illustrative of the range and diver- sity of special facilities at the UW. Applied Physics Laboratory A research and development organization within the College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences, APL is one of four university research centers in the UnitedStates affiliated with the U.S. Navy. APL conducts a program of fundamental research, technology development, engineering, and education, emphasizing naval applications of ocean and polar science, acoustics, and engineering.APL has a $30 million annual research and development budget The staff at APL conduct research for the Navy, NSF, NASA, NOAA, ARPA, and other feder- al agencies, and participate in partnerships with private companies. In addi-tion, about 60 graduate and undergraduate students participate in research at APL. Burke Memorial Washington State Museum An educational and cultural center whose function is to collect, preserve, research, exhibit, and interpret the natural and cultural objects of the human environment, particularly the Pacific Ocean, its islands, and mainland shores. Henry Art Gallery The Henry Art Gallery is a major art museum serving the campus communityand the public. The newly renovated gallery contains a number of art galleries,study and research laboratories, and an auditorium. Friday Harbor Laboratories The Friday Harbor Laboratories facility is the principal marine-science field sta-tion of the University of Washington. Its faculty is drawn from various academicunits of the University, including botany, fisheries, oceanography, and zoology, as well as visiting faculty members from many other U.S. and foreign institu- tions. The Laboratories, located approximately 80 miles north of Seattle near the town of Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, offer a biological preserve of nearly 500acres of wooded land with about two miles of shoreline. The island is one of thelargest of the 172 that make up the San Juan Archipelago, located in the north-west section of the state of Washington between Vancouver Island and theUnited States mainland. In addition to the Friday Harbor site, the Laboratories'administration has the responsibility for overseeing biological preserves leasedor owned by the University on San Juan Island. Goose and Deadman islands,biological preserves owned by the Nature Conservancy, are also under thestewardship of the Laboratories. The Laboratories are located close to seawaters that range from oceanic to those highly diluted by streams, some with depths to 1,000 feet, others withbottoms varying from mud to rock, and water movements ranging from those of quiet bays and lagoons to those of swift tideways. The waters about the San Juan Archipelago abound in varied marine flora and fauna. The Laboratories offer opportunities for independent and supervised research, as well as a varied program of instruction for graduate and undergraduate stu- dents. Throughout the year, use of the Laboratories' facilities for research in var- ious areas of marine science is encouraged. Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics The Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics (CENPA) sup- ports a broad range of experimental physics research. Faculty do basicresearch using in-house accelerators and are also engaged in non-accelerator research in solar neutrino physics in collaboration with investigators in Canada and Russia. Oceanographic Research Vessels These are operated for field study and research in Puget Sound and the PacificOcean. Of particular note is the R/V Thomas G. Thompson, a modern vesselcapable of multidisciplinary research in most oceans of the world. Speech and Hearing Clinic Serves as a center for research in speech science, speech and languagepathology, and audiology, and provides services to the public. University of Washington Medical Center/Harborview Medical Center The University operates two major teaching hospitals: its own 450-bed University of Washington Medical Center and, under contract with King County,the 351-bed Harborview Medical Center. University Libraries With nearly six million volumes, an equal number of microforms, several millionitems in other formats, and more than 50,000 serial titles, the University ofWashington Libraries houses one of the top research collections in the country and forms a part of one of the most innovative electronic campus information networks in the world.

The Impact of UW Research Research programs at the UW benefit students, the state, and the nation. Over the last decade, these programs have produced life-saving advances in med- ical technology, support for key state and regional industries, research and analysis on critical public-policy issues, patented technologies, training formore than 10,000 graduate and professional students each year, as well as contributions to scholarly literature in virtually all major fields of the arts, sci- ences, and humanities. The following sections contain brief descriptions of afew of the many interesting research projects currently underway at the UW. Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences UW earth scientists have a long tradition of concentrating on regional studies tolearn more about the forces that continue to shape the Pacific Northwest. Recent evidence suggests that great earthquakes of magnitude 7 or 8 have occurred in the Pacific Northwest in the not-too-distant past, and are likely to recur atsome time in the future. Data gathered from a network of seismic stations throughout the Pacific Northwest are permitting new faults in the region to be mapped and characterized. The first three-dimensional images of structureswithin the earth in this region are being generated. Lessons learned from seis-mic studies since the eruption of Mount St. Helens are being applied to eruptive activity around the globe. Additionally, extreme conditions deep inside the earth are simulated in the UW High Pressure Mineral Physics Lab in order to under-stand the geologic processes that shape our planet. Underwater observing platforms have been installed to monitor volcanic activi- ty on the sea floor more than a mile and a half below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington state. These undersea volcanoes andhydrothermal vents spew out heated, mineral-laden waters that nourish exotic life forms and form rich metal deposits. The heat-loving organisms, capable of existing without light from the sun, are among the most ancient forms of life onearth. An ice core containing an unprecedented record of climate conditions in a near- coastal area of Antarctica has been obtained by scientists in the UW Quaternary Research Center. The ice sample, which goes back 140,000 years through a complete ice-age cycle, was taken at Taylor Dome, the site of major changes inglacier cover that affected sea level at the end of the last ice age.THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH 43 THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH 44 Work by UW atmospheric scientists has established the role of sulfate aerosol in global climate change. Other studies are shedding light on past and future ElNi\u00f1o weather events\u2014intervals of especially warm ocean temperature that peri-odically appear around December in the equatorial Pacific and that disruptweather patterns around the globe. UW researchers have developed a theoret- ical understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to the El Ni\u00f1o phenome- non. Cores obtained from coral formations in the Pacific provide a record of past El Ni\u00f1o events and may lead to more accurate forecasts of these weather changes in the future. The School of Fisheries, renowned for the development of the Donaldson salmon as well as for its contributions to the High Seas Salmon Program and Alaska Salmon Program, also has made many important contributions to the develop- ment of shellfish aquaculture in Puget Sound and around the world. The triploidoyster, prized for its superior characteristics, was developed by UW fisheries researchers. Physical and Chemical Sciences Extremely high precision measurements of atomic properties are the forte of a strong atomic physics group, which brought recognition in the form of a NobelPrize awarded to Professor Hans Dehmelt in 1989. Astronomers at the University conduct research in a wide variety of astronomi- cal subjects, from the study of solar system bodies to the nature of the universe. The UW's Interplanetary Dust Laboratory has pioneered the discovery and studyof cometary and asteroidal dust. The Stardust mission led by a UW astronomer will gather and return samples of interstellar dust from a comet called Wild-2 in January 2004. Stardust, which was selected by NASA as the fourth flight mis-sion in its Discovery program, was launched on an expendable launch vehiclein February 1999. The return capsule carrying the comet dust samples will para- chute to Earth in January 2006. The University is part of a consortium that has constructed a 3.5-meter optical telescope located at Apache Point in the New Mexico mountains. One of the largest university-operated telescopes in the country, faculty and students canaccess it remotely from a laboratory in the new Astronomy-Physics Building on the UW campus. UW astronomers have also used the Hubble Space Telescope to probe the secrets of stellar evolution, deriving a fresh understanding of the way that stars are born, change, and die. Scientists explore the nature of galaxies and theirmysterious content of \"dark matter.\" Other studies range from the nature of cos- mic black holes to mergers and violent collisions of galaxies, and quasar phe- nomena. The Center for Process Analytical Chemistry is a joint University/industry effort to develop novel sensors and instrumentation for continuous monitoring ofchemical processes used in the manufacturing and environmental settings. Projects range from fiber-optic sensors and spectrometric methods to data analysis and process-control algorithms.Engineering and Applied Sciences A group of UW engineering researchers working in the field of biomimetics is taking its inspiration from nature in designing new materials. The group is prob- ing the secrets of such natural substances as slug mucus, spider webs, andabalone shells in order to produce man-made materials that are stronger, lighter, less expensive, and more environmentally benign to manufacture than conven- tional materials. The Center for Bioengineering is the home of pioneering work in diagnostic ultrasound, which enables physicians to image in detail the internal features of a patient without having to perform surgery. In addition, important strides con- tinue to be made in understanding how to design man-made materials that arecompatible with the human body. Working together in the University ofWashington Engineering Biomaterials (UWEB) project, a group of UW researchers hopes to develop a new generation of medical implants that mimic the biology of the body parts they replace, thus fooling the body into acceptingforeign materials. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is known for its catalyt- ic role in bringing tools for designing microchips to engineers and industrial firms in the Pacific Northwest, and for its pioneering work to address criticalsafety issues in software systems. Recently, UW researchers have been recog- nized for work leading to a three-dimensional photography system as well as for the development of Internet and World Wide Web searching tools calledsoftware robots (\"softbots\"). The tremendous flexibility and power of Geographic Information Systems are being brought to bear on a wide range of research activities across the cam- pus. In a fusion of GIS, computer-aided design, and virtual reality, efforts are underway to link GIS capabilities with visualization tools to allow users to dis-play and move around in a virtual three-dimensional representation of a GIS database. A project at the Human Interface Technology (HIT) Lab, researchers have devel- oped a process to display electronic images directly on the human retina. Theyanticipate the retina display may replace computer screens and video monitors in the future. The University is part of the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER), a $20-million effort funded by the National Science Foundation. Its goalis to identify and mitigate potential earthquake hazards along the Pacific Coast. The UW joins eight California universities in the project. Amid mounting histori- cal evidence that the Pacific Northwest is at risk for devastating temblors, thecenter will study new ways to assess earthquake resistance, as well as seismicretrofitting options for major structures. Biological Sciences Research programs in the biological and zoological sciences take research teams to sites in the Pacific Northwest region and beyond, to remote corners ofthe world. Research in zoology has focused on the neurological basis of behav- ior and the origin of circadian rhythms, the physiology of insect development and the role of hormones in metamorphosis, and the ecology of intertidal com-munities. Pioneering field studies of the male red-winged blackbird conductedby UW zoologists have helped to explain the phenomenon of territorial domi- nance in animals. In order to study the tops of trees and tips of branches where most budding, branching, and photosynthesis occur, and to understand what makes foreststhrive, the UW has erected a construction crane in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest Washington. The crane's gondola can be moved in a 550- foot circle, giving researchers access to nearly six acres of old-growth canopy.The crane is the largest forest research crane in the world and the only one located in a temperate forest. UW microbiologists have pioneered genetic engineering techniques for plants. A UW group applied the latest gene mapping techniques to the problem of howmuch genetic change is required in order for a new species to evolve, one ofthe central mysteries of evolutionary biology. Investigators from the College of Forest Resources and the Departments of Biochemistry and Botany have teamed up in this effort. Researchers in the Department of Genetics in the College of Arts and Sciences conducted basic research in yeast genetics that led to a vaccine against Hepatitis B. Health Sciences Since its establishment many decades ago, the UW Health Sciences Center has become well known for its teaching, research, and patient care. Universityphysicians and staff members pioneered the first successful long-term kidneydialysis techniques, which have led to lifesaving treatments for tens of thou-sands of people. Continuing research is leading to the production of simplerand more portable devices for patients suffering from kidney failure. University physicians have been leaders in the development of bone marrow transplantation, which offers the hope of curing several forms of leukemia. E.Donnall Thomas, former head of medical oncology at the University (now pro- fessor emeritus and director emeritus of clinical research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), received the Nobel Prize in 1990 for developing bonemarrow grafting techniques. Fundamental research in biochemistry is unlocking the secrets of life processes at the molecular and cellular level. The discovery of protein phosphorylation\u2014 the reactions that regulate energy use, growth, and transformation of cells\u2014by UW scientists Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs was recognized with the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1992. In 2001, Dr. Lee Hartwell, professor of genetics at the UW and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, received the Nobel Prize. His pio-neering work in yeast genetics provided the foundation for understanding how normal cells divide and the mechanisms leading to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. In the School of Public Health and Community Medicine, a center in ecogenet- ics explores the genetic basis for cellular responses to environmental insults or other stresses. Research programs at the UW in the study of heart disease, dia- betes, and sexually transmitted diseases have achieved international recogni-tion. The School of Pharmacy has a strong program in pharmacokinetics, the study of how drugs are metabolized and the rate at which they affect target organs and are eliminated by the body. Research is aimed at the analysis and predic- tion of dangerous drug interactions. The UW School of Dentistry is renowned for its work in periodontology, the study of infectious diseases of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The School has the largest clinical service in the world dedicated to the challenges of treating patients with dental fears and phobias. Social Sciences Interactions among individuals and groups determine the texture of society. Thestudy of these interactions is the province of social scientists, whose workranges from basic research on perception to the effect of interest groups on public policy. Nationwide attention has been given to the work of UW investigators studying couples and the common factors that underlie successful relationships. In relat-ed research, several investigators are examining the processes of interaction in small groups, from families to work teams. The award-winning Social Development Research Group in the School of Social Work conducts innovative research on the causes and prevention of violence, crime, drug use, school dropout, and other problems that affect children and families. Important research in leadership and motivation, in human memory, and in alco- holism and addictive behavior is being carried on in a number of academic dis-ciplines. Alcoholism studies range from physiological experiments to modelcounseling programs for pregnant women to participant-observer studies of addictive behavior. The focus for this effort is the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute. Anthropologists are studying the changes in fertility, medical history, and cultur- al adaptation of the Japanese-American community in the Pacific Northwest, and the challenges faced by immigrants from Vietnam and Laos. Other faculty members are pursuing problems in distant locales and times, such as the begin-ning of agriculture in the Nile Valley. Geographers are studying regional issues, such as the economic linkages between the Pacific Northwest and other parts of the country, the design and financing of efficient and equitable transit systems, the recent surge in popula- tion of nonmetropolitan areas and its policy implications, and the geography ofaccess to health care. Social scientists at the University have a special interest in international rela- tions. The University has been a pioneer in research concerning the Near and Far East. In the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, scholars inpolitical science, anthropology, sociology, and the humanities study the role of culture in international affairs. Economists and geographers study develop- ment, resource management, and international economics. Historians comple-ment the work of social scientists in exploring the basis of current thought, andscholars in languages and literature provide essential knowledge of originaltexts and the relationship of language to culture. Humanities and the Arts Research in the humanities often fulfills a primary mission of humanistic study\u2014the preservation of the literary and artistic achievements of mankind. One aspectof this research is textual scholarship, involving the identification and authenti-cation of original texts and artifacts. New knowledge is also generated throughreassessment of earlier texts and works of art. The Early Buddhist Manuscript Project was founded by the British Library and the UW to promote the study, editing, and publication of a unique collection of 57 fragments of Buddhist manuscripts on birch bark scrolls. Texts that form part of Egypt's Nag Hammadi Library, found more than a quarter of a century ago but only recently translated from Coptic, may lead to a reinter-pretation of early Christianity. Located near the upper Nile, the library contains documents from little-known monastic groups, previously unknown Christian gospels, and both familiar and unfamiliar sayings of Jesus. A UW scholar study-ing these texts expects them to have as great an impact as the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The texts also will shed more light on the heretical Gnostic movement, which offers a radically different interpretation of Genesis. Theoretical studies also form an important component of research in the arts. Some faculty in the School of Music conduct extensive research in the scientific analysis of sound, known as systematic musicology. Studies in this field include the influence of vibrato on judgments of vocal blend; context and time in musi-cal perception; and rhythmic responses of preschool children. Other facultymembers are exploring new ways of creating music, including the use of com- puters. The concept of scholarly achievement in the arts often is synonymous with per- formance or exhibition. The UW School of Music has on its faculty a number ofnationally recognized composers. The School of Music also is home to one of the finest opera programs in the country. The School of Art faculty includes nationally and internationally known artists and scholars in nearly every one of its ten studio, art history, and design disci-plines. Studio artists carry on the age-old quest for aesthetic quality but also pursue stylistic innovation, as well as developing new techniques in such diverse areas as non-toxic water-soluble printing and computer-generatedimagery. Many of the School's art historians have helped reshape this youngdiscipline through their studies of art as cultural expression. The UW School of Drama houses the famous Professional Actors' Training Program, which, besides teaching basic acting skills, provides an intensive introduction to the practice of the theatre arts. The program attracts dedicatedstudents who work for demanding, scrupulous visiting directors from the com- mercial stage as well as for permanent faculty members with extensive profes- sional experience. The University's program in creative writing is one of the oldest in the country. It achieved prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, when its faculty includedTheodore Roethke, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. The tradition of excel- lence continues, with current University poets and authors receiving critical acclaim throughout the nation, including Professor Charles Johnson, who wasawarded the 1990 National Book Award for Fiction. This concentration of talenthas made the University a center for literary activity in the Pacific Northwest. The Center for advanced Research Technologies in the Arts and Humanities (CARTAH) supports and promotes computer-based research and creative workin the arts and humanities. The center helps foster liaisons between the researchcommunity and the University's arts and humanities departments, and provides state-of-the-art computing and media resources. CARTAH has become knowninternationally as an important center for producing new digital art and plays akey role in developing educational technology at the UW.THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH 45 UW EXTENSION 46 UW Extension Office of Educational Outreach (UW Extension, Summer Quarter, Evening Degree Program, and Distance Learning) Vice Provost David P.

Community and EnvironmentalPlanning 410 Gould depts.washington.edu/~cep/ Undergraduate Program Adviser Dennis Ryan 410 Gould, Box 355740 206-543-4190 Community and Environmental Planning (CEP) is an award-winning, interdisciplinary Bachelor of Artsdegree program offered through the College as one of the University's interdisciplinary undergraduate programs. CEP has gained distinction as a model fora highly personalized, active, and relevant educa-tional experience within a large research institution. Housed in the Department of Urban Design and Planning, CEP students liberally draw upon the entirerange of courses, faculty, and programs at the UW. The problems we face in this world are simply too great to be met without active engagement from allperspectives and knowledge. To this end, a CEPeducation is founded on the following: start whereyou are; articulate and embrace a vision of how youintend to make a difference in the world; construct aplan, with guidance from faculty and peers, of CEPseminars and cross-disciplinary courses and fieldexperiences; move deliberately with it in the final twoyears of undergraduate education; through first-hand experience and in the context of the CEP communityof learners, become acquainted with effective ways for working constructively together to anticipate and address critical issues facing the complex communi-ties and world we inhabit. A CEP education is fully lived, not passively taken. CEP students actively make their education in com- munity with others. Students learn from learninggroups of seventeen. Each group comprises a com-munity of mutual learning that requires commitment, personal investment, and strong teamwork strategies for two years. Through six interconnected, quarterlyseminars students engage the core content of the major: community, environment, and planning. These contemporary academic fields and areas of researchinclude the study of community as subject and prac- tice, exploration of the ecological context of all soci- etal life, and an investigation of the potentials of plan-ning for developing strategies for positive change. Students design two-year-long individual study plans with faculty. Each builds a unique, strong degree experience with intellectual integrity, combining the quarterly CEP core seminars with a self-selected setof rigorous courses \u2014 including 25 credits of meth- ods \u2014 and outside experiences. CEP students have gone on to careers in a variety of interdisciplinary fields such as community planningand organization, urban development, communica- tions, work in the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, pub- lic administration, education, community and envi-ronmental activism, ecology, and government/com- munity relations.

Offered: AWSpS.Architecture 208 Gould General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Archit.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/archdept/ The Department of Architecture one undergraduate degree, the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in archi- tectural studies and two graduate degrees, theMaster of Architecture (M.Arch.) degree (an accred- ited professional degree), and the Master of Science in Architecture (M.S.) degree (an advancedresearch-oriented degree). The B.A. in architectural studies is a pre-professional degree that prepares candidates for admission to professional architectur- al programs with advanced standing, as well as forother roles in society in related fields\u2014in research, government, development, management, planning, etc. While many of these occupations do not requirea professional license, they do require an under- standing of and exposure to a professional educa- tion. The professional program (M.Arch.) is based onthe architect's need to be a generalist well-roundedin the liberal arts, with a full command of the disci- pline of architecture, who can assume an enlight- ened, responsible, and creative role in society. The curricula of the B.A. and M.Arch. include both broad and focused courses that cover the many and various aspects of architecture: design, graphics, computing, structural engineering, building sci-ences, history, theory, ecology, sociology, psycholo- gy, cultural studies, law, and professional practice. The faculty comprises a large and diverse group ofteachers, practitioners, scholars, and researchers who represent a wide spectrum of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. Approximately thirtypermanent faculty members are supplemented bydozens of part-time professional practitioners from the region and around the country, as well as by exchange scholars from foreign institutions. Priorities stressed by the faculty reflect changing ideas and concepts of architecture. Studios in the B.A. and M.Arch. programs are sequenced, begin- ning with fundamentals and demanding an increas-ing independence at advanced levels. The defined studio sequence not only helps clarify the student's experience, but also insures that students get abroad and coherent cross section of design prob-lems and instructors. Most states require that an individual intending to become an architect hold an accredited degree. There are two types of degrees that are accreditedby the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB): (1) the Bachelor of Architecture, which requires a minimum of five years of architectural study (this degree is not offered at the University ofWashington), and (2) the Master of Architecture, which requires a minimum of three years of study fol- lowing an unrelated bachelor's degree or two yearsfollowing a related pre-professional bachelor's degree. These professional degrees are structured to educate those who aspire to registration and licen-sure to practice as architects. The four-year, pre-professional degree is not accred- ited by NAAB. The pre-professional degree is usefulto those desiring a foundation in the field of architec-ture as preparation for either continued education ina professional degree program or for employmentoptions in fields related to architecture. Architectural education at the University of Washington requires a minimum of six years of high-er education to attain the first professional degree, the Master of Architecture. The curriculum is dividedinto three two-year segments of course work with a pre-professional Bachelor of Arts degree (with a major in Architectural Studies) awarded at the com-pletion of the second two-year segment. The profes- sional degree, Master of Architecture, is awarded only upon completion of the third segment. (Studentswith bachelor's degrees in unrelated fields take anadditional year of course work\u2014see below.) Students must also complete a master's thesis, extending over one or more additional quarters, on adesign problem or research topic of their choice. Admission to the professional program requires admission to the Graduate School of the Universityof Washington. Undergraduate Program Advisers Elaine Day Latourelle Kimberly S. Sawada208 Gould Hall, Box 355720 206-543-4217 bainfo@u.washington.edu Bachelor of Arts The College of Architecture and Urban Planning offers a Bachelor of Arts degree program with a major in architectural studies administered by theDepartment of Architecture. The undergraduate pro- gram is comprised of two two-year sequences. Building on a firm liberal arts foundation, the under-graduate curriculum provides a broadly based gen- eral education with a focus on architecture and the built environment that prepares students for profes- sional-level graduate work in architecture or allied disciplines, and for a wide variety of study and careeropportunities in other areas and professions. The first two-year segment of undergraduate educa- tion includes 17 credits of prepatory architecturalcoursework in addition to 73 credits devoted to sat- isfying general education requirements, which include coursework in visual, literary, and performingarts; math and science; and the social sciences. The intent of the fist two years is to have students build their critical thinking and communication skills, gainbroad exposure to other disciplines in order to make more informed academic and career decisions, as well as to provide the broad academic foundationessential to successful study in architecture. There is a competitive admissions process for those applying to be accepted into the second two-year undergraduate segment (years 3 and 4). At this level, the coursework is focused around providing studentswith a firm foundation in the historical, theoretical, technological, and environmental forces that influ- ence architectural design. Design studio courseworkis also introduced during years 3 and 4 to providestudents with the opportunity and environment in which to synthesize their knowledge and skills through design projects. Students may also choose a dual major in both Architecture and Construction Management and can receive both the B.A. in Architectural Studies and the B.S. in Construction Management. Five years ofstudy is usually the minimum necessary to completethe requirements for both degree programs. Advising: Advising for program premajors is done through the Undergraduate Gateway Center, 171Mary Gates Hall, 206-543-2550. Advising for archi-tectural studies majors is provided by the programadvisers in the Department of Architecture, 208Gould, 206-543-4217.54COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING / ARCHITECTURE Admission Requirements 1. 90 credits to include the following: Preparatory Architectural Course Work, 17 cred- its: ARCH 350, 351, 352 (9 credits); ARCH 210,211 (8 credits).

The program provides a pro-fessional, accredited degree which enables gradu-ates to practice successfully in design firms, non- profit organizations, and public agencies. Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Building from a liberal arts foundation, the B.L.A. pro- gram focuses on developing design knowledge,skills, and abilities through a series of nine environ- mental- and community-based design studios. The goals of the program are to provide students with a broad academic and professional exposure tolandscape architecture and design so that their cre- ative potential and professional growth are realized, and so that they may become leaders in the field.The education includes learning to conceptualizeand design through practice on studio projects, fos- tering creativity, developing graphic and verbal com- munication skills, facilitating cognitive abilities, anddeveloping applicable computer skills in the design process. Studios use individual, team-oriented, and interdisciplinary projects to develop strong interac-tive and evaluative skills. Studio education applies knowledge gained in lec- ture courses which include historic and contempo- rary concepts in landscape architecture, design the- ory, site planning, construction, and communica-tions, and elective courses in allied disciplines. Thestudio sequence addresses projects from detailed toregional scales, rural and urban contexts, and diverse cultures. The five-year, 225-credit degree is structured around nine studios augmented by lecture courses. The pro-gram includes some opportunities for independent60COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING / LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE studies and work in professional settings. Departmental courses are complimented by electivecourses from other departments, including architec- ture, urban horticulture, soils, geology, urban design and planning, botany, and ecology. Landscape architecture studios are led by depart- mental faculty or members of the professional com- munity. Several studios are taught jointly with faculty from other disciplines. Studios address specific areas of inquiry including basic design principles and processes, planting design, materials andcraftsmanship, landscape planning for parks or nat- ural areas, neighborhood and housing design, urban landscape design, ecological restoration, anddesign for ethnic cultures. A capstone pair of studios requires students to integrate their experience of design theory, practice, and construction in a resolved design and set of construction drawings. Departmental lecture courses address the function- ing of natural systems, site planning issues, comput- er applications, and cultural and sociological forcesthat influence the profession's work. Students are encouraged to gain real-world experience through professional experience \"practicums\" with profes-sional firms, organizations, or agencies.

Stein\u2014Research General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/arts_sci.html College Web page: www.artsci.washington.edu The departments and schools of the College of Arts and Sciences offer nearly 100 curricula leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of FineArts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science, aswell as graduate study leading to master's and doc- toral degrees. Undergraduate Study Graduation Requirements A liberal arts education entails mastery of certain basic skills, exposure to a broad range of academicdisciplines, and concentration in a particular field of knowledge. To be awarded a baccalaureate degree a student in the College must fulfill requirements inthe following areas: Language Skills, Reasoning and Writing in Context, Areas of Knowledge, and a Major (see table below). All required courses must be takenfor a numerical grade. In addition, the student must present at least 90 credits outside the major depart- ment and must meet minimum GPA requirements asspecified below. Detailed information on graduationrequirements is provided in the Bachelor's Degree Planbook, available from the Undergraduate Gateway Center, 171 Mary Gates Hall. Language Skills To receive a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students whose first enrollment in college (whether at the UW or elsewhere) was in autumn quarter 1985 or later are required to complete 5 cred-its of English composition with a minimum grade of2.0. They must also complete course work through the end of the first-year college sequence in a for- eign language, with at least a 2.0 in the third-quartercourse, or demonstrate equivalent proficiency by passing an examination or by receiving a passing grade in a qualifying course beyond the first-yearlevel. Credits used for these two requirements(including the entire first year of foreign language, iftaken) cannot also be applied to the Areas ofKnowledge requirements described below.Reasoning and Writing in Context Students who first entered college autumn quarter 1985 or later must complete a minimum of 5 creditsin Quantitative or Symbolic Reasoning (Q/SR) and 10 credits of additional composition courses or courses that emphasize the development of writing skills inthe context of an academic discipline (W courses).Q/SR and writing courses, if they apply, can also be counted toward Areas of Knowledge or major requirements. The writing requirement is in addition to the English composition requirement mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Areas of Knowledge The Areas of Knowledge requirement is the means by which the student develops a breadth of knowl-edge. Undergraduate courses are currently divided broadly into three categories: Visual, Literary, and Performing Arts; Individuals and Societies; and theNatural World. Each student must select at least 20credits in courses from each of the three fields and an additional 15 credits from any courses in the three fields. Of the 75 total credits required, 15 may be fromcourses in the student's major department.

Art 104 Art General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/art.html Department Web page: net.art.washington.edu The School of Art serves a dual role within the edu- cational structure of the University of Washington. It is both a professional school and an academic department. As a professional school it trains stu-dents for active careers in the visual arts; as a school of the College of Arts and Sciences it offers studio and lecture courses. All of its course offerings andits curriculum requirements are based on the under-lying philosophy that an awareness and understand- ing of the visual arts are necessary to a liberal edu-cation, and that a liberal education is necessary tothe training of a professional artist.Undergraduate Program Advisers Matthew CampbellJudith Clark 104 Art, Box 353440 206-543-0646uaskart@u.washington.edu The School of Art offers programs of study leading to either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees. Students may pursue a B.F.A. in ceramics,fibers, industrial design, metals, painting, photogra- phy, printmaking, sculpture, or visual communication design. Students receiving an undergraduate degree in art can expect to develop strong writing, analytical, crit- ical-thinking, and problem-solving skills. Students learn to recognize the power of the visual image andunderstand its importance in a world increasinglydependent on the aesthetic and technical skill of trained artists and designers to create images that communicate information and ideas across culturesand generations. In addition to becoming practicing artists, art gradu- ates find careers in fields such as gallery and muse- um management, arts education, arts administration,photojournalism, film making, graphic and product design, interior design, teaching, advertising, art therapy, and visual and digital technology. Student Associations: Students majoring in the stu- dio arts have the opportunity to participate in several student associations: Hephestium (metals), Zeeware (ceramics), Broadclothes (fiber), PrintmakersAssociation (printmaking), a photo guild, and theInter Arts Council. These organizations raise funds though the sale of members' work to support visiting artists and lectures and to sponsor student involve-ment in regional arts events. Internship or Cooperative Exchange Program Opportunities: The School of Art has several pro- grams that help students develop professional prac-tices and expand their knowledge outside the UW: internships for credit, Artist in Residence programs, K-12 Educational Partnerships, Art on Loan, and theStudio Art Rome program. Admission Requirements: Entering freshmen and transfer students may declare an Art major by sched- uling an appointment with an Art adviser on or after their orientation/registration date. Currently enrolledUniversity students who wish to declare an art major must have a minimum 2.50 GPA and meet with an Art adviser any time during the quarter except the firstweek. It is essential that students read the School of Art, Art History, and Design's \"Information for Prospective Undergraduate Students\" (available in the Art office or online at net.art.washington.edu)prior to the first meeting with an Art adviser. Portfolios: Students who begin college at the UW and transfer students who have not yet completed any art credits do not need to submit a portfolio to declarean art major, though some competitive programs require a portfolio to continue in the program. Students who wish to pursue one of the competitivemajors or who have completed art credits at anothercollege or university should refer to information in the publication mentioned above. Admission Policy for Postbaccalaureate Applicants: Postbaccalaureate study in studio art is limited;admission requirements vary within the ten Artmajors.

Astronomy C319 Physics-Astronomy Building General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/astronomy.html Department Web page: www.astro.washington.edu Modern research in astronomy and astrophysics encompasses a large number of disciplines and spe- cialties, and the faculty members of the Department of Astronomy are active in many of these areas.Research areas of the department include planetary astronomy, stellar structure and evolution, interstellar matter, x-ray sources, galactic structure, extragalac-tic astronomy, galactic dynamics, quasars and galactic nuclei, and theoretical and observational cosmology. The department operates a 30-inch tele-scope with modern instrumentation at the ManastashRidge Observatory near Ellensburg primarily for stu- dents. The department is also part of a consortium of universities which operates a 3.5-meteroptical/infrared telescope located on Sacramento Peak, New Mexico, and is a partner in the innovative Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Students also have accessto a variety of national facilities, such as the Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo observatories and the Very Large Array. A variety of research is conducted with satel-lite instruments such as the Hubble SpaceTelescope. Data analysis and theoretical research are conducted on the department's cluster of SUN, and PC computers, and on a variety of UW andnational supercomputer facilities. Undergraduate majors often assist faculty members in acquisition, reduction, and interpretation of data. Undergraduate Program Adviser Paula Szkody C311 Physics-Astronomy, Box 351580 206-543-1988 office@astro.washington.edu The Department of Astronomy offers a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Science degree. Withthis degree, students obtain a knowledge of the com- ponents of the universe, an understanding of the physics of its structure, and the technical skills toobtain and analyze data from telescopes. Graduatesgo on to graduate school or work at observatories orin industrial applications (lasers, x-ray, optical imag-ing) or in teaching applications. Student Associations: The Society of Physics Students, UAI.COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / ASTRONOMY 91 Internship or Cooperative Exchange Program Opportunities: Space Grant. Bachelor of Science Admission: Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time. Suggested Introductory Course Work: MATH 124, 125, 126 or MATH 127, 128, 129; MATH 308, 324; PHYS 121, 122, 123. Additional Information: The first required astronomy course, ASTR 321, must be preceded by at least oneyear of college physics and mathematics. Any lower- division astronomy courses count as electives and not as part of the major. At community colleges it isbetter to take courses in physics, chemistry, mathe-matics, and computer science than the usual intro- ductory astronomy courses. To finish in four years, the student must have completed PHYS 123 beforeautumn quarter of the junior year. Major Requirements: ASTR 321, 322, 323; 9 credits of astronomy 400-level courses (with at least 3 cred- its in 480 or 499); PHYS 121, 122, 123; 224, 225, 227,228; 321, 322, 334; MATH 124, 125, 126 (or 127, 128, 129); 308, 324; 12 additional credits in courses at the 300 level or above in physics (chosen from PHYS315, 323, 324, 328, 331, 335, 421, 422, 423, 424,425, 426, 431, 432, 433, 434) or engineering as approved by adviser. Data analysis (ASTR 480) and senior-year research (ASTR 499) are highly recom-mended, especially for students planning graduate work. No grade lower than 2.0 is acceptable in cours- es fulfilling the above requirements. Undergraduatesinterested in advanced work in astronomy are advised to take a double major in astronomy and physics. Undergraduates interested in immediateemployment at an observatory or other scientific insti- tution should include computing and electronics courses as part of their program.

Undergraduate Program AdvisersLani Stone 109 Bagley, Box 351700 206-543-9343, 206-616-9597 advisers@chem.washington.edu Since the study of any chemistry-based field requires an understanding of mathematics and physics, theBachelor of Science degree in biochemistry requiresintroductory courses in mathematics, physics, chem-istry, and biology as well as intermediate-level cours-es in chemistry. These courses prepare the studentfor junior and senior studies in biochemistry, molecu-lar genetics, and molecular biology. Since the sub-ject requires a very broad scientific foundation, the program requires a minimum of 196 credits. At theadvanced level, the student has a choice of a wide range of courses in a variety of science departments. Students planning work in the biotechnology field, or those planning on a health professional career, findthe biochemistry degree an excellent choice. Combining introductory core courses from several different departments, this degree is also goodpreparation for graduate school in classical andemerging fields of biomedical research. Student Associations: The Free Radicals, a general undergraduate club for chemistry and biochemistry majors. Phi Lambda Upsilon, the UW affiliate of thenational chemistry honorary society. Bachelor of Science Admission: Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time.

Graduate Program For information on the Department of Biochemistry'sgraduate program, see the graduate and profession-al volume of the General Catalog or visit the General Catalog online at www.washington.edu/students/ gencat/. Biology 318 Hitchcock General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/biology.html Department Web page: www.biology.wash- ington.edu/biology/ Biology is the broadly based study of living organ- isms and may be approached by focus on cell and molecular processes, development, organismal physiology and morphology, natural history, evolu-tion, conservation, or ecology. The aim is to elucidategeneral principles applicable to many different sortsof organisms rather than to concentrate on any par-ticular taxonomic group. Biology is often interdisci-plinary in nature and may involve aspects of bio-chemistry, botany, genetics, microbiology, zoology,and many other natural sciences.Undergraduate Program Advisers Ellen ChanLeal Freng Janet Germeraad318 Hitchcock, Box Biology Teaching Program Adviser Helen Buttemer 206-543-1689 A liberal arts degree in biology is applicable to many different fields, depending upon student interests.Students in the program gain analytical and labora- tory skills that prepare them for entry-level positions in a variety of biologically related areas, including,but not limited to, biotechnology, laboratory and/orfield research support, health science support, wildlife biology, and ecology and conservation work. Students may also continue their education in pro-fessional schools (for instance, in medicine, veteri- nary science, dentistry, or medical technology), or in graduate programs that focus on some aspect of bio-logical science (such as genetics, microbiology, immunology, ecology, environmental health, or cell and molecular biology). The undergraduate program in biology offers two alternative interdisciplinary options leading to a bac- calaureate degree. The emphasis of Option 1 is cell and molecular biology, whereas the emphasis ofOption 2 is ecology, evolution, and conservation biol-ogy. Option 1 is particularly well suited for students who wish to pursue immediate entry-level employment or graduate studies in genetics, biochemistry, microbi-ology, cell biology, or developmental biology, as well as for candidates for professional schools such as medicine. Option 2 is designed for students who wish to pur- sue graduate studies or immediate employment in ecology, evolution, conservation biology, or mathe- matical biology, as well as for students preparing forrelated areas of law or public policy. A number of other degree programs in biological fields or with strong biological orientations exist. These include, but are not limited to, Biochemistry, Botany, Microbiology, Psychology, and Zoology. TheUniversity of Washington's Colleges of Forest Resources and Ocean and Fishery Sciences also offer biologically oriented degree programs forundergraduates. Each of the above bachelor's degrees in the biologi- cal sciences can be combined with Washington State requirements to prepare students to teach biology in public schools at the secondary level. See theBiology Teaching Program Adviser for specific requirements. Student Associations: Beta Beta Beta Biology Honor Society (Tri Beta), tribeta@u.washington.edu; PreMed Society (Alpha Epsilon Delta), aed@u.washing- ton.edu. Bachelor of Science Admission Requirements for Both Options: BIOL 180 or 201 with a minimum grade of 2.5; or BIOL 180,200, 220 (or 201, 202, 203) with a cumulative GPA of2.00 for the three courses. A minimum cumulativeGPA of 2.00 is required for all courses which wouldapply toward major requirements (this includes allapplicable chemistry, physics, mathematics, andintroductory biological science courses).COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / BIOLOGY 95 Suggested Introductory Course Work: Option 1: CHEM 142, 152, 162; CHEM 223, 224 (or CHEM 237, 238, 239); MATH 124, 125 (or MATH 144,145, or Q SCI 291, 292, or MATH 127, 128); MATH 126 (or MATH 129 or MATH 146 or STAT 311 or Q SCI 381); BIOL 180, 200, 220 (or 201, 202, 203); PHYS114, 115 (or PHYS 121, 122). Option 2: CHEM 142, 152, 162, and CHEM 223, 224 or CHEM 237, 238, 239 (students may substitute for all of the above, the short sequence CHEM 120, 220,221); MATH 124, 125 (or MATH 144, 145, or Q SCI291, 292, or MATH 127, 128); BIOL 180, 200, 220 (or 201, 202, 203); PHYS 114, 115 (or PHYS 121, 122). Additional Information: Concentrate on mathematics and general chemistry in the first year. Transfer stu-dents: if possible, complete entire sequences at one school. It is not necessary, or even desirable, to com- plete the Areas of Knowledge requirement during thefirst two years. Major Requirements: For both options the following basic course work is required: one year of mathe- matics (calculus and/or statistics); three to six quar-ters of chemistry covering general and organicchemistry; two quarters of physics; and one year of introductory biology. See Suggested Introductory Course Work above. Option 1 requires one to twoquarters of physical chemistry. The two options diverge substantially in their require- ments for advanced course work. Option 1 Core requires GENET 371 or 372; and either (1) BIOC 440, 441, 442 or (2) BIOC 405, 406 and BIOL 401. Option 2 Core requires BIOL 454, 472, and 476. Additional upper-division work in both options is selected fromcourse lists designed to ensure both breadth and depth of coverage. A minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for all UW courses applied toward major requirements, including upper-division biological sci- ence courses and the introductory biology and required supporting science and mathematics cours- es. (A grade of 2.0 is not required in individual cours-es.) Transfer students must take a minimum of 15 credits in upper-division courses at the UW. Students pursuing a double major or degree should be awarethat some restrictions on overlapping courses apply. See an adviser for details. Because of the differing specific requirements and choices for each option, it is extremely important forstudents to work closely with the Biology Programadvisers.

AWSpS. Canadian Studies See International Studies Chemistry 109 Bagley General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/chemistry.html Department Web page: www.chem.washington.edu Chemistry is a branch of natural science that deals principally with the properties of substances, the changes they undergo, and the natural laws that describe these changes. Chemistry is a central sci-ence, connecting on one side with physics and math- ematics, on another with earth and environmental science, and on yet another with biology and medi-cine. Undergraduate Program 206-616-9597 advisers@chem.washington.edu At the end of their studies, graduating chemistry majors should have a general knowledge of the basicareas of chemistry with a working knowledge of atleast one area; be proficient in basic laboratory skills;have the ability to carry out strategies for solving sci-entific problems; have an understanding of the prin- ciples and applications of modern instrumentation,computation, experimental design, and data analy- sis; have had the opportunity to gain experience with a research project; have the ability to communicatescientific information clearly and precisely; have the ability to read, understand, and use scientific litera- ture; have an awareness of the broader implicationsof chemical processes; have had the opportunity towork as part of a team to solve scientific problems; and have had an introduction to opportunities in, and requirements for, the careers available to chemistry majors. The Department of Chemistry offers both a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry. The Bachelor of Science degree is designed to encour-age early research experience for graduate-school hopefuls. The B.S. in chemistry is divided into two options. Option A provides more choices in classesthan Option B, including biochemistry courses.Depending on the choices made, it can also be good for students wishing to work in industry after gradua- tion. Option B is the only UW chemistry degree certi-fied by the American Chemical Society and follows its strict guidelines. It provides a broad chemistry education, with all fields represented and moreadvanced labs required. The Bachelor of Arts in chemistry fills the needs of students whose chosen career requires a strong the- oretical understanding of chemistry, but where thelaboratory experience is less intense. High school teaching, environmental or patent law practice, or working in industry in positions in sales or manage-ment (where a chemistry background is essential,but advanced lab techniques are not) would be appropriate career choices with the B.A. Student Associations: Alpha Chi Sigma, the UW affil- iate of the national chemistry-related science organi-zation for chemistry and biochemistry majors.

Classics 218 Denny General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Classics.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/clasdept/ Classics embraces the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages. The department is concerned with the Greekand Latin languages and their literatures, including poetry, drama, history, philosophy, rhetoric, and polit- ical theory, as well as with classical art and archaeol-ogy. Undergraduate Program AdviserDoug Machle 218 Denny, Box 353110 206-543-2266clasdept@u.washington.edu The department offers four undergraduate majors. Of these, the majors in classics, Greek, and Latin are the most traditional: they emphasize the develop-ment of expertise in the classical languages and lit-eratures. Many who take the bachelor degrees in classics go on to pursue graduate work in the sub- ject. Because of its long tradition, the B.A. in Classicsis a most respected terminal degree in itself. Like other degree programs in the humanities, it empha- sizes the acquisition of those analytic and communi-cations skills which are indispensable for careers in government, industry, law, medicine, and business. The classics major is often a mark of distinction whena graduate applies for admission to professionalschool. A fourth major, the Bachelor of Arts in Classical Studies, is especially suited to students wishing to explore the literature, history, art, archaeology, andphilosophy of classical antiquity primarily through English translations. The classical studies major demands less study of the classical languages ofGreece and Rome than is required for the othermajors. Students with no previous exposure to Greek or Latin can complete the classical studies major in two years. Students have often combined this majorwith another major, such as English, history, or art history, and even with a non-humanities major such as computer science, biochemistry, or economics. The department also offers minors in Classical Studies, Greek, Latin, and Classics and AncientHistory. Classical Seminar in Rome: During spring quarter, the department offers instruction in classics foradvanced undergraduate majors and graduate stu-dents at the University of Washington Rome Center,located in the Palazzo Pio on the Campo de' Fiori.Bachelor of Arts Admission: Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time.

Computer scientists are interest- ed in such topics as the representation and storage of information; algorithms to access, display, edit,and transform information; programming languagesto express algorithms; and hardware and software processors to execute algorithms. These concerns lead to practical developments in computer systemssoftware, such as operating systems and compilers, and in application areas, such as artificial intelli- gence, computer graphics, and computational biolo-gy, and to theoretical investigations of computers, algorithms, and data. The objective of undergradu- ate education in computer science is to developbroadly educated and competent graduates for pro-fessional careers or graduate studies. Especially important is a foundation that will endure as technol- ogy advances and changes. Instructional and Special Research Facilities The Computer Science laboratories provides exten- sive, efficient, and powerful state-of-the-art facilities for undergraduate, graduate, and faculty instruction and research. The equipment base is upgraded fre-quently. (For an up-to-date description please see the descriptions in the online undergraduate and graduate brochures, available via the department'shomepage.) The same is true for the department'ssoftware base where there are several modern oper- ating systems including Windows-NT, Unix, Solaris, and Linux, as well as extensive collections of soft-ware applications and development tools for each. The department's students have access to these resources in several laboratories in Sieg Hall and through direct modem access administered by the University. All the department's workstations provide users with full Internet access and nearly all thedepartment's courses make extensive use of the World Wide Web. In addition to general computing laboratories, the department also supports special- ized laboratories for computer graphics, hardware,and embedded system design that also support more-advanced computing platforms and software. Undergraduate Programs A Bachelor of Science degree in computer science is offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and is administered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The department alsooffers a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineer-ing degree, administered through the College of Engineering, and graduate degrees in computer sci- ence and engineering. Information concerning theB.S. degree in computer engineering can be foundunder Computer Science and Engineering in theCollege of Engineering section of this catalog. Thedepartment's Web page should be consulted for themost current information. The computer science field has a broad base of pri- vate- and public-sector jobs suitable for the Bachelorof Science graduate: systems analyst, systems pro-114 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / DANCE grammer, applications programmer, technical sales and marketing, and hardware or software engineer-ing specialist. In addition, there are jobs for which graduate education may be appropriate: producers and developers of computer systems, and teachersand researchers. The field is also highly valued for practicing entrepreneurship and is considered one of the most vibrant in the sciences. The departmental core requirements of the two undergraduate majors are identical. The computerscience major may be more appropriate for students who want to earn a double major with another College of Arts and Sciences program (for example,mathematics or economics), who want the additional flexibility of the computer science requirements (the computer engineering major has more requiredcourses and fewer electives), or who may be more interested in the theory, design, and implementation of software systems and applications (for example,the techniques of modern compilers, or the algo-rithms behind computer graphics and animation). The computer engineering major may be more appropriate for students who are interested in creat- ing and building systems that include both hardwareand software components and must be engineered to meet a variety of cost and performance con- straints. The program includes a general foundationin engineering fundamentals to enable interdiscipli- nary work with other departments in the College of Engineering and the University as a whole. The Department of Computer Science and Engineer- ing cooperates with the departments of Applied Mathematics, Mathematics, and Statistics in an interdepartmental Bachelor of Science degree pro-gram in Applied and Computational MathematicalSciences. The program builds a broad foundation in the mathematical sciences and offers the option of specializing in computer sciences though choice ofthe Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms Option. Degree requirements can be found in the Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences section.

The department's scope extends from the center of Earth to the rim of the solar system, and its activities cut across traditional disci-plines of physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and mathematics. The department's faculty, students, and staff examine Earth's interior structure, chem-istry, motion, and dynamics; geologic hazards; processes affecting the surface environment and cli- mate; the surrounding space environment; planetaryprocesses; and geobiology. Undergraduate Program Adviser George Bergantz 302A Johnson, Box 351310advising@ess.washington.edu The Department of Earth and Space Sciences offers two undergraduate degrees. The Bachelor of Arts degree is designed for students who wish to obtain abroad understanding of the history, composition, and dynamics of the earth, either for personal enrichment or as training for careers such as science journalism,environmental law, or K-12 teaching. The Bachelor ofScience degree, which requires more credits in math- ematics and physical sciences, is designed for stu- dents who intend eventually to enter a graduate pro-gram in earth science and pursue a professional career. Both degrees require 55 credits in Earth and Space Sciences and 35 credits in related sciences.All required courses must be completed with a mini- mum grade of 2.0. The Biology Option allows B.S. students interested in paleontology and paleobiolo-gy to substitute certain biology courses for mathe-matics and physical sciences. Courses and a minor are also offered for nonmajors interested in under- standing the processes responsible for the distribu-tion of continents, landscapes, the availability of nat- ural resources, and the occurrence of such natural hazards as earthquakes and volcanoes.

As a social science, it studies the institutions and arrange- ments that societies use to create and allocate pro- ductive resources in order to increase the well beingof their members. It advances understanding of the choices and behavior of individuals, households, firms, and other organizations. For undergraduates, the role of the Department of Economics is to train students in a rigorous, analyti- cal discipline that advances their problem-solving abilities and their understanding of important publicissues. The department has a long tradition of innovative scholarship and demanding and inspiring teaching of economics. Its programs are successful and attract students of exceptional quality. Both programshave benefited from substantial changes in curricu- lum and instructional technology in recent years. Undergraduate Program Advisers 304 Savery, Box 353330 206-543-5794 econadv@u.washington.edu The Department of Economics offers two undergrad- uate degrees that differ in both admission and grad-uation requirements. The Bachelor of Arts degree is designed to provide a general background in economics for the vast majority of departmental majors. It provides the flexi- bility and social science training to prepare studentsfor employment in a variety of areas. Also, it is an excellent preparation for many masters-level gradu- ate programs in other disciplines and for profession-al schools such as law and medicine. The Bachelor of Science degree requires more math- ematics for admission, and its graduation require-ments have a more pronounced quantitative empha-sis. It is designed to provide undergraduates a rigor-ous background in economic analysis. This degreeis designed for students who plan to do graduatestudy in economics or who plan to enter certain tech-nically oriented professions, such as actuarial sci-COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / ECONOMICS 123 ence, demography, financial analysis, or environ- mental consulting.

General Studies 171 Mary Gates Hall General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/gen_studies.html Program Web page: depts.washington.edu/genstudy/ General Studies is an interdisciplinary, individually designed major option for students who wish to cre- ate a program of study by combining selected cours-es from two or more departments. Students arerequired to identify a central organizing theme for their major and design it under the guidance and supervision of at least two faculty members and aGeneral Studies adviser. Undergraduate Program Adviser171 Mary Gates Hall, Box 352805206-543-2550 genstudy@u.washington.edu The General Studies program offers both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, dependingon the theme and curriculum of the approved major.Ethnomusicology and technical writing are two facul- ty-designed major options also available through General Studies. Ethnomusicology (B.A.) focuses onthe study of world cultures through their musical expression. Technical writing (B.A. or B.S.) offers the study of writing and other modes of communicationin a variety of technical environments. Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science Before designing a General Studies major, students should read Designing a General Studies Major at depts.washington.edu/genstudy/genst.html, or obtain a copy from the Undergraduate Advising Center, 171 Mary Gates Hall. Particular attentionshould be paid to the sections on restrictions onthemes and restricted access to courses. GeneralStudies majors are not possible in a number of sub-jects because the UW does not offer sufficient coursework. Also, courses available to students in competi-tive majors cannot be included in General Studiesproposals.Once the guidelines have been read, the student must go through the following steps to design theirmajor: 1.Identify the unifying interdisciplinary theme of your program. 2. Make a list of courses you have taken or plan to take toward this goal. This list should comprise between 50 and 70 quarter credits, all of which are related to your area of concentration. Thesecourses come from at least two departments, butmay come from any number of areas, so long as interrelationships are discernible. Most of the courses must be 300- and 400-level courses. Atleast half of the 50-70 credits selected for the major must come from courses taught within the College of Arts and Sciences. 3.Draft a statement that describes your proposed major and discusses the interrelationships among the courses you have chosen. Propose a brief, descriptive title for your major. 4.Submit your proposal to the General Studies Committee for initial approval. Prospective majors should submit proposals to the General Studies Committee for review at least three quar-ters prior to graduation. 5.Identify at least two faculty sponsors for the major. The faculty sponsors attest to the intellec- tual soundness of your proposal and agree to provide whatever guidance you may jointlydecide you need. They may also suggest changes in your previously approved written pro- posal or list of courses. 6.Obtain final approval from a General Studies adviser. 7.Transfer students must be enrolled at the UW before applying to the major. Major Requirements: 55 to 70 credits, including com- pletion of the approved curriculum and a 5-creditrequired senior study (minimum grade of 2.7 required for senior study). Awarding of the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree depends on the content of each student's program.

Geography 408A Smith General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/geography.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/geog/ Geography is a far-reaching discipline providing a distinctive spatial approach to many of today's soci- etal problems and issues: regional inequality; and health-care delivery; urban growth man- agement; transportation efficiency; environmental pollution problems; economic impacts of majorinvestments or technological changes; spatial effi- ciency of industrial production; spatial inequality in the distribution of goods, services, and resources;and the activities of international corporations andpolitical states. Geography is the study of how indi- viduals, groups, and societies interact with their envi- ronments. The discipline offers sufficient skills train- ing to enable graduates to be competitive in many job markets. The study of geography emphasizes both technical and critical thinking skills. Geographers' skill setsinclude the ability to use Geographic InformationSystems (GIS) software to produce maps; advanced technical skills in statistical analysis; the ability to use census and other demographic data; sophisticationin locating data and interpreting it to help make an argument; sophistication in visual techniques for dis- playing data, including maps, charts, and graphs;advanced use of such software as spreadsheets, relational data bases, and Web page design; and the ability to present multiple models of land-use pat-terns for analysis in environmental and economicdecision making. Graduates have pursued careersas urban planners, environmental planners and land-use analysts, GIS analysts, economic analysts (mar-keting, location analysis, geodemographics), publichealth researchers, NGO specialists in developingnations, airline route analysts, import-export/interna-tional-trade specialists, real estate valuation special-ists, economic development specialists, social stud-ies teachers, and college professors.Geography seeks to understand the complex processes that result in the patterns, trends andimpacts of urbanization, migration, trade, and devel- opment. Geographers use interviews, written materi- al, observation, and secondary data to constructmodels, maps, and other tools for understanding. Special Research and Teaching Facilities A map center in Suzzallo Library houses atlases, sheet maps, and aerial photographs. Departmentalfacilities include the Edward L. Ullman Geography Collaboratory and the John C. Sherman Laboratory, which houses a variety of computer workstationsconnected to the campus computer network. The Ullman Collaboratory in 415 Smith provides a unique collaborative classroom with networked computerwork stations. The Geography Commons also pro- vides computer work stations for students. The Department of Geography is a member of the Centerfor Social Science Computation and Research, whichmaintains an extensive data archive and offers many statistical and software consulting services. Undergraduate Program Adviser Richard Roth 415B Smith, Box 353550 206-543-3246 geog@u.washington.edu The Department of Geography offers a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree, as well as a minor.

Mathematics C138 Padelford General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/mathematics.html Department Web page: www.math.washington.edu Mathematics is both a science and an art. Like any great art, mathematics has an intrinsic beauty and coherence that has attracted practitioners for cen- turies. Yet, unlike other arts, mathematics is a sur-prisingly effective tool for describing the natural world. Indeed, mathematics has come to serve as the foundation of modern science, through its lan-guage and results. Some mathematical results were initially developed in order to solve internally gener- ated mathematical problems and only later foundapplication in other disciplines; other mathematicalresults were inspired by the needs of these other dis- ciplines. The two facets of mathematics\u2014tool of sci- ence and subject of inquiry for its own sake\u2014havecome to be interwoven into a complex fabric. Undergraduate Program AdvisersJulie Martinson Brooke Miller C36 Padelford, Box 354350 206-543-6830 The Department of Mathematics cooperates with the departments of Applied Mathematics, ComputerScience and Engineering, and Statistics in an inter- departmental Bachelor of Science degree program in Applied and Computational MathematicalSciences (ACMS). The program builds a broad foun- dation in the mathematical sciences. The Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics pro- vides a solid background in mathematics for stu-dents who wish to obtain a detailed understanding of this complex fabric, either for its use in other math- ematical sciences or for its aesthetic beauty. Onehallmark of mathematics, in contrast to empirical sci-ences, is its reliance on logic and pure reasoning as the foundational tools for the establishment of knowl- edge. The Bachelor of Science program introducesstudents to mathematical reasoning early in their studies, and provides them with a consistent oppor- tunity to observe the role of mathematical reasoningin the development and application of mathematicalresults. The Bachelor of Arts liberal arts degree, in contrast, allows a student to put together a programof mathematical study that is less rigorous. There isalso a Bachelor of Arts option designed specificallyfor students who plan to pursue secondary teachingcareers. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / MATHEMATICS 161 Bachelor of Arts Admission Requirements for Liberal Arts: 1.MATH 124, 125, 126 (or MATH 134, 135, 136), and at least one 200- or 300-level mathematicscourse required for the degree, preferably 307. 2.A minimum grade of 2.0 in each course to be offered as part of the major; a minimum overall GPA of 2.00 for all mathematics courses. 3.Application to the program should be made at the end of the sophomore year. Transfer students must be enrolled at the UW before applying to the major. Admission Requirements for Teacher Preparation:1. MATH 124, 125, 126 (or MATH 134, 135, 136) and at least one 200- or 300-level mathematicscourse required for the degree, preferably 307. 2.A minimum grade of 2.5 in each course to be offered as part of the major; a minimum overall GPA of 2.50 for all mathematics courses. 3.Application to the program should be made at the end of the sophomore year. Transfer students must be enrolled at the UW before applying to the major. Major Requirements Liberal Arts Option: A minimum of 50 approved cred- its in mathematics, including MATH 124, 125, 126 (or134, 135, 136); 307; 205, 308, or 318; 324; and 26 additional credits at the 300 level and above.

It is concerned with the natureand properties of these organisms, their effects on humans and the environment, and how they can be exploited to provide useful products. Undergraduate Program AdviserSarah Mears G315 Health Sciences, Box 357242 206-543-2572advmicro@u.washington.edu The microbiology baccalaureate degree program leads to a Bachelor of Science and offers students an excellent education in the biology of microorgan-isms, namely bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses.Through learning about the biology of these microor- ganisms and viruses, students can more fully under- stand the pivotal position they occupy in establish-ing and maintaining our biosphere, their effects on human and plant life, and how the biological proper- ties of certain microbes are exploited for certain pur-poses. Microorganisms are important in drinking water, wastewater and sewage treatment, production and spoilage of foods, production of antibiotics,bioremediation of toxic compounds, and geneticengineering of organisms having unique character- istics. Insight into strategies used by microorganisms and viruses to cause disease and the mechanismsused by their host to defend themselves are present- ed. The opportunity to learn practical state-of-the-art laboratory techniques and skills, and to participatein a research program, is one of the cornerstones of the program. The program also offers a minor.Graduates have found research positions in biotech- nology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as instate and government positions hiring microbiolo-gists.

Major Admission Requirements All students must audition and qualify at the MUSAP 320 level or better in their principal performanceareas in order to be admitted as music majors and to receive private instruction. Major status in perform- ance areas is accorded when, after admission to theCollege of Arts and Sciences is acknowledged and the required School of Music audition is successfully completed, the student commences applied-musicstudy in a performance medium (e.g., voice) with anapproved faculty member of the School of Music. Subsequent juries are required for additional qualifi- cation for specific performance-program emphasesand for the Bachelor of Music performance pro- grams. In Music History, Music Education, and Composition, additional entrance requirementsapply, and the faculty members of the particular divi-sions determine the status of individuals accepted. All music programs require instruction on an instru- ment. Auditions into freshman-level applied-music instruction (private lessons) are based on theassumption that a student's background includesfour to eight years of private study on an instrument.Completion of a further two years of college-level pri-vate instruction does not automatically guaranteeentry at the junior level of private instruction; place-ment is determined by an audition.Most degree programs in the School of Music requireone to two years of basic piano. Continuation of Major Status Performance studies should begin after audition andacceptance, and continue each subsequent quarterof registration until the minimum program require- ments for applied-music lessons have been met. Applied-music study should continue as long as thestudent is registered and in residence until the final approved recital is given. In order to retain major standing, the student must make and demonstrateconsistent and acceptable progress at the annualrequired jury. Concurrent enrollment or participation in at least one School of Music ensemble is required during each quarter in which a student receives\"MUSAP\" applied-music instruction. Also, basic piano proficiency is required for all majors. Non-key- board majors must enroll in the MUSAP 133-235series until appropriate proficiency is attained. Any departure from the above requirements must have the recommendation of the appropriate divisionalchair and the written consent of the Director of theSchool of Music. Grade Point Requirements In all options, undergraduate music majors arerequired to earn a minimum grade of 2.0 in each course (core and elective) counted toward music major requirements.

Offered: Sp.Political Science 101 Gowen General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/political_sci.html Department Web page: www.polisci.washington.edu Students of political science examine the theory and practice of government and politics. They acquire knowledge of political institutions and processes andlearn to think critically about public policies and their consequences. They learn how to evaluate individ- ual, group, and mass behavior in political settings.Because of their understanding and interest in politi-cal systems, students who major in political science enter such career fields as government service, law, business, journalism, politics, public-policy analysis,and education. The department is organized into four major fields of study: political theory, American government and politics, international relations, and comparative pol-itics. Several subfields\u2014public law, law and public policy, political communication, political culture, and political economy\u2014cut across these main areas andprovide focused specialization for both undergradu-ate and graduate students. The department has long been renowned in comparative and international pol- itics, especially in the study of Asian political phe-nomena, in public law, and in American government and politics. The department has also augmented its faculty strength in public policy, political and feministtheory, and political economy. Undergraduate Program AdviserChristina Kerr215 Smith, Box 353530 206-543-1824 polsadvc@u.washington.edu The department offers a program of study that leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree, as well as a minor. Students begin their concentration by choosing three basic courses that define the discipline and its majorfields of interest, then advance to more specialized study in the field areas. The department provides a Writing Center to help undergraduates become bet- ter writers and the Political Science ComputerClassroom, which enables students and faculty to conduct research and analysis via computers and the Internet. Faculty provide opportunities for indi-vidual, supervised study through research fellow- ships, independent reading/research, and optional senior theses. Students gain practical experiencethrough internships, service learning, and field work for employment after completion of the baccalaure- ate degree. Student Associations: Pi Sigma Alpha (Political Science Honor Society), Phi Alpha Delta (pre-law fra-ternity). Internships: In order to prepare students for career opportunities, the department offers three internship programs that range from part-time, 5-credit assign-ments to full-time, 15-credit programs. Students canelect to work in local agencies (POL S 496), in thestate legislature during winter quarter (POL S 497),and in Washington, D.C. (POL S 498). Students in allmajors may apply for the Washington CenterProgram, which places students in Washington, D.C.,during every academic quarter. Additional informa-tion is available from departmental advisers in 215Gowen.Bachelor of Arts Admission Requirements: 1.Sophomore standing (completion of 45 college credits). 2.

Prerequisite: SPHSC www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/statistics.html Department Web page: www.stat.washington.edu Probability provides the conceptual foundation and mathematical language for the logic of uncertainty and induction. Statistics is concerned with proce-dures for the acquisition, management, exploration,and use of information in order to learn from experi- ence in situations of uncertainty and to make deci- sions under risk. Statistical practice includes designof experiments and of sampling surveys; exploration, summarization, and display of observational data; drawing inferences, and assessing their uncertainty;and building mathematical models for systems with stochastic components. By means of joint faculty appointments and joint research projects, courses, and seminars, the Department of Statistics maintains active academiccontacts with the School of Business Administration; the College of Engineering; the departments of Applied Mathematics, Atmospheric Sciences,Cardiology, Computer Science, Earth and Space Sciences, Economics, Genetics, Mathematics, Psychology, Radiology, Sociology, and Zoology; theNational Research Center for Statistics and theEnvironment; the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management program; the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences; the Applied Physics Laboratory;the Applied Statistics Division of the Boeing Company; Microsoft Research; and Insightful Corporation. The department has an especially closerelationship with the Department of Biostatistics; for example, the two departments are jointly developingnew curricula in statistical genetics.216 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES / STATISTICS Undergraduate Program Adviser Kristin Sprague B309 Padelford, Box 354322 206-543-8296 The Department of Statistics cooperates with the departments of Applied Mathematics, ComputerScience and Engineering, and Mathematics in an interdepartmental Bachelor of Science degree pro- gram in Applied and Computational MathematicalSciences. The program builds a broad foundation in the mathematical sciences and offers the option of specializing in statistics through choice of theStatistics option. Degree requirements can be found in the Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences section. The department also offers its own Bachelor of Science degree program. This program serves theneed of future statisticians in science, industry, busi- ness, and government, as well as providing the nec- essary background and stimulation for graduatestudy. It is also well suited for double-majoring in sta- tistics and, especially, either mathematics or com- puter science. Bachelor of Science Admission Requirements: 1.Completion of 45 credits, including MATH 124, 125, 126; a minimum 8 credits from one of the fol- lowing groups of courses: ASTR 101, 102, 190, 201, 301; CHEM 120, 142, 145, 152, 155; GENET351, 372, 453, 455; PHYS 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 210, 211, 212; and one course from STAT 220, 301, 311, 390, or anapproved substitute. The 8 credits must be fromwithin the same group (e.g., CHEM 142, 152). 2. Minimum grade of 2.0 in each of the above listed prerequisites and a cumulative GPA of 2.80 for these courses. Students wishing to declare a statistics major must apply by contacting the adviser after prerequisites are completed and graded. Suggested Introductory Course Work: CSE 142; CSE 143; MATH 307, 308, 309, 327, 328. Additional cours-es in the sciences and quantitative methods. It is rec- ommended that the student declare the major only after completion of STAT 341. Major Requirements: MATH 124, 125, 126; 307, 308, 309; 327, 328 (the honors sequences in calculus mayreplace the corresponding regular sequences); CSE 142, CSE 143; one course from STAT 220, 301, 311, 390, or approved substitute (311 is recommended);394, 395, followed by 341, 342, 421, 423. Electives (at least 9 credits): one upper-division course in sta- tistics, mathematics, or computer science, plus twoupper-division courses in any discipline (includingbut not limited to statistics, mathematics, and com- puter science), all subject to prior approval by the Statistics adviser. The first elective gives an opportu-nity to define the flavor of the major within these inter- related mathematical fields, and the other two give a chance to broaden the basis of the major into a spe-cial-interest area, chosen from the full range of upper- division courses offered at the University. However, three Department of Statistics courses is the mostcommon choice. Any other choice must fit into anapproved coherent plan. A minimum grade of 2.0 isrequired in all courses used to satisfy major require- ments. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 inrequired statistics courses is necessary.Minor Minor Requirements: MATH 124, 125, 126; STAT 311 or approved substitute; 394, followed by 341, 342, 421 (or 423); one elective from the following choices:395 (strongly recommended), 396, 403, 423, 427,428, CSE 142, MATH 307, 308, AMATH 351, 353. A minimum grade of 2.0 is required in each course used to satisfy minor requirements.

Undergraduate Program Advisers Ellen Chan Leal Dickson Thomas FrengJanet Germeraad 318 Hitchcock, Box 355320 206-543-9120bioladv@u.washington.edu The department offers two degree programs. The Bachelor of Science provides a solid foundation in the biological and physical sciences in preparation for careers in biology and for graduate study. TheBachelor of Arts program has fewer requirements and is a good option for liberal arts students and those preparing for careers in biology not requiringmath or physics. A liberal arts degree in zoology is applicable to many different fields, depending upon student interests.

TheSchool of Business Administration prepares students for professional careers in management and related disciplines in both the private and public sectors. The Business School offers an undergraduate pro- gram leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA)in Business Administration and graduate programs leading to the degrees of Master of Business Administration (MBA), Executive Master of BusinessAdministration (EMBA), Master of Professional Accounting (MPAcc), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Evening BA and MBA programs are alsooffered. Business Administration became an independent unit within the University system in 1917. It has been accredited by the American Assembly of CollegiateSchools of Business (now known as the InternationalAssociation for Management Education) since 1921. Facilities and Services Most Business School classes and activities are infour buildings. Balmer Hall, named for Thomas Balmer, former president of the University Board of Regents, contains classrooms and computer labs.There are four computer labs in Balmer Hall that areavailable to Business School students. Mackenzie Hall, named in memory of Prof. Donald Mackenzie, Chair of the Department of Accounting from 1949 to1955, contains the Dean's Office, the Undergraduate Program Office, the Graduate Program Office, the PhD Program Office, Business AdministrationComputer Services (BACS), Office of Developmentand External Relations, faculty offices, five depart- ment offices, and other business administration pro- gram offices. Nearby Lewis Hall contains theBusiness Career Center and other faculty and admin- istrative offices. A fourth building, on the north side of Balmer, has three distinct components: the Bankof America Executive Education Center (whichincludes the James B. Douglas Executive Forum),the Boeing Auditorium, and the Albert O. and EvelynFoster Business Library. To serve the continuing education needs of middle- and senior-level managers, the School of BusinessAdministration offers a number of certificate pro-grams, either University-initiated or co-sponsoredwith various community and industry organizations.The Management Program, a nine-month, one night per week program, strengthens understanding andskills in all areas of management and provides an opportunity for successful managers to learn from a distinguished faculty and each other. Short coursesand seminars are offered throughout the year in all areas of management, including marketing strategy, finance and accounting for non-financial executives,negotiation skills, and many others.

Itsresearch programs fundamentally contribute to the understanding of basic biologic processes and behavioral, biomedical, and clinical aspects of oralhealth. The School values and seeks diversity in itsstudents, staff, faculty, and patient populations. It fos-ters an environment of mutual respect where objec-tivity, imaginative inquiry, and the free exchange ofideas can flourish to facilitate personal development,professionalism, and a strong sense of self-worth.\"(July 1994)The following departments participate in the curricu- lum for the School's programs: Dental Public Health Sciences is concerned with the social, legal, politi- cal, economic, and psychological aspects of dentalhealth-care delivery as well as the epidemiology of oral diseases and the application of biostatistical methods in studying them. Endodontics offers train- ing in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases andinjuries of the tooth pulp and periradicular tissues. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery trains students in the procedures used for all types of operations in the oralcavity and all phases of dental pain control. Oral Biology encompasses the study of basic biological mechanisms in normal and diseased oral tissues andstructures. Oral Medicine provides training in diag- nostic techniques and nonsurgical treatments of oral disease. Orthodontics provides training in the pre- vention and correction of malocclusion of the teeth.Pediatric Dentistry provides students with a broad understanding of prevention, diagnosis, and treat- ment of most dental needs from infancy through ado-lescence with emphasis on the psychological and educational requirements of the patient and parent. Periodontics offers training relative to the periodon- tium and dental implants, with emphasis placed on diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and maintenance. Prosthodontics provides instruction in the fabrication and maintenance of removable, complete, and par- tial dentures, and dental implants. Restorative Dentistry offers training in the restoration or replace- ment of tooth structure and study of the form and function of the masticatory structures. Undergraduate Program Dental hygiene seeks to understand why some peo- ple get preventable oral diseases and why others donot. Risk factors, such as poverty, ethnicity, and edu- cation, as well as environment, contribute to perpet- uation of these diseases. The dental hygienistobserves and defines dental diseases, assesses potential outcomes of interventions, and manages conditions that compromise oral health. As anapplied discipline, dental hygiene links its theoretical foundation to behavioral and natural sciences. Using evidence-based science, the discipline seeks tofacilitate holistic assessments of individuals andcommunities and to find solutions to oral health prob- lems. Students in the discipline learn to transfer learning from clinical to community contexts as ameans of improving the oral health status among people.

The University offers undergraduate students infor- mation about financial aid assistance including workstudy, student loans, and student employment through the Office of Student Financial Aid, 105 Schmitz Hall, www.washington.edu/students/osfa/. In addition to scholarships available through Mary Gates Center, student who are dental hygienists andmatriculated through the School of Dentistry aca- demic programs may apply for scholarships offered by the Dental Hygiene Education fund and national,state, and local dental hygiene organizations. Students are eligible for international programs and exchanges following completion of their core course requirements. An applicant who is a dental hygienist form an affiliated international institution may be eli- gible for a tuition waiver during one or more quarter of the regular academic year (autumn, winter,spring). Students interested in these opportunitiesneed to contact the program's academic advisor at least six months in advance. Student Organizations Most major health and oral health organizations have student sections and most students are encouragedto join the chapter or section according to interest. The Washington Rural Health Organization, Washington State Public Health Association, Washington State Dental Hygienists' Association, American Dental Education Association, and International Association of Dental Research areamong many from which to select. Internship or Field Experience Opportunities Students in the undergraduate program take off- campus service-learning courses related to theirpath of study. Generally, sites are located in rural and underserved health provider shortage areas of Washington state, but may include regional, nation- al, or international locations. Bachelor of Science The Dental Hygiene Degree Completion Programoffers a Bachelor of Science degree for majors indental hygiene. It emphasizes the health of popula- tions rather than of individuals. Dental hygienists con- duct community assessments; develop networks thatengage community partners; set priorities; obtain baseline measures; set targets; and measure progress toward solutions to community oral healthproblems. Dental hygiene core skills include the abil-ity to search and retrieve information from the Internet; use census, geographic, and demographic data; critically assess scientific literature; analyzeand interpret data; and apply new scientific knowl- edge to solutions of health problems. In addition to the core knowledge set, dental hygienists may selectfrom two paths of study: care of special populationsand oral health promotion. Depending upon area of interest, graduates pursue careers as business man- agers, marketing specialists, clinic administrators,hospital and nursing home dental hygienists, public health planners, program managers, research assis- tants, and teachers of dental hygiene. The UW has no prelicensure program in dental hygiene. However, students desiring entry into the dental hygiene profession may take their first yeargeneral studies courses in chemistry, psychology,sociology, public speaking, English language com-position, mathematics, nutrition, microbiology, andliberal studies at the UW, or other community, techni-cal, or four-year institution. Having successfully com-pleted a prelicensure dental hygiene program andSCHOOL OF DENTISTRY / COURSE DESCRIPTIONS 237 obtained a license to practice dental hygiene, stu- dents are eligible to return to the UW to complete theBachelor of Science degree with a major in dental hygiene. Admission Requirements This bachelor of science degree program is a postli- censure degree completion program. This meansthat the applicant must hold a certificate or diploma in dental hygiene as well as a license to practice clin- ical dental hygiene. Admission for U.S. or Canadian Applicants1.Completion of an associate degree or certifi- cate/diploma in dental hygiene from a program accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Associationand current Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) credential. 2.Possession of a license to practice dental hygiene in at least one state or Canadianprovince and current CardiopulmonaryResuscitation (CPR) credential.

Departmental Application Deadline: Transfer and postbaccalaureate students are admitted into theprogram summer and autumn quarters. The dead- lines are the same for both quarters: April 15 for citi- zens and permanent residents, January 15 for inter-national students. Major Requirements To qualify for the Bachelor of Science degree with a major in dental hygiene, students must completeUniversity requirements as well as dental hygiene major requirements. The University requirements include a 45-credit senior residency, English, writing,and quantitative reasoning proficiencies, and Areas of Knowledge. The dental hygiene major require- ments include a sequence of three dental-hygienecore courses and a minimum of one path. Majors maybe eligible, following the completion of prerequisite courses, to participate in study-abroad programs that focus on health care delivery, oral health promo-tion or dental disease prevention. The University and its affiliated sites provide the settings for fieldwork, service, and research activities, and interdisciplinarylearning experiences. Completion of the required major and University requirements takes one to two years. Students plan- ning to graduate in one year must have a faculty- approved plan of study within the first quarter ofenrollment. Students planning a two-year program must have a faculty-approved plan of study within the first two quarters of enrollment. All students mustmeet with a program adviser yearly and are encour-aged to meet with a program adviser quarterly. Thecompletion of courses that fulfill graduation require-ments is the responsibility of the student. Core Requirement Students complete a year-long core requirementfounded on significant oral health problems andprobable solutions within the context of specificcommunities. Behavioral change, community devel-opment, health education models, and scientific lit-erature provide a theoretical foundation for study in the core courses. The core curriculum focuses on real problems in real places. Using a people-places- problems approach, students use Internet and library resources to research, analyze, discuss, and make evidence-based decisions relevant to oral health pro-motion and dental disease prevention. Further, theyexplore core values, ethics, laws, and issues related to care access, health promotion/disease prevention approaches, and healthcare delivery models.Included are field activities linked to education, gov- ernment, business, and health resources. Additionally, dental hygiene majors complete require-ments in at least one path and may take electives of their choice to complete the senior residency require- ment. All students must complete the three corecourses (3 credits each, total 9) in the prescribedorder. These courses are: D HYG 465, D HYG 492, and D HYG 493 or approved substitutes. Path Requirement Students must select at least one of two pathways to fulfill the path requirement. The options are: Dental Hygiene Care. This path is for dental hygien- ists who desire to work as clinicians in hospitals, clin- ics, long-term care facilities or other healthcare serv- ices that require advanced clinical and managementskills. Students take courses in interdisciplinary health sciences, along with courses that focus on dental hygiene care and management of personswith physical, mental, developmental, and complex medical disabilities. Required courses in oral medi- cine augment this path. Major requirements includea minimum of 11or 12 credits beyond the core: 10credits in ORALM 460, care of special clients. Oral Health Promotion. This path is for dental hygien- ists who desire to work in multicultural and multidis- ciplinary settings at the local, state, national, or inter-national levels and who require skills beyond clinical expertise. Students learn about the framework within which societies organize and manage their health-care services and learn to link health with the envi- ronment, people's beliefs, ways of life, and kinship. They learn about differences between Western,Eastern and Shamanistic philosophies of health as prerequisites to developing educational strategies for oral health promotion and dental disease preven-tion. As students build skills essential for working withhealth agencies, they participate in community health projects as educators, advocates, or researchers. Activities focus on the health of children and families in rural and remote areas of Washington State. Major requirements for this path include a min- imum of 12 credits beyond the core, to include inter-disciplinary health sciences courses, 3 in healthcaredelivery systems, 3 in health promotion strategies or approved substitute, and a minimum of 4 credits in at least 2 sections of D HYG 404 or approved substi-tutes. Oral Health Administration Elective. Dental hygien- ists who desire to learn about entrepreneurships, create a business, differentiate between variouskinds of organizations, and learn the differencesbetween publicly held profit-seeking corporations to not-for-profit organizations can take one of two administration and management courses, ADMIN410 or 510. Students complete a market feasibility analysis and develop a marketing plan. They devel- op corporate mission, vision, and value statements,evaluate a company's financial position, apply basicaccounting principles, determine appropriate legalstructure for new venture, conduct a strategic busi-ness analysis, and acquire understanding of basicbusiness law through an intensive integrative admin-istration and management course. Biological and Behavioral Sciences Elective. Dental hygienists who desire preparation for graduate orprofessional school or who need to make a career change stemming from a clinical practice-related medical disability may focus their elective courses inthis area. Students who seek entry into a graduate program may require more than the 45-credit resi- dency to complete the Bachelor of Science degree.They ought to consider either a double major or amajor and a minor. Academic Standards The School of Dentistry requires that a minimumnumerical grade of 2.5 be earned in dental hygienecourses which are to be counted toward satisfaction of graduation requirements with a dental hygiene major. Graduation with a dental hygiene major alsorequires a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all work done in residence at the University. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.00 in any quar-ter will be placed on academic probation. The statusof academic probation shall be removed when the cumulative GPA is 2.00 or above. While on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 GPA for eachsucceeding quarter's work until the cumulative GPA is raised to 2.00.

LidstromChen-Ching General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/College_Engineering.html College Web page: www.engr.washington.edu Engineering is an increasingly critical societal enter- prise. More than ever before, the engineer is chal- lenged both to design products whose value is high by social and economic measures and to provide forefficient manufacture of such products within theconstraints of environmental protection and dimin- ishing raw-material resources. Requirements imposed on the transportation system and other ele-ments of society's physical infrastructure pose anal- ogous challenges. At the same time, reductions in computer costs and increases in sophistication aredramatically influencing both the products and processes designed by the engineer and the actual practice of engineering. The primary goal of the College of Engineering edu- cational programs is to prepare students for a pro- fessional career in engineering by providing the tech- nical foundation required for success in industry,government, or academia. Other goals of the Collegeare to instill within its students the highest ethical standards, the capability for lifelong learning, and a curiosity about the world. Excellence in undergradu-ate and graduate academic programs remains the College's highest priority. For undergraduates, the College of Engineering offers a flexible curriculum that not only accommo-dates varied student needs, both in established departmental programs and interdisciplinary stud- ies, but also culminates in a major and meaningfuldesign experience. (See InterdisciplinaryEngineering Studies Program for interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate programs.) The College offers active educational and research programs, both departmental and interdisciplinary,at the graduate levels. (See Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program for interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate programs.) The College of Engineering has been a major unit of the University since 1899. The first engineeringdegrees were authorized in mining engineering and metallurgical engineering in 1898. Degrees were added for civil engineering (1901), electrical engi-neering (1902), mechanical engineering (1906), chemical engineering (1907), ceramic engineering (1919), aeronautical engineering (1929), bioengi-neering (1983), industrial engineering (1986), andcomputer engineering (1987). A degree program intechnical communication was implemented in 1991.In 1999, 1,566 upper-division undergraduate majorsand 1,407 graduate students were enrolled in engi-neering programs taught by a faculty of 195 mem-bers.College Facilities Teaching and research activities of the College are conducted in thirteen major campus buildings (and portions of others), which contain the College'soffices, classrooms, and research and teaching lab- oratories. The Engineering Library, a branch of the University Libraries, provides outstanding collectionsof books, periodicals, technical reports, and patents of interest to engineers. Computers and terminals are available in all departments and at the University's Academic Computer Center. Student Organizations and Activities All of the major professional engineering societies have student chapters on campus, and all engineer-ing students are encouraged to join the chapter that represents his or her field of interest. The College also has student chapters of the Society of WomenEngineers, American Indian Science and Engineering Society, National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic ProfessionalEngineers. The Pre-Engineering Student Association(PESA) is the major College-wide organization for all students enrolled in a pre-engineering course of study but not yet admitted to a department. TheEngineering Student Council, comprising student representatives from all departments and profession- al societies, is the major College-wide student organ-ization and participates actively in College affairs. Honor societies open to engineering students are Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi. Students serve with faculty members on engineering policy committees which make recommendations concerning instructor evaluation, curriculum revi- sions, advising, grading systems, and other mattersof interest to students and faculty. Undergraduate Program Engineering Adviser301 Loew, Box 352180206-543-1770 engradv@engr.washington.edu www.engr.washington.edu/advising/ The College of Engineering provides curricula that offer a variety of educational experiences to its stu- dents. The curricula also facilitate transfer from com- munity colleges and from other four-year collegesand universities. Engineering Advising Center 301 Loew Students are highly encouraged to contact the Engineering Advising Center for program, course, orcareer information and discussion. The center assistsany student interested in planning the initial portion of an engineering degree program, and distributes information about prerequisites for application foradmission to all the departments in the College. A student who is interested in engineering is recom- mended to identify engineering as the intendedmajor while still in the College of Arts and Sciencesand to seek advice in the center. Financial Aid The College offers financial assistance to undergrad-uates through industrial scholarships and loan funds.Scholarship information is available at the College ofEngineering Advising Center (356 Loew), and at theOffice of Student Financial Aid, 105 Schmitz. Mostscholarships are given after a year or more in resi-dence by the student.Honors Program 317 Loew The College of Engineering Honors Program offers students of outstanding performance and achieve-ment a course of study designed to provide intellec- tual challenge in a stimulating learning atmosphere which draws on the resources of a large, diversifieduniversity. Students entering the Honors Program become candidates for the degree \"With College Honors\" or \"With Distinction.\" The College Honors Degree Students who complete this program receive adegree \"With College Honors.\" The College honors degree requires that students participate in the University Honors Program while taking engineering prerequisites in the College of Arts and Sciences. When these students are admit-ted to engineering departments, they may be nomi- nated to enroll in the Engineering Honors Program. Completion of the College Honors degree involvesboth an honors general-education component andadvanced honors work completed after students have been admitted to the College of Engineering. Admission Requirements: Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.30, minimum departmental GPA, and participa-tion in the University Honors Program as a pre-engi- neer. Graduation Requirements: The College honors cur- riculum consists of two parts: a general-educationcomponent and a component in the student's major department. The general-education component is completed while the student is in the College of Artsand Sciences prior to application to the College of Engineering. Students select three sequences, each three quarters long, from honors A&S courses, theNatural World, and Mathematics (selecting at leastone from each). The second component begins when a student is admitted to an engineering department. Students then select a total of 9 credits of College honorscourses with a minimum of 3 credits of departmental 499H Special Projects (or ENGR 499H). The addi- tional honors credits can be fulfilled with either spe-cial projects or ad hoc courses. The Departmental Honors Degree Students who complete this program receive adegree \"With Distinction.\" Admission Requirements: Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.30, minimum departmental GPA (varies fromdepartment to department). Graduation Requirements: Students are nominated for the Departmental Honors Program when they have been in their department for a minimum of onequarter. Students select a total of 9 credits of college honors courses with a minimum of 3 credits of departmental 499H Special Projects (or ENGR499H). The additional honors credits can be fulfilled with either special projects or ad hoc courses. At present, departmental honors degrees are offered in the following degree programs: Aeronautics andAstronautics, Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering,Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering, and Technical Com-munication.245 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING / UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM International Study Given the increased likelihood that engineering stu- dents will have overseas work experiences or will do business with international clients and competitors,the College encourages students to study foreign languages in addition to their engineering course work and to take advantage of opportunities for studyat foreign universities either at the undergraduate or graduate level. The College has active exchange agreements with approximately thirty universities in twenty countries. Foreign-language courses at the third-quarter level or above (e.g., GERMAN 103) maybe applied toward VLPA distribution. Students may contact the Office of Organizational Infrastructure, 356 Loew, for information about opportunities forinternational study. Engineering students can also participate in the Global Engineering Education Program (through the Women in Science andEngineering Program) for opportunities to study abroad. Recommended High School Preparation Substantial high school preparation in mathematics, physical science, and communication is essential forentrance to engineering studies. Required and rec- ommended courses may be determined from the Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew). Admission Students who indicate an interest in engineering ontheir University admission application are assignedpre-engineering status. Students without pre-engi- neering status who wish to pursue an engineering degree may have their coding changed to pre-engi-neering upon request at the College of Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew) or the Undergraduate Advising Center (171 Mary Gates Hall). As a pre-engineering major, a student will take courses inmathematics, chemistry, physics, English composi- tion, and all other prerequisite courses for admission to the desired engineering departmental program. Inaddition, courses in the Visual, Literary, and Performing Arts and Individuals and Societies will be taken. Admission requirements vary for departments or pro- grams within the College of Engineering. Some departments or programs offer early admission, while others do not. For specific, up-to-date informationregarding the admission requirements for a depart- ment or program, the applicant should contact the College of Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew) or the undergraduate adviser for the specific depart-ment or program of interest. In addition, all depart- ments and programs within the College provide up- to-date course and admission information on theWorld Wide Web. For general upper-division admission, students must apply to the engineering department or program after completion of the prerequisite courses for the pro-gram, with at least 64 credits applicable to thedegree program. In general, the prerequisite cours- es include one year of calculus, differential equa- tions, one or two quarters of inorganic chemistry, twoto three quarters of physics, English composition, and several engineering fundamentals. The Engineering Advising Center or the individual depart-ment or program may be consulted for a listing ofspecific entrance requirements. Types of Programs The College offers three basic programs leading to Bachelor of Science degrees: Departmental Major: This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in a designated field ofengineering (e.g., Bachelor of Science in CivilEngineering). It is designed for students who intendto practice as professional engineers in a standardbranch of engineering or who plan to undertakegraduate study in that field. The curricula for these degrees are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the princi-pal engineering accrediting agency in the United States. Accreditation requirements stipulate certain course-distribution requirements for the undergradu-ate degree. A description of how each of the accred-ited baccalaureate programs meets the ABET requirements is available from the department office and from the College office. Accredited four-year cur-ricula leading to baccalaureate degrees are offered in aeronautics and astronautics, and in ceramic, chemical, civil, computer, electrical, industrial,mechanical, and metallurgical engineering. Application to a department or program at the upper- division level is made at the time that lower-division requirements are satisfied. Currently, enrollment lim- its imposed by faculty size and available laborato-ry/classroom space are such that entry into a specif- ic department or program may be competitive. In general, a student applicant must demonstratescholastic aptitude, as evidenced by the attainment of grades whose average is a minimum of 2.50 or above (depending upon the program) in mathemat-ics, the Natural World, English composition, and other courses. The student is urged to plan ahead by learning the intended department or programrequirements and particularly noting which require- ments must be fulfilled by the time the application is made. Nondepartmental Professional Program: This pro- gram leads to a Bachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree and is designed for students who have well- defined, special educational objectives that depart- mental programs do not satisfy. Graduates can prac-tice as professional engineers in newly developing fields, or they may embark on graduate study in these or allied fields (see InterdisciplinaryEngineering Studies Program). Nonprofessional Program: Leading to a Bachelor of Science degree, this program is intended for stu- dents who wish to have significant exposure to sci-ence and engineering courses, but do not plan toengage in professional engineering practice (see Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program). Graduation Requirements To graduate, students must meet or exceed the requirements of the University, the College, and their particular program or department. College require- ments are listed in this section, and program or departmental requirements are given in the specificsection that describes that program or department. All departments of the College have continuation policies that specify a minimum rate of progress as well as minimum academic-performance levels.These policies may be more restrictive than thosegenerally applied by the University and may change with time. Information on current policy is available at the departmental offices. Selecting courses that fulfill graduation requirements is the responsibility of each student. Students are urged to check carefully the course and credit requirements of the program in which they are enrolled. The College requires a minimum number of credits within certain areas of study and some specificcourses within certain areas. All programs requirethe following:General Education Requirements: 85 Credits Areas of Knowledge: 49 Credits Visual, Literary, and Performing Arts and Individuals and Societies: 24 credits minimum. Some programs within the College require 30 credits. Visual, Literary, and Performing Arts (VLPA) includes courses in liter-ature, art, music, and drama which stress the essen- tial qualities of individual forms of expression. First- and second-quarter language courses may not becounted toward the VLPA requirement. Individualsand Societies includes courses in history, econom- ics, psychology, and sociology which stress the social nature of mankind, and the development andanalysis of societies and social institutions. Courses that count toward these requirements are identified as VLPA or I&S in the General Catalog and in the quarterly Time Schedule. A minimum of 10 credits is required in each area. One in-depth sequence con- sisting of two or more related courses is required aspart of the VLPA/I&S requirement. Natural World: 20-25 credits. Most departments with- in the College require chemistry (10 credits): CHEM 142, 152 (some departments do not require CHEM152); and physics (15 credits): PHYS 121, 122, 123.Please consult an adviser in the Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew) or the departmental adviser. Mathematics: 24 Credits Specifically required are MATH 124, 125, 126, 307,and 308. The remaining 3 credits are specified or recommended by the department or program. Written and Oral Communication: 12 Credits One 5-credit English composition course from the approved University list. T C 231, Introduction to Technical Writing (3 credits), and T C 333, Advanced Technical Writing and Oral Presentations (4 credits, or department-approved alternative).

Special Programs Engineering Co-op Program (three- to six-month internships) Director, Lorena McLaren 353 Loew, Box 352180coop@engr.washington.edu www.engr.washington.edu/~coopweb/ The Co-op Program provides an opportunity for pre- engineering students and departmental students to combine practical, full-time, on-the-job engineeringexperience with full-time academic study. Students typically take a break from their studies for six months to work full-time and return to full-time academic sta-tus upon completion of the co-op assignment. Inaddition, students receive academic credit for the co-op experience. Advantages to participation include assistance in deciding which field of engi-neering to follow, additional income to help defraycollege expenses, relevance and motivation for studybased on real engineering work, and work experi-ence and employment contacts that may result inregular employment after graduation. Information may be obtained from the Co-op Program Office, College of Engineering, Box 352180.246 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING / INTERDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING STUDIES PROGRAM Educational Outreach Engineering Professional Programs: www.engr.washington.edu/~uw-epp/ Education at a Distance for Growth and Excellence: www.engr.washington.edu/edge/ Fulfilling a commitment to lifelong learning, the College of Engineering offers courses, workshops, and conferences to respond to the professional development needs of practicing engineers andrelated technical professionals worldwide.

Special Facilities Office of Engineering Research Coordinator, Mary Heusner372 Loew, Box 352180 www.engr.washington.edu/research/ The Office of Engineering Research promotes, stim- ulates, and coordinates research in all fields of engi-neering. Its primary role is to coordinate interdiscipli- nary research programs and national research initia- tives. The Office of Research also reviews grant andcontract proposals, tracks awards, and provides information on funding opportunities. This office allo- cates limited matching funds to College units toincrease the quality of research in the College of Engineering. Interdisciplinary Engineering StudiesProgram 356 Loew The College of Engineering directly administers non- departmental undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Some engineering fundamentals and writ- ing courses required for admission to the depart-ments are managed by specific engineering depart-ments. Undergraduate Programs 356 Loew The Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies (IES) Program is intended for students whose desired course of study does not fall within one of the tradi- tional engineering departments. An interdisciplinaryprogram combines course work from at least oneengineering department as well as other depart- ment(s) on campus (Engineering or other) to allow students to create a program of study not availablethrough the existing undergraduate degree pro-grams. Students wishing to study an undergraduateprogram with emphasis in bioengineering also applythrough this degree program. Although course workmay involve departments outside the College ofEngineering, the major thrust must be in engineering.The IES Program offers a nonprofessional degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science (B.S.)and a professional degree program for the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.). Due to the uniqueness of each interdisciplinary stu- dent's program of studies, the B.S. and B.S.E.degrees are not accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The experience requirement to obtain a professionalengineering license is two years longer for a B.S.E.graduate, except in surveying, than for a graduate of an accredited program. A B.S. graduate is not eligi- ble for a professional engineering license. Interdisciplinary students develop personal pro- grams of study approved by a faculty adviser with similar interests. Programs are reviewed and approved by the Interdisciplinary Committee, whichoversees all undergraduate interdisciplinary-study programs. Contact the Office of Organizational Infrastructure, 206-543-8590, for information onestablished procedures and applications for entryinto the B.S.E. and B.S. programs. Entrance require- ments and the continuation policy for participation in these programs are consistent with those of otherdepartments in the College. Bachelor of Science in Engineering Admission to this program (usually after completion of 90 credits) is competitive with a minimum GPA of2.80 in technical courses required for entry. A mini- mum of 75 credits must be completed after entering the program before a B.S.E. degree is awarded.Detailed information regarding the B.S.E. degree can be obtained from an adviser in the College of Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew). Bachelor of Science The nonprofessional Bachelor of Science degreeprovides greater flexibility than does the Bachelor ofScience in Engineering degree. It can be an excel- lent base for subsequent professional studies in law, medicine, or business. It may also be the primaryeducational objective in such fields as technical writ- ing, engineering sales, or environmental studies. Detailed requirements are available from the adviserin the Engineering Advising Center (356 Loew). Course Descriptions See page 50 for an explanation of course numbers,symbols, and abbreviations.

Chemical Engineering 105 Benson General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Chemical_Eng.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/chemeng/ Chemical engineering is concerned with processes for transforming raw materials into energy and into agreat variety of consumer products, such as gaso-line, electronic materials, pulp and paper, fertilizers,rubber, polymers and composites, and pharmaceuti-cals. Chemical engineers work on research anddevelopment of these materials and on the process-es for making them, as well as on the design andoperation of chemical plants and equipment bywhich production is achieved. This must be donewith efficiency, economy, and concern for society and the environment. Some chemical engineers areemployed by government agencies. Few other pro- fessions can match the diversity of job opportunities available to graduates in chemical engineering. Chemical engineers employ the skills of mathemat- ics, physics, chemistry, and, increasingly, biology, along with oral and written communication skills. The chemical engineer develops competence in the use of fundamental tools for engineering analysis and design: thermodynamics, chemical kinetics andreactor design, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, process control, and economics. At the University, students study intensively in these fieldsand work in teams, often to solve real-life problems, to acquire knowledge and skills applicable in a vari- ety of specialized fields and industries. Flexibility, in fact, is the hallmark of the chemical engineer. Undergraduate Program AdviserDevota Madrano 105 Benson, Box 351750 206-543-2252 advising@cheme.washington.edu The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering degree offered by the department is an accredited, professional program. Its completion should enablethe graduate either to find employment in industry or to continue on to graduate school. Student Associations: The undergraduates in the department run a dynamic chapter of the AmericanInstitute of Chemical Engineers. Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering Advising All students, including freshmen and sophomores, who are considering chemical engineering as amajor are encouraged to be advised in the depart- ment. Admission Requirements Admission to the department is competitive, and completion of the requirements does not guaranteeadmission. A diverse student body adds an important element to the education of all students in the program. All students who meet the minimum admission require-ments will be considered for admission. Students with special circumstances (i.e., economically or educationally disadvantaged, or other circum-stances) are encouraged to make these known intheir application essay. All applicants have the right to petition and appeal the decision of the department. Requirements are subject to change. Students should consult an adviser about current require-ments. Application Deadlines: July 1 for autumn quarter. Application is made by filling out an application form available in the department office. 1. Early Admission Group (EAG): a. Open to students just completing their fresh- man year at the UW. b. Completion of the following courses prior to application: MATH 124, 125, 126; CHEM 142,152, 162; PHYS 121; and 5 credits of Englishcomposition.250 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING / CHEMICAL ENGINEERING c.

Completion of the following courses: MATH 124, 125, 126, 307 (18 credits); CHEM 142,152, 162, 223 or 237 (20); PHYS 121, 122, 123 (15), CSE 142, CHEM E 260 (8); and one 5-credit English composition course. In addi-tion, it is strongly recommended that studentscomplete CHEM 224 or 238. b. Students with a GPA lower than 2.50 for these specified courses or an overall GPA lower than 2.50 for all courses applicable to theB.S.Ch.E. degree seldom succeed in the department. Historically, a minimum GPA of 2.80 in these categories is required foradmission to and success in the department. c. Factors included in the admissions decision include the course record as indicated above and qualitative considerations such as diffi-culty of completed courses, frequency ofincomplete or withdrawal grades, number of repeated courses, applicable work experi- ence and maturity of attitude, record of hon-ors, a demonstrated ability to take at least 12 credits per quarter, and special circum- stances disclosed by the applicant. Entrance to Chemical Engineering Courses Entrance into most chemical engineering courses is ordinarily limited to majors in chemical engineering,paper science, and the B.S.E. program. Other stu- dents who wish to take departmental courses must meet the prerequisites and obtain instructor approval(except for CHEM E 485 and 486, which are open to majors only). Graduation Requirements Information on degree requirements is available in detail from the department office or at its Web site(depts.washington.edu/chemeng/). In brief, the required 180 credits include the College of Engineering general-education requirements asspecified above, 10 credits of engineering electives, 43 credits of chemical engineering, and 5 credits of electives. Many engineers design new equipmentand processes or design modifications to them. Thedesign experience is integrated throughout the cur- riculum, with open-ended problems (sometimes involving economic constraints) in several courses:design of heat exchangers (CHEM E 340) and distil- lation towers (CHEM E 435), design of piping and pumping systems (CHEM E 330), design of chemi-cal reactors (CHEM E 465). The design experienceculminates in two capstone design courses (CHEM E 485 and 486 or 497) which involve the design of an integrated chemical system. An option-al 9-credit specialty area allows each student to develop special competence in a selected subject by taking a minimum of three courses in that area.Engineering and free electives may be used for thispurpose. The areas are biotechnology; polymers, composites, colloids, and interfaces; computers applied to electronic materi-als; environmental engineering; and nuclear engi- neering. A minimum GPA of 2.00 in chemical engi- neering courses, based on the first time each courseis taken, is required for graduation. Continuation Policy The department policy on continuation is consistentwith the continuation policy of the College.

Civil and EnvironmentalEngineering 201 More General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Civil_Engineering.html Department Web page: www.ce.washington.edu Civil and environmental engineering is a profession which interfaces closely with society in the planning,design, construction, and management of facilities serving the needs of people. These activities include all transportation modes: highways, aerospace,rivers, and harbors; water resources, hydraulics, and coastal engineering; structures, mechanics, and geotechnical engineering; surveying, mapping, andphotogrammetry; urban planning and development; water supply, wastewater treatment, and water-quali- ty management; solid- and hazardous-waste dispos-al; and quality control and management of the airresources. A civil engineer may specialize in one or several of these activities and may further specialize in a par- ticular function, such as design or management. Thework frequently provides close associations with the legal profession, urban and regional planners, econ- omists, public officials, biologists, chemists, financialconsultants, architects, and system analysts. Education and practice require a consideration not only of the technological-science aspects of a par-ticular problem but also of its relationship to social,economic, political, and environmental constraints. To accommodate these wide interests, the depart- ment is organized into six academic areas: construc- engineering; and water resources, hydrology, and hydraulic systems.Undergraduate Program Adviser Lynn Girardeau 121 More, Box 352700 206-685-2611 ceadvice@u.washington.edu The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a program of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree. The department's objectives are to provide a quality, broad-based education with breadth and depth inmajor areas of civil and environmental engineering; to prepare students for entry into professional-engi- neering practice and lifelong learning; to preparewell-qualified students for graduate studies in spe- cialty fields within civil and environmental engineer- ing, leading to careers in professional practice,research, or academics; and to maintain a tradition of excellence in classroom teaching, encourage innovation, and use evaluation by students and fac- ulty to improve continually. The department meetsthese objectives by providing a curriculum that includes introduction to major areas of civil and envi- ronmental engineering, development of engineering analysis in each area (drawing on mathematics and basic sciences), and utilization of modern method- ologies, theories, and tools. The curriculum integrates engineering design throughout, incorporating key elements of the design process in a wide range of courses. Each student is required to take a design seminar and at least one major, comprehensive design course in the senioryear, building on fundamentals from mathematics, sciences, major areas of civil and environmental engineering, and communication skills. Additionally,students may take independent-study or research courses, working one-on-one with faculty and advanced graduate students. Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Admission Requirements: 1. Admission to the department is usually at the jun- ior level. 2. Enrollment in the department is limited; students who desire admission must formally apply to, and be accepted by, the departmental admissions committee. 3.The primary admission criterion is degree of qualification for probable success in the engi- neering degree program as evidenced by aca- demic performance, work experience, and otherfactors. 4.Completion of the following courses with a mini- mum grade of 2.0 in each course and a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50: MATH 124, 125, 126,308; CHEM 220; M E 230; and 5 credits of English composition. 5.

Computer Science and Engineering 114 Sieg General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Computer_Sci_Eng.html Department Web page: www.cs.washington.edu Computer science is the study of information and algorithms within the context of real and abstract computing devices. Computer scientists are interest- ed in such topics as the representation and storageof information; algorithms to access, display, edit, and transform information; programming languages to express algorithms; and hardware and softwareprocessors to execute algorithms. These concerns lead to practical developments in computer systems software, such as operating systems and compilers;in application areas, such as artificial intelligence,computer graphics, and computational biology; and also lead to theoretical investigations of computers, algorithms, and data. Computer engineering is a closely related field that is concerned with the design and practical applica- tion of computer hardware and software systems to the solution of technological, economic, and societalproblems. The computer engineer analyzes a prob- lem and selects from a variety of tools and technolo- gies those most appropriate for its solution. A com-puter engineer can expect to be involved in hard- ware design, software creation, and systems integra- tion. The program provides an in-depth education incomputer engineering while retaining strong founda-tions in traditional electrical engineering and com- puter science. The computer engineering program involves digital hardware, software, and architecture.Mathematics, engineering design, laboratory work, and communication-skills development are empha- sized. A capstone design course is used to apply theknowledge and skills collected during the programto a major team project that must be completed dur- ing the senior year. The objective of undergraduate education in computer engineering is to developbroadly educated and competent graduates for pro- fessional careers or graduate studies. Especially important is a foundation that will endure as technol-ogy advances and changes. Instructional and Special Research Facilities The Computer Science laboratories provide exten- sive, efficient, and powerful state-of-the-art facilitiesfor undergraduate, graduate, and faculty instructionand research. The equipment base is upgraded fre-quently; for an up-to-date description please see thedescriptions in the online undergraduate and gradu-ate brochures, which can be accessed through thedepartment's Web page. The same is true for thedepartment's software base, where there are several modern operating systems including Windows NT,Unix, Solaris, and Linux, as well as extensive collec- tions of software applications and development tools for each. Students have access to these resourcesin several laboratories in Sieg Hall and through direct modem access administered by the University. All the department's workstations provide users with fullInternet access and almost all the department'scourses make extensive use of the World Wide Web. In addition to general computing laboratories, the department also supports specialized laboratoriesfor computer graphics, hardware, and embedded system design that also support more-advanced computing platforms and software. Undergraduate Programs A Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineeringdegree is offered by the Department of ComputerScience and Engineering, and is administered through the College of Engineering. The department also offers a Bachelor of Science degree in comput-er science administered through the College of Arts and Sciences. Information concerning the B.S. degree in computer science can be found under theComputer Science program description. The depart-ment's Web page (www.cs.washington.edu) should be consulted for the most current information. The departmental core requirements of the two undergraduate majors are identical. The computerengineering major may be more appropriate for stu- dents who are interested in creating and building systems that include both hardware and softwarecomponents and that must be engineered to meet a variety of cost and performance constraints. The pro- gram includes a general foundation in engineeringfundamentals to enable interdisciplinary work withother departments in the College of Engineering and the University as a whole. The computer science major may be more appropri- ate for students who want to earn a double major withanother College of Arts and Sciences program (for example, mathematics or economics), who want the additional flexibility of the computer science require-ments (the computer engineering major has more required courses and fewer electives), or who may be more interested in the theory, design, and imple-mentation of software systems and applications (for example, the techniques of modern compilers or the algorithms behind computer graphics and anima-tion).

Electrical Engineering 253 Electrical Engineering General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Electrical_Eng.html Department Web page: www.ee.washington.edu Electrical engineering is concerned with the under- standing and utilization of electricity and with provid- ing society useful, efficient, and economic products and services. Electrical engineering is an amazinglybroad-based and rapidly growing discipline. It encompasses everything from batteries and power supplies to crystal fabrication, autonomous robots,and devices that can recognize human speech. Electrical engineers design, produce, study, and operate all manner of devices and systems that useelectric and electromagnetic energy. Electrical engi-neers work on systems at the macro scale of electric power grids and at the micro scale of nanotech- nology. Contemporary society is in the midst of an informa- tion revolution, created in large part from the fruits of electrical engineering. Rapid improvements in com- munication technologies, computer visualization,and information access continue to have a signifi- cant impact on manufacturing, medicine, transporta- tion, and environmental monitoring. Dramaticadvances in personal communication services, digi-tal imaging, and network hardware and software are changing the texture of everyday life for an increas- ing portion of the world's population. Graduates with a degree in electrical engineering find employment in industries such as aerospace, communications, computer manufacturing, power distribution, consumer electronics, and biomedicalengineering. Positions can be found focusing on theresearch, design, and testing of new products; in technical sales and marketing; business consulting; and even growing areas such as intellectual proper-ty. Students who pursue graduate studies are quite successful in highly competitive national and inter- national programs.

Industrial Engineering G-7 Mechanical Engineering Building General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Industrial_Eng.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/ie/ The formal definition of industrial engineering, as adopted by the Institute of Industrial Engineers, is asfollows: industrial engineering is concerned with thedesign, improvement, and installation of integratedsystems of people, materials, information, equip-ment, and energy. It draws upon specialized knowl-edge and skill in the mathematical, physical, andsocial sciences together with principles and meth- ods of engineering analysis and design to specify,predict, and evaluate the results obtained from such systems. Industrial engineering is set apart from other engi- neering disciplines by its broader scope. Industrialengineers are, by definition, specialists in designing and operating systems that make optimal use of resources when labor, materials, capital, and tech- nology are constrained. They deal with people aswell as things, looking at the \"big picture\" of what makes society perform best: the right combination of human resources, natural resources, and man-madestructures and equipment. Bridging the gap between management and operations, they deal with and motivate people as well as determine what toolsshould be used and how they should be used. Industrial engineers are the \"productivity people\" who must provide leadership and integrate technolo- gy. They include the human factor in finding work-able, effective solutions to production problems whileretaining high standards of quality. Demand for industrial engineers has grown dramatically over the past two decades for one chief reason: the need fororganizations to raise their levels of productivity through thoughtful, systematic applications. The profit-making organization must have high produc-tivity in order to compete in the domestic and world market place. The nonprofit organization must have high productivity in order to sustain its position as auseful service unit.

Basic principles of chemistry andphysics are applied to provide an understanding of the structure of materials and the manner in which the structure determines the properties. Scientificprocessing methods are then applied to yield thenecessary properties, which then can be integratedwith, and designed to accommodate, the needs ofmodern technology. Advances in materials enables technological progress in many fields. Historically, this connectionbetween materials and technology has been so inti-mate that major periods in civilization have beennamed after the dominant material used in that era(e.g. Bronze Age, Iron Age). In the past few decades, at the core of the progress in such diverse fields astransportation, communication, electronics, energy and environment are significant advances in materi- als. Materials science and engineering is a verybroad and growing discipline. The Materials Science and Engineering program at the University of Washington has recently experi- enced rapid expansion into new research areas.These include polymers, hybrids, biomaterials, nano-materials, photonic and magnetic materials. Potential applications of nanomaterials, biomaterials, and pho- tonic materials exist in modern industry and cutting-edge technologies. These research areas comple- ment existing strength in ceramics, metals, electron- ic materials and composites. The students in the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Washington are offered both broad core and in- depth courses. The broad core provides the neededbackground and understanding of all types of engi-neering materials, including metals, ceramics, poly- mers, electronic materials, and composites. The advanced required and elective courses offer theopportunity for in-depth study in selected areas. The curriculum provides an opportunity to use basic knowledge in science and engineering fundamen-tals to synthesize and design materials for engineer- ing applications. The undergraduate curriculum emphasizes hands on experience, oral and writtencommunication, team-work and encourages partici- pation in research. Graduates with a degree in mate- rials science and engineering find employment in abroad range of industries including aerospace, bio-medical, electronic manufacturing, materials pro- cessing and transportation. Students are also well prepared for graduate studies at leading national andinternational programs. The faculty of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering recognizes that a strong graduate program is an essential component of a balancededucational effort in materials. The department's graduate programs in materials science and engi- neering are designed to build on and enhance theeducational experience imparted in its undergradu-ate programs. Therefore, a related department goal is to provide coordination and balance between the undergraduate and graduate degree programs, andto ensure that each program is allocated the resources necessary to meet its goals.

Powerutilization (and power generation) is often used to describe the focus of mechanical engineering. Within this focus are such diverse topics as thermodynam-ics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, machine design,mechanics of materials, manufacturing, stress analy- sis, system dynamics, numerical modeling, vibra- tions, turbomachinery, combustion, heating, ventilat-ing and air conditioning. Degrees in mechanical engineering open doors to careers not only in the engineering profession but also in business, law,medicine, finance, and other non technical profes-sions. Undergraduate (B.S.M.E.) and graduate (M.S.M.E. and Ph.D.) degree programs are offered by thedepartment. Courses are presented in both tradition-al class room lecture and laboratory settings as wellas via distance learning through either televisedinstruction or web cast methods. Interest groupswithin the faculty provide instruction in four areas:design; energy and fluids; mechanics, materials andmanufacturing; and systems and dynamics.Departmental thrust areas for graduate and under-graduate research include: environment; health care; information technology; and manufacturing. Severalon-going senior capstone design projects provide both undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on, interdisciplinary, team-driven opportuni-ties that encompass such diverse topics as Formula SAE car; human-powered submarine, mechatronics, and fuel cell technology. Undergraduate Program Mechanical Engineering Student Services143 Mechanical Engineering Bldg., Box 352600206-543-5090 meadvise@u.washington.edu The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Science inMechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.) degree. The B.S.M.E. program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering The mission of the B.S.M.E. program is to provide the resources and educational opportunities that pre- pare men and women for careers in Mechanical Engineering and related fields, and to foster the development of the leadership skills that are thebasis of effective contributors to society. This mission is accomplished by attaining the following goals: 1.Preparation for the profession. At the end of their education, students should possess a tool chestof skills and knowledge that positions them for success as (1) entry-level engineers in existing firms, or (2) graduate students in any program inthe country. This does not preclude other activi-ties, such as volunteering, self-employment, or academic study in another discipline. Students succeed in this goal by being able to use funda-mental science and engineering analysis to solve engineering problems; successfully execute engineering designs, including effective use ofproject management tools; and perform effec- tively in teams through oral, written, and graphi- cal communication. 2.Contribution to society. Students succeed in this goal by being able to think critically, in the sense of broadly educated individuals; perform inde- pendent, informed analysis on issues inside andoutside of technology; and continue lifelonglearning. Each student's success achieving these goals is measured by demonstration of the following learning outcomes: 1.(a) Background in mathematics, science and engineering principles. (b) Ability to apply this knowledge to the formulation and solution of Mechanical Engineering problems 2. (a) Ability to design thermal and mechanical components to achieve a desired goal. (b) Abilityto develop, conduct, and analyze experiments or tests that may aid in this design process. 3. Understanding of the necessary professional abilities of a practicing engineer including ethi-cal conduct, teamwork in the pursuit of a goaland effective communication. 4. Ability to conduct computer based design and analysis in engineering applications. 5. Exposure to a general educational program that aids in the understanding of and increase theappreciation of the \"non-technical\" world270 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING / MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 6. Realization of the business environment in which engineering is practiced 7. Awareness and necessity of continuing educa- tion, graduate study and other life long learning experiences.

Technical Communication 14 Loew General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Tech_Communication.html Department Web page: www.uwtc.washington.edu Technical communicators use their language, visual, and analytical skills, as well as training and research in electronic and other media, to create and enhancecommunication in scientific and technical environ-ments. The Department of Technical Communication prepares students to design, create, edit, and evalu- ate technical and scientific discourse. The depart-ment also provides course work in the development of online help systems and in the design of general- audience content for delivery by means of advancedcommunication technologies such as the Web. The complexities of modern life have greatly increased the number of people who needed to communicate about technical and other specialized topics. Scientific journal articles, manuals, propos-als, and other genres have become important for a vast array of readers. With the Information Age, gain- ing and sharing technological understanding andcapability has become a crucial human activity. Wecommunicate in more genres, address broader (often global) audiences, and face more complex rhetorical problems than ever before. To achieve success in their communication activities, progressive organizations are employing sophisticat-ed planning and development methods, includinguser-centered design and evaluation, content man-agement, and systems-based analyses. In addition,they undertake research projects and apply existingresearch to their own needs. Contemporary researchin technical communication ranges from controlled empirical research on the processing of text, graph-ics, and multimedia content to observational research on how meaning is created and negotiated in business environments and virtual communities. The Department of Technical Communication pre- pares students to assume positions of intellectual leadership in industry, government, and non-profit organizations. Students also specialize in science writing or Web site design. The Technical Japanese program provides a unique opportunity to developcross-cultural experience and expertise. Whatever their professional direction, technical com- munication students learn the newest communica-tion technologies and practices, the most effective information-design strategies, and the research skills appropriate to their interests. They also learn theenduring theory and principles that enable them to understand the constant changes they will encounter throughout their careers. Finally, their course worktakes place in the context of social and politicalissues and human needs. Other major interests of the department are the human-computer interface, hypermedia, communi- cations technology, the rhetoric of technical dis-course, international communication, visual commu- nication, publications and communications manage- ment, policy analysis of technological systems, andresearch and testing. Undergraduate Program Advisers Kate LongCarolyn Plumb 14G Loew, Box 352195 206-543-7108 or 206-543-7611tc@uwtc.washington.edu The Department of Technical Communication offers a program of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Technical Communication degree, as wellas a minor.

Students seeking information about financial aid offered outside the College should contact the Office of Student Financial Aid, 105 Schmitz. Institute of Forest Resources The overall research program of the College isadministered by the Institute of Forest Resources. Because of the size and complexity of this program,the institute assumes a broad scope of responsibility and provides vital support to the College administra- tion, faculty, staff, and students. Major functions include administering all research projects funded by federal, state, and private agencies, monitoringthe McIntire-Stennis research program, ensuring College compliance with federal reporting require- ments, and producing College publications and spe-cial research reports. Institute staff coordinate and facilitate the submis- sion of research proposals for the faculty with theUniversity administration and numerous funding agencies. Students earn research and thesis credit toward advanced degrees by working on major for-est resources problems supported by grants or con-tracts. Areas of current and future research cover a broad array of topics including forest policy analysis, standmanagement, streamside and riparian zone manage- ment, forest ecosystem analysis, international trade in forest products, forest-products marketing, forestbiotechnology, wildlife science, forest soils, urban horticulture, forest engineering, hydrology, and paper science and engineering. Research projects includestudies by individual faculty, as well as interdiscipli- nary programs, which combine the interests of College faculty with those from other academic units of the University and other institutions. The College also collaborates with Cooperative Extension of Washington State University to under- take and promote continuing education for citizensof the state, particularly in the nonindustrial forestry area. The Institute Publications Office provides a wide range of services in producing College researchpublications: technical editing, desktop-publishing systems, format and layout design, computer graph- ics, printing/publishing coordination, and distribu-tion. College publications are distributed to nationaland international institutions and libraries, as well as to forestry professionals, to organizations in the pri- vate sector, and to the general public. Field Research Areas and Facilities The College field facilities include two major forested areas covering more than 4,000 acres, an arboretum,a reserve, and several cooperative research centers and stations. These lands offer a wide variety of ter- restrial and aquatic characteristics favorable to a full range of scientific investigations. They also providea general natural-science laboratory for the many disciplines in the College specifically related to, or concerned with, the research and teaching of natu-ral resources behavioral patterns and management. The Charles Lathrop Pack Experimental Forest of approximately 4,200 acres is located 65 miles southof the University, near Eatonville. This forested prop-erty is the focal point for on-the-ground academicwork in forest management, resource science, andforest engineering, both at the undergraduate andgraduate levels. Broad forest and soil diversity hasled to extensive biological, management, and engi-COLLEGE OF FOREST RESOURCES / MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING DIVISION 277 neering research, much of which may be character- ized as a pioneering effort. A full-time resident staffmanages this facility, harmonizing its public-educa- tion objectives with academic and research objec- tives. Rustic but comfortable facilities which providehousing and support to academic and research pro- grams are also used extensively for conferences both within and outside the University. The Olympic Natural Resources Center (ONRC) is a 19,000-square-foot research and education facilitylocated on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula. The mission of the Center is to conduct research and education on natural-resources management prac-tices which integrate ecological and economic val- ues. Innovative management methods that integrate environmental and economic interests into pragmat-ic management of forest and ocean resources are demonstrated. A forest management program as well as a marine program are in place to study the rela-tionship between the terrestrial and marine environ-ment. The Lee Memorial Forest, approximately 160 acres, is located about 22 miles northeast of the University, near Maltby. This forested property provides valu-able academic and research opportunities near the campus. Characterized by forest types and soils common to western Washington lowlands, Lee Forestis used extensively for part-day trips and for long- term research and demonstration projects especially related to changing land uses. The Allan H. Thompson Research Center and the Joe E. Monahan Findley Lake Reserve and Research Area in the Cedar River watershed are utilized by the College in cooperation with Seattle Public Utilities forstudies in forest physiology and mineral cycling inthe forest ecosystem. The Center for Urban Horticulture has offices, labo- ratories, public-education resources, and field sites for teaching and experimentation along the shore ofUnion Bay. Its 10-acre Union Bay Gardens, for research, teaching, and display, currently emphasize unusual ornamental and native woody landscapeplants. The 60-acre Union Bay Natural Area, a for- mer dumpsite now a naturalized habitat, is used by classes in four different colleges and the public tostudy principles and practices of restoration ecolo-gy. The Douglas Research Conservatory is a modern plant-growing facility with greenhouses, growth chambers, nursery, and classrooms. The OtisDouglas Hyde Hortorium is an herbarium dedicated to plants of urban horticultural significance. The Elisabeth C. Miller Horticultural Library is theNorthwest's foremost public horticultural library, with books, journals, and other materials available to the gardening public, students, and professional horti-culturists. The Center also conducts courses, lec-tures, and special events for the public and profes- sionals as part of the College's Continuing and Public Education program. Cooperative programs are inplace with Washington State University/King County Cooperative Extension, whose horticulture program is housed at the Center. The Center's largest facility is the Washington Park Arboretum, a 230-acre collection of trees and shrubsgrowing in a naturalistic setting on the south shore of Lake Washington. Managed in cooperation with the City of Seattle Department of Parks and Recreationand the Arboretum Foundation, the arboretum con- tains some 5,200 different kinds of woody plants that are available for research and academic study, mak-ing it the third most diverse arboretum in the UnitedStates. Displays and programs educate students andvisitors about woody plants' diversity, natural ecolo-gy, and urban landscape use, as well as conservingendangered natural and cultivated plants. Classesin botany, dendrology, horticulture, wildlife, and land-scape architecture make use of the collections, whilethe grounds are used for studies in soil science,ecology, and various research projects, includingmany independent student projects. The arboretum,established in 1934, also serves as an important pub- lic-service area to the University, offering numerous formal and informal classes for the general publicand, in addition, serving the community as a public park and open space. Summer Opportunities During summer quarter, there are many internships and independent study courses in which a studentmay get credit for summer work. In late summer, there is a four-week intensive pro- gram that combines work and study in Pacific Northwest forests with the study of English as aninternational language for forestry. The College and the Department of English As A Second Language schedule the program. For more information, contact Aaron Bidelspach, UW Educational Outreach, 206-543-2300. Ecosystem Sciences Division Chair David Manuwal 104 Winkenwerder Courses included in the Ecosystem Sciences Division cover basic and applied subject matters in forest biology, wildlife science, and urban horticul- ture. Urban horticulture is concerned with the selec-tion, management, and role of plants and ecosys- tems in urban environments. Subjects covered include plant and animal ecology, wildlife biology andconservation, dendrology and autecology, soils, ecosystem analysis, environmental horticulture, pub- lic horticulture, and urban forestry. The Division of Ecosystem Sciences offers three undergraduate majors leading to the Bachelor ofScience in Forest Resources: Conservation of Wildland Resources, Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry, and Wildlife Science. Specific pathsallow students to design coursework for individual- ized professional or educational objectives. Conservation of Wildland Resources provides an understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and theirstewardship. Students select one advanced course- work option related to different career goals: Conservation Principles, Conservation Practices,Conservation Learning, and an individualized option. Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry com- bines applied horticulture with management of dis- turbed ecosystems, arboreta, and urban forests. Program options are Environmental Horticulture,Public Horticulture, Urban Forestry, and an individu- alized option. Wildlife Science focuses on the application of eco- logical knowledge to wildlife biology and manage-ment, with the intent of preparing students for gradu-ate education in wildlife science or natural resources management. Graduate programs leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees include ecosys-tem analysis (ecology, tree physiology and genetics,and soils and mineral cycling), wildlife science, andurban horticulture. A Master of Forest Resourcesdegree in urban horticulture is also available.Management and Engineering Division Chair Richard R. Gustafson 332 Bloedel Courses for which the Management and Engineering Division is responsible deal with all the facets of the forest resources arena, from management of forests to the production and recycling of paper products.Multiple uses of forests including timber, water, wildlife habitat, and recreation are embraced in the forest management curriculum. Courses in the forestand ecological engineering curriculum emphasize the scientific and engineering design principles that enable graduates to find technical solutions to prob-lems facing forest-related enterprises and rural com- munities. Paper science and engineering courses provide students with the skills to work as technicaland management professionals in the paper andallied industries. The Division of Management and Engineering offers three undergraduate majors leading to the Bachelor of Science in Forest Resources: forest management,forest and ecological engineering (which is offered jointly with the College of Engineering), and paper science and engineering. The goal of the forest man-agement curriculum, which is accredited by the Society of American Foresters, is to educate under- graduate students to perform as professional forestland managers. Forest lands range from public bioreserves, wilderness, and parks where preserva- tion issues are paramount, to extensively managedprivate tracts, watersheds, and commercial treefarms where utilization is the guiding paradigm. Courses emphasize intensive management as well as multiple use of forest resources and forest lands. The four curriculum objectives for forest manage- ment are to (1) educate and train students for entry- level employment, (2) educate students to be effec- tive managers in both the private and public sectors,(3) prepare students to learn how to be future lead- ers of the profession and community, and (4) prepare students for a lifetime of learning. The curriculum pro-vides a firm grounding in the physical, natural, andsocial sciences at the lower-division level along with an introduction to forest resources management. At the upper division, a core of professional forestrycourses emphasizes the integration of forest- resources biological sciences with the social and management sciences. Restricted electives are alsorequired to enhance the understanding of business- management and economic principles. Students in forest management spend the spring quarter of their junior year at the College's PackForest where specialized field instruction is provid-ed. Forest engineering is a profession in which knowl- edge of the mathematical and natural sciences gained by study and experience is applied with judg-ment to design systems and processes to meet soci- ety's many demands from forested landscapes. Forest engineers design timber harvest, road con-struction, watershed protection, and resourceenhancement activities over a wide variety of space and time scales. The overall goal of the forest and ecological engineering curriculum is to provide thehighest quality education in engineering principlesas well as forest ecosystems in an undergraduatedegree program. An admissions application, includ-ing specific course and grade-point prerequisites, isrequired.278 COLLEGE OF FOREST RESOURCES / UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The objectives of the curriculum are (1) to provide a broad education, including a strong liberal arts back-ground emphasizing critical thinking and life-long learning, which will enable students to be informed, responsible, and effective professionals in society; (2) to develop students' written and oral communica- tions skills so that they can organize and express information and ideas logically and convincingly; (3)to develop students' understanding of fundamentalscientific principles, including forest science and ecology, which serve as a sound basis for the syn- thesis of knowledge leading to rational problem-solv-ing; (4) to develop students' knowledge and ability to employ engineering methods including analysis, computation, modeling, experimental techniques,and design to solve forest and ecological engineer- ing problems; and (5) to develop students' under- standing of their legal, ethical, and professional rela-tionships with society to prepare them for the profes-sional practice of forest and ecological engineering. While the first two years of the forest and ecological engineering curriculum are consistent with pre-engi- neering status within the University, and the core for-est and ecological engineering courses begin in the junior year, design is a theme that is emphasized throughout the program. The design theme culmi-nates in the senior year when all forest and ecologi- cal engineering students participate in a real-world, team-oriented design project combining most, if notall, aspects of their studies. This capstone course is held at Pack Forest. Students also generally sit for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, Engineer inTraining (EIT), during their senior year as a first step toward eventual licensure as professional engineers. The paper and allied industries need technically trained professionals to resolve challenges faced by the industries. Students in the paper science andengineering program are instructed in chemistry, chemical engineering, wood chemistry, and pulp and paper processing. The goal of the paper science andengineering curriculum is to provide the highest qual- ity education in engineering principles as well as pulp and paper fundamentals in an undergraduateprogram. Course subjects in this curriculum includewood chemistry, pulping and bleaching, recycling, paper physics, papermaking, process control, and process design. The objectives of the paper science and engineering undergraduate program are (1) to provide students with a strong foundation in mathematics, natural and physical sciences, and engineering fundamentals.In addition, students are trained in the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice; (2) to provide students with athorough knowledge of the technology used in themodern pulp and paper mill and to provide a com- plete understanding of the underlying phenomena that govern the unit operations of that technology; (3)to provide students with relevant laboratory experi- ences that demonstrate basic principles and teach students to conduct experiments as well as analyzeand interpret data; (4) to provide students with a cap-stone design experience that integrates the knowl- edge and skills acquired in previous courses; design problems are solved by multidisciplinary teams anddemonstrate the students' capabilities in identifying, formulating, and then solving engineering problems; (5) to provide students with a broad range of skillsthat they need to function as professionals in an engi- neering career. These include analytical and design skills, communication techniques, ethical principlesand values, and knowledge of contemporary issues.The students are also provided an education in thehumanities and social sciences to understand theimpact of engineering solutions in a global and soci-etal context.The first two years of the paper science and engi-neering curriculum are similar to other pre-engineer-ing curricula, especially chemical engineering. The core paper science and engineering courses begin in the junior year and continue through the senioryear. A fifth-year option is available for qualified stu- dents who want to pursue a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. Admission to the PaperScience and Engineering program is required. Graduate programs leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees are offered by this division and include social sciences, forest econom- ics, forest engineering/hydrology, forest productsmarketing, silviculture and forest protection, quanti- tative resources management, and paper sciences and engineering. A practice-oriented degree lead-ing to the Master of Forest Resources in the area of silviculture is also available. Undergraduate Program Information may be requested by contacting the fac- ulty adviser listed with each program or through theOffice of Student Services, cfradv@u.washington.edu. The College of Forest Resources offers six under- graduate majors leading to a Bachelor of Science in Forest Resources degree: forest management,wildlife science, conservation of wildland resources, forest engineering, paper science and engineering, and environmental horticulture and urban forestry. The first two years of study emphasize general preparation, followed by an upper-division profes-sional program. Each curriculum contains a number of elective credits selected by the student with the assistance of faculty advisers. Students are encour-aged to take a number of these credits outside the College to broaden their preparation. In addition to University regulations concerning requirements and grading, College regulations state that no required course may be taken on a satisfac- tory/not-satisfactory basis. Some classes include field trips, laboratory supplies, or material duplica-tion at extra expense to the students. The College also offers six minors: conservation of wildland resources, forest management, internation- al forestry, urban forestry, streamside studies, and wildlife science. Four of these minors provide expo-sure for students to the knowledge of the majors of the same name. The minor in streamside studies is designed to pro- vide an understanding of streamside issues for theproper management of watersheds. The core class- es provide an interdisciplinary understanding of criti- cal processes in streamside areas: geomorphology,plant ecology, hydrology, and fisheries ecology. Three thematic areas\u2014physical, ecological, and social processes\u2014allow students majoring in geolo- gy, engineering, forestry, or fisheries to meet require- ments of the minor with a minimum of extra hours andacquire in-depth knowledge in a particular area. Other majors are welcome. High School Preparation In addition to the University's general admission requirements, students who plan to enter the College of Forest Resources should have a strong sciencebackground.Admission UW students in good academic standing maydeclare a major in the College at any time with theexceptions of Forest and Ecological Engineering and Paper Science and Engineering which require an application for admission.

Faculty serve as advisers for cur-riculum and career planning. Pack Forest Residential Field Classes Students enrolled in the forest management and for- est engineering curricula must attend the Pack Forestprogram. This program is typically completed during the spring of the junior year for forest management students and during the spring of the senior year forforest engineering students. Courses are conductedas part of the field residential program at the Charles Lathrop Pack Experimental Forest near Eatonville, 65 miles from Seattle. Students in other majors such as Conservation of Wildland Resources may also attend Pack Forest, but it is not required. Students taking course work at Pack Forest must live at the field residential station, paying room-and-board charges in addition to regular tuition. Information is available from the Office of Student Services, 115 Anderson. Accreditation The curriculum in forest management is accreditedby the Society of American Foresters (SAF). Othercurricula include electives that may be used towardqualifications for SAF and the Forester rating for the United States Civil Service. The curriculum in forest engineering is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering andTechnology (ABET). SAF and ABET are recognized by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education as the accrediting agen-cies for forestry and engineering, respectively, in theUnited States. Students should consult with faculty advisers when planning their schedules to include the specific class requirements for SAF and civil-service qualifications.

Center for International Trade in Forest Products The Center for International Trade in Forest Products (CINTRAFOR) was established in 1984 to respond toopportunities and problems relating to the export and import of wood products. Through programs of research, education, and outreach, CINTRAFOR works to improve knowledge of export trade and to train professionals competent in the analysis and interpretation of trade problems, issues, and policies.The Center serves as a focal point for dissemination of information on world trade in forest products by means of seminars, conferences, workshops, andpublications. CINTRAFOR activities involve the cooperative effort of the forest-products industry, state and federal organizations, and other organizations at theUniversity such as the School of BusinessAdministration and the Northwest Policy Center. Theresearch undertaken by CINTRAFOR includes coun- try-market analyses; a global new andstudies of the linkage between forest-products tradeand environmental impacts, regional socioeconomicstability, and policy impact analyses.Students interested in participating in specificresearch activities sponsored by CINTRAFOR may enroll for study in graduate programs in one of the College's two academic divisions or in programs offered by other academic divisions on campus. Center for Streamside Studies Director Susan M. Bolton 244 Bloedel The Center for Streamside Studies (CSS) was estab- lished in 1987 as a joint effort of the College of Forest Resources, the College of Ocean and FisherySciences, and the Center for Quantitative Science in Forestry, Fisheries, and Wildlife. CSS provides infor- mation for the resolution of Management issues relat-ed to the production and protection of forest, fish,wildlife, and water resources associated with the streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The Center conducts research activities related to the understanding of ecological and physicalprocesses and their relation to governmental regula- tions. Projects are solution-oriented, centering around biological, physical, and social aspects ofManagement issues. Cooperative projects are undertaken with state and federal agencies, tribes, private industry, and national and internationalresearch institutions, and involve faculty and stu- dents of the College of Forest Resources, the College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the College of Arts and Sciences. To provide interdisciplinary training necessary to deal with the management of interacting resources, CSS conducts symposia, workshops, conferences, and seminar series as forums for resource-conflict dis-cussion and resolution. Students interested in partic- ipating in specific research activities sponsored by CSS may enroll for study in graduate programs in oneof the College of Forest Resources' two academic divisions or in programs offered by other academic units on campus. Olympic Natural Resources Center Director John M. Calhoun The mission of the Olympic Natural Resources Center (ONRC) is to conduct research and educa- tion on natural-resource-management practices that integrate ecological and economic values. Createdby the Washington State Legislature in 1989, theCenter conducts biological, physical, economic, and social-science research in both terrestrial and coastal/marine systems, focusing on its strategic pri-orities. The Center's programs aimed at pragmatic management solutions span a spectrum from devel- oping new knowledge through applied research toeducation and outreach. Much of the Center's work is conducted cooperative- ly with other research institutions, state and federal agencies, resource owners, and interest groups. The Center is housed in facilities at Forks, Washington,on the Olympic Peninsula. It is well suited for educa- tion, research, and conference activities. The natural resources of the area are a major focus of the work of the Center. The Center is jointly administered by the College of Forest Resources and the College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences. Center for Urban Horticulture Acting Director Thomas Hinckley204 Winkenwerder The Center for Urban Horticulture is dedicated to research, teaching, and public service concerningthe selection, management, and role of plants and of ecosystems in urban landscapes. Urban land-scapes\u2014landscapes that are subject to direct impacts of human activity\u2014include city streets, urban parks, public gardens, residential areas, andnatural (and naturalized) areas bounded by commer- cial and residential development. Urban horticulture concerns those landscapes as they are used for aes-thetic amenity, for amelioration and control of thephysical environment, for public and professional education, for conservation of biodiversity and of nat- ural resources, and for public recreation. Faculty in four colleges\u2014Forest Resources, Arts and Sciences, Architecture and Urban Planning, and Engineering\u2014are affiliated formally and informally with the Center, participating in urban horticulturalresearch, teaching, and collections curation. The Center serves as a primary focus of the UW's curric- ula in urban environmental studies, which comprisethe most comprehensive program in the UnitedStates.

In 1998, the University set out to transform the School by charging it with a new mission, to become what itis today: a broad-based information school thatmeets the challenges and opportunities of the infor-mation age. With the addition of three new degreeprograms, a new dean, an esteemed faculty, andstate of the art facilities, the Information Schoolbecame the University's sixteenth independently organized school and college in 2001. Continuing its long tradition of excellence and inno- vation, the School continues to explore the theoreti- cal and applied cutting edges of the information field and to nurture the best of both worlds: traditionallibrary values and ever-changing information fron- tiers. The vision statement adopted by the School is \"People and Knowledge: Building Information Connections. The faculty, staff, students, and alumni of the Information School believe that connecting people with knowledge is of fundamental individualand societal importance; further, we believe access to information is a basic human right. We commit our- selves to sustain this vision.\" The Information School is actively committed to culti- vating diversity in the School and in the information professions. Special Research Facilities Located on the third and fourth floors of Mary Gates Hall, one of the University's flagship high-technologybuildings, the School offers an extensive software collection, a state-of-the-art computer classroom, an innovative Technology Exploration (TE) Lab, andexcellent network connectivity.

PoE offers an undergraduate degree in environmental studies, a minor in environmental stud- ies, and offers or administers three graduate certifi-cate programs. As an interdisciplinary program merging multiple fields of study, PoE draws faculty from a wide array of disciplines, providing a uniqueopportunity for students and faculty to explore com- plex environmental issues from multiple perspec- tives. PoE offers both a major and a minor in environmental studies. The major leads to a Bachelor of Arts degreeand is offered through General Studies. It offers stu- dents a broad-based liberal arts education with an environmental focus on one of four tracks: ecologyand conservation, population and health, resources, or an approved individualized curriculum. Students explore a diversity of environmental perspectivesacross local, regional, and international arenas and are encouraged to build on their coursework by engaging in service learning, internships, under-graduate research, and study abroad. The B.A. in environmental studies prepares students for a wide variety of environmentally related careers, or forgraduate or professional training in fields such asbusiness, law, policy, public affairs, and health. Many students majoring in environmental studies also pursue a complementary Bachelor of Arts degree in humanities or social science or a comple-mentary Bachelor of Science degree in physical or natural sciences, engineering, forestry, or fisheries. Students electing to pursue either a double major ora double degree are limited to 15 credits of overlapbetween the two major/degree programs. The minor in environmental studies can serve as a complement to either a Bachelor of Arts degree in the social sciences or humanities or a Bachelor ofScience degree in engineering, public health, or one of the sciences. The minor, pursued in combination with a Bachelor of Science degree in an environmen-tally related discipline, is designed to prepare stu-dents for environmentally related jobs that require a combination of technical expertise and interdiscipli- nary breadth.

Offered:AWSpS.SCHOOL OF MEDICINESCHOOL OF MEDICINE / LABORATORY MEDICINE 301 Medical technology (MT) is where basic laboratory science meets the practice of medicine. It is a pro-fession of highly knowledgeable and skilled individu- als who perform clinical laboratory tests on blood, other body fluids, or tissue samples. This is a criticalpart of health care, as the results obtained by these laboratory tests are a vital tool for physicians in their diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Successful medical technologists are individuals who enjoy studying the biological, chemical, andphysical sciences and who find personal satisfaction and intellectual reward in applying scientific meth- ods in the diagnosis and evaluation of disease. Amedical technologist may practice as a generalist, using knowledge in several of the scientific disci- plines, or may specialize in one scientific area in larg-er hospitals. People trained as medical technologists may work in a variety of settings. Many work in clini- cal laboratories in large medical centers, hospitals,and clinics. Others do research in industrial, publichealth, and medical laboratories, and teach in hospi- tals, colleges, and universities. Internship or Cooperative Exchange Programs: In 1999, the Medical Technology program initiated acooperative exchange program with Gunma University in Maebashi, Japan, giving students the opportunity to compare laboratory medicine in Japanwith its practice in the United States. The opportunity exists for graduates of the UW Medical Technology program to visit this comparable Japanese programfor at least two weeks, providing an excellent learn- ing experience for students with an interest in inter- national health care.

Rehabilitation Medicine BB919 Health Sciences General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Rehab_Medicine.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/rehab/ The Department of Rehabilitation Medicine provides education for medical students, interns, residents, and allied health students in occupational therapy,physical therapy, and prosthetics and orthotics in acomprehensive approach to rehabilitation problems. This includes special diagnostic and evaluative pro- cedures; methods and rationale in the application ofprinciples of occupational therapy, physical therapy, prosthetics and orthotics, and other health profes- sions; and advanced investigation of special prob-lems encountered in the field. In addition, the depart- ment conducts a residency training program for the specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation. The department offers graduate curricula leading to the following degrees: Master of OccupationalTherapy, Master of Physical Therapy, and a Bachelor of Science in the field of prosthetics and orthotics. The department also offers a Master of Sciencedegree in rehabilitation medicine with options for occupational therapists, physical therapists, and res- idents in physical medicine and rehabilitation whowish to pursue academic or research careers. Prosthetics and Orthotics Head John Fergason Upon successful completion of the prosthetics and orthotics program, the student will have learned theskills necessary to function as an entry level resident in prosthetics-orthotics. The degree in prosthetics- orthotics gives the student eligibility to enter a one-year clinical residency for each discipline at aNational Commission on Orthotics and Prosthetics Education (NCOPE) approved site. This residencyrequirement must be completed for eligibility to apply for the National Certification Boards administered bythe American Board for Certification in Orthotics andProsthetics, Inc. The prosthetist-orthotist is a member of the rehabili- tation health care team working together with dis-abled or physically challenged individuals toenhance their daily life and increase their functional abilities. The three groups of prosthetic-orthoticdevices which can potentially enter into the rehabili- tation of an individual are: (1) prosthetic devices, which replace or substitute for a missing limb or partof a limb; (2) orthotic devices, which help with the control of motion and the support of a weakened body segment; and (3) adaptive devices, whichenable the person to perform specific activities.Practitioners design and fabricate the appropriate device and evaluate the fit and functional use for each patient. To evaluate function, the prosthetist-orthotist must have a detailed knowledge of anatomy and kinesiology, joint range of motion, muscle strength, and human locomotion. Upon successful completion of the program, the stu- dent is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by the University of Washington School of Medicine. The practitioner program is accredited through theCommission on Accreditation of Allied HealthEducation Programs (CAAHEP). Admission Requirements1. Minimum 2.70 cumulative GPA. 2. Prior to admission to the program, students must complete the following prerequisites with a mini- mum GPA of 2.70: B STR 301; BIOL 101-1-2 orMICROM 301,302, (note that a pre- requisite for microbiology); CHEM 120; PHYS 114, 115 117, 118; PSYCH 101; ZOOL 118; STAT220 or equivalent. 3. Completion of the University writing and reason- ing requirements (5 credits of English composi- tion and 5 credits of quantitative and symbolicreasoning with a minimum grade of 2.0; two addi- tional writing courses totaling a minimum of 10 credits with a minimum grade of 0.7) and theCollege of Arts and Sciences Areas ofKnowledge requirements (20 credits in Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts; 20 credits in Individuals & Societies; 20 credits in the NaturalWorld). Prerequisite courses fulfill the 5-credit quantitative and symbolic reasoning require- ment, 5 credits of the Individuals & Societiesrequirement and all 20 credits of the Natural World requirement. Postbaccalaureate (fifth- year) students are exempt from the writing andreasoning requirements but not from the Areas of Knowledge requirements. 4. Admission to the program is competitive, based on GPA, and other measures of academic suc- cess. High GPA alone, however, does not guar-antee admission. Other factors, such as charac- ter, interpersonal skills, organizational ability, and recommendations, are also assessed. Volunteer or paid experience in health related areas is very important. 5. Departmental Application Deadline: February 15 for autumn quarter only. Suggested Introductory Course Work: SOC 110, SP CMU 103 or 220; courses with practical applica-tions of computers. Graduation Requirements: The following courses must be taken in the scheduled sequence, begin- ning autumn quarter only, at the UW: REHAB340,341, 342, 343, 400, 401, 402, 403, 414, 424, 427,428,429, The university grade-point sys- tem is used in student evaluation. A student mustmaintain a minimum cumulative program GPA of 2.50and \"credit\" grades in all courses that are gradedcredit/no credit to maintain good standing in the pro-gram and be eligible for graduation. A minimumgrade of 2.0 is required in each course. A gradeSCHOOL OF MEDICINE / REHABILITATION MEDICINE 307 below 2.0 in a required course must be repeated at the next offering with a minimum grade of 2.0received in the repeated course. If at any point, the cumulative grade point in the cur- riculum courses falls below 2.50, the student is placed on academic probation. In order to be takenoff probation, the student must achieve a curriculum grade point average of 2.50 by the end of two con- secutive quarters, or within a time frame designatedby the Advisory and Evaluation Committee. If a stu-dent is unable to remove his/her probation status he/she is subject to dismissal from the program. Faculty Chair Lawrence R.

COLLEGE OF OCEAN AND FISHERY SCIENCES / AQUATIC AND FISHERY SCIENCES 315 College of Ocean andFisherySciences Dean Arthur R.M. Nowell 207 Ocean Sciences Associate Dean Ken Chew General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/College_Ocean_Fish.html College Web page: www.cofs.washington.edu The marine environment has been a dominant factor in the history of the Pacific Northwest from the time of the first Native American settlements to the mod-ern days of aquaculture, container ships, and water- front condominiums. It is not surprising, therefore, that the University of Washington has a long traditionof commitment to teaching, research, and public service in subjects related to marine and freshwater activities. The College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences com- prises five of the major units of the University in themarine and freshwater sciences: the Applied Physics Laboratory; the Schools of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Marine Affairs, and Oceanography; andthe Office of Marine Environmental and Resource Programs, which includes the Washington Sea Grant Program. Each of the units of the College focuses ona difference aspect of the aquatic environment, but there is much overlap of interests. The College offers both undergraduate and gradu- ate instructional programs in fisheries and oceanog-raphy, and graduate programs in marine affairs. For undergraduates, it is easy to pursue joint undergrad- uate degrees with departments such as Zoology,Chemistry, and Geology in the College of Arts andSciences. College faculty, staff, and students carry out research in oceans, estuaries, and freshwater lakes and rivers all over the world. Facilities forresearch and teaching range from ocean-going ves- sels to well-equipped laboratories and classrooms. The College also supports career-oriented resources for students to complement traditional course workand research. An annual Career Fair, held eachFebruary, brings more than 30 potential employers to campus to meet with students and discuss career possibilities and employment opportunities. A well-equipped Career Center is available for students, providing information about career planning, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and job opportunities in the marine andfreshwater sciences. Northwest Water Work, a semi- monthly summary of current employment opportuni- ties and internships available in water-related areas,is published by the College and made available freeof charge to students. Internships are encouragedas a way to help students bridge the transition fromthe classroom to employment after graduation. TheCollege also supports educational outreach activi-ties and innovative learning technologies.In 1999, the College had 200 undergraduate and 250 graduate students enrolled, a faculty of 198 mem-bers, and a total budget of $60 million, making it one of the largest institutions of its kind in the nation. The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences is con- cerned with wise management of fish and shellfishstocks, ecological relationships between aquatic organisms and their environment, culture of aquatic plants and animals, and impacts of human popula-tion pressures on the aquatic environment. The School of Oceanography carries out research and teaching on the physical, chemical, geological and geophysical, and biological processes in the ocean, and interactions of the ocean with the earth,the biosphere, and the atmosphere. It is concerned with the study of ocean currents and mixing, life in the sea, the chemical composition and properties ofseawater, the sediments and rocks beneath the sea, and the geophysics of the sea floor. It offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The School of Marine Affairs is concerned with poli- cy and institutional issues related to the ocean. Itcombines natural sciences and engineering with law, economics, international affairs, and public adminis- tration. Marine affairs, coastal zone management,ports and marine transportation, atmospheric and marine policy, living marine resources, and interna- tional law of the sea are all part of the School's teach-ing and research programs. It offers a Master of Marine Affairs degree. The Applied Physics Laboratory is a research and development unit with strong capabilities in marinescience and technology, acoustic sensors and soundpropagation, marine instrumentation, and polar sci- ence and technology. No degrees are offered, but a regular seminar series is presented. APL faculty members with joint appointments in other University departments teach courses and advise graduate stu- dents on theses. Part-time employment for students,including a program offering four years of support to students who contemplate a career in engineering or science, is also provided. The Washington Sea Grant Program is a component of the National Sea Grant Program which was creat- ed by Congress to enhance the wise use and pro- tection of the nation's marine resources through coor-dinated efforts in research, education, and publicservice. The Washington Sea Grant Program is administered as a division of the College but has additional statewide and multi-institutional responsi-bilities. It funds research and education throughout the state; supports advisory services; presents work- shops, short courses, and lectures; and producespublications. The University of Washington was oneof the first four universities in the country designated in 1971 as Sea Grant Colleges in recognition of out- standing sustained programs in research, education,and advisory services in the marine area. Aquatic and Fishery Sciences 116 Fishery Sciences General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/Fisheries.html School Web page: www.fish.washington.edu The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, estab- lished in 1919, is the largest and most diverse aca-demic fisheries program in the United States.Students benefit from our faculty, whose breadth ofexpertise includes marine biology and freshwaterecology, habitat restoration, quantitative fishery man-agement, invertebrate and finfish aquaculture, and a number of disciplines related to physical, biologicaland societal processes that bear on growing issues of fisheries conservation. Faculty and students in the School draw upon a wide range of disciplines includ-ing biology, botany, chemistry, genetics, mathemat- ics, nutrition, oceanography, physics, physiology, and zoology to conduct basic and applied researchin the field of fishery science. For undergraduates,the school has focus areas in marine biology and ecology, freshwater ecology, conservation and man- agement, and aquatic biology and culture. Courses A full spectrum of undergraduate- and graduate-levelcourses allows students to learn the basic principlesof fishery science and to develop expertise in spe- cialized fields such as quantitative fishery manage- ment, aquaculture, and aquatic ecology. Among thewide variety of courses open to students are ichthy- ology, world fisheries and aquaculture, freshwater ecosystems, forestry-fisheries interactions, marinebiology, salmonid behavior and life history, fisheriesstock assessment, ecology of marine fishes, conser- vation genetics, and physiological effects of water pollutants. The School cooperates with other units on campus (Biology, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Forest Resources, Marine Affairs, Quantitative Science, Program on the Environment, Zoology, andOceanography) to offer jointly listed courses. Instruction is offered both on the main campus and at the Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island. Advising The Student Services Office is located in 116 FisherySciences. Students can receive assistance regard-ing curriculum, course scheduling, and graduation requirements. The Student Services Office may be reached by email at safs@u.washington.edu. Related Programs The Center for Quantitative Science is an interdisci- plinary program sponsored by the Office ofUndergraduate Education, the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and the College of Forest Resources. It is dedicated to providing high-qualityinstruction in mathematical and applied statistical methods for undergraduate students who major in the biological and ecological sciences, renewableresources management, and environmental studies. The philosophy of the center is to provide instruction in an atmosphere that emphasizes the use of quanti-tative methods to better understand a variety of sci-entific phenomena. Faculty represent various applied scientific disciplines within Forest Resources, Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and other campusunits. Students may wish to complete a minor in quantitative science to document their understand- ing of the mathematical and statistical methods usedin the analysis of data. Research The faculty, staff, and students of the School conductbasic and applied research on regional, national, andinternational fishery and aquatic resource problems. The school has an especially strong commitment to providing undergraduates research opportunities inall areas of research in the school. All undergradu-ates must complete a capstone project as a degree requirement, but most undergraduates are involved in multiple research projects while enrolled.Research foci are grouped under major disciplinesof aquatic biodiversity (e.g., microbiology, marinemammals, fish systematics), aquatic organismalprocesses (e.g., aquaculture, physiology, genetics,pollution/toxicology), and aquatic ecology (marinefisheries, stream/riparian ecology, policy, and man-agement). Examples of research projects include the316 COLLEGE OF OCEAN AND FISHERY SCIENCES / AQUATIC AND FISHERY SCIENCES influence of physical oceanographic factors on recruitment of larval fish and shellfish, stock assess- ment of marine fishes, mechanisms controlling growth and growth efficiency in fishes, application of molecular biotechnology to the study of phylogeny,behavioral studies of homing and straying in Pacific salmon, contaminant transport through aquatic food chains, effects of forest practices on fish habitat,development of mitigation measures for restoringdamaged wetlands, and approaches for reducing pollution caused by aquaculture effluent. The School continues to coordinate long-term pro- grammatic research on anadromous fishes. TheAlaska Salmon Program, the High-Seas Salmon Program, and the Wetland Ecosystem Team, as well as individual projects collectively focus on the ori-gins, abundance, migratory patterns, and ocean dis- tribution of Pacific salmon and steelhead trout; spawning distribution, growth, and abundance ofsockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska; and environ-mental (physical and biological) factors influencing salmonid productivity. Researchers in the School collaborate with scientists within the University and with investigators employedby other agencies. The School benefits from the presence in Seattle of laboratories of the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. GeologicalService's Biological Resources Division, and the Washington State Departments of Ecology, Fish and Wildlife, and Natural Resources. The headquartersand research staff of the International Pacific Halibut Commission are located on the campus as well. Researchers also collaborate with the scientific staffof private companies located in the Puget Soundregion and elsewhere. School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences researchers frequently participate in inter- institutional projects that involve scientists from otherstates and countries. The research program is enhanced through the activ- ities of several institutes and centers with which the School collaborates closely. The Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit was established in 1967 and is part of the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey. The goal of the WACFWRU fishand wildlife research program is to facilitate studieson a variety of resource management issues. Base funding is provided by the USGS, the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and the Washington Departments of Ecology, Fisheries, and Wildlife, and Natural Resources. Both graduate and undergraduate students are encour-aged to participate in the research being conducted in the WACFWRU. TheCenter for Streamside Studies is an interdiscipli- nary unit of the College of Forest Resources and theCollege of Ocean and Fishery Sciences. The centerconducts research and offers classes related to man- agement issues that surround the production and protection of forest, fish, wildlife, and water resourcesassociated with streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest. A minor in streamside studies is also available to undergraduate students. TheWestern Regional Aquaculture Center is one of five regional aquaculture centers supported by theU.S. Department of Agriculture. Participating scien- tists from twelve Western states conduct research directed toward enhancement of commercial aqua-culture production. TheOlympic Natural Resources Center, located in Forks, Washington, is an interdisciplinary researchand educational program related to the marine andforest resources of the Olympic Peninsula inWashington state.Facilities and Services The Fishery Sciences, Fisheries Teaching and Research, Marine Studies, and Fisheries Centerbuildings are located adjacent to the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The buildings contain class- rooms, laboratories, and support facilities. The Fisheries-Oceanography Library, a branch library offering research materials in fisheries, food science, oceanography, and wildlife science, is located near-by in the Oceanography Teaching Building. TheSchool's Fish Collection has served as a resource for teaching and varied scientific investigations for over 50 years. One of five major permanent facilities onthe west coast of the United States, the collection is by far the largest in our region in terms of number of specimens, containing in excess of 230,000 juvenileand adult specimens, and well over 3.3 million eggs and larvae. Together the collections represent some 3,778 species in 1,419 genera and 310 families. An annual run of several thousand salmon has been developed and is maintained at the School by the release of thousands of fingerlings each spring. Returning adults use a fish ladder to enter theSchool's Teaching and Research Hatchery facility.The run is the basis for both instruction and research on the life cycle of Pacific salmon, as well as the focus for the School's popular outreach programs,which accommodate thousands of school children annually. The Marine Molecular Biotechnology Laboratory (MMBL) is jointly operated by the Schools of Aquaticand Fishery Sciences and Oceanography. Advanced equipment is available for semi-automated sequenc- ing of DNA as well as other techniques of molecularbiology. Many undergraduates conduct research affiliated with MMBL. Other laboratories provide for the study of the physi- ology, biochemistry, and behavior of fishes and of theeffects of pollutants on fishes. Physiological facilitiesinclude equipment for surgical procedures and bio- chemical analysis of body fluids and tissues from both freshwater and marine fishes. The School uses various small vessels for instruc- tional and research work, including tow netting, purse seining, and trawling. These vessels, as well as char- tered vessels, are used in regular courses or trainingcruises to introduce students to shipboard opera- tions. Fisheries field stations in Alaska and at Big Beef Creek on Hood Canal provide additional oppor-tunities for field studies and research in stream andestuarine ecology. Financial Aid The University of Washington Financial Aid Officeadministers a variety of government and Universityfunded financial aid programs for which applicantsmust submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form (FAFSA). Please check with the Financial Aid Office, located in 105 Schmitz Hall, for applica-tions and timelines. The FAFSA may also be obtained at any college, university, or high school in the United States. Through the generous donations of alumni and friends, the School of Aquatic and Fishery Scienceshas established a strong scholarship program to assist students. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and other factors. The appli-cation process commences in spring; please checkwith the Office of Student Services for applicationsand deadlines to apply for scholarships. Employment Aquatic and fishery scientists are employed in threemajor sectors in the economy: public, private, andnonprofit. Jobs in the public sector are found withfederal, state, county, and municipal agencies. Theprivate sector includes fisheries and seafood com-panies and environmental consulting firms. Nonprofitagencies are involved in research, public policy, and public education. Much of their work is done by vol- unteers. Paid staff may be involved in field research,grant writing, public relations work and volunteer coordination. One factor that has expanded the job base in aquat- ic and fishery sciences in recent years has to do with national policies on endangered species, marine mammals, environmental quality, and overharvesting or harvesting of nontarget species. For example,observers are required on all large commercial fish- ing vessels and much work is done in public agen- cies regarding the health of fish and shellfish stocksand the environments that support them. Much of the information gathering is done in the field and also might involve becoming familiar with important aspects of public policy and interacting with public groups. There is a Career Center run through the College of Ocean & Fishery Sciences (COFS) located at 202 Ocean Sciences Building. In addition to collecting and disseminating job announcements, the CareerCenter also publishes an employment newsletter (Northwest WaterWorks ) twice monthly, listing cur- rent openings. This publication can be picked up at Student Services. Those who are not members of the UW community may also subscribe to receive either an electronic or print version by calling 206-543-0719. Also, each winter the College organizes aCareer Fair specifically for COFS students. Undergraduate Program Student Services Office 116 Fishery Sciences, Box 355020206-543-7457 safs@u.washington.edu Bachelor of Science in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences Admission: Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time, including on theirapplication for admission to the UW. After notification of admission and before registration, new students should visit or write to the School for help in planningtheir course programs. Academic and other coun- seling of SAFS students is provided through the Student Services Office. Suggested Introductory Course Work: High school students are urged to take four years of collegepreparatory mathematics (usually including precal- culus or mathematical analysis), because these are prerequisites for the mathematics courses includedin all School curricula.

The study is promptedboth by the intellectual desire to understand how the oceans move and how life develops in a salty, cold environment, and the need to use wisely the ocean'sresources for the benefit of humanity. It is an interdis- ciplinary science integrating the basic principles of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, geophysics, mathematics, botany, zoology, meteorology, andgeography. Applications of high technology to oceanographic instrumentation and vessels, increas- ingly sophisticated computers, satellite remote sens-ing, and innovative methodologies are rapidly open- ing new possibilities for exploration and study. Oceanography is divided into four areas of empha-sis: Biological Oceanography examines the processes governing the distribution, abundances, and produc- tion of plants, animals, and nutrients in the oceanic ecosystem. Emphasis is on investigations of bacte-ria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic organ- isms. Chemical Oceanography investigates the complex chemistry, distribution and cycling of dissolved sub-stances, nutrients, and gases in seawater, the mech- anisms controlling them and their origins and fates. Marine Geology and Geophysics studies marine sed- iments (their formation, transport, and deposition);ocean basin formation (plate tectonics); processes governing shoreline formation; and the origin, struc- ture, and history of the oceanic crust and upper man-tle. Physical Oceanography endeavors to understand and predict motions in the sea from millimeters through tidal and current scales to the great ocean gyres, the distribution of physical properties (tem-perature, salinity, sea ice), and air-sea interaction and its implications for climate. Undergraduate Program Undergraduate Adviser 108 Oceanography Teaching Building, Box 357940 206-543-5039 student@ocean.washington.edu Students may earn a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree with specialization in biolog-ical, chemical, or physical oceanography, or marine geology and geophysics. After acquiring basic sci- entific and mathematical knowledge, students thenapply these principles within Oceanography at increasingly complex levels. Students engage in field work and data collection, learn to analyze and inter-pret that data, and prepare scientific reports.Additionally, students acquire familiarity with the spe-cialized instruments of oceanographic research. The program is designed to prepare students to enter the profession directly or to pursue graduate stud-ies. Oceanographers seek to produce a new under-standing of an ocean system and to explore thepotential consequences to the marine environmentof human activities. They collect samples and data,320 COLLEGE OF OCEAN AND FISHERY SCIENCES / OCEANOGRAPHY analyze and interpret them, and prepare and dis- seminate the results. They work at sea, on land, inlaboratories, and with computers. Most are employed in education and research institutions and federal, state and local government agencies. Other employ-ers include environmental consulting firms and pri- vate companies extracting and harvesting marine products. A degree can also serve as a backgroundfor a career in teaching, administration, marineaffairs, computing, and environmental studies. Student Association and Research Program: Special opportunities for Oceanography majors are providedby the School's large research program by involving students in undergraduate research projects and part-time employment. Admission: Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time.

Requirements for the minor are described in detail at the Web page listed above. The general studies major allows undergraduate stu- dents to create an interdisciplinary, individuallydesigned program of study in public health. The stu- dent identifies public health as a central organizing theme and designs the course of study under theguidance and supervision of at least two faculty members and a general studies advisor. The general studies major usually requires 50-70 credits, many ofwhich come from the courses required for the public health minor. A complete description of the general studies major can be found in the Arts and Sciencessection of this catalog.

Military Science 104 Clark General Catalog Web page: www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/army.html Department Web page: depts.washington.edu/armyrotc/ The ROTC program provides students an opportuni- ty to learn and practice the art of leading people. Recognizing that there is a great difference betweencognition and volition, the program is structured insuch a way as to give the student practical experi- ence in leading and managing resources. The Army ROTC (AROTC) program enables the stu- dent to learn about the military profession and therole it plays in our democratic system of government. The courses enable such knowledge to be acquired on the campus without having to serve in the militaryforces. The Army ROTC electives enrich the student's course of study. Taking these courses also opens up an additional career option, enabling the student to earn a commission and to serve in the Army as an officer,or in the Reserves or National Guard while pursuing a civilian career. Officers serve in a wide variety of career paths, including infantry, human resources,aviation, intelligence, automation, and hospital administration. Army ROTC provides the student membership in a close-knit fraternal student organization. ROTC programs on college campuses are the nation's way of ensuring that all the influences ofhigher education are transported into the militaryservices-a mandatory requirement in a democracy. Adviser Wesley G. Williams 105 Clark, Box 353820 206-543-9010pms@milsci.washington.eduTraditional Four-Year Program Open to freshman and sophomore men and women. Academic studies include courses in military history, principles of leadership, techniques of instruction,management and staff procedures, logistics, physi- cal conditioning, and military law. Extra curricular activities include such options as Ranger Company,color guard, training exercises, field trips, and relat- ed activities. A non-scholarship student incurs no obligation of any kind during the first two years of the four-year AROTC program. Placement credit toward completion of AROTC courses may be given for prior ROTC or military train- ing. Veterans routinely receive full credit for the firsttwo years of AROTC and may enter the advanced course when they are academic juniors. All military textbooks and uniform items are furnished withoutcharge. Students in the advanced course receive tax-free monthly subsistence of $150 for a maximum of twenty months. In the advanced course, cadetsare required to participate in the leadership-devel-opment program, which is a practicum of skills and principles taught during the previous two years. Between their junior and senior years, cadets attenda five-week summer camp during which they receive varied and challenging training and for which they are paid both for the time at camp and for travelexpenses to and from the camp location. Upon enter- ing the advanced course, students agree to com- plete the course, accept a commission upon gradu-ation, and (if selected for active duty) serve on active duty for four years or three to six months' active-duty training followed by service in the Army Reserve orNational Guard. Two-Year Program This program is open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have at least two yearsremaining in school and who have completed 81 credits. Students may qualify for entrance into the advanced course under this program in two ways. First, they may participate as qualified veterans who receive placement credit for the first two years of AROTC. Veterans are also eligible to compete for two- and three-year scholarships while receiving their educational benefits. Members of the Reserves andNational Guard may also be eligible to participate in AROTC and receive their commission upon gradua- tion. The second alternative under this program requires attendance at Camp Challenge for five weeks at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Completion of this training also qual- ifies students for direct entry into the advancedcourse. While at camp, students receive pay plustravel expenses to and from the camp location, and they may compete for two-year scholarships. Two- and Three-Year Scholarship Program This program is open to qualified students on cam- pus. The scholarship provides financial assistanceduring the remaining years of the student's enroll-ment. Each scholarship pays for tuition and a flat rate for books and laboratory expenses and provides tax- free subsistence of $150 per academic month. Allother advantages and obligations are the same as those of the four-year scholarship program. Four-Year Scholarship Program Application to this program should be made while the student is still in high school. Selection of stu-dents is made on a nationwide competitive basis.This program may lead to a commission in the ActiveArmy, the Army Reserve, or the Army National Guard.All tuition, a flat rate for books and laboratoryexpenses, and uniform items, plus monthly tax-freesubsistence of $150 for a maximum of four years, areprovided by the Army. The program requires fouryears of academic study on campus, as well as afive-week advanced camp training period between the junior and senior years, for which the cadet is paid for both time and travel expense to and from thecamp location. Academic studies are identical to those of the traditional four-year program. The stu- dent must sign a contract wherein the student agreesto complete this program, along with a chosen aca-demic program, to accept a commission, and to serve on active duty or in the reserve forces after commissioning.
