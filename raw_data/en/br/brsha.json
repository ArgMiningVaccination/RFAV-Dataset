Seniors are at greater risk of flu-related complications and death, and older immune systems are less responsive to the standard annual flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommends all seniors receive either a higher-dose vaccine or an adjuvanted vaccine, which contains compounds that boost the shot's effectiveness. These extra-strength vaccines address issues specific to aging immune systems and prompt a stronger immune response than standard flu shots. This translates to fewer hospitalizations and deaths from influenza. This article discusses the senior flu shot. It explains the options available, the best time to get a flu shot, and why it is important for seniors to get an annual influenza vaccine. It also covers side effects from the senior flu shot and how long they last. FatCamera / Getty Images What Is a Senior Flu Shot? The CDC recommends everyone over the age of 6 months should get an annual flu vaccine (with a few, rare exceptions). However, the standard flu vaccine is not as effective in people ages 65 and older. Seniors are also at higher risk for complications and death from the flu. To combat this, more powerful vaccines were developed with seniors in mind. Senior flu shots prompt a stronger immune response, which offers greater protection against influenza. In 2022, the CDC began recommending all people ages 65 and up receive these high-potency influenza vaccines annually in place of standard flu shots. Types of Flu Shots for Seniors Senior flu shots come in two forms: high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Three of these vaccines are available for the 2023-2024 flu season: Quadrivalent Vaccine These senior flu vaccines are formulated to address specific immune systems issues in people over the age of 65. They help boost immunity and prevent complications from influenza in seniors. High-Dose Flu Vaccine The high-dose flu vaccines contain increased amounts of antigens. Antigens are the vaccine component that prompts the immune system to produce antibodies against influenza strains. Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens and neutralize threats. Antigens in the annual flu vaccine match the predicted influenza strains for the coming flu season. The antibodies you develop from the flu shot help your immune system quickly mount a defense when exposed to it again. High-dose vaccines promote a stronger immune response. Studies show the high-dose flu vaccine offers seniors 24% more protection against the flu than the standard flu vaccine. The following high-dose flu vaccines are available this season: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent contains antigen levels four times greater than standard-dose vaccines. Available since 2009, Fluzone is only approved for people 65 years and older.Flublok Quadrivalent contains antigen levels three times greater than regular flu shots. It is a recombinant vaccine manufactured without eggs. Flublok is approved for people age 18 and older and is not limited to seniors. Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine The adjuvanted flu vaccine contains the same level of antigens as the standard flu but has an extra ingredient (an adjuvant) to trigger a stronger immune response. Fluad Quadrivalent is the only adjuvanted flu vaccine available for the current flu season. It contains four influenza strains and is currently only approved for people 65 and older. Research in seniors shows the adjuvanted flu vaccine is more effective than the standard flu shot, helps to prevent complications and hospitalizations, and also appears to provide longer protection. Which Flu Shot Is Best for Seniors? According to the CDC, the best flu shots for people over age 65 are Fluzone, Flublok, and Fluad. Known as senior flu shots, the CDC gives no preference to one over another.A 2023 study found high-dose vaccines offer slightly stronger immunity than adjuvanted ones, though the difference was not statistically significant. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist to determine which flu vaccine is best for you. Why You Should Get the Senior Flu Shot People 65 and older are at the highest risk for complications from influenza. About half of flu-related hospitalizations and up to 85% of flu-related deaths are in this age group. Getting an annual senior flu shot is critical to prevent complications. A person's protection wanes over time, and each year the vaccine is tailored to the most prominent flu strains. However, research shows people over age 65 often have weaker immune responses to the vaccine than younger people. The exact reason for this is unclear, but investigators suspect two factors hinder seniors' response to the flu vaccine: Pre-existing antibodies from prior flu seasonsChronic inflammation from arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, or other underlying health conditions Senior flu shots address these issues to promote a stronger immune response and boost effectiveness. In fact, studies show the high-dose flu vaccine offers seniors 24% more protection against the flu than the standard flu vaccine. Prevent Flu Complications Both high-dose and adjuvanted flu shots provide seniors with better protection against complications from the flu. Compared to standard vaccines, senior flu shots reduce flu-related hospitalizations and death. The flu can cause serious complications that require immediate medical care, including: Difficulty breathingChest or abdominal pain or pressureDizziness or confusionSeizuresSevere pain, weakness, or unsteadinessNot urinating or other signs of dehydrationSymptoms that get better, then worse againWorsening chronic medical conditions What Flu Vaccines Should Seniors Avoid? Seniors should not be given the nasal spray vaccine. The live, intranasal influenza vaccine is not approved for use in adults over 50. Seniors should also avoid getting the standard flu shot unless higher-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines are not available. When Should Seniors Get a Flu Shot? The best time for seniors to get the flu shot is late September through the end of October. This helps to ensure your body has enough time (about two weeks) to build immunity before the holidays when flu activity starts to ramp up. Seniors are advised against getting the flu shot too early in the season. The vaccine's protection fades faster in seniors. An August vaccination could lose effectiveness before the end of flu season. Still, a late flu shot is better than none at all. If you didn't get your annual influenza vaccine by the end of October, you can still get it in November or December. What Are the Side Effects of the Senior Flu Shot? The extra protection offered by senior flu shots is also more likely to cause side effects than standard flu shots. For the most part, side effects of the senior flu shot are mild to moderate and only last a few days. Senior flu shot side effects can include: FatigueHeadachesInjection site pain and rednessMalaiseMuscle aches Rates of side effects vary among the different senior flu shots, as follows: Fluad: Injection site pain (16.3%), headache (10.8%), and fatigue (10.5%)Flublok: Injection site tenderness (34%), injection site pain (19%), headache (13%,) and fatigue Injection myalgia (18%), headache (13%), and malaise (11%) Summary The CDC recommends more potent influenza vaccines for people over 65. Also called senior flu shots, these vaccines are specially formulated for aging immune systems. Seniors have a higher risk of complications and death from the flu and tend to have a lower response to standard flu shots. The three flu vaccines preferentially recommended for seniors are the high-dose Fluzone and Flublok and an adjuvanted flu vaccine Fluad. Studies show these more powerful vaccines provide enhanced immune protection for seniors. They also decrease flu-related hospitalizations and deaths compared to standard flu shots. Side effects of senior flu shots are often mild and may include pain and redness at the injection site, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. 17 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
