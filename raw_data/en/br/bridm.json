The phoning of potential subjects is performed by our CRCs, as is the consent process. Subjects/families are not pressured in any way to join any trial. My payments for these activities, therefore, do not influence which trial a patient enters, nor how I manage patients within certain industry-sponsored trials. First and foremost are the interests and safety of my patients and their families, as it should be with any study I am conducting, whether or not I, the hospital, or university received funds for doing them or for consulting activities. COI are also always disclosed on any slide presentations I do - both CE and non-CE events - and are in the consent forms for these studies. Of note, I also participate in trials with other investigational products for food immunotherapy - we do not discriminate one product over another, as we want choices for our patients and families; ultimately the patients and families choose which trial to participate in, not us. For slide presentations, per rules of my University, these slide sets are not done with any company logo, and I have to have complete editorial control of content. Magdalena M.

This resulted in a publication in Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Feb 2018, Volume 120(2). Clinical medical advisory board membership has a similar goal but in an ongoing relationship. Aimmune relationship involved answering investor questions regarding topline phase 3 data presented during the 2018 AAAAI meeting. To mitigate any conflict, all discussions about food allergy therapy will include only modalities rather than companies or product names. In addition, all discussions will be based on published or publicly available data and provide a balanced view of all therapies. Regarding research funding, FARE has provided grant funding for a study in peanut sublingual immunotherapy. UNC is the sponsor of the study and the study is fully conducted by us. Other grant sources have the standard grant/grantee relationship. Bruce J.
