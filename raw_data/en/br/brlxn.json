Clear Quartz Vogel Crystals is a healing crystal explicitly programmed to project healing energy 'Prana'. Clear Quartz crystals are an excellent tool for Pranic Healers and, when used during Pranic Healing treatments, increase the rate of healing energy by 50 to 100%, Helping the body, mind & soul recover natural 60 minutes $100 This treatment works with traumas or events in your life that have left emotional or physical pain that you feel is making it hard to move forward in your life! Every cell has the capability for information, action, power and communication. A person can endeavour to think positively, but at the subconscious level, stored deep within the cell's consciousness, is the residual harmful program continuously passed on to the new cells, thus, sustaining unease. Pranic healing can touch and positively affect the inner workings of the cells as there is a bridge between ordinary reality and spiritual reality. We can alter the cellular environment and erase negative cellular memories, removing the energetic and physical information present in the cells with Pranic Healing. Thus, the cell has no negative news to transfer to the new cells. 60 minutes $100 Reiki treatment is excellent if you want to relax & experience spiritual energy and follow a traditional pattern of hand positions, resting without pressure on or above the body; Reiki is pure energy and brings about deep relaxation and healing.
