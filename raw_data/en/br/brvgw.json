INTRODUCTION 1.1 Objectives of the Guideline The purpose of this document is to recommend intern ational standards for, and promote harmonisation of, the nonclinical safety studies re commended to support human clinical trials of a given scope and duration as well as mar keting authorization for pharmaceuticals. Harmonisation of the guidance for nonclinical safet y studies will help to define the current recommendations and reduce the likelihood t hat substantial differences will exist among regions. This guidance should facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/re place) principles and reduce the use of other drug development resources. Although not discussed in this guidance, consideration should be given to use of new in vitro alternative methods for safety evaluation. These methods, if validated and accept ed by all ICH regulatory authorities, can be used to replace current standard methods. This guidance promotes safe, ethical development an d availability of new pharmaceuticals. 1.2 Background The recommendations of this revised guidance furthe r harmonise the nonclinical safety studies to support the various stages of clinical d evelopment among the regions of European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States. The present guidance represents the consensus that exists regarding the type and du ration of nonclinical safety studies and their timing to support the conduct of human cl inical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals. 1.3 Scope of the Guideline The nonclinical safety assessment for marketing app roval of a pharmaceutical usually includes pharmacology studies, general toxicity stu dies, toxicokinetic and nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies, reproduction toxicity stud ies, genotoxicity studies and, for drugs that have special cause for concern or are in tended for a long duration of use, an assessment of carcinogenic potential. Other noncli nical studies to assess phototoxicity, immunotoxicity, juvenile animal toxicity and abuse liability should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The need for nonclinical safet y studies and their relation to the conduct of human clinical trials is delineated in t his guidance. This document applies to the situations usually enc ountered during the development of pharmaceuticals and should be viewed as general gui dance for drug development. Nonclinical safety studies and human clinical trial s should be planned and designed to represent an approach that is scientifically and et hically appropriate. For biotechnology-derived products (as defined in R ef. 1), appropriate nonclinical safety studies should be determined in accordance with ICH S6. For these products, ICH Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 2M3(R2) only provides guidance with regard to timing of nonclinical studies relative to clinical development. Pharmaceuticals under development for indications i n life-threatening or serious diseases (e.g., advanced cancer, resistant HIV infe ction, and congenital enzyme deficiency diseases) without current effective ther apy also warrant a case-by-case approach to both the toxicological evaluation and c linical development in order to optimise and expedite drug development. In these c ases and for products using innovative therapeutic modalities (e.g., siRNA), as well as vaccine adjuvants, particular studies can be abbreviated, deferred, omitted, or a dded. Where ICH guidances for specific product areas exist, they should be consul ted. 1.4 General Principles The development of a pharmaceutical is a stepwise p rocess involving an evaluation of both animal and human efficacy and safety informati on. The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterisat ion of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exp osure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility. This information is used to estimate an initial safe starting dose and dose range for the human trials and to identify parameters for clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects. The nonclinical saf ety studies, although usually limited at the beginning of clinical development, should be ad equate to characterise potential adverse effects that might occur under the conditio ns of the clinical trial to be supported. Human clinical trials are conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical, starting with a relatively low syst emic exposure in a small number of subjects. This is followed by clinical trials in w hich exposure to the pharmaceutical usually increases by duration and/or size of the ex posed patient population. Clinical trials should be extended based on the demonstratio n of adequate safety in the previous clinical trial(s), as well as on additional nonclin ical safety information that becomes available as clinical development proceeds. Serious adverse clinical or nonclinical findings ca n influence the continuation of clinical trials. Within the overall clinical context, these findings should be evaluated to determine the appropriateness and design of additio nal nonclinical and/or clinical studies. Clinical trials are conducted in phases for which d ifferent terminology has been utilised in the various regions. This document generally us es the terminology as defined in the ICH E8 guideline (Ref. 2). However, as there is a growing trend to merge phases of clinical development, in some cases this document a lso relates the nonclinical studies to the duration and size of clinical trials and the ch aracteristics of the subjects included. 1.5 High Dose Selection for General Toxicity Studie s Generally, in toxicity studies, effects that are po tentially clinically relevant can be adequately characterized using doses up to the maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD). It is not essential to demonstrate the MTD in every study. Ot her equally appropriate limiting doses include those that achieve large exposure mul tiples or saturation of exposure or use the maximum feasible dose (MFD). These limit d oses (see additional details below and Figure 1) prevent the use of doses in animals t hat would not add value to predicting clinical safety. These recommendations are consiste nt with those for reproduction and carcinogenicity study designs that already have def ined limit doses and/or exposures (Refs. 3 and 4). Limit doses for acute, subchronic, and chronic toxi city studies of 1000 mg/kg/day for rodents and non-rodents are considered appropriate in all cases except those discussed Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 3below. In the few situations where a dose of 1000 m g/kg/day does not result in a mean exposure margin of 10-fold to the clinical exposure and the clinical dose exceeds 1 g per day, then the doses in the toxicity studies should be limited by a 10-fold exposure margin or a dose of 2000 mg/kg/day or the MFD, whichever i s lower. In those rare situations in which the dose of 2000 mg/kg/day results in an expo sure that is less than the clinical exposure, a higher dose up to the MFD can be consid ered. Doses providing a 50-fold margin of exposure (usual ly based on group mean AUC values [see Note 1] of the parent drug or the pharmacologi cally active molecule of a pro-drug) to the clinical systemic exposure generally are also c onsidered acceptable as the maximum dose for acute and repeated-dose toxicity studies i n any species. To support Phase III clinical trials for the United States, dose-limiting toxicity generally should be identified in at least one species when u sing the 50-fold margin of exposure as the limit dose. If this is not the case, a study o f one-month or longer duration in one species that is conducted at the 1000 mg/kg limit d ose, MFD or MTD, whichever is lowest, is recommended. However, on a case-by-case basis this study might not be warranted if a study of a shorter duration identifi es dose-limiting toxicity at doses higher than those resulting in a 50-fold exposure m argin. If genotoxicity endpoints are to be incorporated in to a general toxicity study, then an appropriate maximum dose should be selected based o n a MFD, MTD or limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.

PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES Safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic (PD) studie s are defined in ICH S7A (Ref. 5). The core battery of safety pharmacology studies inc ludes the assessment of effects on cardiovascular, central nervous and respiratory sys tems, and should generally be conducted before human exposure, in accordance with ICH S7A and S7B (Refs. 5 and 6). When warranted, supplemental and follow-up safety p harmacology studies can be conducted during later clinical development. Consi deration should be given to inclusion of any in vivo evaluations as additions to general toxicity studi es, to the extent feasible, in order to reduce animal use. In addition, primary PD studies ( in vivo and/or in vitro ) are intended to investigate the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in rel ation to its desired therapeutic target. Such studies are generally conducted during the dis covery phase of pharmaceutical development and as such, are not generally conducte d in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). These studies can contr ibute to dose selection for both nonclinical and clinical studies. 3. TOXICOKINETIC AND PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES In vitro metabolic and plasma protein binding data for anim als and humans and systemic exposure data (ICH S3A, Ref. 7) in the spe cies used for repeated-dose toxicity studies generally should be evaluated before initia ting human clinical trials. Further information on pharmacokinetics (PK) (e.g., absorpt ion, distribution, metabolism and excretion), in test species and in vitro biochemical information relevant to potential drug interactions should be available before exposing la rge numbers of human subjects or treating for long duration (generally before Phase III). These data can be used to compare human and animal metabolites and for determ ining if any additional testing is warranted. Nonclinical characterization of a human metabolite( s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies. Such studies should be conducted to support Phase III clinical trials. For drugs for which the daily administered dose is <10 mg, greater fractions of the drug related material might be more appropriate triggers for testing. Some metabolites are not of toxicological concern (e.g., most glutathion e conjugates) and do not warrant testing. The nonclinical characterization of metabo lites with an identified cause for concern (e.g., a unique human metabolite) should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 4. ACUTE TOXICITY STUDIES Historically, acute toxicity information has been o btained from single-dose toxicity studies in two mammalian species using both the cli nical and a parenteral route of administration. However, such information can be o btained from appropriately conducted dose-escalation studies or short-duration dose-ranging studies that define an MTD in the general toxicity test species (Refs. 8 a nd 9). When this acute toxicity information is available f rom any study, separate single-dose studies are not recommended. Studies providing acu te toxicity information can be limited to the clinical route only and such data ca n be obtained from non-GLP studies if clinical administration is supported by appropriate GLP repeated-dose toxicity studies. Lethality should not be an intended endpoint in stu dies assessing acute toxicity. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 6In some specific situations (e.g., microdose trials ; see Section 7) acute toxicity or single- dose studies can be the primary support for studies in humans. In these situations, the high dose selection can be different from that desc ribed in Section 1.5 but should be appropriate for supporting the intended clinical do se and route. These studies should be performed in compliance with GLP. Information on the acute toxicity of pharmaceutical agents could be useful to predict the consequences of human overdose situations and shoul d be available to support Phase III. An earlier assessment of acute toxicity could be im portant for therapeutic indications for which patient populations are at higher risk for ov erdosing (e.g., depression, pain, and dementia) in out-patient clinical trials. 5. REPEATED-DOSE TOXICITY STUDIES The recommended duration of the repeated-dose toxic ity studies is usually related to the duration, therapeutic indication and scope of the p roposed clinical trial. In principle, the duration of the animal toxicity studies conducted i n two mammalian species (one non- rodent) should be equal to or exceed the duration o f the human clinical trials up to the maximum recommended duration of the repeated-dose t oxicity studies (Table 1). Limit doses/exposures that are considered appropriate in repeated-dose toxicity studies are described in Section 1.5. In circumstances where significant therapeutic gain has been shown, trials can be extended beyond the duration of supportive repeated -dose toxicity studies on a case-by- case basis. 5.1 Clinical Development Trials Repeated-dose toxicity studies in two species (one non-rodent) for a minimum duration of 2 weeks (Table 1) would generally support any clini cal development trial up to 2 weeks in duration. Clinical trials of longer duration sho uld be supported by repeated-dose toxicity studies of at least equivalent duration. Six month rodent and 9 month non- rodent studies generally support dosing for longer than 6 months in clinical trials (for exceptions see Table 1 footnotes). Table 1 Recommended Duration of Repeated-Dose Toxic ity Studies to Support the Conduct of Clinical Trials Maximum Duration of Clinical Trial Recommended Minimum Duration of Repeated-Dose Toxicity Studies to Support Clinical Trials Rodents Non-rodents Up to 2 weeks 2 weeks a 2 weeks a Between 2 weeks and 6 months Same as clinical trial b Same as clinical trial b > 6 months 6 months b, c 9 months b, c, d a. In the United States, as an alternative to 2 week s tudies, extended single-dose toxicity studies (see footnote c in Table 3) can support single-dose human trials. Clinical studies of less than 14 days can be suppor ted with toxicity studies of the same duration as the proposed clinical study. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 7b. In some circumstances clinical trials of longer dur ation than 3 months can be initiated, provided that the data are available fro m a 3-month rodent and a 3- month non-rodent study, and that complete data from the chronic rodent and non-rodent study are made available, consistent wit h local clinical trial regulatory procedures, before extending dosing beyo nd 3 months in the clinical trial. For serious or life-threatening indications or on a case-by-case basis, this extension can be supported by complete chronic rode nt data and in-life and necropsy data for the non-rodent study. Complete hi stopathology data from the non-rodent should be available within an additional 3 months. c. There can be cases where a pediatric population is the primary population, and existing animal studies (toxicology or pharmacology ) have identified potential developmental concerns for target organs. In these cases, long-term toxicity testing starting in juvenile animals can be appropr iate in some circumstances (see Section 12). d. In the EU, studies of 6 months duration in non-rode nts are considered acceptable. However, where studies with a longer duration have been conducted, it is not appropriate to conduct an additional study of 6 mon ths. The following are examples where non-rodent studies of up to 6 months duration can also be appropriate for Japan and the United St ates: When immunogenicity or intolerance confounds conduc t of longer term studies. Repeated short-term drug exposure even if clinical trial duration exceeds 6 months, such as intermittent treatment of migraine, erectile dysfunction, or herpes simplex. Drugs administered on a chronic basis to reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer. Drugs for indications for which life expectancy is short. 5.2 Marketing Authorization Because of the size of the population at risk and t he relatively less controlled conditions in clinical practice in contrast to clinical trials , longer durations of nonclinical testing can be valuable. The durations of repeated-dose tox icity studies to support marketing for different treatment durations are outlined in Table 2. However, for a small number of conditions in which the indicated use is between 2 weeks and 3 months, but for which there is extensive clinical experience suggesting b oth widespread and long-term use beyond that recommended (e.g., anxiety, seasonal al lergic rhinitis, pain), the duration of testing might more appropriately be equivalent to t hat recommended for treatment of greater than 3 months.

ESTIMATION OF THE FIRST DOSE IN HUMAN The estimation of the first dose in humans is an im portant element to safeguard subjects participating in first-in-human studies. All of th e relevant nonclinical data, including the pharmacological dose response, the pharmacologi cal/toxicological profile, and pharmacokinetics, should be considered when determi ning the recommended starting dose in humans. In general, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (N OAEL) determined in nonclinical safety studies performed in the most appropriate an imal species gives the most important information. The proposed clinical start ing dose will also depend on various factors, including PD, particular aspects of the mo lecule, and the design of the clinical trials. See available regional guidance for specif ic approaches that can be used. Exploratory clinical trials (see Section 7) in huma ns can be initiated with less, or different, nonclinical support than is generally wa rranted for clinical development trials (see Section 5.1); therefore, the estimation of the clinical starting (and maximal) dose can differ. The recommended criteria for starting dose s for various exploratory clinical trial designs are described in Table 3. 7. EXPLORATORY CLINICAL TRIALS It is recognized that in some cases earlier access to human data can provide improved insight into human physiology/pharmacology, knowled ge of drug candidate characteristics and therapeutic target relevance to disease. Streamlined early exploratory approaches can accomplish this end. Ex ploratory clinical studies for the purpose of this guidance are those intended to be c onducted early in Phase I, involve limited human exposure, have no therapeutic intent, and are not intended to examine clinical tolerability. They can be used to investi gate a variety of parameters such as PK, PD and other biomarkers, which could include PET re ceptor binding and displacement or other diagnostic measures. The subjects included in these studies can be patients from selected populations or healthy individuals. The amount and type of nonclinical supporting data that is appropriate in these situations will be dependent on the extent of propo sed human exposure, both with respect to the maximum clinical dose used and the d uration of dosing. Five different examples of exploratory clinical approaches are sum marized below and in more detail in Table 3, together with the nonclinical testing prog rams that would be recommended in these particular approaches. However, alternative approaches not described in this guidance can also be used, including strategies to support biotechnology-derived Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 9products. It is recommended that these alternative approaches be discussed and agreed upon with the appropriate regulatory authority. Th e use of any of these approaches can reduce overall animal use in drug development. Recommended starting doses and maximal doses for th e five approaches are included in Table 3. In all cases, characterization of PD and pharmacology using in vivo and/or in vitro models as noted in Table 3 and Section 2 is import ant and should be used in support of human dose selection. 7.1 Microdose Trials Two different microdose approaches are described be low with details provided in Table 3. The first approach would involve not more than a to tal dose of 100 \u00b5g that can be administered as a single dose or divided doses in a ny subject. This could be useful to investigate target receptor binding or tissue distr ibution in a PET study. A second use could be to assess PK with or without the use of an isotopically labelled agent. A second microdose approach is one that involves < 5 administrations of a maximum of 100 \u00b5g per administration (a total of 500 \u00b5g per subject). This can be useful for applications similar to the first microdose approac h described above, but with less active PET ligands. In some situations it could be appropriate to carry out a clinical microdose study using the i.v. route on a product intended for oral admin istration and for which an oral nonclinical toxicology package already exists. In this case the i.v. microdose can be qualified by the existing oral toxicity studies as described in Table 1 or Table 3, Approach 3, where adequate exposure margins have be en achieved. It is not recommended to investigate i.v. local tolerance of the drug substance in this situation because the administered dose is very low (100 \u00b5g m aximum). If a novel i.v. vehicle is being employed then local tolerance of the vehicle should be assessed. 7.2 Single-Dose Trials at Sub-therapeutic Doses or into the Anticipated Therapeutic Range The third approach involves a single-dose clinical study typically starting at subtherapeutic doses and possibly escalating into t he pharmacological or anticipated therapeutic range (see Table 3). The maximum allow able dose should be based on the nonclinical data, but could be further limited base d on emerging clinical information obtained during the course of the study. This appr oach could allow, for example, determination of PK parameters with non-radiolabele d drug at or near the predicted pharmacodynamically active dose. Another example co uld be assessment of target engagement or pharmacology after a single dose. Thi s approach is not intended to support the determination of the maximum tolerated clinical dose (see exception, Table 1, footnote a). 7.3 Multiple Dose Trials Two different nonclinical approaches (numbers 4 and 5) to support multiple dose clinical trials are provided in Table 3. These approaches su pport up to 14 days of dosing for determination of PK and PD in human in the therapeu tic dose range, but are not intended to support the determination of maximum to lerated clinical dose. Approach 4 involves 2-week repeated-dose toxicity s tudies in rodents and non-rodents where dose selection in animals is based on exposur e multiples of anticipated AUC at the maximum clinical dose. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 10 Approach 5 involves a 2-week toxicity study in a ro dent species and a confirmatory non- rodent study that is designed to investigate whethe r the NOAEL in the rodent is also not a toxic dose in the non-rodent. If toxic effects ar e observed in the non-rodent at the rodent NOAEL exposure, clinical administration shou ld be deferred until further nonclinical studies in this species have been condu cted (usually a standard toxicity study (see Section 5)).

Maximal and starting doses can be the same but not exceed a total accumulated dose of 100 \u00b5g. In vitro target/ receptor profiling should be conducted. Appropriate characterization of primary pharmacology (mode of action and/or effects) in a pharmacodynamically relevant model should be available to support human dose selection. Extended single dose toxicity study (see footnotes c and d in one species, usually rodent, by intended route of administration with toxicokinetic data, or via the i.v. route. A maximum dose of 1000-fold the clinical dose on a mg/kg basis for i.v. and mg/m 2 for oral administration can be used. Genotoxicity studies are not recommended, but any studies or SAR assessments conducted should be included in the clinical trial application. For highly radioactive agents (e.g., PET imaging agents), appropriate PK and dosimetry estimates should be submitted. Approach 2: Total cumulative dose 500 \u00b5g, maximum of 5 administrations with a washout between doses (6 or more actual or predicted half-lives) AND each dose 100 \u00b5g AND each dose 1/100 th of the NOAEL and 1/100 th of the pharmacologically active dose. Maximal daily and starting doses can be the same, but not exceed 100 \u00b5g. In vitro target/receptor profiling should be conducted. Appropriate characterization of primary pharmacology (mode of action and/or effects) in a pharmacodynamically relevant model should be available to support human dose selection. 7-day repeated-dose toxicity study in one species, usually rodent, by intended route of administration with toxicokinetic data, or via the i.v. route. Hematology, clinical chemistry, necropsy, and histopathology data should be included. A maximum dose of 1000-fold the clinical dose on a mg/kg basis for i.v. and mg/m 2 for oral administration can be used. Genotoxicity studies are not recommended, but any studies or SAR assessments conducted should be included in the clinical trial application. For highly radioactive agents (e.g., PET imaging agents), appropriate PK and dosimetry estimates should be submitted.

Starting dose should be based on the types of toxicity findings observed in the most sensitive species and a consideration of the pharmacologically active dose. For other considerations on initial dosing in humans, regional guidances should be consulted. Maximum dose can be that yielding up to \u00bd NOAEL exposure in the more sensitive species, in cases where any relevant toxicity observed in animals is anticipated to be monitorable and reversible in humans.

With toxicity in both species, follow appropriate regional guidance for clinical starting dose. If toxicity is not seen in either species (i.e., the NOAELs are the highest dose tested and doses used were not otherwise limited, e.g., not an MFD), or is seen only in one species, the clinical starting dose should be one that gives a predicted clinical AUC value (based on either interspecies PK modelling or mg/m 2 conversion) that is approximately 1/50th of the AUC at the NOAEL from the species yielding the lower exposure. For other considerations on initial dosing in humans, e.g., predicted PD activity, regional guidance should be consulted. Without toxicity in both species, it is recommended that the maximum clinical dose not exceed 1/10 th the lower exposure (AUC) in either species at the highest dose tested in the animals. When only one species demonstrates toxicity, the maximum clinical dose should In vitro target/receptor profiling should be conducted.

With toxicity in both species, the maximum clinical dose should be based on standard risk assessment approaches and, in this specific case, the clinical MTD can be explored.

Starting dose predicted exposures should not exceed 1/50 th the NOAEL in the more sensitive species on a mg/m 2 basis. For other considerations on initial dosing in humans, regional guidance should be consulted. The maximum exposure in humans should not be higher than the AUC at the NOAEL in the non-rodent species or higher than \u00bd the AUC at the NOAEL in the rodent species, whichever is lower e. In vitro target/receptor profiling should be conducted Appropriate characterization of primary pharmacology (mode of action and/or effects) in a pharmacodynamically relevant model should be available to support human dose selection. Core battery of safety pharmacology (see Section 2) using doses similar to those used for the toxicity studies. Standard 2-week repeated-dose toxicity study in rodents (with justification of the rodent as an appropriate species). The top dose should be the MTD, MFD or limit dose (see Section 1.5). Confirmatory study in non-rodent (n=3) at the anticipated NOAEL exposure in rodent, with duration of a minimum of 3 days and at least the intended clinical study duration. Alternatively, an escalating dose study in the non-rodent with duration of a minimum of 3 days and at least the intended clinical study duration at the anticipated NOAEL exposure in the rodent. Ames assay (or an appropriate alternative assay if Ames is inappropriate, for example, for an antibacterial product) and an assay ( in vitro or in vivo ) capable of detecting chromosomal damage in a mammalian system.

Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 16 a. General toxicity studies should be conducted accor ding to GLP regulations. b. See Ref. 10 for genotoxicity study design and dose selection. c. Generally, extended single dose toxicity studies sh ould be designed to evaluate hematology, clinical c hemistry, necropsy, and histopathology data (control and high dose only if no treatment-related pathology is seen at the high dose) after a single administration, with further evaluations conducted 2 weeks later to assess delayed toxicity and/or rec overy. The usual design for rodents consists of 10 animals/sex/group to be asse ssed on the day following dosing, and 5 animals/sex at the dose level(s) selected to be assessed on day 14 post-dose. The usual desig n for non-rodents consists of 3/sex/group for all g roups on day 2 and 2/sex for the dose level(s) assessed on day 14. d. A single dose level to assess reversibility/delayed toxicity on day 14 can support the microdose appro ach. The dose level used need not be the high dose but should be a dose that is a t least 100 times the clinical dose. e. In the absence of adverse effects in the clinical t rial, escalation above this AUC can be appropriate if the findings in the toxicity studies are anticipated to be monitorable, reversib le, and of low severity in humans. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 17 8. LOCAL TOLERANCE STUDIES It is preferable to evaluate local tolerance by the intended therapeutic route as part of the general toxicity studies; stand alone studies a re generally not recommended. To support limited human administration by non-ther apeutic routes (e.g., a single i.v. dose to assist in the determination of absolute bio availability of an oral drug), a single dose local tolerance study in a single species is c onsidered appropriate. In cases where the anticipated systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) from the non-therapeutic administration is covered by the existing toxicolog y package, the endpoints in the local tolerance study can be confined to clinical signs a nd macroscopic and microscopic examination of the application site. The formulatio n delivered for local tolerance need not be identical but should be similar to the clini cal formulation. For an i.v. microdose study that is supported by an oral toxicology package (see Section 7), evaluation of local tolerance of the drug subst ance is not warranted. If a novel i.v. vehicle is being employed, then local tolerance of the vehicle should be assessed. For parenteral products, evaluation for local toler ance at unintended injection sites, when appropriate, should be conducted before exposu re of large numbers of patients (e.g., Phase III clinical trials). The approach to such studies differs in the various regions. Such studies are generally not recommende d in the United States (an example of an exception would be intrathecal for the epidur al route). Japan and the EU recommend single dose paravenous administration for the i.v. route. Other parenteral routes should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 9. GENOTOXICITY STUDIES An assay for gene mutation is generally considered sufficient to support all single dose clinical development trials. To support multiple d ose clinical development trials, an additional assessment capable of detecting chromoso mal damage in a mammalian system(s) should be completed (Ref. 10). A complete battery of tests for genotoxicity should be completed before initiation of Phase II t rials (Ref. 10). If a positive finding occurs, an assessment, and th en possibly additional testing (Ref. 10), should be conducted to determine if further adminis tration to humans is still appropriate. The genotoxicity studies recommended to support Exp loratory Clinical Study approaches are discussed in Section 7. 10. CARCINOGENICITY STUDIES Conditions relevant for carcinogenicity testing are discussed in the ICH S1A document (Ref. 11). If carcinogenicity studies are recommend ed for the clinical indication, they should be conducted to support the marketing applic ation. Only in circumstances where there is a significant cause for concern for carcin ogenic risk should the study results be submitted to support clinical trials. A long clini cal study duration alone is not considered to be a significant cause for concern. For pharmaceuticals developed to treat certain seri ous diseases for adults or pediatric patients, carcinogenicity testing, if recommended, can be concluded post-approval. 11. REPRODUCTION TOXICITY STUDIES Reproduction toxicity studies (Ref. 3) should be co nducted as is appropriate for the population that is to be exposed. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 18 11.1 Men Men can be included in Phase I and II trials before the conduct of the male fertility study since an evaluation of the male reproductive organs is performed in the repeated-dose toxicity studies (Note 2). A male fertility study (Ref. 3) should be completed before the initiation of large scale or long duration clinical trials (e.g., Phase III tria ls). 11.2 Women Not of Childbearing Potential Women not of childbearing potential (i.e., permanen tly sterilised, postmenopausal) can be included in clinical trials without reproduction toxicity studies if the relevant repeated-dose toxicity studies (which include an ev aluation of the female reproductive organs) have been conducted. Postmenopausal is def ined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. 11.3 Women of Childbearing Potential For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) there i s a high level of concern for the unintentional exposure of an embryo or fetus before information is available concerning the potential benefits versus potential risks. The recommendations on timing of reproduction toxicity studies to support the inclus ion of WOCBP in clinical trials are similar in all ICH regions. It is important to characterize and minimize the ri sk of unintentional exposure of the embryo or fetus when including WOCBP in clinical tr ials. One approach to achieve this objective is to conduct reproduction toxicity studi es to characterize the inherent risk of a drug and take appropriate precautions during exposu re of WOCBP in clinical trials. A second approach is to limit the risk by taking prec autions to prevent pregnancy during clinical trials. Precautions to prevent pregnancy i nclude pregnancy testing (e.g., based on the -subunit of HCG), use of highly effective methods o f birth control (Note 3), and study entry only after a confirmed menstrual period . Testing for pregnancy during the trial and subject education should be sufficient to ensure compliance with the measures designed to prevent pregnancy during the period of drug exposure (which could exceed the length of study). To support these approaches, informed consent should be based on any known pertinent information related to reproduc tion toxicity, such as a general assessment of potential toxicity of pharmaceuticals with related structures or pharmacological effects. If no relevant reproductiv e information is available, the potential for unidentified risks to the embryo or f etus should be communicated. In all ICH regions, WOCBP can be included in early clinical trials without non-clinical developmental toxicity studies (e.g., embryo-fetal studies) in certain circumstances. One circumstance could be intensive control of pregnanc y risk over short duration (e.g., 2 weeks) clinical trials. Another circumstance could be where there is a predominance of the disease in women and the objectives of the clin ical trial cannot be effectively met without inclusion of WOCBP and there are sufficient precautions to prevent pregnancy (see above). Additional considerations for the conduct of studie s in WOCBP without the non-clinical developmental toxicity studies include knowledge of the mechanism of action of the agent, the type of pharmaceutical agent, the extent of fetal exposure or the difficulty of conducting developmental toxicity studies in an app ropriate animal model. For example, for monoclonal antibodies for which embryo-fetal ex posure during organogenesis is understood to be low in humans based on current sci entific knowledge, the Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 19 developmental toxicity studies can be conducted dur ing Phase III. The completed reports should be submitted with the marketing application. Generally, where appropriate preliminary reproducti on toxicity data are available (see Note 4) from two species, and where precautions to prevent pregnancy in clinical trials (see above) are used, inclusion of WOCBP (up to 150 ) receiving investigational treatment for a relatively short duration (up to 3 months) ca n occur before conduct of definitive reproduction toxicity testing. This is based on the very low rate of pregnancy in controlled clinical trials of this size and duratio n (see Note 5), and the ability of adequately designed preliminary studies to detect m ost developmental toxicity findings that could raise concern for enrolment of WOCBP in clinical trials. The number of WOCBP and the duration of the study can be influenc ed by characteristics of the population that alter pregnancy rates (e.g., age, d isease). In the United States, assessment of embryo-fetal de velopment can be deferred until before Phase III for WOCBP using precautions to pre vent pregnancy in clinical trials (see above). In the EU and Japan, other than the s ituations described in the above paragraphs, definitive nonclinical developmental to xicity studies should be completed before exposure of WOCBP. In all ICH regions, WOCBP can be included in repeat ed-dose Phase I and II trials before conduct of the female fertility study since an eval uation of the female reproductive organs is performed in the repeated-dose toxicity s tudies (Note 2). Nonclinical studies that specifically address female fertility (Ref. 3) should be completed to support inclusion of WOCBP in large-scale or long-duration clinical t rials (e.g., Phase III trials). In all ICH regions, the pre-postnatal development s tudy should be submitted for marketing approval. All female reproduction toxicity studies (Ref. 3) a nd the standard battery of genotoxicity tests (Ref. 10) should be completed before inclusio n, in any clinical trial, of WOCBP not using highly effective birth control (see Note 3) o r whose pregnancy status is unknown. 11.4 Pregnant Women Before the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials, all female reproduction toxicity studies (Refs. 3) and the standard battery of genot oxicity tests (Ref. 10) should be conducted. In addition, safety data from previous human exposure should be evaluated. 12. CLINICAL TRIALS IN PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS When pediatric patients are included in clinical tr ials, safety data from previous adult human experience would usually represent the most r elevant information and should generally be available before initiation of pediatr ic clinical trials. The appropriateness and extent of adult human data should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Extensive adult experience might not be available before pedi atric exposures (e.g., for pediatric- specific indications). Results from repeated-dose toxicity studies of appr opriate duration in adult animals (see Table 1), the core safety pharmacology package, and the standard battery of genotoxicity tests should be available before initiation of tria ls in pediatric populations. Reproduction toxicity studies relevant to the age a nd gender of the pediatric patient populations under study can also be important to pr ovide information on direct toxic or developmental risks (e.g., fertility and pre-postna tal developmental studies). Embryo- fetal developmental studies are not critical to sup port clinical studies for males or prepubescent females. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 20 The conduct of any juvenile animal toxicity studies should be considered only when previous animal data and human safety data, includi ng effects from other drugs of the pharmacological class, are judged to be insufficien t to support pediatric studies. If a study is warranted, one relevant species, preferabl y rodent, is generally considered adequate. A study in a non-rodent species can be ap propriate when scientifically justified. Generally, juvenile animal toxicity studies are not considered important for short-term PK studies (e.g., 1 to 3 doses) in pediatric popula tions. Depending on the therapeutic indication, age of the pediatric population, and safety data from adult animal and human exposure, the appropria teness of obtaining juvenile animal study results before initiation of short-dur ation multiple-dose efficacy and safety trials should be considered. The age of the trial p articipants in relation to the duration of the clinical study (i.e., the fraction of a develop mental period of concern during which clinical study participants are exposed) is among t he most important considerations. This evaluation can determine whether juvenile anim al studies are warranted and, if warranted, their timing in relation to clinical tri als. For long-term clinical trials in pediatric populati ons when an assessment of juvenile animal toxicity is recommended, the nonclinical stu dies should be completed before the initiation of the trials. There can be cases where a pediatric population is the primary population and existing animal studies have identified potential developmen tal concerns for target organs (toxicology or pharmacology). In some of these case s long-term juvenile animal toxicity testing can be appropriate. A chronic study initia ted in the appropriate age and species with the relevant end points to address this develo pmental concern (e.g., 12 months duration in dog or 6 month in rodent) can be approp riate. A 12-month study can cover the full development period in the dog. For either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study an d a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances. The appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing sho uld be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, un less there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or finding s from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to supp ort the conduct of pediatric clinical trials. 13. IMMUNOTOXICITY As stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxici ty using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of- evidence review, including immune-related signals f rom standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, th ese should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., P hase III). 14. PHOTOSAFETY TESTING The appropriateness or timing of photosafety testin g in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: 1) the photochemical prope rties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule; 2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds; 3) tissue distribution; and 4) c linical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 21 An initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug's photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be perfor med. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indic ates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective me asures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequ ent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropr iate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo , or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be un dertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (Phase III). Alternatively, instead of the above stepwise approa ch, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studie s and clinical protective measures are not called for. If the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potenti al photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protec tive measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical tria ls and in product information for marketing (Note 6). 15. NONCLINICAL ABUSE LIABILITY For drugs that produce central nervous system activ ity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the d esign of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduc t of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specifi c abuse liability packages. Nonclinical data collected early in the drug develo pment process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potenti al. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical stru cture to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs fro m in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studie s, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Gen erally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patte rns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous sy stem, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., Phase III). When the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability eval uations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predicti ve of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, s tudies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Asse ssments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibil ity arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma conce ntration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is c onsidered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments. Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 22 16. OTHER TOXICITY STUDIES Additional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify p otential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previou s nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated spec ial safety concerns. The approaches for qualifying impurities and degrad ants are outlined in ICH Guidelines Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warra nted before Phase III, unless there are changes that result in a significant new impuri ty profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions bet ween the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qu alification studies can be warranted to support Phase II or later stages of development. 17. COMBINATION DRUG TOXICITY TESTING This section covers combination drugs that are inte nded to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form ('fixed formul ation'). The principles outlined can also apply when developing products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, ev en if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information reg arding the combination. Combinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e ., from Phase III studies and/ or post marketing)); (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experie nce (i.e., Phase II studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration , combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical st udies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar ta rget organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern it should generally be comple ted before carrying out clinical studies with the combination. Where there are two late stage products for which t here is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical co mbination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively shor t-duration clinical studies (e.g., Phase II studies of up to 3 months duration). Noncl inical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term com bination trials, as well as for marketing. For combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxi cological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical pro of-of-concept studies of up to one- month duration. The clinical study of the combinati on should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Lat er stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combin ation toxicity study. For combinations of two early stage entities, noncl inical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials. Provided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination t oxicity study is warranted to support Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 23 combination clinical trials, the duration of the co mbination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duratio n of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A comb ination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on t he duration of the intended clinical use. The design of the nonclinical studies recommended t o characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient p opulation, and the available clinical data. Combination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional te sting can be appropriate. When complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology pr ogram with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination. Combination genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, or c arcinogenicity studies generally are not recommended to support clinical trials or marke ting if the individual agents have been tested according to current standards. In tho se cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with the individual agen t(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studie s are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identif ied. If nonclinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a p otential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended unless conc erns exist, based on the properties of individual components, that their combination co uld give rise to a hazard for humans. In circumstances when the individual agents have be en tested in embryo-fetal studies but embryo-fetal studies of the drug combination ar e warranted, the study(ies) of the combination should be available to support the mark eting application. 18. CONTINUING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HARMONIZATION It is recognised that significant advances in harmo nisation of the timing of nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical tr ials for pharmaceuticals have already been achieved and are detailed in this guideline. However, differences remain in a few areas. Regulators and industry will continue to co nsider these differences and work towards further improving the drug development proc ess. 19. ENDNOTES Note 1: In this document \"exposure\" generally means group m ean AUC. In some circumstances (e.g., if the compound or compound cl ass is known to produce acute functional cardiovascular changes or central nervou s system-related clinical signs) it might be appropriate to base the exposure margin on group mean Cmax values rather than AUC. Note 2: An assessment of male and female fertility by thoro ugh standard histopathological examination on the testis and ova ry in a repeated-dose toxicity study (generally rodent) of at least 2-week duration is c onsidered to be as sensitive as fertility studies in detecting toxic effects on male and fema le reproductive organs (Refs. 3, 15, 16). Note 3: Highly effective methods of birth control are defin ed as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e ., less than 1% per year) when used Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Market ing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals 24 consistently and correctly. For subjects using a h ormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed. Note 4: A preliminary embryo-fetal study useful for this pu rpose is one with adequate dose levels; that includes assessment of fetal surv ival, body weight and external and visceral examinations; that uses a minimum of six d ams per group; and that has dams treated over the period of organogenesis. This prel iminary nonclinical study should be conducted under high-quality scientific standards w ith data collection records readily available or under GLP conditions. Note 5 : The pregnancy rate of women initially attempting to become pregnant is ~17% per menstrual cycle. Pregnancy rates estimated fro m Phase III studies conducted in WOCBP were observed to be <0.1% per menstrual cycle . During these studies, subjects were encouraged to avoid pregnancy and measures wer e instituted to prevent pregnancy. Survey information from earlier Phase II studies su ggests that the pregnancy rates were lower than in Phase III studies but the extent of f urther reduction could not be estimated due to the limited number of women enroll ed. Based on the above Phase III experience, Phase II trials enrolling 150 WOCBP for 3 months are estimated to result in significantly less than 0.5 pregnancies per pharmac eutical under development. Note 6: Testing for photocarcinogenicity in rodents using currently available models (e.g., hairless rodent) is not considered useful in support of pharmaceutical development and generally is not recommended. If the phototoxi city assessment suggests a potential photocarcinogenic risk and an appropriate assay bec omes available, the study should usually be completed before marketing and the resul ts should be considered in the human risk assessment. 20.
