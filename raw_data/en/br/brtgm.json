Of course you are! As we come up on flu season, we're all looking for ways to stay healthy and boost our family's immune systems in any way we can, short of putting ourselves in a bubble or cocoon for the rest of the year. While you can't fully control whether you get sick or not (without living in the aforementioned bubble), there are steps you can take to better your chances of making it out of this year unscathed. So where is the best place to start? How can you boost your immunity effectively and naturally? Try starting with healthy lifestyle choices. [Eating a healthy, balanced diet](https://www.stuckychiropractic.com/healthy-living/eat-well/), staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep can all help to keep your entire body in check, including your immune system. When you fuel your body the right way, each system is able to work more effectively. Staying active can also help support your immune system by keeping your body healthy and stress levels to a minimum. In addition to these lifestyle changes, chiropractic has been proven to boost your immune system. Regular [chiropractic care](https://www.stuckychiropractic.com/services/chiropractic-adjustment/) can keep your body in alignment and working correctly, supporting your immune system in the process. Beyond supporting a well-functioning body, chiropractic can address dysfunctions and subluxations, which can cause a weakened immune system. Chiropractic, along with healthy lifestyle choices, is a great drug-free alternative to the flu shot.
