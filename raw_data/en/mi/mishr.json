Hopefully this works for others--our dog, who hasn't typically been too picky with food, was not interested in eating this one. On to try another--as long as I don't have to go back to Hill's Prescription with its ever-increasing prices, I'll try almost anything! Last year our 3-year-old girl's allergies went from a month or so out of the year to year-round. She has been miserable and we have tried different foods, gone grain-free, and changed to limited ingredient chicken-free trying to narrow down her issues. I was getting ready to call a veterinary dermatologist when I saw this last week on Chewy and read the ingredient list having read in my most recent research that beef is also a common allergen in dogs. I bought the 4lb bag, limited ingredient dog treats with no chicken meal/flavoring and it seemed after just one meal of this with her new treats she is so much more comfortable. A random scratch here or there, but it was noticeable from the first day. We're on day 4 and we think we've got a winner. She cleans her bowl as well, I hope this is the holy grail it seems to be. We are so happy. Worth a try! This is alot of money for a bag of potatoes 1st and 3rd ingredient are potatoes. In description, it says venison is first ingredient My dog has sensitive stomach and he will not eat this brand ar all. I mixed it with the American Journey canned food with duck but he won't touch either one. He loves duck treats but not these. My 2 dogs won't touch this stuff. I tried every tactic imaginable. They spit this kibble out. Dropping this off at a shelter. My Akitas loved the basic ingredient dog food....even would eat it without canned mixed in it. No more tummy aches for my sensitive tummy akitas. Will definitely buy it again My dog no longer barfs unless she gets into a friend's dinner at their house. She has a poultry allergy and this food has been working very well. Only difference I can see is that she poops a whole lot. Like, the Royal Canin HP food it'd be about twice a day. Now it's 4, sometimes 5 times a day. Must be super high fiber or something. I had such a good experience with my order. The food is the only one that actually works for my bulldog and the fact that it was cheaper and i received it in one day, specially on a Sunday was amazing. Thank you for the great service. I have been using this dog food natural balance for over 20 years and first bag I received made my dogs ill - the food was not cooked or something it was grainy and flaky. I have now received 2 bags over a 7 year span that has had very fine pieces of kibble as well as a fine dust from manufacturing. I'm giving the food 4 stars because its a good food, but more quality control is needed. Chewy has been great replacing the bags when this happens "}
