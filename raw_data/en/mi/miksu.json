(Nasdaq: NVAX), a biotechnology company dedicated to developing and commercializing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced that Health Canada has approved a supplement to a New Drug Submission (sNDS) for Nuvaxovid (COVID-19 Vaccine (Recombinant protein, Adjuvanted)) (NVX-CoV2373) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a primary series of two doses in adolescents aged 12 through 17. \"With the winter COVID-19 surge upon us, it's more important now than ever to ensure adolescents have access to COVID-19 vaccine options, including Nuvaxovid,\" said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax. \"Our vaccine is developed using an innovative approach to traditional vaccine technology and may have a special role to play in adolescent vaccination based on parents' and caregivers' familiarity with protein-based vaccines used in other disease areas.\" The approval of the sNDS was based on data from the ongoing [pediatric expansion](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=3827438618&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.novavax.com%2F2022-02-10-Novavax-Announces-Positive-Results-of-COVID-19-Vaccine-in-Pediatric-Population-of-PREVENT-19-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial&a=pediatric+expansion) of the Phase 3 PREVENT-19 trial of 2,247 adolescents aged 12 through 17 years across 75 sites in the U.S., to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Nuvaxovid. In the pediatric expansion, the effectiveness analysis was based on antibody titers that were shown to be higher in adolescents than in young adults. Effectiveness was supported by clinical efficacy showing that Nuvaxovid provided clinical protective efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI: 46.8%, 92.1%) overall at a time when the Delta variant was the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain. Preliminary safety data from the pediatric expansion showed the vaccine to be generally well-tolerated. Serious and severe adverse reactions (AR) were low in number and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups, and not considered related to the vaccine. Local and systemic reactogenicity was generally lower than or similar to adults, after the first and second dose. The most frequent ARs in participants aged 12 through 17 were injection site tenderness (71%), injection site pain (67%), headache (63%), myalgia injection swelling (19%), pyrexia (17%), and injection site redness (17%). Most were mild-to-moderate in severity and lasted less than two days. No new safety concerns were observed through the placebo-controlled portion of the pediatric expansion. In the 12 through 17-year-old population, Novavax' vaccine has been authorized in more than 10 markets around the world including the [U.S.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=2412879162&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3638126-1%26h%3D1503327331%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fir.novavax.com%252F2022-08-19-U-S-FDA-Grants-Emergency-Use-Authorization-for-Novavax-COVID-19-Vaccine%252C-Adjuvanted-for-Adolescents-Aged-12-Through-17%26a%3DU.S.&a=U.S.), the [European Union](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=1504074318&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3638126-1%26h%3D2574353337%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fir.novavax.com%252F2022-07-05-Novavax-Nuvaxovid-TM-COVID-19-Vaccine-Conditionally-Authorized-in-the-European-Union-for-Adolescents-Aged-12-Through-17%26a%3DEuropean%2BUnion&a=European+Union), and the [United Kingdom](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=2140823063&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3638126-1%26h%3D4018291151%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fir.novavax.com%252F2022-08-26-Novavax-Nuvaxovid-TM-COVID-19-Vaccine-Granted-Expanded-Conditional-Marketing-Authorization-in-the-United-Kingdom-for-Use-in-Adolescents-Aged-12-Through-17%26a%3DUnited%2BKingdom&a=United+Kingdom).

There are no data available on the interchangeability of Nuvaxovid with other COVID- 19 vaccines to complete the primary vaccination series. Important Safety Information: Canada - Nuvaxovid is contraindicated in individuals who are hypersensitive to the active ingredient or to any ingredients in the formulation, including any non-medicinal ingredient, or component of the container. - Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. - Individuals may not be optimally protected until seven days after their second dose. - Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of Nuvaxovid. - Nuvaxovid should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. - The effects with Nuvaxovid may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. - Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the vaccine. - Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions, hyperventilation, or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting and manage syncopal reactions. - Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and fetus. - The most common adverse reactions observed during clinical studies were injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, and nausea or vomiting.

The vaccine was created using Novavax' recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein and is formulated with Novavax' patented saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Nuvaxovid contains purified protein antigen and can neither replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. Nuvaxovid is packaged as a ready-to-use liquid formulation in a vial containing ten doses. The vaccination regimen calls for two 0.5 ml doses (5 mcg antigen and 50 mcg Matrix-M adjuvant) given intramuscularly 21 days apart. The vaccine is stored at 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0 Celsius, enabling the use of existing vaccine supply and cold chain channels. Use of the vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. Novavax has established partnerships for the manufacture, commercialization, and distribution of Nuvaxovid worldwide. Existing authorizations leverage Novavax' manufacturing partnership with Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume. They will later be supplemented with data from additional manufacturing sites throughout Novavax' global supply chain. About the NVX-CoV2373 Phase 3 Trials NVX-CoV2373 continues being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 trials. PREVENT-19 (the PRE-fusion protein subunit Vaccine Efficacy Novavax Trial | COVID-19) is a 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant in 29,960 participants 18 years of age and over in 119 locations in the U.S. and Mexico. The primary endpoint for PREVENT-19 was the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least seven days after the second dose in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline. The statistical success criterion included a lower bound of 95% CI >30%. A secondary endpoint was the prevention of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19. Both endpoints were assessed at least seven days after the second study vaccination in volunteers who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the trial, NVX-CoV2373 achieved 90.4% efficacy overall. It was generally well-tolerated and elicited a robust antibody response after the second dose in both studies. Full results of the trial were published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=859754113&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3440781-1%26h%3D467849857%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nejm.org%252Fdoi%252Ffull%252F10.1056%252FNEJMoa2116185%253Fquery%253Dfeatured_home%26a%3DNew%2BEngland%2BJournal%2Bof%2BMedicine&a=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine) (NEJM). The pediatric expansion of PREVENT-19 is a 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M adjuvant in 2,247 adolescent participants 12 to 17 years of age in 73 locations in the U.S., compared with placebo. In the pediatric trial, the vaccine achieved its primary effectiveness endpoint (non-inferiority of the neutralizing antibody response compared to young adult participants 18 through 25 years of age from PREVENT-19) and demonstrated 80% efficacy overall at a time when the Delta variant of concern was the predominant circulating strain in the U.S. Additionally, immune responses were about two-to-three-fold higher in adolescents than in adults against all variants studied. Additionally, a trial conducted in the U.K. with 14,039 participants aged 18 years and over was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study and achieved overall efficacy of 89.7%. The primary endpoint was based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least seven days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline. Full results of the trial were published in [NEJM](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3730124-1&h=3501482974&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3440781-1%26h%3D3617137863%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nejm.org%252Fdoi%252Ffull%252F10.1056%252FNEJMoa2107659%26a%3DNEJM&a=NEJM).
