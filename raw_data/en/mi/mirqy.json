Although this topic encompasses a wide array of health conditions, this brief will focus on a small number of specific issues affecting youth, including mental health disorders, high-risk behaviors, injuries and accidents, and issues related to the development of chronic illnesses in adulthood (such as obesity, exercise, and nutrition). Adolescence is widely considered to be a period of ideal physical health. However, the rapid physical, cognitive, and social changes teens experience can be associated with the onset of significant health problems. Poor nutrition 1 and inadequate exercise2 are common problems that contribute to obesity 3 and place youths at risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other serious he alth prob lems.- - 4 Mental health conditions are also a concern for adolescents. The symptoms of mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety , often begin during the teen years. - - Approximately 1 in 8 adolescents and young adults in the United States live with depression, 5 and suicide is one of the most common causes of death in this age group. 6;7 Anxiety disorders af fect approximately one-third of teens,- 8 and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and eating disorders are common in adolescence. 9;10 Mental health disorders and other health issues may result from adverse childhood experiences (such as traumatic events, economic hardship, or parental separation or divorce), which affect 45% of American youths. 11 More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, with its associated physical and social isolation, lockdown measures, social unrest, and various economic and other stressors, has had an adverse effect on both the physical and mental well-being of adolescents. In many youth popula tions, rates of depression, - anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation and behavior, and unhealthy substance use have increased, 12 as has utilization of emergency and other medical services for mental health problems.13;14 Kaiser Permanente publications related to adolescent health since 2007 727 Journal articles 22,521 Citations172 Citations in PubMed Guidelines Source: Kaiser Permanente Publications Library and Scite metrics, as of September 13, 2022. This brief summarizes a selection of the publications contained within the Kaiser Permanente Publications Libr ary, which indexes journal articles and other publications authored by individuals affiliated with Kaiser Permanente. The work described in this brief originated from across Kaiser Permanente's 8 regions and was supported by a wide range of funding sources including internal research support as well as both governmental and nongovernmental extramural funding. \u2014 2 \u2014 March 2023 Kaiser Permanente Research Brief: Adolescent healthMoreover, as youth transition into the increased autonomy and independence of adulthood, they are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors. Although use of alcohol, tobacco, and most illicit - drugs among American teens has declined in re cent years, marijuana use has increased among 10th graders, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse has reported a substantial increase in the use of tobacco and marijuana vaping products.15 - Moreover, recent surveys suggest that adolescents' perceptions of the risks of marijuana use have declined steeply.15- High-risk sexual behav ior among teens also remains common. Ac cording to the Centers for Disease Control and - Prevention, 27.4% of U.S. high school students in 2019 reported having had sexual intercourse in the prior 3 months. Of these, nearly half had not used a condom, and 21.2% had used drugs or alcohol prior to intercourse.16 About 11% of students reported having been forced to engage in sexual behavior against their will, including unwanted kissing and touching, or being forced to have intercourse.16 As a consequence of risky sexual behavior, nearly 150,000 infants were born to teen mothers in 2021,17 and half of new - cases of sexually transmitted infections (including 21% of new HIV diagnoses 18) occur in ado lescents and young adults.- 19 Finally, accidental deaths and injuries, primarily associated with driving, cycling, and walking,20 represent the leading cause of death among teens.21 Adolescent health is an active area of study for Kaiser Permanente Research. Scientists across - the organization have used our rich, comprehensive, longitudinal da ta to advance knowledge in the areas of understanding risk, improving - patient outcomes, and translating research findings into policy and practice. We have published nearly 730 articles related to adolescent health since 2007; together, these articles have been cited more than 22,000 times.22 These articles are the product of observational - studies, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies led by K aiser Permanente - scientists. Our unique environment \u2014 a fully integrated care and coverage model in which our research scientists, clinicians, medical groups, and health plan leaders collaborate \u2014 lets us - contribute generalizable knowledge on adolescent health and many other research topics.Understanding Risk For which health problems are adolescents at increased risk? - In exploring the risk factors associated with common health problems in adolescents, Kaiser Per manente researchers have found the following to - be predictors of mental health problems: onset of symptoms23;24 and use of mental health services25 at younger ages, insomnia,26 diabetes,27 parental depression,28;29 and health risk behaviors such as smoking, substance use, and unsafe sexual behavior.30 Recent work has also highlighted the links between poor social integration and subsequent suicidal thoughts or behavior, - 31 as well as nonsuicidal self-injury.32 Our scientists have also - explored factors associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs, which include vap ing, - 33;34 cigarette advertising,35;36 characteristics of neighborhoods37;38 and the school environment,39 prior risky alcohol use,40 and age.41 Insufficient information42 and inadequate screening43 may be associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV or chlamydia, and - teens with inadequate access to contraception44-46 may be at higher risk of pregnancy. In spite of early concerns, a study conducted among Kaiser Permanente members did not find an association between HPV vaccination and risky sexual - behavior.47 Other research has found that the risk of injury in adolescents is linked to mental health symptoms48 and inadequate safety precautions.49 Research conducted by Kaiser Permanente scientists has also demonstrated that obesity and - unhealthy behaviors in teens can lead to more serious health problems,50-56 including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases,57;58 and that youth with such health problems may experience serious consequences in early adulthood59-63 or later in life.64 One line of study explored the contributions of in utero conditions, such as maternal gestational diabetes,65;66 to obesity in adolescence, and another recent study found that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of pediatric asthma that persists into adulthood. - 67 Maternal cardiovascular health during pregnancy has also been found to predict heart health in adolescents.68 Our scientists have stud ied the increase in adolescent obesity during -\u2014 3 \u2014 March 2023 Kaiser Permanente Research Brief: Adolescent healththe COVID-19 pandemic,69 and have explored neighborhood characteristics,70-74 such as food - retail density and recreational options, asso cia ted with obesity. We have also studied the roles of parental75 and peer76 influences, sleep quality,77 gender,78 race,63 parental diabetes,79 and cancer80 in the development of obesity and related cardiovascular conditions. As many as 60% of U.S. adults have at least 1 adverse childhood experience (ACE), including abuse, neglect, parental loss, or family dysfunction. Kaiser Permanente research has linked ACEs with many serious health risks later in life: Mental health82-85 Sexual behavior86 Smoking87 Lung disease88;89 Chronic pain90 Autoimmune disease91 Premature death92 Are there subgroups of adolescents who are at particularly high risk for these health problems? Kaiser Permanente has long been a leader in research on the health impacts of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs. These include abuse, neglect, loss of a parent, or family dysfunction.- 81 In recent years, our scientists have found these experiences to be associated with mental health problems, 82-85 high-risk sexual behavior,86 smoking87 and smoking-related illness,88;89 chronic pain,90 autoimmune disease,91 and the risk of premature death.92 A recent study conducted by Kaiser Permanente researchers suggested that ACEs related to mistreatment were more predictive of mental health symptoms than household dysfunction,- 93 while anoth er found that Latino adolescents experienced -lower health-related quality of life following stressful life events. 94 Furthermore, as part of our organization's commitment to total health, we have conducted extensive research on the role of socioeconomic factors in adolescent health risks. Household food insecurity has been linked to diabetes risk, greater use of emergency departments, 95- and greater anxiety about hypo glycemia,96 and lower socioeconomic status has been associated with obesity,97;98- lack of engage ment with substance abuse tr eatment,99- and low er he alth-related quality of life.100 Youth of lower socioeconomic status may also be more likely to experience toxic stresses associated with health risks. 101;102 Our research has also found that peer influences play a significant role in teens' health-related behaviors, including physical activity, 103;104 use of alcohol and drugs,105 and treatment-seeking for depression.106 Finally, our scientists have studied a variety of long-term health risks in youth with spina bifida, 107- scoli osis,108 preterm birth,109 cancer,110;111 and sickle cell disease.112 What key factors protect adolescents against these risks? - In addition to studying risk factors, Kaiser Permanente scientists have e xplored the role of influences that are protective against the development of health problems in adolescents. - Social support appears to protect teens from the development of depression 113 and to support recovery from substance use disorders.114 In particular, studies conducted by our researchers have demonstr ated that positive peer and - family influences,115-118 as well as the influence of trusted adults,42;119;120 can support healthy behaviors44;75;121-123 and aid in disease preven tion.- 37;124;125 A recent study conducted among pregnant Kaiser Permanente members found that personal resilience was protective against the development of mental health symptoms in adult women with ACEs. 82 Some of our scientists have also explored the benefits to youth of extra-curricular activities. 126;127 \u2014 4 \u2014 March 2023 Kaiser Permanente Research Brief: Adolescent healthImproving Patient Outcomes What prevention or early intervention strategies are effective in mitigating the health risks faced by adolescents? Researchers at Kaiser Permanente have studied interventions for the prevention of common health problems in adolescents. As part of our organization's approach to preventive medicine, our scientists have studied screening programs for obesity, 50;128 abnormal cholesterol,129;130 substance use disorders,131-135 and mental health conditions,136;137 as well as efforts to screen sexually active adolescents for infections such as chlamydia 138 and HIV.139 In addition, we have - studied a number of counseling and other preventive interventions tar geting these conditions. For example, in a randomized controlled trial involving Kaiser Permanente members, a cognitive-behavior al intervention aimed at teens with - depressed parents was found to have benefits over several years, 28;29;140 and pediatric patients undergoing brief behavioral therapy showed lower levels of anxiety at 5 months in another randomized study. 141 Our researchers have also investigated programs targeting risky behaviors such as tobacco use, 142 substance misuse,143;144 and high-risk sexual behavior.145-147 We have investigated ways of increasing use of birth contr ol among sexually active teens,- 120;148-150 as well as interventions to improve diet and exercise habits. 104;151-154 Kaiser Permanente employs a range of strategies with adolescents to prevent future health problems Future health problems: High cholesterol Mental health conditions Obesity Sexually transmittedinfections Substance use Vaccine-preventableillnesses Prevention strategies: Behavioral counseling Birth control Brief counselingand r eferr al Parental communication Provider training School-based services Screening Sexually transmittedinfection testing Vaccination Other research has explored primary-care-based interventions targeting multiple risk behaviors. Training to increase provider confidence,119 and combining screening and brief intervention with a health educator visit, 155 each yielded positive outcomes, while a mental health intervention alone yielded mixed results. 30 We have also studied the impact of family involvement124 and health care provider communication156 on the efficacy of adolescent preventive health. A final component of prevention in adolescents involves vaccinations. The CDC recommends that adolescents receive vaccinations for HPV, meningococcal disease, COVID-19, and the flu in addition to the tetanus diphtheria and - acellular pertussis booster. Kaiser Permanente has conducted extensive r esearch on both the effectiveness157-166 and safety167-171 of these vaccines, and the factors and strategies affecting their uptake. 172-186- Our scientists have also partic ipa ted in studying the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents.187 \u2014 5 \u2014 March 2023 Kaiser Permanente Research Brief: Adolescent healthWhat are the key factors in effective treatment of the common health problems experienced by adolescents? Kaiser Permanente scientists have studied many - treatment strategies for adolescent health problems, including mindfulness-based therapy,188 care pathways,189 collaborative care,190- medica tions for mental health conditions,191-201 12-step treatment for substance use disorders,114;202;203 cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders,- 204 metformin for pediatric obesity,205 and insulin for pediatric diabetes.206 Our research has also demonstrated that outcomes may be improved when providers take teens' growing autonomy into account, 156;207-209 work toward a smooth transition between pediatric and adult primary care, 151;210;211- and emphasize confidenti ality in teens' inter actions with the health care sys tem.- 212-216 In addition, our scientists have explored various ways of providing support for youth with life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. 217-220 What are the key components of approaches to reduce disparities in care and outcomes experienced by adolescents? Researchers at Kaiser Permanente have identified a variety of disparities in access and outcomes among subgroups of adolescents. Our - - work has found that Black and Latino youth experience greater unmet needs for mental health services, and further work is needed to identify ways to increase the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of services for these teens. 133 Similarly, our research has found that adolescents of minority sexual orientation may be at higher risk of sexual violence 221 and other negative health outcomes,222;223 and efforts are needed to improve outreach and care delivery to these patients. 222 One approach to improving health care accessibility has been the delivery of services such as immunizations and screening outside of traditional health care settings; our scientists have evaluated programs delivered in school-based health centers 40;176;182;183;224-227 and other settings132;181;228 that youth are less likely to find stigmatizing or inaccessible. Translating Research Findings Into Policy and Practice Kaiser Permanente research on adolescent health has contributed to changes in policy and practice. As part of a learning health care - organization that works to systematically use rese arch to inform and improve practice, research, clinical, and operational partners within Kaiser Permanente have tested a range of interventions to r educe the risk of common adolescent - health problems and to improve the outcomes young patients experience. Pediatricians and researchers have developed and implemented interventions to addr ess parental hesitancy - regarding vaccines.229-232 This work recently was expanded to include HPV vaccinations in adolescents. Kaiser Permanente also has implemented - a successful intervention to screen adolescents for chlamydia in urgent care settings. 138- Howev er , further work is needed to increase adoption of other effective interventions studied by our scientists, including screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment for adolescent - substance misuse,40;133;143;233;234 and collaborative care for depression.190 More recent research on the acceptability of gender identity screening and screening for sexual minority status during adolescent wellness visits has supported the implementation of these programs throughout Kaiser Permanente. 235;236 Finally, our integrated electronic health record system has been used to develop novel strategies for predicting higher risks of substance use disorders 237 and suicidal behavior238;239 in adolescents. Kaiser Permanente research contributes not only to policy and practice changes within our own care delivery model, but also to advancing the national understanding of adolescent health. Kaiser Permanente's research on adolescent health since 2007 has been cited more than 170 times within recent consensus statements and clinical practice guidelines published by a wide range of entities, including the American Diabetes Association, 240 the CDC,241 and the American Academy of Pediatrics.242 In addition, Kaiser Permanente researchers and clinician-scientists have dir ectly contributed as authors - of the Guidelines for Adolescent Depression \u2014 6 \u2014 March 2023 Kaiser Permanente Research Brief: Adolescent health in Primary Care243;244 and the asthma guidelines of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program,245 as well as of guidelines and consensus statements from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,50;131;136;142;246-249 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,250;251 the American Academy of Pediatrics,212 the American Heart Association,252 the Institute of Medicine,219 and the CDC.253 Our - researchers were also involved in the development of guidelines for prescribing antipsychotic medi cations to youth, as part of the Safer and Targeted Use of Antipsychotics clinical trial.254 Finally, Kaiser Permanente has shown considerable leadership in the broader field of adolescent health research. Our scientists have led a number of prominent studies in this field, including Treatment of Resistant - Depression in Adolescents, a 6-site randomized controlled trial that studied the effect of adding cognitive behavioral therapy to an intensification of pharmacother apy;191 the National Institute of Mental Health's Treatment for Adolescent Depression Study;255 and the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, a multicenter national study sponsored by the CDC and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 256-259 We are involved in ongoing efforts to study the effectiveness and safety of vaccines delivered to adolescents as part of our involvement in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a nationwide project sponsored by the CDC.- 260 Our scientists were also involved in a National Cancer Institute symposium on data issues involved in studying cancer in adolescents.261Collaborative care190 50adolescents with depression A depression care manager delivered brief education and cognitive-behavioral therapy, and assisted in treatment planningScreening, brief intervention, referral to treatment132-134 648adolescents at Well Child visits Either a pediatrician or a primary-care-embedded men tal health specialist performed screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment if needed Both of these programs found increased treatment engagement and improved outcomes at 1 to 2 years. Currently, our attention is focused on addressing the challenges involved in scaling these programs to support broader implementation. Kaiser Permanente's 185 research scientists and 1,530 support staff members are based at 9 research centers. There are currently 2,355 studies underway, including clinical trials. Since 2007 our research scientists have published more than 20,000 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Kaiser Permanente currently serves approximately 12.6 million members in 8 states and the District of Columbia. This brief was written by Nicholas P . Emptage, Anna C. Davis, and Elizabeth A.
