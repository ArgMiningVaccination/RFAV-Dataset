An updated procedure is provided here, which maintains the essential concepts of the use of the congeneric group approach and thereliance on the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept. The updated procedure emphasizes more rigorous considerations of unidenti ed constituents and the genotoxic potential of constituents. The update of the previously established procedure is the rst step in a multi-year project to conduct safety re-evaluations for more than 250 NFCs that have uses that are currently considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the FEMA Expert Panel. In addition, this procedure can be more generally employed in the safety evaluation of NFCs. 1. Introduction Natural Flavor Complexes (NFCs) are naturally occurring mixtures derived from plants and other natural sources that are used to flavor foods for human consumption. Many NFCs from commonly used spices and herbs, including black pepper, cinnamon, clove, rosemary, oregano and basil have been used to flavor food for centuries. By the beginning of the 20th century, NFCs were used for a variety of applications, suchas use of peppermint and other mint oils for the flavoring of chewing gums and candy and use of citrus oils in soda fountain drinks. Today,NFCs remain important flavoring ingredients in almost all food cate- gories. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States (FEMA) began a program in 1959 to assess the safety and gen-erally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of flavoring ingredients under the authority provided by the 1958 Food Additives Amendments to theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FEMA Expert Panel published its rst GRAS list in 1965 ( Hall and Oser, 1965 ) including 265 NFCs that are also permitted at 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part172.510 and 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 182.20. The Expert Panel has since evaluated numerous chemically-de nedflavoring ma- terials for GRAS status including approximately 40 NFCs in recentyears. As part of its mission, the Expert Panel continually reviews available safety data and use of all substances determined to be FEMA GRAS. In the rst FEMA GRAS evaluations for NFCs, conclusions on their safety were generally based on their long history of safe use in foods combined with their likely low exposure, based on the principle of self- limitation (i.e. flavor ingredients used at high concentrations are often unpalatable, and thus they are typically used at very low concentrationsin food).

Ttoxicology, metabolism, biochemistry and analytical chemistry, a sci- entically based procedure for the safety evaluation of NFCs based on their chemical composition was developed and published in 2005(Smith et al., 2005 ). The procedure requires a comprehensive evalua- tion of the chemical and biological properties of the constituents. Thesafety evaluation of cardamom oil demonstrated the application of the procedure ( Smith et al., 2004). TheSmith et al., 2005 procedure employs a congeneric group ap- proach for the classi cation and evaluation of the identi ed (known) constituents of the NFC under consideration and compares the intake ofeach congeneric group to the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) (Cramer et al., 1978; Kroes et al., 2000; Munro et al., 1996 ) a widely adopted and highly conservative approach to the safety evaluation offood ingredients. Both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) use the TTC approach in their evaluation of flavoring substances ( EFSA/WHO, 2016). In the Smith et al., 2005 procedure, the constituents of each congeneric group are related by chemical structure, biochemistry, metabolism and toxicologic potential. The 36 congeneric groups that were described in the original procedure, with some mod- ications, are listed in Appendix A . Comprehensive, quantitative che- mical analyses of each NFC are considered, sorting each identi ed constituent into its appropriate congeneric group. The structure of each constituent is assessed for toxic potential using the Cramer decision tree (Cramer et al., 1978) which classi es chemical substances into the following classes: Class I (expected low oral toxicity), Class II (less in-nocuous than Class I but do not contain structural features that provide oral toxicity concern) or Class III (contains structural features which do not permit a presumption of safety). The Cramer decision tree class for each congeneric group is assigned using the highest structural class of any constituent present in the congeneric group. For the NFC under consideration, the range of concentrations of each congeneric group is determined based on multiple analyses. To determine the intake of eachcongeneric group resulting from consumption of the NFC, the highest percent concentration is multiplied by the NFC intake which is calcu- lated in terms of daily per capita intake derived from annual volume of use surveys. The intake of each congeneric group is evaluated againstthe TTC thresholds for each Cramer Class, 1800 g/person/day for Class I, 540 g/person/day for Class II and 90 g/person/day for Class III (Kroes et al., 2000). For the evaluation of the relatively small per- centage of unidenti ed constituents of an NFC using the Smith et al., 2005 procedure, they are grouped, and approximations of intake of the unidenti ed constituents are determined in a similar way as for the known congeneric groups. The resulting intake is evaluated against the TTC threshold for Class III, 90 g/person/day. For both known con- generic groups and unknown constituents of the NFC, if the intake isbelow the TTC threshold, there is no safety concern. When the intake exceeds the TTC threshold for the respective Cramer class, the proce- dure calls for the evaluation of the toxicological data for representative members of the congeneric group and/or the NFC. For the evaluation of the unidenti ed constituents, if their intake is greater via consumption of the food compared to their intake via use of the NFC as added fla- voring, further consideration of the unknown portion is not needed and the evaluation of the NFC proceeds to other potential issues that mayraise safety concerns. This manuscript presents an update to the 2005 procedure for the safety evaluation of NFCs. A summary of the revised procedure is outlined in Fig. 1 but the full procedure described here should be used for evaluating NFCs. The original scope of the procedure was for thesafety evaluation of essential oils derived from higher plants for the intended use as flavoring substances in food. However, the inherent flexibility and general applicability of the procedure has allowed for the evaluation of a wider range of complex mixtures including those that may be derived from non-botanical sources. While the general approach of the procedure remains the same as that published in 2005, the up- dated procedure re flects the knowledge obtained through its practicalapplication over the last decade, including a more rigorous considera- tion of the unknown fraction and further consideration of the approach to genotoxicity evaluation of constituents, in addition to other minor changes. 2. The procedure for the safety evaluation of natural flavor complexes (NFCs) Preamble This procedure provides guidance for the safety evaluation of NFCs; it is not to be viewed as a rigid check-list. The preamble identi es the data that must be available to success- fully employ this safety evaluation sequence as described below: A. It is essential to provide a complete analytical characterization of the chemical composition of the NFC to be used as a flavoring agent. B. The description of the starting material and isolation method must take into account, where relevant: \u0081all recognized botanical/natural sources,1 \u0081all relevant geographical sources, \u0081all commercially used plant parts, \u0081all commercially used degrees of maturity, \u0081all commercially used methods of isolation, and \u0081the variability inherent in each method of isolation. These six factors can, and often do, have such an extensive infl uence on composition that their variation may result in a wholly distinctive product. Therefore, in all cases, it is essential to de ne these factors to ensure that commercial products conform to the identi cation that describes the evaluated product. C. An NFC identi cation shall include existing relevant speci cations and additional data that assure the identity, purity, technical e ect and safety of the commercial product. D. Data should be provided on the total exposure to the NFC that in- cludes: a. History of use b. Intake of the natural source of the NFC when that source is itself consumed as a food, and c. Intake of the NFC when it is used as an added flavoring ingredient d. Any other relevant data on individual constituents Step 1. To conduct a safety evaluation of an NFC, the Panel requires that comprehensive analytical data are provided. The analyticalmethodologies employed should refl ect the expected composition of the NFC and provide data that identify, to the greatest extentpossible, the constituents of the NFC and the levels (%) at which they are present. It is anticipated that GC-MS and LC-MS would be used for characterization of most NFCs, and that the chromatographic peaks based on peak area of total ion current will be almost completely identi ed. The percentage of unknowns should be low enough to not raise a safety concern. Otherappropriate methods (e.g., Karl Fischer titration, amino acid analysis, etc.) should be employed as necessary. The analytical parameters should be submitted for each type of analysis, including the method of quantitation for both identi ed and unidenti ed constituents and libraries, databases and methodology employedfor the identi cation of analytes. The Panel requires data from multiple batches to understand the inherent variability of the NFC. a. Consumption of foods from which the NFCs are derivedCalculate the per capita daily intake (PCI) of the NFC based on the annual volume added to food. 1A botanical source should be described phytogenetically by family and by genus, species and variety within each family.S.M. Cohen et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology 113 (2018) 171-178 172Fig. 1. Summary of the procedure for the safety evaluation of natural flavor complexes.S.M. Cohen et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology 113 (2018) 171-178 173For NFCs with a reported volume of use greater than 22,700 kg (50,000 lbs), the intake may be calculated by assuming that con- sumption of the NFC is spread among the entire population, on a case- by-case basis. In these cases, the PCI is calculated as follows: =\u00d7 \u00d7\u00d7PCI(g/person/day)annual volume in kg 10 population CF 365 days9 where: The annual volume of use of NFCs currently used as flavorings for food is reported in flavor industry surveys ( Gavin et al., 2008; Harman et al., 2013, 2018; Lucas et al., 1999 ). A correction factor (CF) is used in the calculation to correct for possible incompleteness of the annual volume survey. For flavorings, including NFCs, that are undergoing GRAS re-evaluation, the CF, currently 0.8, is established based on theresponse rate from the most recently reported flavor industry volume- of-use surveys. For new flavorings undergoing an initial GRAS evaluation the an- ticipated volume is used and a correction factor of 0.6 is applied which is a conservative assumption that only 60% of the total anticipated volume is reported. For NFCs with a reported volume of use less than 22,700 kg (50,000 lbs), the eaters' population intake assumes that consumption of the NFC is distributed among only 10% of the entire population. In these cases, theper capita intake for assuming a 10% \"eaters only \"population (PCI \u00d7 10) is calculated as follows: \u00d7=\u00d7 \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 PCI 10 (g/person/day)annual volume in kg 10 population CF 365 days109 If applicable, estimate the intake resulting from consumption of the commonly consumed food from which the NFC is derived. The aspect of food use is particularly important. It determines whether intake of the NFC occurs predominantly from the food of which it is derived, or from the NFC itself when it is added as a flavoring ingredient ( Stofberg and Grundschober, 1987).2At this step, if the conditions of use3for the NFC result in levels that di er from intake of the same constituents in the food source, it should be reported. b. Identi cation of all known constituents and assignment of Cramer Decision Tree Class In this step, the results of the complete chemical analyses for each NFC are examined, and where appropriate for each constituent the Cramer Decision Tree Class (DTC) is determined ( Cramer et al., 1978 ). c. Assignment of the constituents of Congeneric Groups; assignment of congeneric group DTC In this step, the identi ed constituents are sorted by their structural features into congeneric groups. Each congeneric group should be ex- pected, based on established data, to exhibit consistently similar rates and pathways of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and common toxicological endpoints (e.g. benzyl acetate, benzalde- hyde, and benzoic acid are expected to have similar toxicological properties). The congeneric groups are listed in Appendix A . Assign a decision tree structural class to each congeneric group. Within a congeneric group, when there are multiple decision tree structural classes for individual constituents, the class of highest tox- icological concern is assigned to the group. In cases where constituents do not belong to a congeneric group, potential safety concerns would be addressed in Step 13. Proceed to Step 2. Step 2. Determine (a) the mean percentage (%) of each congenericgroup in the NFC, and (b) the daily per capita intake,4of each congeneric group. The value (a) is calculated by summing the mean percentages of each of the constituents within a congeneric group, and the value (b) is calculated from consumption of the NFC and the mean percentage. Calculation of PCI for each constituent congeneric group of the NFC: =\u00d7Intake of congeneric group congeneric group Intake of NFC (g/person/day) 100(g/person/day) where: The mean % is the mean percentage % of the congeneric group.The intake of NFC ( g/person/day) is calculated using the PCI \u00d7 10 or PCI equation as appropriate. Proceed to Step 3. Step 3. For each congeneric group, collect metabolic data for a representative member or members of the group. Step 3 is critical in assessing whether the metabolism of the members of each congeneric group would require additional considerations in Step 13 of the procedure. Proceed to Step 4. Step 4. Are there concerns about potential genotoxicity for any of the constituents that are present in the NFC? If Yes, proceed to Step 4a . If No, proceed to Step 5. Step 4a. Are there su cient data to conclude that the genotoxic potential would not be a concern in vivo? If Yes, proceed to Step 5. If No, additional information is required to continue the evaluation. Step 5. Is the total intake of each congeneric group less than the TTC for the class of toxic potential assigned to the group, i.e., Class I: 1800 g/ person/day, Class II: 540 g/person/day (Kroes et al., 2000; Munro et al., 1996 )? For congeneric groups that contain members of di erent structural classes, the class of highest toxicological concern is selected. If Yes, proceed to Step 7. If No, proceed to Step 6. Step 6. For each congeneric group, do the data that are available from toxicological studies lead to a conclusion that no adverse e ects leading to safety concerns are exerted by each group's members? This question can commonly be answered by considering the data- base of relevant metabolic and toxicological data that exist for a re- presentative member or members of the congeneric group, or the NFC itself. A comprehensive safety evaluation of the congeneric group and a sucient margin of safety (MoS) based on the data available is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Examples of factors that contributeto the determination of a safety margin include 1) species di erences, 2) inter-individual variation, 3) the extent of natural occurrence of eachof the constituents of the congeneric group throughout the food supply, 4) the nature and concentration of constituents in related botanical genera and species. Although natural occurrence is no guarantee of safety, if exposure to the intentionally added constituent is trivial compared to intake of the constituent from consumption of food, then this should be taken into consideration in the safety evaluation ( Kroes et al., 2000 ). If Yes, proceed to Step 7. If No, additional information is required to continue the evaluation. Step 7. Calculate the mean percentage (%) for the group of unidenti ed 2See Stofberg and Grundschober,1987 for data on the consumption of NFCs from commonly consumed foods. 3The focus throughout this evaluation sequence is on the intake of the constituents of the NFC. To the extent that processing conditions, for example, alter the intake of con- stituents, those conditions of use need to be noted, and their consequences evaluated inarriving at the safety judgments that are the purpose of this procedure.4SeeSmith et al., 2005 for a discussion on the use of PCI \u00d7 10 for exposure calcula- tions in the procedure.S.M. Cohen et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology 113 (2018) 171-178 174constituents of unknown structure in each NFC (as noted in Step 1) and determine the daily per capita intake (PCI or PCI \u00d7 10) for this group. Proceed to Step 8. Step 8. Using the data from Step 1, is the intake of the NFC from consumption of the food5from which it is derived signi cantly greater than the intake of the NFC when used as a flavoring ingredient? If Yes, proceed to Step 13 . If No, proceed to Step 9. Step 9. Could the unidenti ed constituents belong to TTC excluded classes?6The excluded classes are de ned as high potency carcinogens, certain inorganic substances, metals and organometallics, certain proteins, steroids, known or predicted bio-accumulators, nanomaterials, and radioactive materials ( EFSA/WHO, 2016; Kroes et al., 2004). If Yes, the NFC is not appropriate for consideration via this proce- dure. If No, proceed to Step 10 . Step 10. Do the identi ed constituents give rise to concerns about the potential genotoxicity of the unidenti ed constituents? If Yes, proceed to Step 10a . If No, proceed to Step 11 . Step 10a. Is the estimated intake of the group of unidenti ed constituents less than 0.15 g/person/day ( Koster et al., 2011; Rulis, 1989 )? A TTC of 0.15 g/person/day has been proposed for potentially genotoxic substances that are not from the TTC excluded classes ( Kroes et al., 2004). If Yes, proceed to Step 13 . If No, proceed to Step 10b . Step 10b. Do negative genotoxicity data exist for the NFC? If Yes, proceed to Step 11 . If No, retain for further evaluation, which would include the col- lecting of data from appropriate genotoxicity tests, obtaining furtheranalytical data to reduce the fraction of unidenti ed constituents, and/ or considering toxicity data for other NFCs having a similar composi-tion. When additional data are available, the NFC could be reconsidered for further evaluation. Step 11. Is the estimated intake of the unidenti ed constituents (calculated in Step 7) less than the TTC ( Kroes et al., 2000; Munro et al., 1996) for Structural Class III (90 g/person/day)? 7 If Yes, proceed to Step 13 . If No, proceed to Step 12 . Step 12. Does relevant toxicological information exist that would provide an adequate margin of safety for the intake of the NFC and its unidenti ed constituents? This question may be addressed by considering data for the NFC or an NFC with similar composition. It may have to be considered furtheron a case-by-case basis, particularly for NFCs with primarily non-vo-latile constituents. If Yes, proceed to Step 13. If No, perform appropriate toxicity tests or obtain further analytical data to reduce the fraction of unidenti ed constituents. Resubmit for further evaluation. Step 13. Are there any additional relevant scienti c considerations that raise a safety concern (e.g. intake by young infants and children)? If Yes, acquire and evaluate additional data required to address the concern before proceeding to Step 14. If No, proceed to Step 14. Step 14. Based on the above data and considerations, the NFC can be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under conditions of intended use as aflavoring ingredient. 3. Discussion on signi cant revisions to the procedure 3.1. Consideration of intake A discussion of the per capita intake PCI \u00d7 10 method ( Rulis et al., 1984 ) was presented in the 2005 procedure and continues to be used in the revised procedure. The PCI \u00d7 10 method for the calculation of in-take is used for NFCs except in instances where a large volume of use was reported and assumes that the volume of use for the NFC is con- sumed by 10% of the population. The PCI \u00d7 10 intake calculationfactors are the volume of use, current population and a conservative correction factor of 0.8 to account for possible unreported volumes of use. FEMA currently conducts industry-wide surveys for volume of use data every ve years use ( Gavin et al., 2008; Harman et al., 2018; Harman et al., 2013; Lucas et al., 1999). In cases where the annualvolume of an NFC exceeds 50,000 lbs (22,700 kg), it is highly unlikely that the NFC is consumed by 10% or less of the population ( Lambe et al., 2002 ) and as a result, consumption is usually calculated based on the entire population. Calculations for per capita intake and consump- tion ratio for Coriander Oil (FEMA 2334) are shown as an example inFig. 2. Within the 2005 version of the procedure, the intake of each con- generic group and the group of unidenti ed constituents is determined from the maximum reported percentage (%) and the daily per capita intake of the NFC is calculated from the annual volume reported in industry surveys. The conservative use of the maximum % versus mean % was used, in part, to compensate for uncertainty in the analytical constituent data. This approach, however, results in an overestimation of the calculated intake for each congeneric group and, consequently, when the intakes of all the congeneric groups and the group of uni- dentied constituents of an NFC are summed, this sum is greater than the intake for the NFC, as calculated by the PCI \u00d7 10 method describedabove. The degree to which the intake is overestimated for each NFC depends on the variability in the collected composition data and may be biased by a single data set. In the revised procedure, this calculation was changed such that the intake of each congeneric group is de- termined from the mean reported percentage (%) in recognition of the fact that technological advances in the analysis of complex mixtures have greatly reduced the variability and uncertainty in the analysis of NFCs. Using this approach, the calculated intakes for the congeneric group and the group of unidenti ed constituents are a more accurate representation of the intake of the NFC as a whole. In Step 5 of the revised procedure, comparison of intake to TTC thresholds, remains ahighly conservative evaluation due to the assignment of the most conservative Cramer decision tree class to the group and use of the inherently conservative TTC approach. When the congeneric groups are assessed, the decision tree class of the group is determined to be the highest class assigned to any one constituent. Thus, in many cases, the toxicological potential determined by decision tree class assigned to a5Provided the intake of the unidenti ed constituents is greater from consumption of the food itself, the intake of unidenti ed constituents from the added NFC is considered trivial. 6This can be based on arguments including: expert judgement; nature of the identi ed ingredients; knowledge on the production/extraction process (see also Koster et al. (2011); EFSA/WHO (2016) ). 7The human exposure threshold of 90 g/person/day is determined from a database of NOAELs obtained from 448 subchronic and chronic studies of substances of the highest toxic potential (structural class III) mainly herbicides, pesticides and pharmacologicallyactive substances ( Munro et al., 1996 was de- termined to be 0.15 mg/kg bw/day which upon incorporation of a 100-fold safety factor for a 60 kg person yielded a human exposure threshold of the 90 g/person/day. How- ever, no flavoring substance or food additive in this structural class exhibited a NOAEL less than 25 mg/kg bw/d. Therefore the 90 g/person/day threshold is an extremely conservative threshold for the types of substances expected in natural flavoring com- plexes. Additional data on other speci c toxic endpoints (e.g., neurotoxicity, reproductive and endocrine disruption) support the use of this threshold value ( Kroes et al., 2000 ).S.M. Cohen et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology 113 (2018) 171-178 175congeneric group is higher than that for one or more constituents within a congeneric group. In addition, in the following step, these intake values are compared to the TTC thresholds. The TTC threshold values are based on the 5th percentiles of the NOAEL of each class with an additional 100-fold safety factor, resulting in a highly conservative threshold for each class ( Kroes et al., 2000; Munro et al., 1996 ). In brief, use of the reported mean percentage (%) to calculate the intake for eachcongeneric group will still result in a conservative safety evaluation. An additional consideration of intake by young infants and children is considered within Step 13. In cases where intake for a congeneric group is within the range of the TTC value, a further evaluation will beconducted to consider possible exposure to children and infants, given their lower body weights and the potential for di erences in tox- icokinetics and toxicodynamics as compared to adults. 3.2. Consideration of metabolism within the updated procedure The progression from Step 3 to Step 4 in the revised procedure diers from the original procedure where if metabolic data could not adequately indicate that the constituents of each congeneric group would be metabolized to innocuous products, the original procedure did not evaluate the congeneric groups against the TTC thresholds. In the revised procedure, the consideration of metabolic data in Step 3 does not preclude application of the TTC concept in Step 5 .I ti srecognized that metabolism is an inherent consideration within the structural class assignments made by the Cramer Decision Tree ( Cramer et al., 1978; EFSA/WHO, 2016 ). For substances for which a metabolic pathway could not be predicted with reasonable con dence, or that would be predicted to metabolize to products of potentially higher toxicconcern, additional considerations are made in Step 13 of the proce- dure. This approach is well-aligned with recent amendments to theevaluation of flavoring substances through the JECFA evaluation pro- cedure ( JECFA, 2016). 3.3. Consideration of genotoxicity of the identi ed constituents in the updated procedure Although consideration of genotoxicity data for the identi ed con- stituents was included in the original procedure, more speci c guidance has been added to this revised procedure. In new Steps 4 and 4a if there are concerns about potential genotoxicity for any of the congeneric groups or speci c constituents that are present (in Step 4), the material is evaluated speci cally for the potential in vivo genotoxicity in Step 4a , before continuing to Step 5. All relevant data should be considered in these steps. A weight of evidence approach based on expert judgement is used to conclude whether a potential for genotoxicity exists for any constituent of the NFC, and whether this potential is biologically re- levant in vivo . If there is an in vivo genotoxicity concern in Step 4a .Fig. 2. Calculation of per capita intake and con- sumption ratio for Coriander Oil FEMA 2334.S.M. Cohen et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology 113 (2018) 171-178 176additional information is required to address the concern before con- tinuing the evaluation. A manuscript on the FEMA Expert Panel's ap- proach to consideration of potential genotoxicity in the evaluation of flavoring ingredients is in preparation. 3.4. Changes in the safety evaluation of unidenti ed constituents InStep 9, a new step in the revised procedure, the evaluation con- siders the possibility of the presence of constituents belonging to theTTC excluded classes among the unidenti ed constituents. The TTC excluded classes contain high potency carcinogens, as well as certainmetals, proteins, steroids, bio-accumulators, nanomaterials and radio- active materials ( Kroes et al., 2004). This step is answered based on the identied constituents of the NFC under consideration, source of ma- terial and process of preparation ( Koster et al., 2011 ). For example, many NFCs are produced by distillation of the botanical or botanicalextract and thus contain only a small percentage of non-volatile con- stituents. Thus, metals and non-volatiles such as a flatoxins, proteins and steroids are not typically found in this type of NFC. If the possibility ofthe presence of constituents belonging to the TTC excluded classes among the unidenti ed constituents is excluded, the evaluation con- tinues to Step 9. If not excluded, the NFC is not appropriate for con- sideration using the procedure. Steps 10, 10a and 10b are new steps in the procedure that evaluate the genotoxic potential of the unidenti ed constituents of the NFC based on its identi ed constituents. The identi ed constituents provide information on the relevant biosynthetic pathways active in the bota- nical from which the NFC is derived. The constituents of an NFC are generally derived from the isoprene pathway, the shikimic acid pathway, the photosynthetic pathway and the lipoxygenase oxidation of lipids, resulting in chemical pro les with predictable structural variation ( Schwab et al., 2008) and generally lacking structural alerts for genotoxicity. However, if the identi ed constituents of an NFC have a biologically relevant structural alert for genotoxicity, further eva- luation is conducted in Steps 10a and 10b. If it is determined that there is no concern for genotoxic potential from the unidenti ed constituents, the evaluation proceeds to Step 11. Step 10a tests whether the per capita intake of the unidenti ed constituents in the NFC exceeds 0.15 g/person/day, the TTC threshold previously established for chemicals that would be considered potentialgenotoxic compounds ( Kroes et al., 2004; Rulis, 1989 ). If the intake of the unidenti ed constituents is less than 0.15 g/person/day and thus of negligible concern, the evaluation progresses to Step 13 . If the intake is greater than this threshold, the evaluation progresses to Step 10b.I n Step 10b, genotoxicity data on the NFC are considered and if negative, provide adequate evidence to exclude concerns of genotoxicity and the evaluation proceeds to Step 11 . If negative genotoxicity data are not available for the NFC or for NFCs of similar composition, the evaluationcannot proceed until additional data become available to address the concern. Steps 11 and 12, which are identical to Steps 9 and 10 in the original procedure, test whether the per capita intake of the unidenti edconstituents in the NFC exceeds 90 g/person/day, the TTC threshold for Class III substances ( Kroes et al., 2000; Munro et al., 1996). As in the original procedure, the group of unidenti ed constituents, if not of concern for genotoxicity, are treated as a group and assigned thehighest toxicity potential, Class III in the Cramer classi cation scheme. If the intake is below the 90 g/person/day TTC threshold, the eva- luation continues to Step 13 . If the intake exceeds this threshold, the evaluation proceeds to Step 12 and the toxicological data are analyzed for the NFC or closely related NFCs with a similar composition. If an adequate margin of safety can be determined in Step 12 , the analysis proceeds to Step 13. The safety evaluation concludes in Steps 13 and 14, which are identical to Steps 11 and 12 in the original guide. In Step 13, any re- levant data on the NFC not previously examined are considered. For example, unique metabolic considerations from Step 3, studies on po- tential interactions of the NFC or its constituents, or constituents thatwould present a unique potential safety concern, would be considered in this step. 4. Conclusions An eective and thorough approach for the safety evaluation of NFCs was published in 2005 and has been applied for the evaluation of NFCs for GRAS status by the FEMA Expert Panel. The revised procedure reported here retains the core approaches of organizing constituents into congeneric groups and comparing the intake of those groups re- lative to established TTC values. It updates the previous procedure by including a more rigorous consideration of the unidenti ed con- stituents, by utilizing mean versus maximum percentage when de-termining intake for each congeneric group, and by further assessing the genotoxic potential of constituents. The revised procedure is being utilized in a multi-year project to conduct safety re-evaluations of more than 250 NFCs that have uses currently considered FEMA GRAS. Thescope of the project includes botanically derived essential oils, extracts and oleoresins of various origin and will be covered in future publica- tions. In addition, future NFC evaluations for FEMA GRAS status under conditions of intended use as flavoring ingredients will rely on this revised procedure. Finally, the updated procedure described could bemore generally employed in the safety evaluation of complex mixtures. Declaration of interests Drs.
