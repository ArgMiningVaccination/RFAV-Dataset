Eliot says: \"What we've done is we've developed a regenerative building system. So what does that mean? It means we went the full mile, if you will, to really go back to square one and look at how we build a home and leave no stone unturned to really make sure that everything-all of the inputs going into this home-are truly as close as they possibly can be to coming from a harmonious relationship with our planet.\" To hear more, listen to the full episode of Roots to Renewal wherever you get your podcasts, or on our website [here](https://hawthornevalley.org/roots-to-renewal-podcast/?mc_cid=10047fda89&mc_eid=b24f72f5f1).
