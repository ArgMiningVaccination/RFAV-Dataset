Harmful chemicals and industrial pollutants are pervasive in the air we breathe, the water we drink and bathe in, the foods we eat, our daily bath & body products, vehicles, and the furniture, paints and cleaners in our homes and workplaces. Because these substances are unrecognizable to the body and the organs that normally flush out organic waste, they often get stored in the cells and accumulate over time. This can result in unexplained sluggishness, pain, diseases and even death. A toxic body may manifest a variety of symptoms: - Fatigue, low energy and fuzzy thinking - Unexplained headaches - General joint stiffness, swelling, aches and pains - Skin problems (rashes, acne, etc.) - Food and scent intolerances/allergies - Indegistion, constipation, diarrhea and other digestive issues - Frequent colds, viruses and infections - Insomnia, anxiety and inability to feel rested after sleep - Inability to lose/gain weight Benefits of natural detoxification: - Proven to Support Digestion, Nutrient Absorption, Healthy Metabolism and Elimination - Reestablishes a Healthy Intestinal Microbiome - Boosts Strong Immune Response toPathogens and Viral/Bacterial Infections - Improves the Symptoms of Autoimmune Diseases and Food, Skin & Seasonal Allergies - Decreases the Harmful Effects of Daily Stressand Exposure to Environmental Pollutants - Increased energy and mental sharpness The Corrective 6 Day Detox Kit is a truly complete approach to detoxification Each part of the kit addresses different aspects of whole body detoxification and should only be administered along with nutritional counseling under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider Functional Nutrition + Nutritional Counseling OptiCleanse GHI is a comprehensive, fructose-free, low-allergy-potential dietary supplement designed to support GI function and balanced detoxification. ColonX is designed to support GI regularity. How well the body digests and assimilates metabolic fuel and eliminates waste determines health at the cellular level. Gastrointestinal elimination also plays a major role in detoxification by expelling the remnants of toxic molecules. If these harmful remnants are not eliminated, they can recirculate in the body. Drainage combines homeopathic \"drainers\" with remedies that support excretory function and address symptoms of toxicity. Toxic accumulation can occur from external sources, such as pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides, and from internal sources, such as stress and inadequate nutrition, which lead to undesirable changes in metabolic function. ProbioMax Daily DF is a vegetarian, dairy- and gluten-free, four-strain probiotic formula that benefits health by (1) supporting metabolic activity and nutrient absorption; (2) maintaining a healthy balance of organisms in the intestinal tract; (3) helping to establish populations of good bacteria after disruption in balance; (4) supporting immune function; (5) promoting intestinal epithelial cell survival; (6) supporting healthy bowel function; and (7) detoxification. A Functional Nutrition Program is provided with the kit. Dr Carnes will walk you through the dietary guidelines. The included high-quality supplements and functional foods are clinically tested to support healthy body composition and the body's natural detoxification mechanism, are hypoallergenic, anti-inflammation and are generally well-tolerated. When Combined with a Nutritional Detox Program Infrared Sauna Therapy Can Expedite Deep Tissue Detoxification Infrared light (experienced as heat) is the invisible part of the sun's spectrum with the ability to penetrate human tissue, providing a soothing, natural warmth. Sunlighten's infrared technology is therapeutic because it is 99% efficient at heating the body directly rather than simply heating the air. It works to raise the core body temperature to produce a deep, detoxifying sweat at the cellular level where the majority of toxins reside.
