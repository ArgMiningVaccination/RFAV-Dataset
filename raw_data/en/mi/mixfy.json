He is member of the clinical division in the Program in Immunology at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Jensen holds the Janet and Jim Sinegal Endowed Chair in Pediatric Solid Tumor Research in Honor of Korey Rose. Dr. Michael Jensen graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine then completed training in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. His laboratory work began under the mentorship of Dr. Philip Greenberg, Program Head in Immunology, Fred Hutch and focused on the immunobiology of tumor-specific T cells. Following completion of his fellowship, Dr. Jensen joined the faculty at the City of Hope National Medical Center, where he built a translational research program integrating gene therapy and cellular immunotherapy for cancer. This program grew into the Department of Cancer Immunotherapeutics & Tumor Immunology within the Beckman Research Institute and was incorporated into the institution's NCI-Comprehensive Cancer Center as the Cancer Immunotherapeutics Program with Dr. Jensen as its leader. During his tenure at City of Hope, Dr. Jensen's research program placed a strong emphasis on bench-to-bedside translational research and resulted in seven FDA-authorized Investigational New Drug Applications covering first-in-human applications of adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells having redirected tumor specificity for lymphoma, neuroblastoma and malignant gliomas. In 2010, Dr. Jensen joined the University of Washington School of Medicine faculty as a Professor of Pediatrics and is the founding director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research. He holds the Janet and Jim Sinegal endowed chair in pediatric cancer research. Dr. Jensen is an adjunct professor of Bioengineering and Neurological Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a joint member of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch. Dr. Jensen is an Associate Head of the Immunology and Vaccine Development Program of the UW-Fred Hutch Cancer Consortium and is a SU2C Dream Team Principal Investigator on the recently awarded Pediatric Cancer Research Immunogenomics Dream Team award. - Related Pages - At Seattle Children's, the Jensen Lab is pursuing a cutting-edge treatment that reprograms a child's defense system to attack and kill cancer cells, without chemotherapy or radiation - or their debilitating side effects. - - - Dr. Jensen was in his Fellowship at Seattle Children's in 1994-1995 and was instrumental in my battle with Non-Hogkins. It was a scary time, but his ability to explain the processes, side-affects, and outlook was confident and caring for my parents and myself. As a patient and a child, I wanted to know what was going on and why. Dr. Jensen took the time to converse candidly with me about the cancer, the treatments, and the schedule. I think these conversations helped me to not fear the cancer or the treatments, that the only thing to fear is what I do not know. Dr. Jensen and the team at Seattle Children's have a beautiful vision and I have hope and confidence they will make it happen. Contrary to what I was told were possibilities: The salt in the pepperoni sticks that were the only thing I wanted to eat during treatment, didn't hurt me. The sun might have been bad for the skin because of the treatments, but it was great for my spirit (my Dermatologist does agree that I should stay away from it though). The infertility rate of childhood cancer survivors went down about 6 years ago when my wife Kristy and I welcomed our son, Jonathan. We also have a daughter, Kaleah (16 months). I closed my account at \"the bank\" after finding out I didn't need what was deposited. I would encourage anyone who was treated for childhood cancer by any doctor or hospital to participate in a \"Long Term Follow-Up\" study. Doing so creates a wealth of knowledge and helps communicate the need for Doctor Jensen's research. These studies document the impact of childhood cancer and treatments on survivors and their quality of life. Thank You Dr. Jensen for your continued care in the battle, Nathan Schauermann Survivor, Non-Hogkins T-cell Lymphoma - Dr. Jensen was my pediatric oncologist at a California hospital before he moved to Seattle Children's; and before I met him I was given a 30% chance to live. That was 12 years ago. To Dr. Jensen you are more than just a chart, number, or disease, you are a human being. His bedside manner, I have yet to see duplicated, and when he told me I was cancer free and would no longer need treatments, I cried, because I was going to miss HIM. I'm happy to say that I am doing well and I'm getting ready to celebrate my 25th birthday, a birthday I likely would not have had if not for Dr. Jensen. Thank you doctor for everything you have done for pediatric cancer patients everywhere, and for giving me my life back! - - Other Publications - Jensen MC, Riddell SRDesign and implementation of adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells. 24329794 Immunological reviews, 2014 Jan. : 257(1)127-44 -
