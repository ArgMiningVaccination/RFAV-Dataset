However, it is hard to tell which air fresheners are helping you and which are harming you. There have been many instances of scented wall plug-ins having destructive effects on people and even their pets. It is essential to know what air fresheners to avoid and what air fresheners are reasonable and will keep you safe and your house smelling nice. Health experts are concerned about plug-in air fresheners because of the Phthalates. Phthalates are chemicals that help make plastic soft and flexible. According to a [Natural Resources Defense Council ](https://www.indoordoctor.com/blog/health-hazards-plug-air-fresheners/#:~:text=serious%20lung%20infections.-,Compounding%20the%20risks%20posed%20by%20formaldehyde%2C%20most%20major%20brands%20of,causes%20similar%20effects%20in%20humans.)(NRDC) study, almost 86% of all air fresheners have been tested and showed Phthalates. Phthalates are found in other products, such as aerosol sprays, paints, fragrances, cosmetics, and plastics, and have been known to cause disruption to the body. NRDC also reported that Phthalates could cause issues with a male producing testosterone and have also been known to cause other reproductive issues. Phthalates are on California's list of toxic substances because they are known to cause birth defects and reproductive harm. Phthalates can also trigger allergic reactions and asthma. The UK's Public Health Center for Radiation, Chemical, and Environmental Hazards have also stated that air fresheners also hold another toxic element known as Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a human carcinogen that has been linked to cancers of the throat and nose. According to the US government's National Toxicology Program, it can also cause irritation to the throat and airways and lead to infections, asthma, nosebleeds, and other respiratory issues. Plug-in air fresheners also contain a chemical called naphthalene. Naphthalene has been linked to causing tissue damage and cancer of the lungs.
