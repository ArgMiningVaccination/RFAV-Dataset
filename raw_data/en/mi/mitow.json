The purpose of this program is to help you learn and practice skills that will help you personally and professionally to become more resilient in the face of stress, more clinically effective in helping patients, and more mindful in your daily life as you learn the latest scientific research about mind-body skills, engage in reflective practices, and use our free online recordings of evidence-based mind-body practices. Whether you are a seasoned professional or still in training, you will find helpful information and practices to address the needs of the patients and clients for whom you care. There are twelve 1-hour modules arranged in four clusters: - Relaxation Response (stabilizing attention while decreasing stress) - Mindfulness (cultivating non-judgmental, curious attention) - Heart-centered practices (cultivating positive cognitive-emotional states) - Guided Imagery and Hypnosis (using focused attention and imagination to achieve goals) Convenience: Modules can be completed from any computer, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Most modules take about one hour to complete. You can repeat any module as often as you like, and you can download the MP3 recordings to a smartphone or other device to listen to wherever you like! Please feel free to share the MP3 recordings with colleagues and patients.

Integrative care is personalized, participatory, relationship-based care, promoting optimal health. It emphasizes the healing of the whole person to achieve each individual's unique physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and social health goals. The primary therapies used to achieve these goals are healthy habits (nutrition, activity, sleep, mindful self-care, and fellowship) in a healthy habitat (social, natural, and built environment). Integrative healthcare skillfully uses the best of both conventional and complementary strategies to attain patients' health goals. Research About This Course Kemper, K. (2016).
