STAR OUT PATIENT CARE INSURANCE POLICY Health Insurance with OPD cover Buying a health insurance policy is usually not on the top of our priority list. It is often looked at as an unnecessary expense. Rarely do we understand the safety that health insurance policies offer. As humans, we certainly don't expect to be admitted for major illnesses/diseases and often feel we don't need a health insurance policy. But unfortunately, we do fall sick. These conditions would have certainly taken you to a clinic or a hospital from the common cold to the cough to diarrhea or allergies. Did you know that OPD expenses in India account for over 60% of total health care costs? Yes, you read that right. And while paying Rs 500 per consultation may not seem like a lot, the cumulative expenses incurred over the year certainly cannot be taken for granted. There could be various reasons for spending on health care, and one way to mitigate these expenses is by buying an insurance policy. You need not be hospitalised or require an in-patient stay to avail of the benefits provided by the policy. Keeping all this in mind, we have devised the Star Out Patient Care Insurance Policy. This policy will help you overcome OPD costs, so you need not stress and worry if you happen to fall sick. While you may need to be admitted to a hospital for some conditions, most illnesses do not require hospitalisation and treatments for such ailments fall under outpatient care. Outpatient care involves all treatment that a patient received without being admitted to the hospital. Eg. Consultation fees, vitamin supplements, antibiotics. Just imagine the amount of money you could save on most common outpatient procedures like tests, scans, having a consultation in hospital with a specialist or getting a tooth filled at a dentist's clinic, etc. What is the Out Patient care policy? - Out-patient medical consultation - Non-allopathic treatment expenses - Diagnostics, physiotherapy and pharmacy expenses - Dental and ophthalmic treatment expenses |Subject||Criteria| |Entry Age||18 years to 50 years| Renewal discount - 25% on the premium after every block of 2 continuous claim free years 5% - for purchase of policy online |Waiting Periods||PED- 48/24/12 months (silver/Gold/Platinum respectively)||Initial waiting period limit||Description of cover| |Out Patient Consultation||Up to S.I bonus if any||Covers Outpatient expenses incurred at any networked facility in India.| |Non-allopathic treatment expenses||Covered||Covers non-allopathic treatment for those inclined to AYUSH treatments up to sum insured.| |Diagnostics, physiotherapy and pharmacy expenses||Covered||Get your expenses covered incurred on diagnostics, physiotherapy and pharmacy at any networked facility in India.| |Dental and ophthalmic treatment expenses||Covered||Dental and Ophthalmic treatment expenses arising out of accident incurred at any Networked Facility in India is covered.| Difference between Daycare treatment and OPD treatment Day Care Treatments: Generally, in order to make a claim against your health insurance, you must be hospitalized for a minimum of 24 hours. However, certain treatments are no longer require 24 hours of hospitalisation as they used to be due to technological advancements. In the past, for example, a patient receiving a cataract operation would be required to stay in the hospital for several days after surgery. As a result of technological advancement, surgery can now be performed on the same day as the patient is discharged from the hospital. Such type of treatment falls under the policy definition of covered treatment if it is included in your policy. OPD Treatments: Outpatient Department, or OPD, treatment refers to the situation in which a patient may visit a doctor or medical practitioner for the purpose of seeking advice, tests, X-rays, investigations, diagnostics physiotherapy etc. It might seem that Day Care and OPD treatments are similar because they involve a shorter amount of time. Hospitalization is the most significant difference between the two. A Day Care procedure, even if it takes less time, is performed in a hospital and only then you will be able to claim your medical expenses under a Day Care treatment. Treatments for OPD do not require hospitalisation. The nature of OPD treatment is that it is possible to get the treatment without being admitted to a hospital or clinic. A root canal treatment is a good example to understand the same. A root canal can be done either in a hospital or clinic without actually being admitted, and therefore falls under the OPD category. A dental surgery done in the event of an accident, however, may result in a day care treatment. Why should you buy an Out Patient Care Insurance Policy? The cost of medical care is rising at an unabated pace in India, and it makes health insurance a necessity than a choice. OPD treatments have become very normal today. Who isn't visiting a doctor for fever, blood sugar test, ECG, x-rays, or frequenting a family physician or a consultant? Usually, outpatient treatments come as an add-on to existing policies or benefit from accompanying a standard policy because every person has their requirements and needs when choosing a health insurance policy that suits their pocket. By having an OP cover and an in-patient cover, the person is completely covered. On the contrary, even a healthy person is more likely to visit a doctor for medical conditions, which are not serious enough for hospitalisation, for instance, tooth filling or a few appointments with your general practitioner. As age advances, regular health checkups become a part of life. If you are a person taking regular health check-ups, such expenses are covered under OP care. Unfortunately, the cost of dental treatments, diagnostic tests, periodic doctor consultation, preventive check-ups and medicines can range anywhere from a thousand to 1 lakh. Having said that, the outpatient cover will be more apt for a healthy person and for anyone who frequently visits the hospitals and clinics, and the expenses you incur no longer need to be paid from your pocket.
