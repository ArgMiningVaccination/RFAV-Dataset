DEFINITON Complementary and alternative medicine is a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well being (O'Connor et al 1997). PHILOSOPHY OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Focuses on empowering the individual to accept responsibility for at least a part of the task of recovery and future health maintenance Emphasises sound nutrition as a core requirement for health Recommends a balanced lifestyle, adequate and appropriate exercise, rest, sleep and relaxation as prerequisites for a state of good health2 PHILOSOPHY OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Attempts to ensure detoxification and the efficacy of the organs and systems of the body Recognises the importance of the musculoskeletal system as a potential source of interference with nerve transmission and the body's energy pathways, and as a reflection of the individuals internal physical and emotional state Most importantly, treats the individual instead of his or her symptoms CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE USERS The majority of individuals use CAM in conjunction with conventional medicine.

PRAYER AND SPIRITUALITY Most commonly used among the entire CAM therapies Mind-body medicine Prayer and spirituality is used own and others health EFFICACY OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Advocates of alternative medicine hold that the various alternative treatment methods are effective in treating a wide range of major and minor medical condition. Placebo effect Evidence-based medicine There is paucity of multi-institutional RCTs BELIEF IN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE EFFICACY There are: social/cultural psychological reasons for beliefs in CAM efficacy SOCIAL OR CULTURAL REASONS The low level of scientific literacy among the public at large An increase in anti-intellectualism and antiscientific attitudes riding on the coattails of new age mysticism Vigorous marketing of extravagant claims by the \"alternative\" medical community Inadequate media scrutiny and attacking critics Increasing social malaise (conspiracy theories) and mistrust of traditional authority figures - the anti doctor backlash Dislike of the delivery methods of scientific biomedicine. PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS The placebo effect The will to believe Self-serving biases that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning Demand characteristics - the obligation to respond in kind when someone does them a good turn Psychological distortion, such as confirmation bias and Cognitive dissonance (inability to respond to criticism of alternative medicine in order to reduce one's cognitive dissonance) 7 RESEARCH There is very little research on the safety or efficacy of Complementary and alternative medicine published. Complex, individualised treatments and lack of standardisation of herbal medicines Difficulties in accruing, randomising, and retaining patients and in identifying appropriate placebo interventions. ADVERSE EFFECTS Most unfortunate and dangerous public misconception about alternative medications is the belief that just because something is natural it is automatically safe. ADVERSE EFFECTS Interactions with conventional medicine Decreasing the activity of conventional medicines Side effect of Herbal products Herbal medicine may contain toxic plant material or heavy metals Infection and Trauma from Acupuncture CRITICISM OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Find little or no proof No accredited medical degree Efficacy of the treatments has not been demonstrated through double-blind randomised controlled trials Delay in seeking treatment Placebo effect CONCLUSIONS Health professionals should be mindful of their patient's cultural beliefs, mores and behaviours. Awareness of Complementary and alternative therapy patient may be taking alongside their prescrib ed treatment may play an important role in providing quality care and avoiding adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS Some of the complementary and alternative therapies are on the bord er of acceptance by the medical profession where as others have little evidence behind them are still viewed with much scepticism.
