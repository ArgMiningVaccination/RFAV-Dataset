Vox Sanguinis International Forum on transfusion services about response to COVID-19. Vox Sanguinis 2020 May 8. A new, rapid test for COVID-19 antibody detection In collaboration with Monash BioPRIA and Chemical Engineering, TRU researchers have contributed to development of a new assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The world-first research was published on 17 July 2020 in the prestigious journal ACS Sensors. The test incubates patient plasma or serum with reagent red blood cells previously coated with short peptides representing pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and uses red cell agglutination to determine a positive or negative result. The new assay, using column agglutination cards and automated readers already widely available in pathology laboratories, gives results in 20 minutes and could be used for high-throughput screening. \"We found that by producing bioconjugates of anti-D-IgG and peptides from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and immobilising these to RRBCs, selective agglutination in gel cards was observed in the plasma collected from patients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to healthy plasma and negative controls,\" said Professor Gil Garnier, Director of BioPRIA.

Fiona Stanley Prize for NHMRC Synergy Grant Professor Erica Wood was delighted to receive the inaugural Fiona Stanley Prize for the top-ranked 2019 Synergy grant: \"Addressing Australia's national transfusion research priorities\". It was extra-special that Professor Stanley herself presented the award at the NHMRC Research Excellence Awards dinner, held in Canberra in March 2020. Victorian Cancer Agency Clinical Research Fellowship for A/Prof Zoe McQuilten Congratulations to A/Prof Zoe McQuilten who has been awarded a 5-year Victorian Cancer Agency Clinical Research Fellowship. This funding will support her work on the IMPACT program: Immunoglobulin replacement versus Prophylactic Antibiotics to prevent infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia due to blood Cancers Trials. Immunoglobulin products made from donated plasma are routinely used to supplement antibody levels to prevent infections for patients with blood cancers such as myeloma and lymphoma. However, treatment of these disorders has changed dramatically since the original studies on immunoglobulin replacement were conducted, and there is little up-to-date evidence on optimal use of these blood products or alternative therapies. Zoe will continue and expand the TRU clinical trials program to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from immunoglobulin and whether alternatives, such as antibiotics, could also be effective, aiming to improve patient outcomes, reduce risks and costs, and improve stewardship of these precious community resources. NHMRC Synergy Grant kicks off with planning day The investigators of the successful NHMRC Synergy grant met for the first time on 21st February to get underway with the 5-year program of work: \"Addressing Australia's national transfusion research priorities.\" Main themes of the research include major haemorrhage and massive transfusion, prevention and management of bleeding and anaemia in patients with blood cancers, bleeding and platelet transfusions in patients with critical illness, and efficient and effective use of immunoglobulins.

The project will provide new information to clinicians, patients, health services and policy makers on current transfusion needs for MDS patients, and inform policy development and health resource allocation. 2000th patient recruited to the Lymphoma and Related Diseases Registry Congratulations to the team at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, who recruited the 2000th patient to the Lymphoma and Related Diseases Registry (LaRDR) on 9th May 2019. Managed by TRU, and established with a pilot in 2016, LaRDR is now open at 17 sites across Australia, collecting data on non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Several collaborative research projects are underway using the registry, and more are planned. Further information is available at Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry participates in Myeloma UK patient workshop As part of the Myeloma Patient Registry Stakeholder Workshop, held in London on 5th April 2019, the MRDR was pleased to be invited to provide information on our experience in developing a myeloma registry in Australia and New Zealand. Myeloma UK is scoping out a project to establish a registry, and MRDR Research Fellow Dr Elizabeth Moore recorded a narrated slide presentation to share at the workshop, covering research and operational aspects, including governance and funding. Recruitment completed for the RATIONAL trial Thanks and congratulations to all patients, site staff and investigators involved in the RATIONAL study. The study completed recruitment in March 2019. Funded by the National Blood Authority, RATIONAL is a phase II, randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing the efficacy of prophylactic immunoglobulin with prophylactic antibiotics in patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to haematological malignancies. Patients enrolled in the trial are randomised to receive either immunoglobulin replacement therapy, or prophylactic oral antibiotics. The primary outcome is adherence to and acceptability of assigned treatment, with secondary outcomes including infectious outcomes, admissions, costs and quality of life being followed for 12 months. More information is available at 2,500th patient recruited to the MRDR Among its registry projects, TRU manages the Congratulations to Christchurch Hospital in New Zealand who recruited the 2,500th patient! Ultimately, MRDR data will help clinicians and hospitals to provide the best possible care to people with myeloma and MGUS and allow evaluation of the translation of advances in therapy (such as the introduction of new targeted therapies) into long-term outcomes, outside the setting of clinical trials. More information on the MRDR and its projects is available at: 400th patient recruited to the TREATT trial TREATT is a collaboration between the NHS Blood and Transplant in the UK and Monash University. The Australian arm of the trial is funded by the NHMRC and the Australian and New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion. Ten Australian hospitals are currently participating. More information is available at Congratulations to the team at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne who recruited the 400th patient! TRU at the American Society of Hematology conference Prof Erica Wood, A/Prof Zoe McQuilten and Dr Lucy Fox represented TRU at the recent ASH meeting in San Diego. Data from the UK-Canada-Australian REDDS pilot study of red cell transfusion in patients with myelodysplasia were presented as an oral abstract by Dr David Bowen, with Zoe McQuilten as a co-author. See abstract 527: A Feasibility Randomized Trial of Red Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Myelodysplasia.

ICAN study - Immunoglobulin use in Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia And Non-Hodgkin lymphoma - funded by the National Blood Authority Patients with certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), are at increased risk of infections due to the effects of their disease and treatment on levels of protective antibodies. Immunoglobulin therapy (made from donated plasma) is commonly used to prevent infections by replacing protective antibodies in this patient group, and is one of the most common and fastest growing indications in Australia. Availability of novel treatments with profound and protracted immunosuppressive effects will likely mean that immunoglobulin demand will continue to grow. However, there is limited evidence from clinical studies to guide clinicians on which patients are most likely to benefit, when to commence treatment, or for how long. The role of other strategies to prevent infection, such as prophylactic antibiotics and immunisations, have not been well studied. Working with the Australian Lymphoma and Related Disease Registry and the newly established CLL Registry, both managed by TRU, the ICAN project will collect data on current immunoglobulin replacement and other infection prevention strategies, as well as patient-centred outcomes, in Australian patients with CLL and NHL. In a subgroup of participants, the study will also collect serial blood samples for novel immune-profiling studies. The ICAN investigators are Zoe McQuilten, Erica Wood and Neil Waters from Monash University's Transfusion Research Unit; other Monash University colleagues Orla Morrissey, Stephen Opat, Jonathan Wong and John Zalcberg; Philip Crispin from Canberra Hospital; Stephen Mulligan and Kyle Crassini from Royal North Shore Hospital/University of Sydney; and Monica Slavin and Benjamin Teh from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre/ NHRMC National Centre for Infections in Cancer. NHMRC success with the ASPREE-CHIP study for TRU's A/Prof Zoe McQuilten and colleagues A/Prof Zoe McQuilten and colleagues have been awarded $1.416 million for a study of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) in the elderly. This project will investigate CHIP in participants from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, a randomised controlled trial of daily low-dose aspirin or placebo in over 19,000 elderly but otherwise well individuals ( CHIP is the presence of a haematological malignancy-associated somatic mutation in blood or marrow without evidence of haematological disease. CHIP is increasingly common with increasing age, and is associated with risk of haematological cancers, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. Mouse models support a causative link between CHIP and development of atherosclerosis. However, very few studies have been performed in humans to date, and fundamental gaps remain in our understanding. Using ASPREE trial data on incident haematological cancers, cardiovascular events, stroke, dementia and all-cause mortality, and biobanked samples at baseline and 3 years, we will study CHIP and its clinical consequences. We will also investigate the role of inflammation, and whether reducing inflammation through use of low-dose aspirin alters incidence, progression and consequences of CHIP. Investigators on the NHMRC-funded grant are: Zoe McQuilten and Erica Wood from Monash University's Transfusion Research Unit, other Monash University colleagues David Curtis, Rory Wolfe, Paul Lacaze, John McNeil, Andrew Murphy, Moeen Riaz, Nick Wong and Robyn Woods, and Robert Sebra Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA.

Sharing Massive Transfusion Registry data with transfusion practitioners Dr Rosemary Sparrow and Mrs Helen Haysom provided an update on the Massive Transfusion Registry as part of the Blood Matters Transfusion Forum in November. The MTR now has data on over 8,000 cases of critical bleeding from 29 hospitals across all clinical contexts, including trauma, obstetrics, surgery and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. An additional 20 sites are in the process of joining. The MTR is proving valuable for both research and for clinical practice improvement and benchmarking, and data are provided to participating sites via hospital data reports, letters and presentations. Results have been presented this year at the BLOOD 2018 conference in Brisbane, the International Society of Blood Transfusion congress in Toronto, and the AABB conference in Boston, as well as through several publications. Current MTR research projects include analyses of: If you have an idea for a project using MTR data, please get in touch with us: TRU at BLOOD 2018 conference The Transfusion Research Unit was well represented at the recent Australian and New Zealand annual haematology and transfusion conference, TRU's exhibition booth was a great opportunity to profile the Unit's research and hold informal discussions with delegates. Breakfast meetings for the lymphoma and myeloma registries included presentations by invited speakers as well as review of registry data and project updates, and were well attended by clinicians and industry partners. Dr Rosemary Sparrow awarded honorary membership of BEST Collaborative Congratulations to Rosemary for being made an honorary member for her previous and ongoing contributions to BEST and transfusion research, and becoming the first Australian to be awarded this honour.

More information is available at: trial in transplant-ineligible myeloma - the FRAIL-M study - funded by the Medical Research Future Fund TRU's Zoe McQuilten, Erica Wood, Elizabeth Moore and Cameron Wellard are investigators on the FRAIL-M study. The project will utilise the infrastructure of the Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry (MRDR) managed by Monash University's Transfusion Research Unit. Professor Andrew Spencer (Monash University/Alfred Hospital) is Chief Investigator A on FRAIL-M and chair of the MRDR Steering Committee. Funding of $1.642 million has been awarded by the MRFF through its call for applications for \"Low Survival Cancers and Diseases\". Current Australian guidelines recommend that up-front therapy for transplant-ineligible myeloma patients should be either bortezomib- or lenlidomide-based regimens, with dosing adjusted according to patient frailty. However, adapting treatment dose according to frailty assessment has not been tested in a clinical trial. FRAIL-M is a stratified randomised controlled trial to identify which competing treatment options are more appropriate in transplant-ineligible myeloma patients according to frailty status. Participants will be stratified into three groups (fit, intermediate-fit or frail) based on a standardised and validated frailty assessment, and randomised to a bortezomib- vs a lenalidomide-based regimen, with dosing adjusted according to frailty stratum. A Bayesian Optimal Phase II design will allow us to jointly monitor efficacy and toxicity, with further adjustments if individual treatment arms appear either too toxic or ineffective. The FRAIL-M investigators are Andrew Spencer, Zoe McQuilten, Hang Quach, Peter Mollee, Erica Wood, John Reynolds, Ruth Hubbard, Richard De Abreu Lourenco, Cameron Wellard, Elizabeth Moore, Madeleine King, Steve Roach and Tracy King. TRU congratulates Dr Nicholas Saadah who was awarded his PhD from the University of Leiden on 11 September 2018 Nic was an academic visitor to Monash during 2017, working on a range of transfusion research projects. Prof Erica Wood from the TRU was a member of the PhD defence panel for the University of Leiden. The Asia-Pacific Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry has opened to recruitment at Samsung Medical Center in Korea! The The registry was established in 2018 by Monash University, and in collaboration with participating pilot hospitals in Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and is affiliated with the Australian and New Zealand Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry (ANZ MRDR). The APAC MRDR aims to provide health care services and researchers an important resource for investigating the best possible treatment options for people with these conditions. The Registry will tell us about: The Registry will also form a network of clinical experts from the Asia-Pacific region with a special interest in myeloma and related diseases.
