It is possible to feel, among friends, family or co-workers, that people are a little tired of the purely materialistic answers, which no longer realize the modern yearnings. Far beyond \"things\", it is natural to arouse in this scenario the interest and the search for a greater understanding of human experiences from a spiritual perspective. In this sense, and contrary to the rush required by the market, a philosophy has been gaining more and more adherents: anthroposophy. From the Greek \"knowledge of the human being\", the term was introduced in the early twentieth century by the Austrian Rudolf Steiner and can be characterized as a method of knowledge of the human nature and the universe. Anthroposophy intends to expand the knowledge obtained by the conventional scientific method and its application in practically all areas of human life. Including, most currently, within corporations, to train leaders, coaching and development projects within large companies. Steiner believed that to extend the clarity of the scientific method to the phenomena of human soul life and spiritual experiences, new faculties of objective spiritual perception had to be developed. The steps in this process of internal development, according to Peter Schneider in Introduction to Waldorf Education, were identified by him as the conscious range of imagination, inspiration, and intuition. The results of this form of spiritual research, the philosopher argued, should be expressed in a way that could be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of the natural sciences. Applied to the work environment, anthroposophy is a worldview that adds self-knowledge, integration and understanding about other people, whether a colleague or a client. For those who apply the method on a daily basis, it is not enough to produce: there must be a sense in everything that is done. In practice this translates into empathy as a premise, in listening to each other carefully, understanding their dynamics and seeking individual solutions. It is trying to go beyond the problem led by the client, seeking to understand their life model, their way of thinking and consequently their spiritual side. From a management point of view, anthroposophy encourages rethinking processes and relationships in companies. This secular philosophy suggests that organizations are not impersonal institutions: as people, they also have a \"life story\" and \"development phases\". This \"fourfold\" view of companies, as Steiner called it, involves four qualitative levels: Identity: Which implies a mission and a biography (consciousness and intuition); Relationships: This includes everything that cannot be controlled or systematized, such as climate, motivation, leadership and communication; Processes: Information and flows, which do not take up space but run over time, and can therefore, be predicted logically; Resources: Material factors that can be measured, such as equipment, facilities, and capital. At the end of the day, the great challenge for managers is to gain the awareness and the different skills needed to be able to operate at all these levels and thus to run the business effectively. After all, entrepreneurship is an activity that, because it involves people and the unpredictable behavior of different personalities, often transcends reason. This is why most companies that rely only on the scientific method, rather than on new approaches to solving relationships and identity problems, often end up with irreversible damage to their teams. And if anthroposophy sounds like something metaphysical close to science, it is worth remembering that the scientific method was conceived from a dream in which Ren\u00e9 Descartes had the vision of an angel, who asked the French philosopher to trust his new science, and thus I would know the world by measure and number. _________________________________________________________ "}
