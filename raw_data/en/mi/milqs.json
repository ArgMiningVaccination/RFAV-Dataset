The network of organs, cells, proteins, and small molecules that constitute the immune system is nature' s most agile and proficient fighting force against disease. Y et all too often, cancer slips past it. Cancer' s strategy for dealing with the immune system is one of avoidance rather than engagement. Instead of confronting or outdueling the immune system, cancer sur-vives by lying low. Tumor cells, it turns out, can be quite passive-aggressive. As you'll read in this issue of Paths of Progress, Dana-Farber' s Gordon Freeman, PhD, and his colleagues discovered one of the ways that tumor cells protect themselves: by girding themselves in proteins that, when locked onto corresponding proteins on immune sys-tem cells, prevent an immune system attack on the tumor. This discovery, made more than a decade ago, suggest- ed that drugs that interfere with the binding of the protein strands could unleash the immune system' s full cancer-fighting abilities. Today, some of the most exciting clinical trials in cancer medicine involve drugs that do just that. The trials, being conducted at research centers around the country, show that patients who benefit from these drugs often experience cancer remissions that last for years. In retrospect, it isn't surprising that a discovery of this magnitude should emerge from Dana-Farber laboratories. Research in immunology has been one of the Institute' s strengths for decades, particularly since Baruj Benacerraf, MD, who won a Nobel prize for his work in the field, served as president of Dana-Farber from 1980-1992. The advances in immunotherapy are indicative of how discoveries made in the laboratory can come to fruition, often many years later, in the form of new and better cancer treatments. Some of the other stories in this issue - such as one on CanSeq, a new system for identifying abnormal DNA sequences in the genes of cancer cells - describe basic-level work that may be the foundation of future treatment advances. We have much work still to do, but I hope you'll be as enthusiastic as I am about the progress we're making. Dear Readers, Edward J. Benz Jr., MD President and CEO, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 3Around the Institute Garraway Earns Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, of Dana- Farber Cancer Institute was one of the three recipients of the 2013 Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research, an award from Memo-rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center that recognizes promis-ing investigators age 45 or younger for their efforts in advancing the field of cancer research. The three winners each received an award of $50,000 and spoke about their research at a scientific symposium in New Y ork City. \"The three winners of this year' s Paul Marks Prize have all made major contributions to our understanding of the genetic changes that lead to tumor development or the mechanisms by which those changes occur,\" said Mi-chael B. Kastan, MD, PhD, executive director of the Duke Cancer Institute and chair of the Paul Marks Prize selection committee. \"The committee was particularly impressed that each of the winners has already established themselves as an international leader in their respective areas of scientific study at this early stage in their career.\" Garraway' s research is focused on three main areas: discovering new cancer genes that are relevant across many different types of cancer; studying how additional genetic or molecular changes enable tumors to develop resistance to targeted thera-pies, especially in melanoma; and adapting genomic technology to enable its use by clinicians to develop better cancer treatments (so-called \"preci-sion\" cancer medicine).Marriage May Be Linked to Better Outcomes People who are married when diagnosed with cancer live longer than those who are not, report researchers at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women' s Hospital. Married patients also tended to have cancers diagnosed at an earlier stage \u2014 when it is often more successfully treated \u2014 and to receive more appropriate treatment. \"Our data suggests that marriage can have a significant health impact for patients with cancer, and this was consistent among every cancer that we reviewed,\" said Ayal Aizer, MD, MHS, chief resident of the Harvard Radiation Oncology Program and the paper' s first author. \"We suspect that social support from spouses is what' s driving the striking improvement in survival. Spouses often accompany patients on their visits and make sure they understand the recommendations and complete all their treatments.\" The study' s findings were published online in September in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In the News Judy Garber, MD, MPH, has been elected to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), a nongovernmental organization that advises the nation on issues related to biomedical science, medicine, and health. Garber is director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) and is one of the leaders of its Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers. Election to the IOM is con-sidered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine. Three faculty members from DF/BWCC' s Center for Neuro-Oncology were selected for top positions at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO), the premier North American-based organization dedicated to scientific and clinical research on central nervous system tumors: David A. Reardon, MD, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology, was elected SNO president; Patrick Wen, MD, director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology, was appointed editor-in-chief of Neuro-Oncology, the official journal of SNO; and E. Antonio Chiocca, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon in the Center for Neuro-Oncology and chair of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women' s Hospital, was elected the new vice president of SNO. The American Cancer Society honored Joanne Wolfe, MD, MPH, with its 2013 Pathfinder in Palliative Care Award, recognizing her research in quality of life of children with advanced cancer. Wolfe is the founder and director of the Pediatric Advanced Care Team (PACT) at Dana-Farber/ Boston Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.4 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.org Around the Institute A closer look at a few of the thou- sands of words associated with the complex fields of cancer medicine and research. AML (acute myeloid leukemia): A quickly progressing disease in which too many immature white blood cells (called myelo-blasts) are found in the blood and bone marrow. Ewing sarcoma: A cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue, affecting mainly children and adolescents. genetic testing: An examination of a person' s DNA to look for any genetic alterations that may indicate the individual is at risk for develop-ing a certain disease or condition. KRAS gene: A gene that makes the KRAS protein, which controls cell growth and apoptosis (cell death). When mutated, the KRAS gene can drive cells into cancerous growth. neutropenia: A condition in which a person has an abnormally low count of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps fight off infections). It is relatively common in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. pathology report: a medical docu- ment that helps determine treat-ment options by clarifying cancer diagnosis and staging (the extent to which cancer is present in the body). The report is written by a pathologist, a doctor who diagnoses disease by interpreting lab tests and evaluating body tissues. CANCER DICTIONARYIn Memoriam Jane Carrie Weeks, MD, MSc Jane Carrie Weeks, MD, MSc, a prominent Dana-Farber researcher interna- tionally known for building the discipline of outcomes research in oncology and admired by colleagues as an outstanding mentor, died in fall 2013 after a long illness. She was \"one of the true intellectual pillars of the Harvard medical commu- nity,\" said Dana-Farber President Edward Benz Jr., MD. Weeks was professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, direc-tor of the McGraw-Patterson Center for Population Sciences, and chief of the Division of Population Sciences in the department of medical oncology at Dana-Farber. She also served as the program leader for Outcomes Research at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Weeks was widely sought after by thought leaders and known for her ability to innovate, stimulate creative thinking, and forge novel collaborations. She was renowned for both her brilliance and her generosity. Weeks earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School and her master' s degree in health policy and management from the Harvard School of Public Health. She completed postgraduate training in internal medicine at Brigham and Women' s Hospital and in medical oncology at Dana-Farber, joining the faculty in 1992. She is survived by her husband, Barrett Rollins, MD, PhD, Linde Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief scientific officer and faculty dean for academic affairs at Dana-Farber. Memorial gifts can be made to the Jane C. Weeks, MD, MSc, Junior Population Science and Clinical Investigator Endowment Fund online at www.dana-farber.org/janeweeks.Jane Weeks, MD, MScSpring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 5 CANCER DICTIONARYAround the Institute $30M Marcotte Gift Advances Research at Dana-Farber Earlier this year, Dana-Farber announced a $30 mil- lion gift from Albert A. Marcotte, PhD, a former Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor and founder of Boston-based management consulting firm Advanced Management Systems (AMS). The transfor-mational gift supports the Institute' s Capital Projects Campaign to expand research and clinical space. It also creates the Marcotte Center for Cancer Research at Dana-Farber and advances a number of strategic cancer research initiatives. Marcotte' s significant investment in the Capital Projects Campaign will help Dana-Farber carry out a number of key expansion projects already under way, including revitalizing the Institute' s Charles A. Dana Building, expanding the Jimmy Fund Clinic, building out the Molecular Cancer Imaging Facility, and customizing lab space in the Longwood Center (a new research space near Dana-Farber' s Boston campus, scheduled to open in 2015). With these enhancements, the Institute can continue to attract the most talented and world-renowned physician-scientists and remain at the forefront of translational cancer research, accelerating discovery and delivery of compassionate patient care. \"We are entering a new era where advances in cancer research will move treatments from coping to cures,\" Marcotte noted at the time of the gift. \"By recognizing unique differences in various cancers, future research will develop new paradigms that lead to earlier detec-tion, targeted treatments, and increased survival rates. With its broad spectrum of strategic research initiatives, Dana-Farber is uniquely positioned to make significant advances in cancer research and patient care.\" The Marcotte Center for Cancer Research is located at Dana-Farber in the Dana building, across the street from the Institute' s Y awkey Center for Cancer Care. The twin centers' positioning reflects Dana-Farber' s unique and balanced commitment to research and patient care - a commitment that enables an extraordinary level of col-laboration between scientists and clinicians, and speeds the translation of laboratory discoveries into life-saving treatments for patients. \"Our goal is to bring the latest basic and clinical research advances from the lab to the clinic as soon as Albert A. Marcotte, PhD possible,\" said Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, president and CEO of Dana-Farber. \"Dr. Marcotte' s visionary gift will help speed that process and help bring the benefits of cancer research to more people sooner. We are grateful for his support and for his dedication to our shared mission of advancing cancer research and patient care.\" Marcotte earned his doctorate from the Sloan School of Management at MIT, where he taught for more than two decades in the Senior Executive Program. At MIT, he pioneered the development and use of simulation-based education for upper level managers. His research laid the foundation for improving management decision-making by utilizing computer-based systems to support executive decision-making processes. In 1979, Marcotte founded and is still president of AMS, a firm dedicated to improving the performance of service organizations. In the late 1970s, little was known about managing service organizations. Recognizing the need for a new quantitative methodology, he developed the underlying theory, concepts, tools, and techniques for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of service operations. Today, AMS methodology is used by leading banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms through-out the world.6 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgAround the Institute 'Beige' Fat May Ward Off Obesity Risks \"Beige\" fat cells scattered through healthy fat under the skin play a critical role in protecting the body against the health risks of obesity, according to a recent report by Dana-Farber' s Bruce Spiegelman, PhD, and colleagues. Their experimental findings may lead to treating obesity-related illness in humans. Spiegelman and his Dana-Farber colleague Paul Cohen, MD, PhD, led the study. Their report in the journal Cell suggests that the presence of beige fat, which can burn energy to release heat, is what makes subcutaneous fat in the hips and thighs healthier than obesity caused by fat within the abdomen. Excess abdominal, or \"visceral,\" fat largely lacks beige cells, and people with ample visceral fat are at increased risk for diabetes and heart disease. Surplus calories in overweight people are stored in fatty tissues composed mainly of white fat cells. In adults, beige cells are scattered throughout depos-its of white fat, especially in subcutaneous fat. These health-promoting beige cells can activate a \"thermogenic\" mechanism that burns stored fat to make heat, a process known as \"browning.\" The findings indicate that beige adipocytes [fat cells] are required for the browning of white fat and the healthful effects of subcutaneous adipose tissue. The discovery \"might lead to pharmacologic strategies to treat obesity-related diseases,\" comments Cohen.228 registered nurses staff inpatient units at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center 362,285 visits by patients seeking consultations and treatment at Dana-Farber in fiscal year 2013 479 people volunteered their time to help staff and patients at Dana-Farber' s Longwood Campus in 2013 23,542 volunteer hours were donated in 2013 on the Longwood Campus 99 percent : the vaccination rate for Dana-Farber employees receiving a flu shot in the 2012-13 flu season - the highest rate among Massachusetts hospitals 761 clinical trials open to Dana-Farber patients last year 5,533 bicyclists participated in the 2013 Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC), which raised more than $38 million for the Jimmy Fund.

What is the difference between being religious and being spiritual? Most people eventually ask age-old questions: Where do we come from, what are we doing here, where are we going? Being spiritual means having a sense that life is not just physical, and that we are more than molecules in motion. Someone religious is also spiritual, but that person has found a community of people with similar beliefs and prac-tices. When I came to Dana-Farber, patients were asked on a question-naire if religion was important, and about 50 percent said yes. After I added the word spirituality, about 80 percent said yes. How can spirituality guide some- one through cancer? Spirituality or religion can support patients in unimaginable ways. They see the world with a new energy. They know cancer is serious, but it is only one part of their lives. They can say, \"I'm still me, I still have a name.\" They own their own narra-tive and their own beliefs. Cancer cannot damage or destroy the spirit. How do you support staff members? We make rounds in the clinics, offer one-on-one support, and help staff members cope with grief and other work challenges. We hold healing services in the face of disaster, such as the Boston Marathon bombing. When a staff member calls a code [which means a patient needs emer-gency care], we assist the family, sometimes accompanying them to a hospital emergency room, and later return to support the staff members involved. What changes have you seen since you began work in 1988? Patients and families are freer to articulate their personal beliefs and develop their own practices. They also come from many more countries than in the past. Denominational and interfaith chaplains are more integrated with the medical team and participate on key committees, such as ethics. Can you describe a memorable encounter with a patient? An out-of-state couple, engaged to be married, came by because the young woman' s father was critically ill, and she did not feel she could have the wedding without him. Her father shared that he was most looking forward to the exchange of vows at his daughter' s wedding. We decided to begin the wedding in his hospital room and resume the ser-vice in his home state at a later time. Walter Moczynski, D. Min. , BCC The door is usually open to Walter Moczynski' s modest office next to Dana-Farber' s chapel, in case patients drop by. His top drawer contains hand-written thank-you notes from patients, families, and staff. Having become Dana-Farber' s first in-house chaplain in 1988, Moczynski is now director of the Center for Spiritual Care, a large, multifaceted program for patients, families, and staff members. He is also a field education supervisor for Harvard Divinity School, where some of Dana-Farber' s interns study. Dressed in a tuxedo, he witnessed the exchange of vows and died a few days later. 8 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgThe discovery of the PD-1 protein, by a team led by Gordon Freeman, PhD (left), holds promise for therapies that make the body's immune system attack cancer cells.Unleashing the Potential by rob ert levy Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 910 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgResults like these: In 2010, inves- tigators led F . Stephen Hodi, MD, of Dana-Farber/Brigham and Wom-en' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) reported that a therapy that stifles a key protein on immune system cells extended the lives of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. In some cases, the gains were extraor-dinary: About 20 percent of the patients who benefited from the drug are alive today, up to 10 years after treatment. The study marked the first time a drug had been scientifi-cally shown to lengthen survival in patients with the often fatal disease. Last year brought news of another clinical trial of a drug with a talent for blocking a protein on immune system cells. Investigators at Johns Hopkins University, DF/BWCC, and elsewhere administered the drug to hundreds of patients with cancers that hadn't been tamed by tradi-tional therapies. In all, 18 percent of patients with non-small cell lung cancer had their tumors shrink partially or completely, as did 28 percent of patients with melanoma, and 27 percent of those with kidney cancer. Equally impressive was the length of the remissions: two-thirds of the patients who benefited from the drug were still in remission when investigators checked them a year after treatment.In a field where survival im- provements are often measured in months, findings like these have had an electric effect. The excite-ment represents a triumph for an approach to cancer treatment called immunotherapy (which mobilizes the immune system to fight disease) that not long ago was the pursuit of a hardy minority of scientists. And it comes as a vindication for the handful of research centers - notably Dana-Farber - that incubated the work while other centers took a dif-ferent tack. For scientists like Dana-Farber' s Gordon Freeman, PhD, whose dis-coveries about the basic workings of the immune system made many of the new immunotherapies possible, the convergence of research in this area is especially rewarding. \"As a basic scientist at Dana-Farber, I often ride the elevator with patients and their families or pass through clinical areas, and it reminds me every day how important our work is,\" Freeman explains. \"It' s exciting to know that research I did can really make a difference.\" A Scientific Legacy This new era of cancer immuno- therapy is the product of decades of research into the teeming intricacies of the human immune system. The notion that the immune system could be honed into a weapon against can-cer is at least 100 years old, but like many attempts to harness a force that' s only dimly understood, early efforts were largely unsuccessful. Real progress awaited discoveries in the 1990s as scientists studied the interaction between immune sys-tem T cells and cancer cells. It was known that T cells - the immune system' s strike force against foreign invaders and diseased cells - iden-tify cancer cells by latching onto proteins, called antigens, from the cancer cells' surface. The latching is accomplished with specialized pro-teins called receptors that jut from the T cell surface. It quickly became clear, however, that T cells do a more thorough job of frisking cancer cells than this simple, one-step procedure would suggest. For along with their recep-tors, T cells also carry similar struc-tures known as co-receptors. When the co-receptors are stimulated by certain cancer cell proteins, the T cells become active tumor hunters. Research into T cell receptors and co-receptors suggested a novel strategy against cancer: siphon some of a patient' s T cells into a test tube, \"introduce\" them to some of the patient' s own tumor cells, then inject the newly aggressive T cells back The buzz at some cancer research presentations these days is like the pre-show chatter at a rock concert. But the subject of the excitement isn't the latest pop star, it' s research that is unlocking the immune system' s power as a cancer fighter. Oncologists who may once have been skeptical about the notion of immune system-based cancer therapies now findthemselves enrolling in refresher courses on immunology and doing double-takes at thelatest clinical trial results.\"It' s going to be standing room only. We' d better get there early.\" Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 11into the patient so they can rally the immune system against can-cer. This approach to a therapeutic cancer vaccine has been studied and tested by a wide range of research-ers, including some at Dana-Farber, but despite showing signs of prom-ise, it has yet to achieve a break-through success. \"About halfway through the research into co-receptor interac-tions, there was a surprise,\" re-counts Harvey Cantor, MD, chair of Dana-Farber' s Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS. \"We learned that some co-receptors inhibited the immune response, rather than stimulating it.\" T cells' response to infection or cancer, it turns out, is more like a deliberation than a reflex. Much as a war council gets input from advocates as well as opponents of military action, T cells receive both \"charge!\" and \"stand down\" signals from their co-receptors. Whichever signal predominates determines the T cells' course of action. Even as discoveries about in- hibitory co-receptors were being published, most research institutions continued to focus on the stimula-tory side of the immune response - believing the best approach to an immunotherapy for cancer is one that multiplies both the number and activity of T cells. An exception was Dana-Farber, where research into both aspects of the immune response was afoot. It wasn't that Dana-Farber researchers had special powers of foresight or were quicker to grasp the potential of therapies that targeted the inhibitory response of T cells, Cantor remarks. It was, rather, the general vitality of im-munological research that allowed researchers here to take a broader view. That dynamism was, to a large degree, a legacy of Baruj Benacer-raf, MD, the Nobel Prize-winning immunologist who, as president of Dana-Farber from 1980-1992, built the Institute into a mecca for immu-nology research, Cantor states. One of the young scientists who came to Dana-Farber around the time of Benacerraf' s arrival was Gordon Freeman, who joined the lab of Lee Nadler, MD, in 1985 as a postdoctoral fellow. With labmate Arnold Freedman, MD, he began studying B7, a protein displayed by key immune system cells. Although B7 proteins come in a variety of How to Escape an Immune-system Attack One of the ways that cancer cells evade an attack from the immune system is with a protein called PD-L1 (and a related protein called PD-L2). When PD-L1 latches onto the PD-1 protein on immune system T cells, the immune system attack on the cancer cells goes on hold. Drug agents that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 allow the attack to go forward.tumor Cell tumor Cell DeathInactivated t Cell a ctivated t Cell PD- l 1 PD- l 1PD-1PD-1Drug Compound IllUSTRATI oN BY MEAHgAN HARRI gAN AN d jo HN d I g IANNI12 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.org \"Cancer cells have essentially stolen the P d-1/Pd-l1 mechanism from normal cells in order to ev ade attack by the immune system.\" - g ordon Freeman, Ph dforms, the ones initially identified issue an activating order to T cells, instructing them to attack. \"We began to look for molecules that were similar or related to B7,\" Freeman relates. They found several, but it was the discovery of one in particular that helped change the course of cancer immunotherapy. In 2000 Freeman and his col- leagues published a paper announc-ing the existence of a protein on normal cells called PD-L1 (for pro-grammed cell death 1 ligand 1). Like other members of the B7 family, the researchers wrote, PD-L1 entwines with a T cell co-receptor - in this case, one called PD-1 - deterring the T cell from going into attack mode. PD-1 and PD-L1 are part of the body' s system for self-preservation. They help assure that T cells - always on the lookout for foreign invaders and diseased cells - rec-ognize normal cells and leave them unharmed. By draping themselves in PD-L1 (and a related protein, PD-L2), cells are essentially hanging a thousand \"Do Not Disturb\" signs on their membranes. Freeman' s next paper, in 2001, reported a startling finding: PD-L1 appears not only on some normal cells but also on many cancer cells. \"Cancer cells have essentially stolen the PD-1/PD-L1 mechanism from normal cells in order to evade attack by the immune system,\" Freeman says. The implications of the discovery for cancer treatment were imme-diately apparent. \"Whenever you discover something that inhibits the immune response to cancer, you have a target for a new therapy,\" Freeman remarks. \"We showed that if you block PD-L1 or PD-L2 with a drug molecule, you allow T cells to become more active against cancer cells.

The hallmark of each of these studies is the staying power of the drugs being tested. While \"targeted\" therapies - which shut down specific, abnormal genes - often work for a large percentage of patients, the treatments tend to lose effectiveness over time, as cancer cells learn to evade them. Drugs that disinhibit T cells, by contrast, have so far been effective in a smaller proportion of patients, but their benefits are much more durable. Combining targeted therapies with the newer T cell-targeting agents may offer the best of both worlds - broad-scale effec-tiveness and long-lasting benefits - researchers say. \"The future really is now,\" Free- man comments. \"The challenge is to find the right mix of therapies that create a PD-1 blockade and hit a second target, preferably one with a different mechanism of action. The ability to target cancer cells directly and indirectly, with agents that remove T cell inhibition, is especially promising.\" If current studies bear fruit, patients will be beneficiaries of that promise for years to come.at pursuing immunotherapies began developing drugs that block PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, or some combina-tion of them. Some of those drugs are now being tested in clinical trials, and the initial results, as mentioned above, have been as compelling as any in cancer medicine in recent years. The trial at John Hopkins and DF/BWCC earlier may have gotten the most publicity, but others are equally encouraging. (The trial, led by Hodi, involved a drug that blocks another immune-inhibiting molecule, CTLA-4.) Here are the results of some of these early-stage trials: An antibody that blocks PD-L1 produced remissions or halted the growth of tumors in many patients with advanced cancers, with im-provements lasting more than a year. A PD-1-blocking antibody sent tumors into a sustained retreat in some patients with advanced melanoma. The discovery by Gordon Freeman, PhD (left), of proteins that fend off an immune system attack on cancer cells has opened a new avenue of cancer therapy.

Researchers have found that even though T cells can penetrate deeply within tumors, these T cells are often just milling around in a state scien-tists call \"exhaustion,\" rather than leading an anti-cancer assault. The reason for this lethargy: the cancer cells within the tumor are blanketed in PD-L1 and sometimes also PD-L2. Therapies that incite the T cells to go on the offensive have the perverse effect of encouraging cancer cells to sprout more of these inhibitors of the immune response. It' s as though a legion of horses were saddled and mounted for a cavalry charge, only to have the riders pull ever more tightly on the reins.

Sometimes test results can be inconclusive or give ambiguous results. And while some cancers are more straightforward, others can be notoriously difficult to diag-nose correctly. Understanding the landscape of a disease can suggest new directions. The specialized expertise of pathologists, diagnostic radiolo-gists, surgical oncology specialists and medical oncologists can offer a critical second opinion - whether it is from reviewing pathology samples or reinterpreting imaging results in a clinical context - because in a life-time of practice, general oncologists may not see the number of specific subtypes of uncommon cancers a specialist treats each year at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Can-cer Center (DF/BWCC). Specialists can fine-tune a diagnosis, reclas-sifying a cancer into an important subtype or re-categorizing the grade or stage, and, in the process, changing the course of treatment. And, in a few cases, an oncologist might be able to tell a patient that the revised diagnosis is something that looks like cancer, but is not. Expert Pathology At the heart of any cancer diagnosis is pathology. Every year, pathologists at Brigham and Women' s Hospital (BWH) peer under microscopes to analyze the biopsies of more than 20,000 DF/BWCC patients. \"The vast majority of cancer diagnoses are still made down a microscope,\" says Christopher Fletcher, MD, FRCPath, chief of onco-pathology at DF/BWCC, vice chair for anatomic pathology at BWH, and an international expert in sarcoma pathology. Aided by special tests like immunohistochemistry (which stains specific proteins in tissue cells) and molecular genetics (which can detect distinctive changes in specific chromosomes or genes), a pathologist determines many things: whether a breast cancer tumor is invasive, the type and grade of the tumor, the presence or absence of lymph node involvement, whether the edges (\"margins\") of a speci-men removed by surgery are positive or negative for any residual tumor, whether the tumor expresses estro-gen receptors, and possibly other prognostic factors. The same process applies to cancers of almost any organ system - ovarian cancer, lym-phoma, sarcoma, and colon cancer, for example. This expert analysis produces a robust diagnosis, the starting point that guides all future treatment decisions. Specialized expertise is critical. \"For the overwhelming majority of cancers, the correct diagnosis, upon which treatment decisions are made, is made by a pathologist - who also adds nuances concerning identifica-tion of possible therapeutic targets and status of surgical margins,\" says Fletcher. \"At major cancer cen-ters like DF/BWCC, there is access by naom I funkhouser Accuracy matters, particularly when it comes to a cancer diagnosis. How a sample of tissue or blood - which is necessary to make a diagnosis - is characterized can make an enormous impact. It can determine whether a patient has cancer , influence treatment options and prog-nosis, and color many decisions for the patient and the care provider. But diagnosing cancer is not always black and white. It can be nuanced. Within the broad brush of a cancer are subtle subtypes of disease. not only to the most up-to-date technologies for pathologic diagno-sis, but also to a group of subspe-cialized, highly experienced faculty pathologists, many of whom are nationally or internationally recog-nized experts in their field. Their skilled pathology review may lead to significant changes or refinements in diagnosis in as many as 15 percent of cases, depending on the type, or rarity, of the cancer.\" Ultimately, the frequency with which a diagnosis is changed is pro-portional to how common the dis-ease is, says Fletcher. The rarer the cancer - some types of lymphoma or sarcoma, for example - the more likely the diagnosis may change. In some cases, the diagnosis can change from cancer to a non-malig-nant result, a scenario that George Demetri, MD, director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at DF/BWCC and senior vice president for experimental therapeutics, says he sees about twice a year. Demetri credits Fletcher' s pathol- ogy team with being among \"the best in the world,\" he says. \"We live off the quality of their pathology.\" A Diagnostic Revolution An accurate diagnosis opens up new treatment options. Demetri estimates that in up to 20 percent of sarcoma cases, \"there are sig-nificant changes in a diagnosis that make a meaningful difference in how patients are managed.\" \"We are in the early stages of a diagnostic revolution in cancer,\" Demetri adds. Once there is an accu-rate tissue diagnosis from a patholo-gist, patients often receive a qualified diagnosis. For example, a patient may learn not just that he has non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but a new genetic subtype of NSCLC for which there are targeted thera-pies. These critical details drive how patients are treated in an increasing number of cancer types, across lung cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma, lung cancer, melanoma, and several others. Understanding the different genetic subtypes and the molecular under-pinnings driving them is at the heart of Profile, a comprehensive research study launched by scientists at Dana-Farber and BWH, and now including Boston Children' s Hospital. Since the project began in 2011, Profile scien-tists have analyzed the DNA in tumor tissue from more than 6,000 patients, studying the genetic makeup of tu-mors for variations in the more than 300 genes that scientists believe are most likely to be involved in cancer. And while this molecular profil- ing rarely overturns a diagnosis, it can identify treatable targets, provide a more comprehensive picture of disease, and lead to research options and potential drug targets, according to Demetri. \"We have a broad spec-trum of clinical research trials, often 16 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgChristopher Fletcher, MD, FRCPath (right), chief of onco-pathology at DF/BWCC and vice chair for anatomic pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is an international expert in sarcoma pathology. Pathology confirmed the initial diagnosis of the invasive ductal car- cinoma. Molecular analysis further classified Thompson' s oncotype and directed a treatment plan. Thompson was eligible for a clinical trial called the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT), which is designed to deter-mine whether there is a role of aro-matase inhibitors for women whose ovarian function is suppressed. Thompson and her husband moved temporarily to Boston for surgery and follow-up care. For Thompson, a cancer diagnosis from expert subspecialists working in coordination led to individualized treatment. Having the most accurate diagnosis from the start meant tailored treatment options, an intimate under-standing of disease, and the tools and team to put a plan in place. Today, Thompson is back in Virginia and in her third year of taking tamoxi-fen. For the first two years, she also received monthly hormone suppres-sion shots. Last year, she opted to end the monthly shots and had her ovaries removed. She continues to visit DF/BWCC every six months and \"will most likely make an annual pilgrimage there for the rest of my life,\" she says. \"It' s a small price to pay for saving my life.\" Spring/Summer 2014 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 17based on precise identification of specific molecular targets, which is especially important for those with advanced cancers with no known curative options,\" Demetri says. Why a Second Opinion Matters Often, a second opinion serves to confirm a particular diagnosis, and in the process, identify treatment options, including clinical tri-als. That was the case for Paulina Thompson, who traveled to DF/BWCC from Virginia Beach after a breast cancer diagnosis at age 50. Thompson and her husband, Jeff, arrived in Boston \"in a fog,\" with seven pages of questions, she says. \"When you are told you have cancer, the first thing you realize is that you don't know what you don't know.\" She met with breast surgeon Laura Dominici, MD, and medical oncolo-gist Sara Tolaney, MD, both with the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber. Dominici recommended a mas- tectomy because of the number of tumors and the distance between them, which would have required the removal of a third to half of Thompson' s breast. \"She thought it was unlikely that I' d be happy with the cosmetic outcome if I didn't opt for a mastectomy,\" Thompson says. Tolaney helped the Thompsons understand their options after surgery - much of which would be determined by the pathology from the mastectomy.

Every year, about 20,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a form of non-small cell lung cancer in which the cancer cells have an abnormality in a protein known as EGFR. About 90 percent of these patients benefit from targeted drugs like Tarceva, which block the activity of the abnormal protein and send the disease into remission. The remaining 10 percent have a defect in a different portion of EGFR. In these patients, Tarceva and similar drugs are ineffective, but scientists haven't known why. The illustration on these pages provides an answer. Produced by Dana-Farber' s Michael Eck, MD, PhD, and his colleagues, the image shows the crystal structure of an ab-normal form of EGFR found in patients who don't respond to Tarceva. (The image shows the protein about 40 million times larger than in real life.) The irregularity in the protein con-sists of an extra chain of amino acids, shown in orange at the bottom of the protein. The insertion of these additional amino acids essentially jams the protein' s activation switch into the \"on\" position, signaling the cancer cell to grow and divide. The yellow and red balls in the image represent the drug compound Iressa - a cousin of Tarceva - lodged inside the protein. As the image makes clear, Iressa still binds to the abnormal EGFR, but not tightly enough to halt the constant stream of growth signals. The challenge for Eck and his colleagues is to discover potential drugs that bind tightly to this particular form of abnormal EGFR. It' s especially challenging because the altered portion of the protein is on the opposite side of the usual site of drug binding. \"We now have a clear picture of the molecular target that needs to be hit in this group of patients,\" Eck says. \"That' s vital information for the development of new therapies.\" SCIENCE ILLUSTRATED The Structure of Proteins T 18 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgThe Structure of Proteins Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 1920 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgDana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) is an environment where doctors and laboratory scientists often rub shoulders.

Steele was being treated for male breast cancer when he was also diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer. Despite several rounds of chemotherapy, the lung tumors were spreading and colonies of cancer had reached his brain. The two cancers had occurred simultaneously, but nothing in Steele' s family background or genetic testing revealed an unusual risk. Moreover, tests of his lung tumors didn't reveal any of the known DNA mutations that often drive such cancers and which sometimes can be attacked with molecularly targeted drugs. \"I kept thinking there must be something more,\" recalls Barbie, of the Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncol-ogy at DF/BWCC. Later, while attending a talk at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, Mass., Barbie heard Nikhil Wagle, MD, a researcher with the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber, describ-ing an ambitious new research project called CanSeq (pronounced \"can seek\"). In CanSeq, Wagle and other researchers are evaluating an advanced technology called whole-exome sequenc-ing, which conducts a wide sweep for cancer genes in tumors. It' s a joint project involving Dana-Farber, the Broad Institute, and Brigham and Women' s Hospital. Overall, CanSeq \"is about studying and developing best practices around the whole process of returning complex tumor and germline genomic information to oncologists and their patients,\" explains Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber, who heads the project along with Pasi J\u00e4nne, MD, PhD, a DF/BWCC thoracic on-cologist and researcher. Testing tumors for the presence of known cancer mutations is standard practice for many patients coming to DF/BWCC. Depending on the type of cancer, a sample of tumor tissue may be tested for a number of specific mutations, which may vary from patient to patient. The tumor' s mutational profile can guide physicians in choos-ing designer drugs - a practice known as \"precision\" or \"personalized\" cancer care. In addition, all consenting patients have their tumor' s DNA scanned by Profile, a research program that com-piles mutations and other abnormalities found in cancers treated at DF/BWCC and Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospi-tal Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Scientists search the samples for a list of known mutations in tumor tissue, and they also sequence - that is, read out the entire genet-ic script of - 305 genes that have been linked to cancer. Whole-exome sequencing goes further. Unlike \"tar- geted sequencing,\" the whole-exome method scans all 20,000 genes contained in the human genome. It' s a monumental task, but whole exome sequencing takes a shortcut by reading only the exons in each gene. Exons are the segments of DNA code that contain the recipes for cell proteins - the large molecules that build and operate the body. In all, the human genome contains some 180,000 exons. Collectively, these exons are called the \"exome,\" which contains about 30 million letters of genetic code. Most mutations and alterations that cause cancer are likely to be found in DNA in the exons of A Spring/Summer 2014 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 23genes: Thus, sequencing the exome should capture the vast majority of cancer-related DNA changes. The goal of the four-year study is to sequence the exomes of 200 patients with advanced lung cancer and 200 with advanced colon cancer. \"CanSeq sets up a mechanism so we can understand how having this very comprehensive picture of a tumor can have an impact on patients,\" says Garraway. \"Is it a good thing? Does it help, and if so, a lot, or not so much?\" Hunting for Genetic Suspects If standard testing is like hunting for crime suspects at specific addresses, whole-exome sequencing can be thought of as unleashing a massive door-to-door search of an entire city. It can scoop up known wrongdoers, but also flush out thousands of others not previously identi-fied. Whole-exome sequencing is mainly being applied in research settings, but many believe it is the next step in realizing the ambitious goals of precision cancer care. \"Some of these genes we know nothing about - they're not mutated commonly enough,\" says Garraway. \"But they may be relevant. For example, when a doctor says, 'I have a patient with nothing else to try,' whole-exome sequencing may find a mutation that could lead to a trial of a drug for this patient.\" Wagle' s talk about CanSeq prompted a new approach to treating Colin Steele' s relent-less cancer. After the presen-tation, Barbie described the Nikhil Wagle, MD (left), and Levi Garraway, MD, Phd, who co-leads CanSeq, discuss ways to speed the process.\"I am pretty optimistic,\" says Colin Steele (left), who volunteered for exome sequencing. \"Give me something, and I'll try it.\" Automated DNA sequencing instruments at the Broad deciphered the genetic code of the exons in Steele' s cancer within a matter of weeks, generating a gigantic amount of data. \"The actual sequencing is easier than interpreting all these pieces of data - you are going to find things that you don't know what they do, whether they are a bad actor or not,\" explains J\u00e4nne. Raw sequencing data is pumped through two analytic \"pipelines\" that highlight DNA alterations that might be clinically relevant. That genomic information is then parsed by team of physician-scientists who study the DNA variants and rank-order them in terms of their potential value for guiding treatment. A major goal of CanSeq is to cre- ate the most efficient infrastructure for the process. \"We've learned it' s incredibly hard to interpret the data case and asked whether whole-exome sequencing might unearth mutations in the cancer that could guide treat-ment. Wagle thought it might. Moving Forward In December 2012, Steele became one of the first patients to undergo whole-exome sequencing under the CanSeq program. After he agreed to join the study, researchers extracted and sequenced DNA from cancerous tissue removed during his lung sur-gery. They also sequenced his \"germ-line\" DNA - the normal genome he was born with - from a blood sample. \"To identify the mutations driv- ing the cancer, we need to see the patient' s normal DNA sequence and subtract it from the tumor DNA, leav-ing it with changes that are relevant to the cancer,\" explains Stacy Gray, MD, a Dana-Farber oncologist and investigator CanSeq project.

In Steele' s case, the results vali- dated his physician' s hunch and of-fered a glimmer of hope. It revealed at least three mutations missed by standard tests: a rare mutation in a gene called KRAS; a mutation in the ATM gene, and a deleted tumor- suppressor gene, LKB1. Mutant KRAS, which drives cells into cancerous growth, is found in many lung cancers. But standard tests available at the time hadn't spotted the mutation in Steele' s tumor, because it occurred at a dif-ferent position on the gene. \"This particular KRAS mutation was only reported a few years ago, in colorectal cancer\" Barbie says. \"We know it drives the cancer and predicts that it will be resistant to chemotherapy.\" However, the discov-ery opened up experimental treat-ment options for Steele that hadn't existed prior to the sequencing. IntronGene e xon ProteinD na s trand w hole all exons exome 1% of whole genomeA cancer cell's genome comprises DNA blueprints for the body's proteins. Only a tiny fraction of the DNA, a collection of exons called the exome, is used in making proteins. Exome sequenc-ing focuses on this DNA because it's thought to contain most of the cancer-causing genetic changes. Genes also con-tain large regions called introns that don't carry the code for proteins.Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 25 Barbie discussed the case with a colleague, Leena Gandhi, MD, PhD, in DF/BWCC' s thoracic oncology program, who was leading a clini-cal trial of a drug known as a CDK4 inhibitor that had achieved responses in some patients with KRAS muta-tions. Steele enrolled in the trial. \"Overall, I'm pretty optimistic,\" he said recently. \"Give me something to try and I'll try it.\" In early December 2012, Steele underwent the first of four cycles of treatment with the experimental drug. Over the next months, scans showed the cancer' s growth had slowed and some small tumors apparently halted. \"It wasn't a home run,\" says Barbie, \"but it stabilized his disease and caused some shrinkage, which hadn't happened with all his previous chemotherapy. We think the CDK4 inhibitor has damaged his tumor.\" After four cycles, the drug was stopped because of worsening side effects. But in 2013, Steele started another trial targeting the ATM muta- tion in his tumor' s DNA. The new drug, combines a PARP inhibitor and a CDK4 inhibitor. \"The scans keep saying there' s slow growth, and I've survived two and a half years with this lung can-cer,\" says Steel. \"I'm feeling pretty good and I'm thankful for that.\" His case is an example of how whole-exome sequencing adds a new dimension to the search for cancer genes, potentially giving patients new treatment options. With this technol-ogy nearing clinical use, research like CanSeq is helping shape how exome sequencing can define a model for integrating it into cancer care. Learn about our genetiC researCh www.bit.ly/1cgAO1n How Should We Use Whole-Exome Data? In addition to finding tumor genes, whole-exome sequencing may spot red flags in a patient' s DNA, signaling an increased risk of diseases and conditions that have nothing to do with cancer. These byproducts of exome analysis are known as \"incidental findings.\" How this information should be handled has stirred debate and ethical discussion across the oncology field. \"This is something that is entirely new to cancer care,\" says Stacy Gray, MD, AM, medical on-cologist with the CanSeq project at Dana-Farber. She is co-leader of a project that investigates the ethical, legal, and social implications of exome sequencing technology. Exome sequencing differs from current tumor profiling in that it also scans the patient' s normal, inherited DNA. So, for example, a lung cancer patient' s DNA might reveal she has an elevated risk of heart disease, or even sudden death, or that she carries a muta-tion that predisposes her to another cancer. Depending on the condi-tion, a preventive or early treat-ment might save a life. If no treat-ment is available, or the severity of the risk is uncertain, some would argue the knowledge is more of a burden to the patient than a benefit. Gray explains that CanSeq' s consent process is designed to ensure that patients understand the potential outcomes of exome sequencing. It allows them to state preferences about which results they wish to receive. Some patients may want to learn any and all DNA results, no matter how uncertain or distress-ing. Others might shun any findings not relevant to their cancer. But, do doctors have a duty to override these preferences for the patient' s good? Are patients obligated to share with family mem-bers test results that could affect their relatives? What if the patient dies before information on a familial risk becomes available? The American College of Medi- cal Genetics (ACMG) now lists 56 gene mutations it recommends as conditions that should be reported to doctors and patients. Among them: mutations causing hereditary breast and ovarian can-cer, Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome, Marfan syndrome, retinoblastoma, and certain heart disease risks. Some argue that such a stance threatens patient autonomy. CanSeq researchers \"have thought this through,\" says Gray. A clause in the consent form allows researchers to inform a patient of a finding that is \"immediately actionable and would be clinically beneficial,\" she says. \"These find-ings may be returned to patients on a case-by-case basis if withholding them might result in patient harm.\" Patients will not be alone in dealing with these issues. CanSeq oncologists will refer patients with incidental findings to genetic counselors and other appropriate specialists for follow-up. -RS Stacy Gray, MDChoosing a Path 26 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgWhat patients should know about clinical trials by elIzabeth DouGherty Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 27Instead of an infusion of chemo, Perry went home with a bottle of pills and, though he didn't know it yet, a new lease on life. Perry is among the 15 to 20 percent of patients at DF/BWCC who opt to participate in clinical trials. \"Without patients who participate, the field would not advance at all. Period. It just wouldn't happen,\" says Robert Soiffer, MD, chief of Hematologic Malignancies at DF/BWCC. Clinical trials not only provide new treatment options for current patients, they also make it possible for tomor-row' s patients to receive treatments that are better than those available today. For patients to participate, how-ever, they must know which trials are available, how they work, and how science is transforming the drug develop-ment process into a faster and more effective mechanism for bringing new treatments to patients everywhere. Entry Criteria At the most basic level, the role of clinical trials is to answer critical questions: Does a drug work? Is it safe? How much should be given, how often, and for how long? To successfully vault from trial to standard use, an experimental agent must pass through several phases of clinical trials, as defined by the Food and Drug Adminis-tration. (See box on page 31.) Trials exist for patients of all stages, from those with stage 1 cancer, the earliest detectable cancer, to those with stage 4 cancer, the most advanced disease. Clinical researchers carefully select which trials to offer, aiming to give a broad range of patients the most promising options available. \"Y ou want to open up trials that can move the field forward,\" says Ursula Matulonis, MD, medical director of Gynecologic Oncology in the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber. \"If you have 10 trials looking at the same patient population, you haven't been able to prioritize what' s important.\" Recurrent cancer, disease that has returned after initial treatment, tends to be harder to treat. In lung cancer, for example, only three drugs have been approved for second-line treatment, fewer than the number approved for first-line treatment. Not only are there fewer options, those approved options have only about a 10 percent response rate, with a duration of just 2 months. The strong need for second- and later-line treatment options means there are often more trials available for patients who have been previously treated, provided they are healthy enough to participate, says Bruce Johnson, MD, chief clinical research officer and thoracic oncologist at DF/BWCC. A new partnership between Dana-Farber, the Lympho- ma and Leukemia Society (LLS), and the LLS Therapy Acceleration Program is taking aim at another constraint: proximity. For the most part, trials draw participants from the narrow set of individuals who live near \u2014 or have the means to visit \u2014 a major cancer center, such as DF/BWCC. \"A large number of patients do not have access to Late last winter, Justin Perry set out from his home in Wells, Maine, for an afternoon appointment at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DF/BWCC), expecting to begin chemotherapy to treat recently diagnosed stage 4 lung cancer. Before lunch, his plans had changed. Results from genetic tests done on his tumor revealed a mutation in the ALK gene that qualified Perry, an active 23-year old, for a clinical trial of an experimental targeted drug. 28 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.orgJustin Perry, shown here in his garage in Wells, Maine, enrolled in a clinical trial of an experimental drug designed to target his specific tumor type.

The Blood Cancer Research Partnership is helping to improve access to trials for those who live far away from major medical centers. Make Me a Match Increasingly, trials are based on the genetic features of patients' tumors in an attempt to precisely match treatment to the genetic mu-tations that are driving the particular cancer. As more of these targeted drugs enter clinical testing, more phase 1 trials are recruiting patients based on the tumor' s genetic profile, regardless of the type of cancer. \"The goal is to try to use genetic tu-mor profiling information to make a more intelligent choice about which trial might be helpful to the patient,\" says Geoffrey Shapiro, MD, PhD, director of the Early Drug Develop-ment Center at DF/BWCC. Such matchmaking is changing the way trials unfold, as illustrated by the story of crizotinib, a drug that inhibits several proteins thought important for cancer growth, in-cluding a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In 2006, a standard phase 1 trial began testing the drug in patients with all tumor types. \"Not much was happening,\" says Shapiro. In 2007, however, it was recognized that ALK activa-tion occurs in about five percent of lung cancers as a result of gene rearrangement. Shortly after, several lung cancer patients with ALK rear-rangements in their tumors enrolled. \"Lo and behold, they responded.\" The trial rapidly morphed to enroll 80 patients who fit the profile. The response rate soared to 61 percent. Approval of the drug occurred soon after, in 2011. \"This is the paradigm we should be following in every type of cancer,\" says William Hahn, MD, PhD, deputy chief scientific officer at Dana-Farber. Now, next generation ALK- inhibitors are in trials at DF/BWCC, including AF802 and the drug Justin Perry is taking, LDK378, which was awarded Breakthrough Therapy sta-tus by the FDA in March 2013 based on positive phase 1 results. When Perry learned that his lung cancer was ALK-positive, he could have taken the already approved therapy, crizotinib. Instead he elected to join a trial of LDK378. \"My cancer was really bad,\" says Perry. \"I figured I could help them learn about this cancer. I could help them out and possibly help myself out too.\" Within four months, 98 percent of Perry' s cancer had cleared. He' s now been taking LDK378 for 10 months and remains virtually cancer-free. According to Shapiro, evidence is building that patients enrolled in tri-als that are considered a good match for their tumor profiles tend to live longer. \"Generally patients do better, so the approach has merit,\" he says. \"But there are still many instances where this strategy doesn't work for the patient. It' s still experimental.\" It is also not clear how long Perry' s strong response will last. \"If this drug does stop working, they have other trials down the line,\" says Perry, such as trials testing combina-tions of therapies to stave off recur-rence. \"They're constantly working to build newer treatments.\" Improved Tools for Research To begin systematically building the evidence-based matchmaking that has helped rapidly advance targeted cancer treatment, Dana-Ursula Matulonis, MD, of the Susan F.

With these tools, says Johnson, \"we're moving toward faster answers and more effective treatments.\" At the same time, traditional cancer delineations are beginning to blur. Some phase 2 and 3 trials are following the lead of phase 1 trials and accepting patients with the same tumor profile but varying types of cancer. \"We have a scientifically-based idea about who might respond and we want to test all of those patients,\" says Hahn, who is seeing enthusiasm building for these so-called umbrella trials. \"We're really at the beginning of a new era in clinical trials; one in which there is less empiricism and more science.\" More science means better trials, with more precise questions and faster answers. The end result is ac-celeration, so that doctors can more quickly bring improved treatments to tomorrow' s patients - and today' s.

The program now also includes patients at Boston Children' s Hospital. Researchers plan to mine the data collected by Profile to find patterns that suggest, for instance, which treatments work best for a given tumor profile or why some cancers progress while others don't. More than 20,000 patients have been consented and 6,000 tumors have been profiled. Each tumor profile includes information on the genetic coding of more than 300 genes, a panel that includes the key players implicated in cancer. Profile information is making it easier for trials to follow the crizotinib paradigm by helping researchers home in on the patient population for which a drug is working. The Profile database also allows researchers to readily identify patients who are good matches for a trial without having to take the time Extending the Reach of Innovative Clinical Trials The Blood Cancer Research Part- nership, offered in collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) and the LLS Therapy Accel-eration Program, aims to extend the reach of cutting edge clinical trials to patients who live far away from major medical centers. Partnerships have already been formed with sites in Georgia, Colorado, Washington State, Florida, New Jersey, Maine, New Y ork State, Central California, Virginia, and Tennessee. The program facilitates col- laboration between Dana-Farber and community oncologists, building networks of sites from which clinical trials can draw patients. \"Not only do these partnerships give these patients access to what might be tomorrow' s successful cancer drugs, it also allows us to work with more people, not just those who make their way to an urban cancer center,\" says Robert Soiffer, co-principal investigator of the Part-nership along with physician-scientist Irene Ghobrial, MD, who specializes in multiple myeloma at Dana-Farber. The program, in addition to expand- ing access, also aims to accelerate trials by speeding recruitment. \"We want a rapid turnaround so we can develop the good therapies and dis-card the bad ones,\" says Soiffer. \"The more patients we have partici-pating in clinical trials, the faster and more efficiently we, as a society, will improve cancer care.\"CLINICAL T RIALS , By P HASE Phase Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 420-60 Hundreds Thousands VariableDetermine tolerable doses and side effects that emerge as dose increases.

Nor did she expect to have such an intimate connection with patients at the young age of 29. Y et, just one year ago, during her last semester at the University of Massachusetts Medical School to become a nurse practi-tioner (NP), Loucks was diagnosed with breast cancer. \"I wanted to use my experience as a cancer patient and turn it into something positive,\" says Loucks, who was treated at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) by Ann Partridge, MD, MPH, breast oncologist in the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers and director of the Program for Y oung Women with Breast Cancer. \"My cancer has given me a new out-look on oncology patients. I know what it' s like to sit in the other chair. I know that cer - tain things may seem trivial to a provider, but can be really bothersome to patients, like los-ing your eyelashes or eyebrows, which was quite difficult for me.\" Loucks originally joined DF/BWCC in 2006 as a clinical research coordinator in the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology. For three years, she worked alongside Kathy Polson, NP , and Amy Pilotte, NP , both of whom Loucks credits as her inspirations for becoming a nurse practitioner. \"I always joked with the team, 'Oh, save a spot for me, I want to come back,' but I never really thought it would be a possibility,\" says Loucks, who in February 2013 returned as a nurse practitioner in the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at DF/BWCC. \"It feels like home here. It' s very natural to be back.\" During her first few months working at the Institute as an NP , Loucks was both nurse and patient, making early morning trips down the hall to breast oncology to finish her chemotherapy infusions. But she was never alone. \"The sarcoma oncologists and nurses would come visit me when I was getting treatment even before I started working here [for the second time], and they made me feel like that bond we origi-nally developed had never broken,\" she says. \"They were still very much involved in my life and were an extended part of my family.\" Since returning to DF/BWCC, Loucks has not only strengthened her ties with the sarcoma team, but has also become close with her former provider, Partridge, through her involvement in the education and fundraising efforts of the Program for Y oung Women with Breast Cancer. \"I feel like I owe her everything,\" says Loucks of Partridge. \"She really provided individu-alized, personalized care to me, and always made me feel like I was her only patient, which is pretty incredible.\" Loucks insists that her experience with cancer, while it may help her connect with patients and give colleagues an inside view of patients' thoughts, does not make her unique or special. \"I'm just a person who was diagnosed with cancer at 28, and I want to bring what I can from that experience into my work. I want to pour all of my energy into every piece of the clinic.\" by shannon wa tterson Maggie Loucks, NP, knows what it's like to be a cancer patient.There and Back Again A cancer diagnosis can change everything, including one' s career path. My cancer diagnosis came right smack in the middle of high school. I was diagnosed in March 2011, my sophomore year, with Ewing sarcoma. I had to give up sports and stop going to school while I did 14 rounds of chemotherapy and 31 rounds of radiation. I promised myself I would fight through it. And I didn't let myself get down when I lost my ability to play soccer. I relapsed in October 2012 and I've been doing treatment ever since. The dos-ages are lower, so I was able to attend school and stay involved. When I came back to school, everyone lit up when they saw me. It was a good feeling, and I was glad I could go to school, even if it was only for a few hours a day. I couldn't play, but I was named captain of my soccer team. The team came together to rally around me, and always let me feel included even when I couldn't play. \"Winning is the only option\" is a phrase my soccer coach would always say. I think about cancer in the same way. Growing up, I would always draw pictures on tests and quizzes. Art has always been my best subject and I started getting into it a bit more when I couldn't play soccer. I love photography, especially landscapes, and drawing portraits. Spring/Summer 2014 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 33 As told to melan Ie GrahamFernando MoralesWHAT I KNOW Painting is very therapeutic for me. It helps me calm down and get in the zone. I'm proud of myself for finishing high school on time. I received a standing ovation at graduation and a special golden diploma, which is awarded to someone who goes through a hardship while in high school. Cancer makes you appreciate all the little things in life. Whether it' s kids coming by to say hi, or people bak-ing me cookies, these little things make me really happy. I think cancer has brought out the best in me. I' d like to believe I was always this way, but I try to take advan-tage of everything and focus on what' s good. I can't imagine a better family to go through this with. My parents have sacrificed so much for me and I couldn't thank anyone more than them. Fernando Morales, age 19, treated at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, says cancer has \"brought out the best\" in him.A teen artist and athlete, determined to win the fight against cancer34 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2014 www.dana-farber.org Annual Report 2013 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 35 2013 an n ua L rePo rt/tr e a s u r e r 's rePo rt a n d da na-fa r b e r gov e r na n Ce Dana Farber' s strong financial performance in fiscal year 2013 culminated in an increase in net assets of approximately $146 million during a year of continued investment in our physical plant and research. We achieved an operating margin of $19 million, or roughly 1.8 percent, compared to a budgeted gain of $16 million. Non-operating revenue also had strong performance, resulting in an excess of rev-enues over expenses of $56.2 million. Total cash and investments grew by 22 percent, due to strong operating and fundraising activity and a 12.8 percent return on our portfolio for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2013. Patient care revenues grew by 6.5 percent at the main Boston campus and our regional satellite centers. Thanks to the continued support of our donors, it was a very strong year for fundraising, which saw a 5.6 percent increase in unrestricted giving. Research revenues remained fairly constant between 2012 and 2013, growing 0.8 percent. The federal deficit and sequestration had a negative impact on research growth this year. However, we ended the year with renewals of four extremely com-petitive Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) grants. In 2013, we started revitalizing our Boston campus, converting the Dana build- ing' s parking ramp into new floors with physician offices and dramatically renovating the first floor lobby. In order to co-locate Pediatric Hematology, currently housed at Boston Children' s Hospital, and Pediatric Oncology, we are also renovating the Dana building' s third floor, which includes the Jimmy Fund Clinic. From a research perspective, the planning and construction of the nearby Longwood Center is well under way. This state-of-the-art laboratory facility at the corner of Longwood and Brookline Avenues will help us recruit and retain additional world-class research faculty. These projects are funded by a capital projects campaign for 2013-15, which raised $20 million in the first year, and by a bond issuance of $50 million completed last summer. We continue to grow, expand, and invest in our regional network by investing in a broader reach for our network. We are also collaborating with many of the major providers of community cancer care in the area. Management, faculty, and staff throughout Dana-Farber - guided by the oversight of several committees of our Board of Trustees - worked diligently to achieve these results. We are grateful to them and also to the many donors and friends of Dana-Farber, who continue to demonstrate their commitment to the organization with their valuable knowledge and generous contributions. We are proud of all of these efforts and thankful for this strong and ongoing support.a message from Chief finan CiaL offiCer Karen bird 36 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s / Annual Report 2013 www.dana-farber.orgFor the Fiscal Y ear Ended Sept. 30 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Assets Current Assets 311,537 248,483 In vestments 747,048 621,266 Debt Service Reserve and Construction Fund 12,544 13,209 Proper ty, Plant, and Equipment, net 646,077 644,775 Contrib utions Receivable, less current 23,790 21,529 Total Assets $1,790,428 and Net Assets Current Liabilities 193,306 174,255 Long-T erm Debt and Other Liabilities 414,739 Unrestricted 556,219 Total Liabilities and Net Assets $1,790,428 $1,605,048 Summary Statistical Information (unless otherwise noted, includes adult and pediatric patients) Infusion T reatments 127,031 123,440 Outpatient MD Visits 235,254 225,479 Number of Licensed Beds (as of y ear-end) 30 30 Adult Inpatient Dischar ges 990 1,134 Clinical Trials (open to patients at Dana-Farber, 761 752 including therapeutic and nontherapeutic trials)da na-fa r b e r Ca nCe r in s t i t u t e inC. a n d su b s i d i a r i e s * Condensed Conso Lidated baLanCe sheets * Subsidiaries include Dana-Farber Inc. and Dana-F arber Trust.
