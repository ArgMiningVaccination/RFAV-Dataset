Dharamshala: In a major setback to the region and cancer patients, the Tibetian Doctor Yeshi Dhonden, a Padma Shri awardee and the personal healer to Dalai Lama will no longer be treating patients. Citing his old age health reasons, Dr Yeshi has given up his practice and has decided to shut down his medical centre at Mcleodganj. Notice in this regard has been displayed at his clinic which apparently states that the doctor will no longer see any patients at his clinic due to his old age health issues. He is reported to have stopped practising from 1 April. The clinic is now open only to existing patients for refilling their prescriptions. Born in 1927, the 92 years old doctor Dhonden is known as the foremost expert in a Tibetan medicine, known as Sowa-Rigpa, that draws on centuries-old techniques such as blood-letting, cupping, and moxibustion \u2014 burning herbs on energy points of the body \u2014 to try to heal ailments. The practice draws on aspects of traditional Chinese medicine and India's Ayurvedic system as well as its own unique theories and treatments. It also features spiritual practices including meditation and Buddhist prayer. His Tibetian medicine treatment his attracted devotees from all over the globe, hoping for help with conditions from back pain to cancer and degenerative diseases. Dhonden is also the founder of Men-Tsee-Khang or the Tibetan Medical College.
