Soriatane comes in 10 mg and 25 mg capsules. The prescribed dose is taken once a day with food. Several factors determine the initial dosage for each individual, including the type of psoriasis present. Doses may be reduced after symptoms improve, depending on the person's response. Ordinarily, retinoid treatment is stopped when lesions have cleared significantly. When lesions or other symptoms reappear, the drug may be taken again. Soriatane tends to work slowly for plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis may worsen before individuals start to see clearing. After eight to 16 weeks of treatment, the skin lesions usually will improve. It may take up to six months for the drug to reach its peak effect. Soriatane is indicated for use in adults with severe plaque, guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, or palmoplantar psoriasis. Who Should Not Take Soriatane? Do not take soriatane if you have: - You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding; - You have severe liver or kidney disease; - You have high triglycerides; or if - You are allergic to retinoids.

They must use two effective forms of birth control at least one month before beginning treatment, while on the drug and for three years after stopping treatment. Progestin-only birth control pills may not work while taking Soriatane, so women should avoid using them as a primary form of birth control. Individuals should not donate blood during treatment and for three years after stopping treatment. Donated blood could expose pregnant women to acitretin.

Soriatane is related to vitamin A, and taking vitamin A could add to the unwanted effects of Soriatane. Women of childbearing potential who use Soriatane must not drink or eat any substance containing alcohol during treatment and for two months after treatment is stopped. Alcohol can cause Soriatane to convert to a form that is very slowly removed from the body, which increases the risk of birth defects if the woman becomes pregnant.
