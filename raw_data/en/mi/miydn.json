The group has been diligently collecting data and reporting outcomes for more than two decades. One of the key objectives of the Quality Assurance Project is to improve the quality of breast cancer treatment by promoting adherence to national breast cancer treatment guidelines. This 20-year report provides a detailed account of breast cancer treatment and outcomes. It shows: improved guideline compliance high rates of utilisation of contemporary and life-saving treatments improved survival rates from breast cancer. The outcomes in this report demonstrate our collective commitment to providing exceptional health care, and show that breast cancer treatment in this region is of high quality and can be trusted to deliver good outcomes. The accurate and detailed information in this report regarding treatment and outcomes in a real-world setting is unique in Australia. Whilst it is widely known that breast cancer survival has improved over the last few decades, this report shows how this improvement correlates with treatment delivery in a multidisciplinary setting. The participants who consented to be part of this project, the voluntary contributions of participating clinicians, and the diligence of the project office team is highly commended. Bernadette McDonald Chief Executive Officer Canberra Health Services Margaret Bennett Chief ExecutiveSouthern NSW Local Health District9 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Acknowledgements This report reflects the efforts of many clinicians and health care consumers focussed on improving the care of people with breast cancer. The data collection project has been sustained by a small number of dedicated staff who have contributed diligently and enthusiastically to the work for 24 years. Our project manager, Yanping Zhang has been with the project for its entirety (since 1997). Yanping was assisted by dedicated staff over this period, including Thet Khin, Jenny Green, Sally Naylor and Helen Porritt. The project has benefited from resolute support from the management of BreastScreen ACT with Jenny Brogan and Yvonne Epping as initial and current directors, respectively, during a span of 24 years. The authors of this report were: Paul Craft AM, Yanping Zhang, Angela Rezo, Elizabeth Chalker, Sean Robison, Carolyn Cho, Lisa Sullivan, Nicole Gorddard, Kerri Beckmann, Yada Kanjanapan, Jane Dahlstrom OAM, Jenny Green and Sally Naylor. The preliminary results were prepared by Yanping Zhang and survival data analysis was conducted by Kerri Beckmann. Supporters of the project are listed in Appendix 1. Past and present members of the ACT and SE NSW BCTG and Data Management Subcommittee are acknowledged for their robust involvement over many years. The project staff have been funded through Canberra Health Services (previously ACT Health) with funding supplemented with generous grants from the Radiation Oncology Private Practice Fund. The project has also received extremely valuable assistance from the John James Foundation and Bosom Buddies. These grants have allowed us to add value in many ways, including allowing for specific analyses of the data, improved data cleaning, and funding the production of reports and monographs. As described in this report, the Quality Assurance Project relied on contributed information from busy clinicians, including surgeons, oncologists, pathologists and general practitioners. This 20-year report reflects the huge amount of donated time and expertise. These contributions have all assisted in documenting and improving the care for people with breast cancer in the region. Thank you to David Roder and Kun Zhao for their valuable comments and contributions. Penny Pearce and David Ritchie assisted with database support and Katherine Green contributed the map. Thanks also to Shae Lalor from The Write Path for editorial services. Finally, we would like to offer special thanks to the 6,676 women and men who agreed to allow us to collect their information, a decision taken often at a time of significant stress. The participation of so many people with breast cancer has, we believe, been instrumental in ensuring the quality of care across the region.

Persons presenting with a new diagnosis of breast cancer (including in situ breast cancer) were asked to consent for their information to be included. Over the subsequent 20 years, 58 clinicians voluntarily contributed data detailing presentation and treatment (including treatment outcomes) for 6,676 women and men with breast cancer. With the aim of reducing unwarranted variation in care, patterns of care information were fed back to individual clinicians on an annual basis, supplemented by regular presentations and discussion of results. Patterns of care, including rates of different types of treatment, were documented over a span of 20 years for both invasive and non-invasive breast cancer occurring in women and men. Over a third (35%) of all cases of invasive breast cancer were screen-detected. Of the 669 non-invasive cancers, 76% were detected through a screening program. Overall, 47.9% of women with operable invasive early breast cancer underwent mastectomy with the remainder (except for a small group not undergoing any surgery) having breast conserving surgery. The rate of breast conserving surgery has gradually increased, particularly in the most recent 5-year cohort. Almost all (95.8%) women undergoing breast conserving surgery underwent postoperative radiotherapy. However, 42 of 96 women aged 80 years and older undergoing breast conserving surgery did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. For those women undergoing mastectomy, postoperative radiotherapy is often recommended where there is involvement of the axillary lymph nodes. The proportion of women with moderate (1 to 4) axillary lymph nodes receiving radiotherapy increased from 48% in the first 15 years to almost 70% in the last 5 years of the project (1 to 3 positive lymph nodes) as evidence of benefit became clearer from randomised trials.13 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Outcomes of care Outcomes from breast cancer care were broadly assessed by estimating overall survival, breast cancer specific survival and relapse-free survival. Quality of care was assessed against 5 indicators of adherence to treatment guidelines (see Chapter 2 ). Overall adherence of treatment to all 5 relevant indicators was 92.5%. Adherence was lower for women aged 70 years or older, women residing in rural locations and for women presenting during the 1997 to 2002 period. Breast cancer specific survival was reduced for women aged 70 years and over, and for rural residents, when corrected for other prognostic factors such as tumour size and axillary lymph nodes status in Cox regression models. Those women presenting in more recent quinquennia also experienced improved breast cancer specific survival. Similar associations were observed for the recurrence-free survival endpoint. Improved breast cancer specific survival and recurrence-free survival were also associated with increased adherence to guideline-based treatment as assessed using the 5 practice indicators. The associations between age, treatment and outcomes could in part be due to the confounding effects of comorbid conditions, which was not able to be statistically corrected. However, the results suggest that compromising treatment in the elderly, even if necessitated by medical comorbidity, is associated with poor breast cancer outcomes. Most importantly, the project confirms the beneficial effect of improved treatments incorporated over the past 20 years with a steady and clinically very significant improvement in all outcomes in each 5-year period. The risk of recurrence for a woman with operable invasive breast cancer receiving care in the ACT and SE NSW was 61% less in 2012-2017 relative to 1997-2002. 14 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group1 Introduction Paul Craft AM Despite ongoing improvement in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer remains a major health problem across Australia including the ACT region. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) predicted that almost 20,000 people would contract breast cancer in 2020, and, tragically, close to 3,000 would die from the disease.1 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In 2017 (the last year for which data are included in this report), 306 women residents of the ACT developed breast cancer. Breast cancer, as with other cancers, requires complex treatment to achieve the best outcome. Achieving the best outcome requires care by a multidisciplinary team of expert clinicians focussed not just on disease control but the overall health and well-being of the person affected by breast cancer and that of their families. Decision-making can be difficult with some adjuvant treatments offering small benefits in the context of significant risk of toxicity. An ongoing challenge for health professionals offering care for people with breast cancer is rapidly changing treatment options, with new evidence informing treatment choices becoming available at an increasing rate. During 1997, in the context of continuing discovery and new treatment options, a community-based audit of breast cancer care commenced. The catalyst for the community-based quality assurance project or audit was the publication of the first Australian treatment guidelines for early breast cancer.2 The view of all clinicians involved in the care of persons with breast cancer was that ongoing review of patterns of care and treatment outcomes would help to guide and regularise treatment decision-making\u2014in an era of ongoing controversy around the optimal extent of surgery and the use of adjuvant systemic therapy. Initially, the focus was on surgical techniques (for example, breast conserving surgery replacing mastectomy in some circumstances) and on adjuvant therapies. Subsequently, the group witnessed the introduction of many new innovations including targeted systemic therapies, sentinel lymph node biopsy, oncoplastic surgery, neoadjuvant therapy and short-course radiation therapy. The introduction and take-up of these\u2014now standard\u2014treatments is depicted in this report. Over time, the quality assurance project was able to become an adjunct to surgical quality assurance requirements of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons Breast Section Audit. Adherence to agreed standard treatment approaches was able to be examined. As the project continued, basic outcome data around relapse rates and survival started to become available. The community-based audit, while not providing full population-based coverage such as provided by the ACT Cancer Registry, does have the advantage of including community practices as well as those of the larger institutions. It encompasses private as well as public practices and hospitals. Moreover, it includes information across a state boundary and enables determinants of outcome to be examined in varied treatment settings. Trends and differences in accessing adjuvant radiation treatment have shown the different choices for rural women with early breast cancer compared with those residing in Canberra, who are nearer to treatment facilities.3 15 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017The ACT and SE NSW BCTG Quality Assurance Project was developed as a quality assurance activity and approved by the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee. Because of the ethical framework, the audit data have been able to be used as a basis for academic studies of prognosis and determinants of outcomes during the course of the audit. In 2017, the milestone of 20 years of data collection was reached, forming the basis of this report. Significant funding was provided by Canberra Health Services and its predecessors. We have also received generous funding support from the Radiation Oncology Private Practice Fund, Bosom Buddies and the John James Memorial Foundation. Collecting the data is laborious and the perseverance of the small staff cohort has been crucial. This project has been important for maintaining and improving care for people affected by breast cancer in the region. Trends in treatment, particularly the uptake of new treatment methods, has been chronicled and in certain circumstances the introduction of new technology enhanced. The rapid uptake of sentinel lymph node biopsy is an example as is the switch of adjuvant chemotherapy from historic drug combinations to the more modern and effective counterparts. More recently, the increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become apparent, particularly for HER2 amplified breast cancers. It is not yet clear where the optimal rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use will be set. Over 20 years the Quality Assurance Project has continued because of the support of clinicians managing breast cancer, particularly our founding breast surgeons, Professor Noel Tait, Dr Ian Davis, Dr Margaret Beevors, and the late Associate Professor John Buckingham AM. Looking forward, the clinical group continues to find merit in examining patterns of care and outcomes of treatment. A revision of the protocol to allow for data matching and big data techniques will be important, along with streamlined consent processes and integration with the ACT Cancer Registry. While registry type, quality-focussed projects like these do not provide high-level evidence supporting one treatment in comparison with an alternative, they do provide so-called 'real-world' evidence of effectiveness. It will be clear on reading this report that evidence-based treatments are able to be given with a high degree of reliability across sectors and, at least in the setting of early breast cancer, give the outcomes expected. This Quality Assurance Project sits under a multidisciplinary group of clinicians and consumers, which meets every 4 months to consider results from the audit as well as contemplate new innovations and trends in breast cancer treatment. Throughout this report, a focus of the discussion is the burden of breast cancer on women aged over 70 years. It is apparent from the results that older women continue to experience worse outcomes. Some of this effect may be related to reduced capacity of older women to safely receive potentially toxic treatments, most notably chemotherapy. There is evidence of compromises being made in treatment for this group. Careful decision-making by older women undergoing treatment for early breast cancer is essential to achieve the best outcomes. 16 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group2 The Quality Assurance Project Paul Craft and Yanping Zhang Background In 1996, a multidisciplinary clinical group (see Appendix 1 ) involved in the control of breast cancer was formed with the assistance of ACT Health. There was grassroots interest in improving the care of persons with breast cancer based on new knowledge around treatment outcomes. The activity was particularly stimulated by the publication of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Early Breast Cancer in 1995.4 The guidelines summarised important information derived from seminal clinical trials in breast cancer clarifying the role of adjuvant systemic therapies, breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. In 1997, the group of clinicians and breast cancer consumers decided to launch a long-term audit of breast cancer care in the ACT and surrounding SE NSW (see Appendix 2 ). The audit was focussed on the region and was not tethered to a particular health care institution or facility. The project was assisted by a small number of staff housed within BreastScreen ACT. The audit continued unchanged, apart from some modifications in data items, through to 2020. Methods The study was designed as a Quality Assurance Project and notified as such under section 7 of the Health Act 1993 in May 1997. The project was approved by the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee. Data contribution and participation in the project was available to all clinicians in the ACT and surrounding SE NSW providing care for persons with breast cancer. The project adopted an inclusive approach and supported all clinicians wishing to be involved (see Appendix 3 ). Participating clinicians agreed to approach all of their patients presenting with newly diagnosed breast cancer, regardless of gender or cancer extent, and offer enrolment into the project. A simple patient information and consent form was then completed and submitted to the project (see Appendix 4.1-4.3 ). Subsequently, detailed data extraction from the medical record and relevant pathology reports was undertaken (see Appendix 4.4 ). This data included details of treatment recommended and received, the diagnostic pathway, and patient characteristics. Detailed pathological information was derived from the relevant anatomical pathology reports. 17 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Assessment of treatment outcome Long term follow-up for the whole cohort has been undertaken over a 22-year timespan. Information around recurrence events and current health status was sought at 12 months after initial treatment and then every second year. The follow-up consisted of enquiry to the treating specialist and the nominated general practitioner using a very simple form (see Appendix 5.1-5.3 ). Active follow-up of each participant continued for up to 10 years. This was supplemented with cross-checking the ACT and NSW Registries of Births, Death and Marriages. Finally, a data matching enquiry with the AIHW National Death Index was undertaken in 2019. Deaths registered as due to breast cancer, but without a reported breast cancer recurrence, were investigated by querying the treating clinician for further information (see Appendix 5.4 ). Reporting of individualised patterns of care to participants As part of the quality improvement process, results from the audit were regularly presented to the multidisciplinary group (including breast cancer consumers) to highlight trends in treatment and care and outline initial treatment outcome data. The data collected by the project has been used to estimate concordance with clinical practice guidelines to improve patient outcomes. In addition to aggregate data presentations, each clinician received an annual personalised report describing the individual patterns of care and displaying these anonymously against the group as a whole (see Appendix 6 ). Participating breast surgeons were assisted by the project in regard to their participation in the Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand Quality Audit (known as BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit or BQA). This national surgical audit allows data from this Quality Assurance Project to be uploaded on behalf of participants, preventing duplication and contributing to the national effort to improve breast cancer care (see Appendix 7 ). Database The project coordinator developed a specific database to securely store the collected data, produce various project-related updates and reports, and conduct initial data analysis. The data and their use are protected by the Quality Assurance Project Data Use Procedures (see Appendix 8 ). In addition to the BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit reports produced for each breast surgeon from 2001 to 2020, the database produced reports for the Breast Cancer Tissue Bank Project as a part of the requirements for the National Tissue Bank Project between 2009 and 2017. The Quality Assurance Project database has also served as a model, with minor modification, for data management in the ACT and SE NSW Colorectal Cancer Treatment Project (September 2003), and two other studies in the ACT for the Childhood Respiratory Symptom Surveillance Project (October 1999) and as the foundation database for the Kindergarten Health Check for children aged 5 to 6 years (February 2000). The data gathered by this project has also been used in other research and its results provided to many presentations at national and international conferences, 13 research papers in academic journals, and our quinquennial project reports (see Appendix 9 and Appendix 10 ). They have also been used by BCTG members, including junior doctors in their training programs. 18 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupClinical indicators In order to estimate concordance with treatment guidelines over the duration of the project, the BCTG adopted a number of clinical indicators around breast cancer care. The indicators are designed to represent non-controversial minimum standards of care in usual circumstances. They have been updated since the 15-year report. Clearly, decision-making around any treatment is personalised, and the indicators cannot take into account individual circumstances, comorbid conditions, and personal preferences of patients. Some non-adherence with the indicators is expected and warranted. Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy Women with completely resected invasive breast cancer greater than 2 cm or axillary lymph node involvement should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy Women aged 50 years or less, with completely resected axillary lymph node positive breast cancer, should be offered adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Radiation therapy post-breast-conserving surgery Women undergoing less than total mastectomy for operable invasive breast cancer should be offered postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Axillary surgery Women with operable invasive breast cancer should be offered some form of axillary surgery sufficient to develop a pathologically defined axillary lymph node-based prognosis. Radiation therapy post-mastectomy Women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy with more than 4 axillary lymph nodes involved should be offered post-mastectomy adjuvant radiation therapy. Concordance of care received or offered as defined by these indicators is considered throughout the report and the effect on outcomes of care is presented in Chapter 6 . 19 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 20173 Project demographics and overview of results Angela Rezo and Elizabeth Chalker The results for this 20-year report were collected for patients treated from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2017, with follow-up censored on 27 November 2020. During the 20 years, 6,676 patients gave their consent to participate in the project, representing 93.5% of all patients notified by participating clinicians in the region (see Figure 1 ). The number of notifications of breast cancer cases by participating surgeons was 7,177, which included 39 ineligible patients who did not have a new diagnosis of breast cancer. Of the 7,138 patients who were eligible, 462 did not consent to participate in the project. Of those who did not consent, 78 declined, and in the remaining 229 patients, consent was not obtained for unknown reasons, 36 had moved out of the region, and 119 had died prior to being offered participation. Consent can be obtained at any stage from diagnosis to follow-up, but the majority of the consent forms were signed around the time of breast surgery.

The collaboration between the BCTG project, the participating surgeons and the BQA continues with de-identified patient information collected by the project. Breast surgeons are provided with results against key performance indicators. Participation in the BQA is mandatory for full membership of the Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand. Surgeon participation in the BCTG Quality Assurance Project remains high, with 46% of clinicians being surgeons, 26% medical oncologists and 28% radiation oncologists (see Figure 2 ).

Breast cancer treatment in the ACT and SE NSW region This report provides an overview of treatment received by 5,323 women with invasive unilateral breast cancer, and 669 women with unilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is provided in Figure 3 . In the group with invasive breast cancer, 47.9% had a mastectomy and 52.1% had breast conserving surgery. The numbers receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and trastuzumab are shown in Figure 3 and are discussed in further detail in Chapter 5 of this report. 21 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 3 Women with unilateral invasive/DCIS breast cancerFIGURE 3 Women with unilateral invasive/DCIS breast cancer, N=5992 Women, unilateral invasive N=5,323Women, unilateral DCIS Endocrine therapy 37 (8.8) Tamoxifen 31 (7.4) Aromatase inhibitors 8 Trastuzumab Trastuzumab 234 (9.2)Mastectomy N (%) 250 (37.4) Radiotherapy 0 Chemotherapy 0 Endocrine therapy 18 (7.2) Tamoxifen 12 (4.8) Aromatase inhibitors 2 (0.8) Trastuzumab 0Breast conserving surgery N (%) 419 (62.6) In the group with DCIS, 62.6% had breast conserving surgery and 37.4% had a mastectomy. Rates of adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy are much lower compared to the invasive breast cancer group, which is expected. Details regarding the treatment of DCIS are discussed in Chapter 8 . Treatments received by special groups of breast cancer patients are shown in Figure 4 . These include 276 patients who had 2 separate breast cancers diagnosed at presentation or 'synchronous bilateral' breast cancer, 185 patients who had 2 diagnoses of breast cancer separated over time or 'metachronous bilateral' breast cancer, 103 patients with early breast cancer who did not have surgery, 140 patients presenting with metastatic disease, and 38 men with breast cancer. The treatment these patients received is listed in Figure 4 and described in more detail in Chapter 7 . It should be noted that one patient can appear in 2 categories, for example a man with bilateral breast cancer is counted in 2 categories.22 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 4 Special breast cancer groupsFIGURE 4 Special breast cancer groups Synchronous bilateral N=276 N (%)Metachronous bilateral N=185 N (%) 274 (99.3) Radiotherapy 116 (42.0) Chemotherapy 128 (46.4) Endocrine therapy 127 (46.0) Aromatase inhibitors 116 (42.0) Trastuzumab 12 (4.3)Radiotherapy (22.3) (25.2) Endocrine therapy 82 (79.6) Tamoxifen 42 (40.8) Trastuzumab (96.8) (36.1) 35 54 Aromatase inhibitors 69 (49.3) Trastuzumab 24 (17.1)Radiotherapy 15 (41.7) Chemotherapy (55.6) Endocrine therapy (72.2) Aromatase Trastuzumab 1 (2.8)Surgery N/A Breast cancer follow-up The most current status of 5,323 women with unilateral invasive breast cancer is shown in Figure 5 , and the status of 669 women with ductal carcinoma in situ is shown in Figure 6 . A supplementary table (see Table 1 ) shows the percentage of women within each category. The follow-up data was censored on 27 November 2020. The median follow-up was 7.3 years (range 3-23 years). The percentages in Figures 5 and 6 do not take into account the length of follow-up and cannot be directly compared to survival estimates quoted in AIHW reports, or the actuarial survival rates reported in Chapter 6 . Of the 4,641 women with invasive unilateral breast cancer with full follow-up information, 71.5% were alive and breast-cancer-free, 4.1% were alive with breast cancer, and 24.4% of women had died. Of the women who had died, 14.1% died from breast cancer, 10.2% died without evidence of breast cancer, and in 0.1% of cases the cause was unknown. The remaining 682 women with invasive unilateral breast cancer were alive but lost to follow-up for a period of more than 2 years.23 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 5 Current status of women with unilateral invasive breast cancer Perc entage of pa tien tsCurrent status 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 01 00Died withou t evidence of brea st cancerDeath due to brea st cancerAlive with recurrent diseaseAlive an d disease free Note Excludes cases: - Relapse free status uncertain, no response since 2015, N=682 - Unknown cause of death, N=5 FIGURE 6 Current status of women with DCIS Perc entage of pa tien tsCurrent status Died withou t evidence of brea st cancerDeath due to brea st cancerAlive with recurrent diseaseAlive an d disease free 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 01 00 Note Excludes cases: - Relapse free status uncertain, no response since 2015, N=114 - Unknown cause of death, N=2 Of the 555 women with DCIS, 83.2% were alive and disease-free, 4.1% were alive with breast cancer and 12.7% of women had died. Of those women who died, 2.7% died of breast cancer, 9.6% died without evidence of breast cancer, and 0.4% died of unknown causes. The median duration of follow-up for women with DCIS was 8.3 years. There were 114 women with DCIS who did not have relapse information, but who are likely to be alive if they are residing in Australia. The main reason for lack of breast cancer relapse information was lack of follow-up response from clinicians presumed to be involved in the patient's care in 616 cases. In 231 instances, the participant moved away from the region and follow-up was not continued.24 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 1 Current status of women with unilateral breast cancer and DCIS Current status Women with invasive breast cancerWomen with DCIS N (%) N (%) N=5,992 5,323 669 Follow-up information as at 27 November 2020* Alive and disease free 3,315 (71.5) 462 (83.2) Alive with recurrent disease 192 (4.1) 23 (4.1) Death due to breast cancer 654 (14.1) 15 (2.7) Died without evidence of breast cancer 475 (10.2) 53 (9.6) Unknown cause of death 5 (0.1) 2 (0.4) Note * Excludes relapse free status uncertain, no response since 2015, N=796 (invasive, N=682 and DCIS, N=114). How the BCTG 20-year report data differs from population-based cancer registries Cancer is a notifiable disease in all Australian states and territories and every state and territory maintains a population-based cancer registry. All new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) and all deaths of people with cancer are registered to gain a comprehensive picture of the burden of cancer. The information is used to improve cancer prevention programs, evaluate how well cancer screening programs are working, and to provide statistics to better plan cancer health services and policies for cancer prevention and health care. Every year the states and territories provide data to AIHW for inclusion in the Australian Cancer Database. There are several reports available that review the epidemiology of breast cancer in the ACT and NSW, and Australia as a whole, such as reports by AIHW and Cancer Australia. Most of these reports are based on data from the population-based cancer registries. The ACT and SE NSW BCTG QA Project collects many additional data items over and above those managed by the population-based registries, including information on the method of detection, stage, pathology and specific treatment. The follow-up information is collected from participating clinicians and then cross-referenced with the National Death Index for date and cause of death. The outcomes are measured against best practice guidelines and with the annual individual clinician feedback and 5-yearly reports, there is opportunity to improve the quality of breast cancer care and improve outcomes. The BCTG Quality Assurance Project is therefore a rich source of detailed breast cancer information.25 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Breast cancer incidence: ACT Cancer Registry and the BCTG project Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women in the ACT with an age-standardised incidence rate of 127.9 cases per 100,000 women in 20165, compared with the Australian rate of 125.9 cases per 100,000 women.6 The ACT consistently has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in Australia. The reasons for this are complex, but it is well established that there is an association between socioeconomic status and risk of breast cancer, with women in higher socioeconomic groups being at higher risk.7 The ACT has a high socioeconomic status relative to other Australian states and territories.8 It is thought that the reasons for these increased breast cancer rates are related to lifestyle factors (e.g. high alcohol consumption) and hormonal factors such as having fewer children, a higher proportion of women who have never given birth, older age at first birth, and lower rates of breastfeeding.9 While the age-standardised rate has remained relatively stable, the number of cases of breast cancer has increased considerably in the ACT due to an increase in the size of the population and the ageing of the population. One of the major risk factors for cancer is older age, so the number of people with breast cancer in the ACT is likely to increase as the proportion of older people in the population grows. Breast cancer outnumbers the next 4 most common cancers in women (colorectal cancer, melanoma, lung cancer and uterine cancer) combined. The estimated risk of female breast cancer diagnosis before the age of 85 in the ACT over the period 2013 to 2017 was 1 in 7. In the ACT, the number of females with newly diagnosed breast cancer as part of the BCTG Quality Assurance Project is similar to numbers in the AIHW data during a comparable period (1998-2016) (see Figure 7 ) confirming that, at least with ACT participants, this 20-year report reflects real-world outcomes. From 2010 to 2015 there were fewer participants in the project compared to AIHW figures related to the burden of contributing data borne by participating clinicians.

Age (and gender) remain the most significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer, with 75% of all cancers detected in Australian women aged 50 years or older.11 The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre (NBOCC) categories of risk are incorporated into the current study's participant questionnaire and include details on menopausal status, family and personal history of cancer. Over the 20-year span of the project, breast cancer detection methods have evolved with subsequent improvements in detection sensitivity. The vast majority of cancers are detected both in screening and non- screening services (i.e. private radiology clinics), with mammography and ultrasound remaining the primary imaging modalities for detection. This chapter will discuss current technologies and future developments in breast imaging. Results Consistent trends in patient characteristics have been identified over the 20-year span of the project. The median age for women in the ACT and SE NSW at the time of diagnosis was 59 years, compared with a national average age of 60 years.12 Most women were postmenopausal with peak incidence in the sixth decade (see Figure 9 and Figure 10 ), and a majority were categorised as at or slightly above risk for breast cancer based on family history (see Figure 11 ).13 Eight per cent of women were categorised as potentially high risk. Low incidence of prior breast cancer (4%) or non-breast cancer (5%) histories were identified. 28 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 9 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by age and regionNumber of pa tien ts SE NS BCTG regions) FIGURE 10 Menopausal status of women at diagnosis with invasive breast cancer Perimenopaus al 9% Postmenopaus al 66% Premenopau sal 25 Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 11 Family history of women with invasive breast cancer Potenti ally high risk 8% Moder ately increa sed age risk 80%12%8% 80% Unknown, N=19 Detection The majority of cancers were invasive (89%) with the remainder being DCIS and other non-invasive subtypes. Half of the invasive cancers were self-detected (50%) with a smaller percentage identified by GP/specialist palpation (8%) and a screening program outside the ACT and SE NSW area (5%). Less than half of all invasive cancers were screen-detected (35%), which may in part reflect the rate of participation of the target screening population, which in the ACT is 58% with a national average of 54%. Table 2 highlights characteristics of cancers detected in screened and non-screened women. Screened women had smaller cancers (80% measuring <20 mm) with 76% having no nodal involvement. Lower grade tumours (grade 1 and 2) accounted for the majority of screen-detected cancers. Conversely, the majority (80%) of larger cancers (>20 mm) were self-detected. Non-screen-detected tumours were more likely to be high grade with approximately half having nodal involvement at presentation. The majority of the 669 DCIS/non-invasive cases were detected in a screening program (76%). This is expected given that DCIS is typically asymptomatic, non-palpable and manifests as microcalcification, which is best appreciated on mammography. The data did not define those cases of invasive cancer with associated DCIS. 30 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 2 Characteristics of women with screen-detected and non-screen-detected breast cancer Characteristic Screen-detected breast cancer N (%)Non-screen-detected breast cancer N (%) Age group (years) <40 6 (1.9) 312 (98.1) 40-49 169 (16.6) 847 (83.4) 50-59 765 (49.1) 793 (50.9) 60-69 859 (59.7) 579 (40.3) 70-79 262 (35.7) 472 80 33 226 (27.4) 993 (72.6) (14.7) 407 (85.3) Micrometastasis* 38 (36.2) 67 (63.8) Unknown 99 (46.3) 115 (53.7) Tumour grade 1 658 (58.1) 474 (41.9) 2 929 (42.7) 1,246 (57.3) 3 482 (24.6) 1,476 (75.4) Breast cancer type DCIS^ 508 (75.9) 161 (24.1) breast cancer 2,094 (39.3) 3,229 (60.7) Notes * Micrometastases added to the BCTG Quality Assurance Project database since March 2012 ^ Includes the DCIS/non-invasive cases, N=669 Preoperative assessment Figure 12 outlines the preoperative investigations by year for women with invasive cancer. The majority of cancers remain detected by the combined use of mammography, ultrasound and subsequent core biopsy. Use of fine needle aspiration (FNA) continues to decline in the detection of invasive cancers although it is often used for evaluation of nodal involvement.14 Compared with FNA, core biopsy allows histopathological assessment of tumour morphology including grade and receptor status, which has important implications for patient management. 31 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Utilisation of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to increase in detection, preoperative staging and biopsy settings. Though not evaluated as part of this study, MRI-only-detected breast cancers can be sampled either with MRI-guided biopsy (which now has a Medicare rebate introduced in 2017) or by second-look ultrasound and subsequent biopsy. DCIS is typically diagnosed via stereotactic vacuum assisted biopsy utilising a wide bore (usually 9 gauge) needle for sampling of mammographic-only detected microcalcifications. FIGURE 12 Preoperative investigations by diagnosis yearNumber of pa tien ts Others The category Others includes detection by nurses, husband, etc. Older women It is acknowledged that breast cancer incidence and mortality increase with older age. Women in an older age group (70 or above) accounted for 15% of the study population. A minority of invasive cancers were detected via screening (30%) compared with the general study population (35%), likely accounted for by the drop off in screening numbers outside the 74-year target age group (increased by BreastScreen from 70 years in 2013). Small cancer incidence was similar to the overall population (56% versus 59%) and the majority of invasive cancers in this age group were self-detected/GP or Other. Future directions Risk profile Breast density is recognised as one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk. Increased volume of fibroglandular tissue can obscure mammographic assessment resulting in lower detection sensitivity and increased interval cancers of a higher grade.1532 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupThe American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) has formulated commonly used categories for assigning a visual estimate of breast density: A: The breasts are almost entirely fatty. B: There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density. C: The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. D: The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. For women with A and B density, the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer is high (around 90%) however this drops to 78% for women with category C breasts and 64% for those with category D breasts. Supplementary imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI are often recommended for women with C and D breast density. Many states in the USA now mandate breast density reporting. BreastScreen WA notifies the GP of women presenting for screening with category C and D breast density and recommends supplementary investigations. Outcomes of this intervention are being assessed and currently there is no consensus on national guidelines for breast density reporting/notification in Australia. Given established risk factors for the development of breast cancer, additional work is being undertaken to attempt to tailor screening programs based on a woman's individual risk profile, including breast density, presence of genetic mutation, family history and previous abnormal breast biopsy. Detection technology Breast imaging technology has progressed since the inception of the project, with ongoing improvements in detection sensitivity. Over the last 15 years, digital mammography has been widely adopted, particularly in the screening context. The next step in the evolution of mammography was breast tomosynthesis (also referred to as digital breast tomography or 3D mammography) which is an advanced form of mammography utilising a series of low dose mammographic images obtained at different angles. A reconstructed 3D image of the breast is then collated along with a standard 2D image. Tomosynthesis has been shown to increase sensitivity of cancer detection and reduce recall rates by minimising the masking effect of overlapping tissue. It is now the standard mammographic imaging modality in private care in Australia, with public hospital institutions increasingly adopting the technology. It may also prove beneficial in a screening context, with a prospective randomised control trial underway at BreastScreen Victoria's Maroondah centre, which is evaluating the feasibility of tomosynthesis for screening and its impact on detection and recall rates. Functional breast imaging allows evaluation of the physiological activity of cancers, and modalities include MRI and the emerging technology of contrast-enhanced mammography. MRI remains the most sensitive means of breast cancer detection and is often the only means of detecting mammographic and sonographically occult cancers. MRI is available in both public and private imaging centres in the ACT. Since the prior report, there has been limited expansion of available Medicare rebates for breast MRI (and PET/CT), however cost remains a considerable hindrance to wider utilisation. Contrast-enhanced mammography is an emerging technology which some studies have identified as having equal or near equal sensitivity in cancer detection when compared to MRI.16 Contrast mammography uses an injection of standard iodine contrast in conjunction with co-registered 2D and tomosynthesis mammography to re-create a subtracted image identifying regions of increased blood flow or neovascularity, typical in invasive cancers. Contrast mammography may be a more cost-effective means of assessing cancer size and extent than MRI and may be useful in patients where MRI is contraindicated. 33 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 20175 Treatment of early invasive breast cancer 5.1 Surgery Carolyn Cho Introduction The last 5 years has seen the continuing evolution of surgical techniques. Breast conserving surgery is now performed more frequently. Immediate breast reconstruction with mastectomy has become increasingly available and it is offered and performed more often. Management of the axilla has also changed in line with evidence from more recent studies. As the population becomes older, the treatment of women over 70 years of age needs more careful consideration and this specific group benefits significantly from multidisciplinary care. Results In the 20 years from July 1997 to June 2017, there were a total of 5,323 women with unilateral invasive breast cancer; 669 women with unilateral DCIS; and 24 women with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) who received surgical treatment.* The in situ cases are discussed in Chapter 8 . It can be seen in Figure 13 that the percentage of women having surgery within the ACT has been stable in the last 5 years, with the remainder having treatment in rural NSW (20% of patients) or elsewhere. The number having treatment in rural centres has steadily increased within this time period. Sydney and Melbourne were the most common other centres where surgery was performed (8% of cases). * Data for PLCIS only collected in 2012-2017 cohort. Pure PLCIS=24; mixed DCIS & PLCIS=12.34 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 13 Percentage of women with invasive breast cancer by place of surgery and year Other region s Rural UrbanPercen tage of N=913, Other regions, N=57 - The category 'Other regions' refers to the place of surgery if not located in ACT or SE NSW regions Breast conserving surgery Of the women with invasive breast cancer, 2,771 (52%) had breast conserving surgery (BCS) (see Figure 14 ) and this is consistent with current guidelines for the Management of Early Breast Cancer.17 Importantly, within the last year of data collection (2016-2017), the rates of BCS have increased noticeably to approximately 65% in the ACT and greater than 70% in SE NSW. Current evidence confirms that BCS provides equal locoregional control and long-term survival compared to mastectomy. Some studies also suggest that BCS may have better long-term outcomes than mastectomy.18 The impact of routine breast screening on the type of surgery performed is again demonstrated in Figure 15 , as women with screen detected cancers are more likely to have BCS. The choice between mastectomy and BCS remains multifactorial. Reasons that patients choose to have mastectomy include: concerns about the side effects of radiotherapy living in rural or remote locations where access to radiotherapy is difficult increased risk based on family history peace of mind symmetry difficulties with ongoing screening.35 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 14 Percentage of women with invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery in the ACT and SE NSW SE NS W ACTPercen N=1,065 - Excludes other regions, N=4 FIGURE 15 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by type of first operation and method of detection Non-sc reen-detected brea st cancer Screen-detected brea st cancerNumber of pa tien ts Type of oper atio Biop sy N=5,323 Other factors influencing the choice between the two procedures include: tumour biology (triple negative tumours require definitive locoregional treatment) tumour characteristics such as multifocal or multicentric tumours size and position of the primary tumour tumour size in proportion to breast size unilateral metachronous tumour where the previous cancer was treated by BCS and radiotherapy.36 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTable 3 shows that in the last 5 years of the study, 86.6% of women had one surgical procedure and 13.4% required 2 operations. The reasons for requiring further surgery include positive surgical margins where the tumour was not excised completely; further axillary surgery after a positive sentinel node; or unexpected pathology identified. Issues related to axillary surgery will be discussed below. In contrast to the previous 5-year period, in the most recent 5-year cohort, no patients required a third surgical procedure. This is very encouraging and could be due to a variety of reasons such as: improved preoperative breast imaging (the introduction of digital mammography and tomosynthesis, increased use of breast MRI) wider adoption of oncoplastic breast surgical techniques changed definition of surgical margins. Where previously 10 mm, 5 mm and 2 mm margins were required for a tumour to be considered adequately excised, current guidelines state that 'no tumour on ink' is acceptable. This means that during histopathological evaluation, if there are no cancer cells seen at the edge of the excised breast tissue which is marked by ink in the laboratory, the cancer is considered to be excised completely.19 TABLE 3 Number of operations by diagnosis period Number of breast conserving surgeries Diagnosis period One N (%)*Two N (%)*Three or more N (%)*Total N* 1997-2002 106 (20.1) 5 (0.9) 528 2002-2007 584 (89.0) 70 (10.7) 2 (0.3) 656 2007-2012 599 (84.2) 111 (15.6) 1 (0.1) 711 2012-2017 759 (86.6) 117 (13.4) 0 (0.0) 876 Notes * % is number of women who needed that number of operations divided by the total number of women for the diagnosis period who had breast conserving surgery. N=2,771 Mastectomy In the 20-year study period, overall 2,552 (48%) women had mastectomy with or without reconstruction. The recent downward trend in mastectomy rates is consistent across risk categories of family history (see Figure 16 ). FIGURE 16 Number of women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy by family history and diagnosis period Potenti ally high risk Moder ately increa sed risk At/slightl y ab ove Note N=2,542 unknown family history, N=1037 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Breast reconstruction Current guidelines recommend that breast reconstruction should be available and offered to women having mastectomy who are deemed suitable. This should involve both a breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. As immediate and delayed breast reconstruction becomes more widely offered as part of breast cancer treatment, treatment choices for women also become more complex. Breast reconstruction can be performed using either implants or tissue, which is transferred to re-create the breast shape. This tissue is normally taken from the abdomen (TRAM or DIEP flap), back (latissimus dorsi flap) or less commonly, other sites. There are also several described techniques for skin and nipple-sparing mastectomy and the choice between them is influenced by surgeon preference and clinical factors. There is now good evidence to show that skin or nipple-sparing mastectomy techniques are safe in an oncological setting with no increased risk of local recurrence.20 Frozen section of the nipple margin should be considered intraoperatively for tumours close to the nipple to ensure adequate surgical margins. The increasing use of breast MRI preoperatively to evaluate tumours also helps with surgical decision-making. Implant-based reconstruction remains the most common technique for immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) and it can be performed as a single stage or two-stage procedure, depending on whether a direct (permanent) implant or tissue expander is used. The latter requires a second surgical procedure to exchange it for a permanent prosthesis. These techniques can be done with or without the use of a mesh or acellular dermal matrix (ADM), which can be used in so-called dual-plane reconstructions. This is where the implant is placed under a layer composed of pectoralis major muscle superiorly and some type of ADM or mesh inferiorly. Thus, there is a second complete layer of tissue/mesh under the skin and subcutaneous tissue which covers the implant. More recently, pre-pectoral implant placement has been described, where the implant lies directly under the skin and subcutaneous flap, with or without the use of a mesh. The use of implants for breast reconstruction has come into focus in the last few years due to concerns about secondary cancer. A rare type of lymphoma termed Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) has been described in the capsule and seroma fluid surrounding breast implants. The capsule surrounding an implant is essentially formed from collagen tissue as a reaction to the prosthesis and it develops around any implant. The risk of BIA-ALCL is difficult to estimate, as not all countries have reliable implant and population registries. The estimated worldwide risk is 1 per 30,000, however this ranges between 1 per 3,800 to 1 per 60,000 depending on the implant surface. Implants which have a macro- textured or polyurethane surface are at highest risk of developing BIA-ALCL, although it has also been described in smooth and micro-textured implants overseas. The risk in these latter groups is significantly less, although the US FDA-reported incidence in smooth implants is 12%. Ninety-eight per cent of cases are cured by removal of the implant and capsule.21 Although rare, concern regarding BIA-ALCL has made the choice between implants difficult for surgeons and women alike, and some have either avoided reconstruction altogether or considered autologous techniques instead. Textured implants continue to be used as they have a lower risk of capsular contracture and the textured surface reduces the risk of implant movement or rotation. This is important when anatomical implants are used to create a more natural 'tear drop' shaped breast. The European Society of Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) also recommends that women who have any implants in place, including those at higher risk of BIA-ALCL, do not need to have them removed, and that textured implants can continue to be used for IBR.22 Nevertheless, IBR using a direct-to-implant technique has become increasingly used as it is less complex surgery, requires a shorter hospital stay, has a shorter recovery time and is less costly than autologous tissue procedures. Thus, the decision between simple total mastectomy, skin-sparing and nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction or delayed breast reconstruction should be a joint decision between a woman and her surgeon.38 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 4 Characteristics of women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction Immediate reconstruction N (%)Delayed reconstruction N (%)Mastectomy with no reconstruction N (%) Breast cancer type Invasive ( N=2,552) 178 (7.0) 270 (10.6) 2,096 (82.4) DCIS ( N=250) 36 (14.6) 28 (11.3) 183 (74.1) Age group (years) <40 37 (17.5) 42 (19.9) 132 (62.6) 40-49 74 (13.5) 123 (22.5) 350 (64.0) 50-59 47 (6.8) 79 (11.4) 570 (81.9) 60-69 16 (2.8) 23 (4.0) 538 (93.2) 70-79 3 (0.8) 3 (0.8) 356 (98.3) 80 1 (0.7) 0 (0.0) 150 (99.3) Diagnosis period 1997-2002 7 (1.3) 76 (13.6) 476 (85.2) 2002-2007 23 (3.4) 77 (11.3) 584 (78.8) 2007-2012 60 (8.7) 86 (12.5) 542 (78.8) 2012-2017 88 31 (5.1) 494 (80.6) Radiotherapy and ( N=449) Received 216 (48.1) Not received 225 (50.1) Offered and refused 8 (1.8) Note Excludes unknown reconstruction for invasive, N=8, and DCIS, N=3 Table 4 shows that over the 5-year periods, the rate of IBR is slowly increasing but still remains low. Of the total number of women with early invasive breast cancer in the last 5-year cohort, 14.4% had immediate and 5.1% had delayed breast reconstruction. IBR rates have noticeably increased in this last 5-year period whereas delayed procedures have declined. This reflects changing patterns of clinical practice, where IBR has become increasingly available and discussed more routinely than previously. It has not been possible to accurately identify the number of cases performed in the private versus the public hospital setting, however over the 20-year study period, reconstruction is increasing in both sectors. Within the last 5-year cohort, 67% ( N=124) were performed in the private hospital setting and 27% ( N=50) in public hospitals. In 6% of reconstruction cases, it is unknown where the surgery took place (see Figure 17 ).39 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 17 Women with invasive breast cancer undergoing breast reconstruction in the private and public hospital setting by diagnosis period Unknown Public PrivatePercen is important to note that almost half (48%) of women who had reconstruction also had radiotherapy. Within the last 5-year cohort, since the majority of reconstructions were immediate ( N=88), an increasing number of women had post-mastectomy radiotherapy after implant reconstruction ( N=57; approximately 58%). It is crucial that women are aware that radiotherapy can adversely affect the aesthetic results and complication rates of IBR, so that they have realistic expectations of the surgical outcome. Axillary surgery Axillary lymph node assessment continues to have an important role in the surgical management of early invasive breast cancer. At the time of initial diagnosis, the axillary lymph nodes are assessed clinically and with dedicated axillary ultrasound. They can also be imaged using other modalities such as mammography, CT and MRI, however ultrasound assessment remains the most accurate and useful. Ultrasound-guided FNA can be easily performed if any abnormal lymph nodes are identified. For those women where there is no evidence of cancer spread to axillary (or other) lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed. SLNB is now the gold standard of axillary lymph node staging in early invasive breast cancer and also selected cases of ductal and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ.23 It involves the identification of the sentinel lymph node using preoperative dye mapping with Technetium 99 m - labelled antimony colloid. In recent years, the use of Patent Blue V dye as a second mapping agent has declined due to concerns about allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. On average 2 to 3 sentinel lymph nodes are identified and excised for histopathological testing. Where metastases are detected in the sentinel lymph node, some patients may then require formal axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) of the level II +/- level III axilla. Previous studies have shown that where the sentinel lymph node contains a metastasis, this will be the only lymph node/s positive in 40-60% of cases, meaning that a majority of patients do not require ALND. Currently, according to the ACOSOG Z0011 and other studies, those patients who have breast conserving surgery with positive axillary SLNB do not require further axillary surgery. Patients who had 3 or more positive sentinel nodes or extracapsular extension were excluded from this category.24 It is also important to note that in the Z011 study the following groups were excluded: patients who T3 patients who had undergone previous axillary surgery; and women with pre-pectoral implants. Other groups who should be treated with caution are: younger women; triple negative cancers; and high grade or HER2 amplified tumours.25 40 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTable 5 shows that the rates of SLNB plus ALND are slowly decreasing, and this would reflect a change in clinical practice based on published studies. It can also be seen that the rates of surgery involving SLNB alone have increased, particularly in the 2 most recent 5-year cohorts. At present, 66% of women have SLNB alone and this results in significantly less morbidity from axillary surgery, such as shoulder stiffness, dysaesthesia and lymphoedema.

The decision to offer treatment in accordance with current guidelines must take into consideration: the woman's general health and other medical conditions the wishes of the woman and her family the impact of treatment on a woman's quality of life tumour biology. The risks of surgery and general anaesthesia also increase with age. Some patients may choose BCS due to the smaller surgery and shorter recovery time, whereas others may choose mastectomy to try to avoid the possibility of needing a second operation or radiation therapy. Some women may decline surgery due to concerns about general anaesthesia, postoperative recovery, and the availability of family/carer supports. Others may not be suitable for surgery and may have primary endocrine treatment or no treatment whatsoever. 41 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Within this report, of the 2,552 women who had mastectomy, 512 were aged 70 years or over. Comparing the 5-year cohorts, there was an increasing number who had mastectomy. This is seen in all groups regardless of family history risk (see Figure 18 ). FIGURE 18 Number of women aged 70 years or older with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy by family history and diagnosis period Potenti ally high risk Moder ately increa sed risk At/slightl y ab ove 2002-2007 1997-2002 N=512 Of the women in this age cohort, there is also a slight trend towards fewer undergoing chemotherapy when it is offered compared to those refusing adjuvant radiotherapy or endocrine treatment when offered. Overall though, there is a trend towards increasing adjuvant treatment of all types. This may reflect an increasing number of women in this age group with better physical health who are offered more active treatment (see Figure 19 and Figure 20 ). There is minimal data on neoadjuvant systemic or endocrine treatment. Within the 20-year period, only 103 women had no surgery at all and of these women, 41 were aged 70 years or older. For women who did not have any surgery, there was an increasing trend towards treatment with endocrine therapy using an aromatase inhibitor, rather than tamoxifen or a combination of both. FIGURE 19 Patterns of adjuvant treatment in women aged 70 years or older following mastectomy by diagnosis period 020406080100 Oered an d refused 2002-2007 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 20 Patterns of adjuvant treatment in women aged 70 years or older following breast conserving surgery by diagnosis period 020406080100 Oered an d refused 2007-2012 2002-2007 1997-2002 It is important to note, as the general health of our population continues to improve, there is an increasing number of older women who have a better 'physiological age' than their biological age, and these women should be actively treated according to current guidelines. This includes a discussion regarding immediate or delayed breast reconstruction. Recent Australian data shows that the reconstruction rate for women aged over 60 years was 25.4% in comparison with rates published in the literature for women of all ages, which range from 5% to 80%. It was suggested that IBR using a direct to implant technique may be more suitable for older women as it only involves one surgical procedure and may have fewer complications than two- stage procedures or delayed/autologous reconstruction.26 Preliminary data from this project shows that the reconstruction rate is less than 2%. It is not possible to draw any conclusions about this low rate due to small numbers, however many older women may not wish to have more major surgery because of other medical factors. Some may not be offered reconstruction due to age bias. Women in the 70-79 years age group and those aged 80 years or older are also more likely to have no axillary surgery in 10.4% and 27% of cases, respectively (see Table 5 ). This was also noted in the 15-year report. It is thought to be due to several factors including a woman's fitness for surgery due to other medical conditions, and patient and family choices. Future directions Risk-reducing mastectomy After a diagnosis of breast cancer, a certain percentage of women consider preventative mastectomy, also known as risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM), where the other healthy breast is removed. This can be done at the same surgery or at a later time. Other groups who have bilateral RRM are healthy women with a known breast cancer gene or other high-risk gene mutation, those with a potentially high-risk family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those with no other risk factors but who remain anxious. It is estimated that in the USA, 30-40% of women consider RRM and 15-20% actually proceed with this additional surgery.2743 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017These women should be fully informed about the risks of surgery and have access to the full range of surgical techniques available for mastectomy and reconstruction. This includes a discussion with both breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. It is important that women have realistic expectations of the surgery and cosmetic outcomes and are aware that RRM reduces risk by over 90% but not 100%. Particularly for women with breast cancer having contralateral RRM, they need to be aware that as the risk of a contralateral breast cancer is low (<0.5% per year), there is no improvement in overall survival, and it does not affect the risk of any recurrence of the ipsilateral cancer. Genetic assessment and psychological counselling are also important prior to any surgery. The use of online information such as BRECONDA (Breast Reconstruction Decision Aid) is also helpful in decision-making. There is still another group of women who do not carry a gene mutation or have a strong family history who choose to proceed with RRM. Some women have very dense breast tissue or other features which make breast screening very difficult, and some have other breast lesions associated with a generally increased breast cancer risk such as classical lobular carcinoma in situ. Other common reasons are peace of mind, reducing the stress associated with future mammography, and symmetry. The latter can be a significant benefit in women with a very large breast size who undergo mastectomy without reconstruction for cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant treatment The use of neoadjuvant treatment is steadily increasing, as more trials demonstrate improved outcomes in selected groups. The use of these modalities can potentially alter surgical treatment and should be done in the multidisciplinary setting. Advantages include: tumour downsizing to enable BCS reduced complication rates with immediate breast reconstruction minimalising axillary surgery the provision of important prognostic information.28 The reduction in axillary surgery, for instance, using SLNB or targeted axillary surgery rather than axillary lymph node dissection also leads to a reduction in surgical morbidity. The current trials investigating neoadjuvant radiotherapy are also showing promising results in reducing surgical complications and improved cosmesis.29 Sentinel lymph node mapping and tumour localisation To date, there are many methods of sentinel lymph node mapping and tumour localisation available, many of which require preoperative procedures on the day of surgery. These can cause additional stress to women and also delays to the operating list. Newer techniques using a radioactive seed or magnetic trace are currently being trialled, and have the potential to resolve these issues and make surgery safer for women. Outcomes During the 20-year study period, there have been many changes in surgical techniques and approaches which have led to better surgical outcomes, with reduced morbidity and an improved quality of life for women with breast cancer. An increase in BCS rates in line with current clinical practice internationally improved breast reconstruction rates, reduced axillary surgery procedures, and neoadjuvant modalities, have all been identified in this project. With an ageing but healthy population, the challenge for the next 20 years is to improve tailored treatment through each decade of life.44 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group5.2 Radiotherapy Lisa Sullivan Breast conservation radiotherapy The standard of care for women who undergo breast conserving surgery is to receive radiotherapy to the conserved breast (adjuvant breast radiotherapy) to improve local control and long-term survival.30 Adjuvant breast radiotherapy reduces the risk of a breast cancer death by approximately one-sixth, and reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by half. Overall, for every 4 women who avoid a breast cancer recurrence by year 10 of diagnosis, one woman avoids a breast cancer death by year 15.2.31 The absolute benefit of radiotherapy, however, varies considerably in individual women. The greatest benefit of breast conserving radiotherapy is found in young women with large, node-positive breast cancer. In clinical practice, there are some women, particularly older women with low risk clinicopathological features, in whom the benefits of treatment might be outweighed by other considerations. To date, however, there is no known cohort of women, who undergo breast conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer, in which radiotherapy can be omitted without a detriment to local control. Results In the ACT and SE NSW, of the 2,692 women (excludes offered and refused, N=79) who underwent breast conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer, 2,579 (95.8%) were recommended adjuvant breast radiotherapy. The percentage of women receiving breast conserving radiotherapy is summarised in Table 6 . This table shows the number and percentage of women receiving radiotherapy according to age, grade, tumour size, nodal involvement and margin status. Women aged 80 years and older were the largest group of women who underwent surgery alone. 45 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017TABLE 6 Characteristics of women with invasive breast cancer receiving radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery Surgery alone N (%)Surgery plus radiotherapy N (%) N=2,692* 113 (4.2) 2,579 (95.8) Age group (years) <40 102 (2.2) 447 (97.8) 21 (2.5) (97.5) 70-79 24 (6.9) 326 (93.1) 80 42 (43.8) 54 (56.3) Tumour grade 1 38 (5.2) 698 (94.8) 2 39 (3.6) 1,035 (96.4) 3 30 (3.5) 822 (96.5) Unknown 5 (21.7) 18 (78.3) Tumour size (mm) (95.0) Unknown 0 (0.0) 3 (100.0) Number of involved nodes 0 52 (2.7) 1,845 (97.3) 1-4 10 (1.9) 516 (98.1) 50 (36.0) 89 (64.0) Micrometastasis 1 (1.8) 55 (98.2) Margin status (mm) 0 6 (7.9) 70 (92.1) <1 5 (4.1) 116 (95.9) <5 30 (3.1) 930 (96.9) >10 27 (4.3) 607 (95.7) Unknown 1 (16.7) 5 (83.3) *Excludes offered and refused, N=7946 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupOlder women Increasing age was significantly associated with not receiving radiotherapy (see Figure 21 ). Almost 98% of women under 70 years of age received adjuvant radiotherapy compared to approximately half of women aged 80 years and older. Older women were less likely to be recommended adjuvant radiotherapy by their doctors, and a larger percentage of older women refused adjuvant radiotherapy despite it being recommended. Eleven per cent of women aged 80 years and older refused radiotherapy compared to 5.7% of women in their 70s and less than 3% in women under 70 years of age. FIGURE 21 Percentage of women with invasive breast cancer receiving radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery by age group Oered and refused Not oe red ReceivedPercen offered and refused cases, N=79 In the setting of breast conserving surgery, the risk of local recurrence reduces with age.32 Hence, the absolute benefit of radiotherapy also reduces with age. The CALBG 9343 trial demonstrated that in women aged 70 years or older with low-risk breast cancer, the addition of radiotherapy to breast conserving surgery provided a small improvement in recurrence-free survival in the ipsilateral breast. However, there was no improvement in overall survival, ultimate breast preservation or distant disease-free survival.33 The 2012 guidelines from the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) and European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) recommend whole breast radiotherapy in all elderly patients on the basis that, to date, all subgroups of fit older patients benefit from adjuvant breast radiotherapy.34 In contrast, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines were amended in 2015 and now state that breast irradiation may be omitted in those 70 years of age or older with ER-positive, clinically node-negative, T1 tumours who receive adjuvant hormonal therapy.35 In older women, the benefit of radiotherapy needs to be weighed against the patient's absolute benefit of radiotherapy in the context of their other comorbidities and predicted life expectancy. The identification of a subgroup of women who could be managed with adjuvant endocrine treatment alone, following breast conserving surgery, is currently under investigation in clinical trials using biological, genetic and clinical predictors. 47 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Quality indicators The EUSOMA working group published an update of quality indicators in breast cancer care in 2017.36 In women with invasive breast cancer who undergo breast conserving surgery, the working group suggest a minimum of 90% of women should receive postoperative radiation therapy, with a target of 95%. In the ACT and SE NSW, over the last 20-year period, the percentage of women who were offered and received radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery was 95.8%, fulfilling the EUSOMA's optimal target (see Table 6 ). Future directions In Australia and internationally, hypofractionated radiotherapy is considered standard treatment for the majority of women following breast conserving surgery for early breast cancer. Hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy is usually delivered over 3 to 4 weeks, compared to conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy over 5 to 6 weeks. Multiple, large, international randomised trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy.37 In addition, hypofractionated radiotherapy is more convenient for women and less resource intensive for radiotherapy departments. Unfortunately, the BCTG Project has not collected the number of treatments (fractions) or time period of treatment. Future changes to the data collection will endeavour to include more specifics about radiotherapy treatment including number of fractions, days per week, and treatment technique. Post-mastectomy radiotherapy The indications for post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) changed significantly since the beginning of this study in 1997. Traditionally, post-mastectomy radiotherapy is indicated in patients with 4 or more lymph nodes involved and/or primary breast tumours greater than 5 cm in size, to improve local control and long- term survival. More recent evidence shows that PMRT reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality in women with any number of positive lymph nodes.38 International guidelines, published in 2016, recommended that the decision to use PMRT in patients with 1-3 lymph node positive disease should be made in the context of other high-risk features and through a multidisciplinary approach.39 Higher risk features include patients of younger age (<45 years), presence of lymphovascular invasion, high grade disease, oestrogen receptor negativity, and large size of involved nodal metastases. Results In the ACT and SE NSW, of the 2,490 patients (excludes radiotherapy offered and refused cases, N=62) with invasive breast cancer who underwent a mastectomy, 1,027 (41.2%) received PMRT. The percentage of patients receiving PMRT according to nodal status, tumour size and margin status is shown in Table 7 . The percentage of patients receiving PMRT increases with greater tumour size, greater nodal burden, and positive margin status. As expected, the vast majority (approximately 90%) of patients with tumours greater than 5 cm and/or more than 4 lymph nodes positive received post -mastectomy radiotherapy.48 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 7 Characteristics of women with invasive breast cancer receiving post-mastectomy radiotherapy Surgery alone N (%)Surgery (58.8) 1,027 0-10 155 (20.7) 21-50 518 (48.1) 559 (51.9) >50 31 (10.4) 266 (89.6) Unknown 2 (33.3) 4 (66.7) Number of involved nodes ^* 0 976 (82.2) 211 (17.8) 1-4 368 (46.0) 432 (54.0) >4 36 (9.1) 57 (91.9) 5 (8.1) Micrometastases 26 (56.5) 20 (43.5) Margin status (mm) 0 23 (23.5) 75 (76.5) <1 28 (43.8) 36 (56.3) <5 244 (49.6) 248 (50.4) 5-10 326 (57.1) 245 (42.9) >10 839 (66.6) 420 (33.4) Unknown 3 (50.0) 3 (50.0) Notes * Excludes radiotherapy offered and refused cases, N=62 ^ Ideally the nodal data would be presented according to TNM (see Abbreviations) nodal group staging, but at the time this study started, a decision was made to group those with 1-4 involved nodes together. The percentage of patients with any lymph node positive disease receiving PMRT increased from 59% in the first 15 years of the study (1997-2011) to 76% in the last 5 years (2012-2017). The following 2 tables compare the percentage of patients offered PMRT with lower ( Table 8 ) and higher ( Table 9 ) numbers of positive lymph nodes, over 2 time periods. At the inception of this study, patients with 1-4 lymph nodes positive were classified together. In 2012, the BCTG reclassified nodal status to reflect the exact number of lymph nodes involved to correlate with the TNM staging system more easily.49 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017TABLE 8 Percentage of patients receiving post-mastectomy radiotherapy with low level lymph node positive disease over 2 time periods First 15 years 1-4 lymph node positive N (%)Last 5 years 1-3 lymph node positive N (%) N=827 (73.0) 223 (27.0) Radiotherapy Received 269 (44.5) 155 (69.5) Not offered 313 (51.8) 61 (27.4) Offered and refused 22 (3.6) 7 (3.1) TABLE 9 Percentage of patients receiving post-mastectomy radiotherapy with high level lymph node positive disease over 2 time periods First 15 years >4 lymph node positive N (%)Last 5 years >4 lymph node positive N (%) N=429 329 (76.7) 100 (23.3) Radiotherapy Received 290 (88.1) 92 (92.0) Not offered 34 (10.3) 6 (6.0) Offered and refused 5 (1.5) 2 (2.0) The greatest change in the proportion of patients receiving PMRT is seen in the subgroup of patients with the smaller numbers of lymph nodes involved. Between 1997 and 2011, 48.1% of patients with 1-4 lymph nodes positive were offered PMRT. This increased to 72.6% of patients with 1-3 lymph nodes positive between 2012 and 2017. There is much less change seen in those with higher numbers of lymph nodes involved in each time period (88% to 92%). This reflects the timing of the publication of evidence for benefit of PMRT in patients with any number of lymph node positive disease and the resultant change in practice over the time of the study. Whereas patients with 4 or more lymph nodes positive have had strong indications for PMRT over the entire study period. Quality indicators The EUSOMA working group's updated quality indicators in breast cancer recommend a minimum standard of 90% of patients with 4 or more positive lymph nodes to receive post-mastectomy radiotherapy, with an ideal target of 95%.40 Due to the lymph node grouping in this study, we cannot assess this particular subgroup over the entire 20 years. However, in patients with more than 4 positive lymph nodes, 90.9% were recommended post-mastectomy radiotherapy. This compares to 54% of patients with 1-4 lymph nodes positive and 17.8% of patients with uninvolved lymph nodes. In the last 5 years of the study, we can evaluate the subgroup of patients with 4 or more lymph nodes positive due to the change in nodal classification. From July 2012, 100 patients enrolled with 4 or more positive lymph nodes. Ninety-two per cent of these patients received PMRT, reaching the EUSOMA's minimum target. 50 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTable 10 shows patients who underwent mastectomies for invasive breast cancer and had 1-4 involved lymph nodes. Consistent with international guidelines, the factors associated with receiving post- mastectomy radiotherapy in this cohort were younger age, larger tumour size, higher grade, positive/close margin status, and the presence of lymphovascular space invasion.

It will be useful to assess the percentage of women requiring further revision surgery after radiotherapy to a reconstructed breast. This will assist in informing our patients and our medical professionals prior to decisions regarding reconstruction and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can make decisions for post-mastectomy radiotherapy more difficult due to the lack of full pathological information prior to treatment. Currently, radiotherapy is recommended based on the initial stage of disease at diagnosis. It is unclear whether radiotherapy could be omitted in women who achieve a complete pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Future studies could examine the percentage of women recommended radiotherapy in the setting of complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Regional nodal radiotherapy Radiotherapy to the chest wall following mastectomy, or to the whole breast following breast conserving surgery, may be combined with radiotherapy to the regional lymph node regions which comprise the axilla, supraclavicular fossa (SCF) and internal mammary chain (IMC). In the addition of radiotherapy to the SCF, undissected axilla and IMC, in addition to the chest wall or breast, is associated with improvements in both overall survival and distant metastatic disease survival.41 The updated NCCN guidelines, published in 2020, recommend that all patients with 4 or more lymph nodes involved should be offered comprehensive nodal radiotherapy. It also recommends that comprehensive nodal radiotherapy should be strongly considered in patients with 1-3 lymph nodes positive. At the inception of this study, comprehensive nodal radiotherapy was not typically recommended in patients with 1-3 lymph nodes positive. There has, therefore, been a significant change in clinical guidelines over the 20-year period. Results Over the last 20 years, there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of women receiving radiotherapy to regional nodal groups following breast conserving surgery. This change has been small in absolute terms with the greatest change seen in SCF radiotherapy (3% in 1997-2002, compared with 10% in 2012-2017). There has, however, been a significant increase in regional nodal radiotherapy in women receiving post- mastectomy radiotherapy. The percentage of women receiving radiotherapy to different nodal sites over 5-year periods is shown in Figure 22 . FIGURE 22 Percentage of women receiving radiotherapy following mastectomy by site and diagnosis period Axillar y Internal mammar y chai n SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupThe most significant change is a fourfold increase in the percentage of women receiving IMC radiotherapy, from 5% in 1997-2002 to 40% (1997-2002) to 66% (2012-2017). This change in practice is due to the increased indications for regional nodal radiotherapy in women, and our ability to safely deliver this treatment. Over the last 2 decades, there has been considerable improvement in radiotherapy planning and delivery, which has allowed improved conformity of dose to the target areas with reduced dose, and hence less toxicity, to normal tissue. This study did not define axillary radiotherapy as whole axilla, undissected axilla or high axilla. It is, therefore, difficult to comment on the axillary radiotherapy changes. Figure 23 compares the percentage of women with 4 or more lymph nodes positive receiving radiotherapy to individual nodal sites in the last 5 years of the study. FIGURE 23 Percentage of women with 4 or more lymph nodes positive receiving radiotherapy by site and diagnosis period Axillar y Internal mammar y chai n Supr N=123 Due to multiple sites, figures do not add to 100% In women with 4 or more lymph nodes positive, a similar high percentage (~80%) received SCF radiotherapy over the 5 years, but a dramatic increase is seen in the percentage of women receiving IMC radiotherapy. This directly corresponds with the publication of the three landmark trials confirming a significant clinical benefit of regional nodal radiotherapy in 2015-16.42 Future directions This study confirms significant changes in practice with regards to the percentage of patients receiving nodal radiotherapy. With future BCTG publications, we hope to assess the impact of this change in clinical practice on the oncological and survival outcomes of our patients. This may assist in determining, in particular, the impact of radiotherapy to specific nodal sites. 53 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 20175.3 Systemic adjuvant therapies Nicole Gorddard Background Over the past 3 decades, there has been a substantial decrease in mortality from breast cancer in many Western countries. In Australia, between 1982 and 2016, breast cancer mortality in women has fallen by close to 50%. Currently, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer in Australian women is 91%.43 The improvement in breast cancer survival is due to a number of factors, including the introduction of breast screening for asymptomatic women and more effective systemic adjuvant therapies. The systemic adjuvant therapies in use today are chemotherapy, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies, and endocrine therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy In recent years there has been increasing use of neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, particularly for high grade, triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancers. Historically, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used for locally advanced breast cancers with the aim of reducing the size of these cancers in the breast and associated involved lymph nodes preoperatively, to facilitate successful surgery with clear margins. This surgical 'downstaging' approach can also include reducing cancer size so that more patients can have breast conserving surgery rather than mastectomy. More recent data demonstrate that the quality of the cancer response to preoperative chemotherapy (with HER2 targeted therapy/trastuzumab if indicated) provides valuable prognostic information, particularly for triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancers.44 In addition, for cancers which do not respond well to preoperative chemotherapy, there may be the opportunity to intervene and tailor postoperative systemic therapy to reduce future risk of recurrence.45 These more recent data have led to a trend for higher grade, triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancers to be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy if they are more than 2 cm in size, and particularly if they are lymph node positive. In HER2 positive breast cancer, adding a second HER2 targeted drug, pertuzumab, to preoperative chemotherapy and trastuzumab also improves the response to preoperative treatment.46 More than 5% of patients with invasive breast cancer were recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the last 5 years (see Figure 24 ); at least double the previous 5-year period. 54 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 24 Percentage of women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy by diagnosis neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is still being defined in clinical trials. Outside the clinical trial setting this may be helpful treatment for older women with very hormone-sensitive and large breast cancers who would benefit from surgical downstaging but would not manage chemotherapy well. The recent trends in use of neoadjuvant therapies are reflected in Figure 25 and Figure 28 . Over the past 2 decades the percentage of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer has increased, whilst there has been a decline in the percentage of patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Results As shown in Figure 25 , subsequent to 2012, the majority of women receiving neoadjuvant treatment were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy rather than neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. This reflects the trend to optimise the use of preoperative chemotherapy in higher risk, higher grade breast cancers and maximise the chance of breast conserving surgery. Prior to 2012, neoadjuvant therapies were split more evenly between chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. It is likely many of these women had very locally advanced breast cancers with a low expectation of long-term cure, and preoperative treatment choice was based on patient tolerability in the short-term as well as cancer activity. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are generally not given concurrently due to concern over possible negative treatment interaction. However, in 2015 The Canberra Hospital began participating in a clinical trial (called the Eliminate Trial) investigating the use of sequential versus concurrent endocrine therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.55 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 25 Percentage of women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy by diagnosis period Neoadjuvant 26 , anthracycline and taxane combination chemotherapy protocols are the most effective breast cancer regimens (this is further discussed in the adjuvant chemotherapy section), and therefore appropriate to use in the neoadjuvant setting when treating higher risk and more chemotherapy- sensitive breast cancers. There has been a clear increase in the use of anthracycline-taxane combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy since 2012. FIGURE 26 Number of women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy by diagnosis period Other Anthracycline+Taxane Taxane -based Anthracycline-base 2012-2017 2007-2012 2002-2007 1997-2002 Few women over the age of 70 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (see Figure 27 ). This probably reflects both the different tumour biology in this age group (lower proportion of high grade and endocrine resistant breast cancer) as well as a higher percentage of frail patients not fit for chemotherapy. Potentially newer treatment approaches may also not be considered so readily in older patients due to concerns around toxicity.56 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 27 Number of women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy by age group Other Anthracycline+Taxane Taxane -based Anthracycline-base d CMFNumber of a slight decrease in neoadjuvant endocrine therapy use over the last decade of the study, as shown in Figure 28 . This is probably because the role for initial endocrine therapy remains ill-defined and is the subject of ongoing clinical research. The main indication for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is for older and more frail patients with large and difficult to resect oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer, or who initially decline surgery. FIGURE 28 Number of women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy by year Neoadjuvant diagnosis05101520 2016-20172015-20162014-20152013-20142012-20132011-20122010-20112009-20102008-20092007-20082006-20072005-20062004-20052003-20042002-20032001-2 0022000-20011999-20001998 -19991997-1998 Women who are diagnosed with distant metastases at presentation would normally be recommended to receive systemic therapy with either chemotherapy or endocrine treatment initially, as surgery may not be indicated in most of these cases. The care of women presenting with stage IV metastatic breast cancer is discussed in Chapter 7 of the report.57 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Future directions Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is at least equivalent to postoperative chemotherapy in terms of long-term outcomes but may downstage the primary cancer to a size that is suitable for breast conserving surgery. Patients who achieve a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (no invasive cancer remaining at the time of their operation) have a reduced risk of relapse following treatment. Ongoing research is further refining the optimal use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- HER2 targeted therapy and addressing the role of tailoring subsequent treatment according to neoadjuvant results. More recent data in triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancers demonstrate improved outcomes with modification of postoperative systemic therapy if there is suboptimal response to preoperative treatment.47 Chemotherapy The modern era of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy began with the 1976 publication of the results of a trial by Bonadonna and colleagues.48 This trial showed that the recurrence rate in women with node positive early breast cancer who received chemotherapy with oral CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) was significantly lower than in those who were randomised to receive no chemotherapy. Subsequently, the updated results of this trial showed that not only was there an improvement in disease- free survival for those women randomised to receive CMF, there was also a significant improvement in overall survival. Over time there has been a change in the types of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy used. Up until 2003, CMF was the most commonly prescribed chemotherapy regimen. However, anthracycline-based (doxorubicin and epirubicin) treatments were received by women participating in the BCTG Quality Assurance Project from 1997. By 2004, anthracycline-based regimens were the most commonly prescribed regimens. CMF was largely being replaced by anthracycline-based regimens, which were shorter and more convenient, or more effective, and taxane chemotherapy had entered routine clinical practice. Taxane chemotherapy proved to be effective when added to anthracycline chemotherapy, or used as an alternative to anthracyclines.49 By 2008, most patients received a taxane chemotherapy agent (see Figure 29 ). Anthracycline plus taxane regimens, which were introduced in 2002,50 are the most active breast cancer chemotherapy regimens and are commonly used for higher risk and lymph node positive breast cancer.51 By 2012, anthracycline plus taxane regimens were the most frequently used regimens for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and remain the most utilised regimens to date (see Figure 29 ). From 2006 onwards there was a sharp decline in the use of anthracycline-based regimens in favour of anthracycline plus taxane regimens. Taxane-based chemotherapy regimens (without anthracycline) are also active and avoid some of the rare complications of anthracyclines, namely cardiomyopathy and secondary leukaemia, hence are frequently chosen in intermediate risk and node negative breast cancer. Figure 29 shows an expected increase in taxane-based regimens since 2008. The recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy is based predominantly on the prognostic factors of the tumour, but also the age of the patient and other existing comorbidities. With respect to the tumour, recurrence rates increase with increasing tumour size, tumour grade and especially the number of lymph nodes involved. Breast cancer subtype is also important and affects likelihood of future relapse. Increasingly, breast cancer subtype is considered in adjuvant systemic treatment recommendations. Molecular profiling (gene expression assays) can help clarify breast cancer subtype and predict chemotherapy benefit. These are not routinely used in Australia (see future directions below).58 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 29 Number of women with invasive breast cancer receiving chemotherapy by year Other Anthracycline+Taxane Taxane -based Anthracycline-base d CMFNumber diagnosis020406080100120 0022000-20011999-20001998 -19991997-1998 Note The category 'anthracycline-based' includes some CMF-containing regimes that are preceded by an anthracycline. This figure included other forms of chemotherapy. Results Our data confirm appropriate levels of chemotherapy use in categories of patients expected to gain significant benefits from chemotherapy. This includes 80% of all women with hormone receptor negative breast cancer, almost 90% of women with more than 4 lymph nodes involved, about 80% of all grade 3 cancers and more than 80% of HER2 positive breast cancers. In addition, most (88.4%) young women aged less than 40 years with invasive breast cancer received chemotherapy (see Table 11 ).59 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017TABLE 11 Characteristics of women receiving chemotherapy Chemotherapy N (%)No chemotherapy N (%) N= 5,323 Age group (years) <40 (88.4) (79.2) 799 (60.0) 70-79 148 (22.6) 508 (77.4) 80 6 (2.5) 234 (97.5) Tumour grade 1 210 (19.3) 880 (80.7) 2 1,087 (54.1) 3 1,464 (79.8) 49 (10.5) Hormone receptors ER or PR positive 1,928 (46.8) 2,190 (53.2) ER and PR negative 679 (80.3) 167 (19.7) Lymphovascular invasion Present 943 (82.0) 207 (18.0) Not present 1,596 (43.2) 2,098 (56.8) Unknown 69 (46.9) 78 (53.1) HER2 Positive 473 (81.7) 106 (18.3) Negative 1,667 (49.9) 1,676 (50.1) Unknown 468 (43.8) 601 (56.2)60 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupChemotherapy provides greater absolute benefits for women with larger tumours, higher grade cancers, and especially in those with lymph node involvement. Other factors associated with the absolute magnitude of chemotherapy benefit are hormone receptor negative status, HER2 positive breast cancer and lymphovascular space invasion. Older women Adjuvant chemotherapy was used less frequently in older women than in younger women. The magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy in older women is generally less, particularly in hormone-sensitive breast cancers and women with significant comorbidity. However, older women who are fit with good life expectancy may also benefit from chemotherapy, particularly if they have higher grade, more aggressive breast cancers. A comprehensive geriatric assessment which takes account of medical comorbidity and a patient's functional status can help determine those older patients who are likely to manage chemotherapy. Figure 30 demonstrates an increased percentage of women aged 70 or older receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in 2012-2017 than in previous periods. About 20% of women aged over 70 years received adjuvant chemotherapy in the most recent time period, compared to 10% ten years earlier. FIGURE 30 Percentage of women aged 70 years and older with invasive breast cancer receiving chemotherapy by diagnosis period 020406080100Percen tage of patien ts 2002-2007 1997-2002 Diagnosis period N=154 Figure 31 documents the age breakdown of women receiving chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer across the different treatment periods. Triple negative breast cancers are negative for oestrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as negative for HER2 overexpression. Adjuvant chemotherapy is particularly important for this breast cancer subtype, significantly improving survival. The majority of patients with triple negative breast cancers should be recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy unless they have very small and node negative breast cancer, are not fit for chemotherapy, or have other life-limiting medical comorbidity. It is reassuring that in the most recent treatment period of 2012-2017 there is a more even spread of chemotherapy use across all age groups for triple negative breast cancer. In particular Figure 31 demonstrates increased use of chemotherapy in women aged 70 years or older in the most recent diagnostic period. Women of all age groups can potentially benefit from chemotherapy with this aggressive breast cancer subtype\u2014providing they are in good health. Prior to 2005, HER2 testing was not routinely performed on early breast cancer pathology specimens so the data for triple negative breast cancer in the early time periods is likely less accurate due to small numbers of women represented. This applies particularly to the period of 1997-2002 when most breast cancers would be HER2 'unknown'. 61 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 31 Age distribution of women receiving chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer by diagnosis periodPercen tage of the different chemotherapy regimens used to treat triple negative breast cancers and shows a very appropriate increase in the use of the highly active anthracycline and taxane combination chemotherapy regimens over time. FIGURE 32 Number of women with triple negative breast cancer receiving chemotherapy by diagnosis periodNumber of pa tien ts Diagnosis period Quality indicators The quality indicator for adjuvant chemotherapy is that ideally all women who are less than 50 years old and have node positive breast cancer receive or are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Table 12 shows that over time, the percentage of women in this group has been close to 100%. The slight decrease in the numbers of node positive women aged less than 50 years receiving chemotherapy over the most recent period 2012-2017 may represent consideration of breast cancer subtype or prognostic features other than nodal status in treatment recommendations. Low grade, low proliferation breast cancers which are very hormone-sensitive only gain minimal benefits from chemotherapy, even if lymph node positive. A significant percentage of the women in this group may be perimenopausal. However, caution still needs to be used when omitting chemotherapy in premenopausal women with lymph node positive breast cancer as there are insufficient data from clinical trials to support this approach. 62 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 12 Number of node positive women aged less than 50 years receiving chemotherapy by diagnosis period Diagnosis period Chemotherapy recommended N (%)Chemotherapy not recommended N (%) 1997-2002 141 (99.3) 1 (0.7) 2002-2007 171 (96.6) 6 (3.4) 2007-2012 166 (98.8) 2 (1.2) 2012-2017 129 (90.2) 14 (9.8) N=630 Young women The most common age group of women enrolled in the Quality Assurance Project is 50-69 years. In Australia, breast cancer is less common among women over the age of 70 and those under the age of 40.52 Young age is an adverse prognostic factor, especially for those women under the age of 35 years at presentation. This is likely because higher grade cancers are more common in younger aged women. Young women are more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with 88.4% of women aged under 40 years receiving this treatment (see Table 11 ). Future directions Gene expression profiling of breast cancers has been shown to predict for recurrence risk as well as chemotherapy benefit.53 These tests are not currently subsidised in Australia but may be undertaken privately. The Quality Assurance Project does not currently collect data on gene expression profiling. More recently, clinicians have used Ki67, a proliferation marker, which has been routinely estimated in many service pathology laboratories since 2009. A high Ki67 index indicates that chemotherapy may be useful in reducing the risk of recurrence, whereas a low Ki67 index suggests that chemotherapy may be less effective.54 The data for chemotherapy according to Ki67 index were insufficient for analysis in this report. Endocrine therapy About three-quarters of all breast cancers are hormone receptor positive. The 2 hormone receptors that are measured routinely are the oestrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR). A hormone receptor positive breast cancer is one which is ER positive and/or PR positive. Previously, the hormone receptors were measured by biochemical assays. These biochemical assays have now been assays. On immunohistochemical assays, hormone receptor positivity is defined as 1% or greater staining for either ER and/or PR. The first form of medical endocrine therapy for breast cancer was tamoxifen, which was introduced in the mid-1970s. Tamoxifen is predominantly anti-oestrogen although it has some weak oestrogenic action in some tissues. It is effective in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. A number of trials have shown that tamoxifen is effective in reducing the risk of recurrence in women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer.55 Aromatase inhibitors were introduced around the year 2000. These drugs are only effective in postmenopausal women who derive their oestrogen from the peripheral conversion of androgens (male hormones secreted by the adrenal glands). These androgens are converted into oestrogens by the aromatase enzyme located in skin, muscle and fat. The administration of aromatase inhibitors is associated with a decrease in circulating oestrogens in postmenopausal women. Initially, aromatase inhibitors were used in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, but subsequently they became available for women with early breast disease as adjuvant endocrine therapy. They can also be used in young women who have had oophorectomy or who are being treated with GnRH analogues, which result in suppression of ovarian function, mimicking a postmenopausal state.63 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Adjuvant endocrine therapy is given to the majority of women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer. In general, the toxicity of adjuvant endocrine therapy is mild compared with the toxicities of chemotherapy. Selection of an aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen is based on the patient's menopausal status and medical comorbidities. However, aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen and therefore are now used more frequently than tamoxifen.56 Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are not administered concurrently. The standard duration of adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors is 5 years, like that of tamoxifen. For higher risk, especially node positive breast cancer, there are small benefits for a more extended course of adjuvant endocrine therapy, particularly for those women who commenced treatment with tamoxifen.57 Results Figure 33 confirms the increased use of aromatase inhibitor medication and declining use of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy over time. The use of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors significantly increased in 2005 following results of clinical trials of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors and change in Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) restrictions. We have not been able to collect accurate data on the percentage of women who switch endocrine agents during their course of adjuvant treatment, nor on the use of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. Hence, the endocrine therapy documented is that recommended/planned at the initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

Roughly 90% of all age groups of women with ER positive breast cancer have received endocrine therapy, including 92% of women aged less than 40 years, and 87% of the women aged over 80 years. It is reassuring that almost all the women with higher risk ER positive breast cancer were recommended endocrine therapy: more than 95% of those women with lymph node involvement, and 95% of ER positive breast cancers larger than 2 cm.64 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 13 Characteristics of ER positive women receiving endocrine therapy Endocrine therapy N (%)No endocrine therapy N (%) N=4,354 Age group (years) <40 210 (91.7) 19 (8.3) 40-49 68 (10.9) 190 (86.8) 29 (13.2) Tumour grade 1 927 (84.0) 176 (16.0) 2 1,875 (91.7) 169 (8.3) 3 1,105 (94.0) 70 (6.0) (12.7) 1-4 1,163 (95.9) 50 (4.1) >4 (96.6) 12 (3.4) Hormone receptors ER positive 3,929 (90.2) 425 (9.8) Lymphovascular invasion Present 878 (96.1) 36 (3.9) Not present 2,955 (88.8) 371 (11.2) Unknown 96 (84.2) 18 (15.8) HER2 Positive 345 (92.5) 28 (7.5) Negative 2,824 (90.5) 298 (9.5) Unknown/NA 760 (88.5) 99 (11.5) Diagnosis period 1997-2002 777 (89.6) 90 (10.4) 2002-2007 977 (88.4) 128 (11.6) 1,003 (89.9) 113 1,172 (92.6) 94 Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017In postmenopausal women in particular, there was a strong trend to use an aromatase inhibitor in preference to tamoxifen for endocrine therapy in the most recent decade (see Figure 34 ).

Over the 20-year period, 89.9% of women with receptor positive breast cancer were recommended to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. Table 14 shows that the percentage of younger women recommended to receive endocrine therapy has increased over time. In the most recent diagnostic period, 95.4% of women aged 50 years or younger with hormone sensitive breast cancer were recommended to receive endocrine therapy.

There have also been clinical trials of longer use of aromatase inhibitor medication (continuing beyond 5 years), which suggest additional small benefits. In addition, there are many women who will change their endocrine treatment during the adjuvant period due to intolerance or other clinical factors, such as a change in menopausal status. The project did not record data about changes in endocrine therapy over the 5 years of treatment. Extended adjuvant therapy (for instance, more than 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy) may be recommended to those women with a particularly high risk of recurrent disease; for example, those with extensive lymph node involvement. Ovarian function can be suppressed in a number of different ways, such as with surgery, medically by the use of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, and rarely with ovarian radiation. Premenopausal women who have adjuvant chemotherapy may go into menopause following the chemotherapy, but for those who continue to menstruate, there is evidence to suggest that OFS with an LHRH agonist plus an aromatase inhibitor is the most effective of adjuvant endocrine therapy.60 An LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen is also more tamoxifen alone.61 OFS with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor should be considered as endocrine therapy for young women with higher risk oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer (for example, larger tumours or lymph node positive breast cancer). Tailoring of endocrine therapy is an area of active research. Hopefully, this research will more clearly define the subset of premenopausal women most likely to benefit from more intensive endocrine therapy using OFS, as well as premenopausal and postmenopausal women who require extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. Studies investigating the benefits of adding cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors to adjuvant endocrine therapy in high-risk hormone receptor positive breast cancer are ongoing, with conflicting results to date. The addition of these targeted agents to aromatase inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer significantly improves disease-free and overall survival. However, their role in the adjuvant treatment of early -stage breast cancer currently remains unclear.68 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTrastuzumab HER2 overexpression occurs in 10%-20% of breast cancers.62 to gene amplification. HER2 gene amplification (or HER2 positivity) has been shown to be both a prognostic factor for increased recurrence risk, and a predictive factor for responsiveness to treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae). Trastuzumab is a manufactured monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 protein and has been widely used for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer since 2006. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials has shown a relative risk reduction of 40% for breast cancer death (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.60) and 34% for death (HR 0.66) with the use of adjuvant trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancers.63 In Australia, trastuzumab was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in April 2006 for adjuvant therapy of HER2 node positive disease or node negative breast cancer greater than 20 mm in diameter. In October 2006, trastuzumab was approved for subsidised use by the Australian PBS for adjuvant therapy of localised breast cancer. HER2 positive tumours Routine HER2 testing began in 2005 when trastuzumab became potentially available for adjuvant therapy in Australia. Prior to this, testing was only performed on an ad hoc basis, usually for women with metastatic disease. Over the most recent decade of the Quality Assurance Project (2007-2017), the majority of women with HER2 positive breast cancer did receive chemotherapy (and trastuzumab). Trastuzumab needs to be administered with chemotherapy to meet the PBS guidelines for treatment, and also as it is most effective when administered concurrently with chemotherapy. Figure 38 and Figure 39 demonstrate the use of chemotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer between 2007 and 2017. Ninety-five per cent of the women aged 40 years or younger received chemotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancer, as did a significant majority (73%) of the older women aged 70-79 years. About 42% of women aged 80 years or older were offered chemotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancer\u201421% did receive treatment and 21% declined this therapy. FIGURE 38 Percentage of HER2 positive women receiving chemotherapy by year (2007-2017)Percen tage of patien ts of Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 39 Percentage of HER2 positive women receiving chemotherapy group red Received N=394 Future directions The optimal chemotherapy regimen to be used with trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer remains to be defined. For high-risk HER2 positive breast cancer, anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy schedules are still generally used. Ongoing and future clinical trials will help better define the subset of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer who can achieve very good survival without intensive chemotherapy and may benefit from a simplified and less toxic adjuvant treatment schedule. There is also emerging evidence to support the use of dual HER2 blockade/additional HER2-targeted agents in the adjuvant treatment of higher risk HER2 positive disease (for example, node positive) which was not managed with an initial preoperative approach.64 Although randomised clinical trials provide the best evidence of effectiveness of a novel therapy, trial populations are inevitably selected. More complete understanding of the effectiveness and safety of novel therapies requires the systematic study of outcomes in a general community treatment setting. Systemic therapy for early breast cancer is continuing to evolve with a move towards personalised cancer therapy based on increasing knowledge of molecular factors which predict benefit from specific agents. As predictive molecular markers enter clinical practice, they will be incorporated into the data collection. In the case of HER2 positive breast cancer and the use of dual HER2-targeted therapy, further data regarding outcomes will be available over the next 5 years.70 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group6 Outcomes of care and adherence to guidelines Paul Craft and Kerri Beckmann Introduction Treatment for early operable breast cancer is based on surgery and radiation therapy to control the primary tumour and regional lymph nodes, often combined with systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy) aimed at preventing secondary cancers. Over the 20-year span of the Quality Assurance Project, there have been many improvements in treatment for all breast cancers across all modalities. Despite these improvements and enhancements, the broad practice quality indicators framed by the BCTG in 1997 remain relevant\u2014with some minor modifications\u2014to current cancer care. As determined by consensus of interested clinicians in the region, the indicators represent an appropriate minimum standard across the duration of the project and form the basis of the assessment of quality of care presented in this report. The practice quality indicators 1. Women with completely resected invasive breast cancer greater than 2 cm or axillary lymph node involvement should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy. 2. Women aged 50 years or less, with completely resected axillary lymph node positive breast cancer, should be offered adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. 3. Women undergoing less than total mastectomy for operable invasive breast cancer should be offered postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. 4. Women with operable invasive breast cancer should be offered some form of axillary surgery sufficient to develop a pathologically defined axillary lymph node-based prognosis. 5. Women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy with more than 4 axillary lymph nodes involved should be offered post-mastectomy adjuvant radiation therapy.71 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Methods Data collection Enrolment of subjects into the BCTG Quality Assurance Project and collection of follow-up outcome data has been described in Chapters 2 and 3. Treatment outcome was assessed by determining vital status and occurrence of cancer relapse using a very brief survey of the treating clinicians every 2 years, in addition to consulting the AIHW National Death Index (in 2019). Analysis Concordance of recorded treatment with practice indicators was examined. Factors associated with concordance were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Unless indicated, these analyses were limited to women with unilateral invasive breast cancer undergoing potentially curative surgical resection. The association of clinical characteristics and treatment variables (including adherence with practice indicators) on the risk of death from any cause was examined using Cox proportional hazards modelling, adjusting for demographic factors, tumour characteristics and treatment. Survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis, or the date of first surgery if the date of diagnosis was uncertain. The censoring date for all cases was 27 November 2020, or the date of last follow-up if current vital status was unknown. A similar analysis was undertaken to examine breast cancer specific survival. Breast cancer specific survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis or first surgery until the date of breast cancer related death. Censoring was undertaken for death from other causes. Cox regression modelling was also performed to examine disease-free survival. A hazard ratio lower than 1.0 denotes a smaller risk of an event compared with the reference subgroup. A hazard ratio greater than 1.0 denotes a higher risk. Disease-free survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis (or first surgery if the date of diagnosis was uncertain) to the date of first recorded recurrence or breast cancer death. Again, deaths from other causes were censored.72 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupResults The observed concordance of treatment practice with practice quality indicators is summarised in Table 15 .

A p-value of 0.05 or less is generally regarded as 'significant'. Indicator 1 Women with completely resected invasive breast cancer greater than 2 cm or axillary lymph node involvement should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy. This indicator was met in 97.1% of cases. Essentially all women with a significant cancer received some form of systemic adjuvant therapy. The only significant variation from this treatment was observed for women aged 70 years and older where almost 8% of women did not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy. Indicator 2 Women aged 50 years or less, with completely resected axillary lymph node positive breast cancer, should be offered adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. This indicator was met in 99% of cases with only 7 young women with node positive breast cancer not offered adjuvant chemotherapy.73 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Indicator 3 Women undergoing less than total mastectomy for operable invasive breast cancer should be offered postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. This indicator was met in 96% of cases. Again, the only group identified with reduced adherence to this indicator were those women aged 70 years or older, where 13.8% did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. Indicator 4 Women with operable invasive breast cancer should be offered some form of axillary surgery sufficient to develop a pathologically defined axillary lymph node-based prognosis. This indicator includes sentinel lymph node biopsy as well as axillary dissection. Initial sentinel lymph node biopsy has become the dominant technique in the last 5-year period (see Chapter 5 ). This indicator was met in 96% of cases. As with other indicators, there was significant non-adherence in women aged 70 years and older. Also, there was a statistically significant and clinically important difference between the 5-year period to 2002 and the most recent 15 years. Indicator 5 Women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy with more than 4 axillary lymph nodes involved should be offered post-mastectomy adjuvant radiation therapy. This indicator relates to a relatively small number of women with high-risk breast cancer. Adherence overall was 91% and increased over time as the benefit of this treatment for these patients became clearer. Adherence was less for women aged 60 years or older, and for rural residents compared with ACT residents. Overall adherence to guidelines A composite adherence estimate was derived combining all 5 indicators. Adherence was met if all 5 indicators (when relevant to that case) were met. Overall adherence was 92.5%. Higher compliance was observed in more recent 5-year cohorts, in younger women, and those residing in the ACT. Overall survival An analysis of overall survival for women with unilateral operable early breast cancer was undertaken. For this cohort, the 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 91.6% and 81.4%, respectively. Based on the Cox multivariate analysis, factors associated with reduced hazard ratio and improved overall survival included age, whether the cancer was breast-screen-detected, place of residence, and more recent year of diagnosis (see Table 16 ). In addition, the classical tumour-related prognostic factors were, as expected, associated with different overall survival. These factors included tumour size, tumour grade, nodal status (positive versus negative), and the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Expression of ER/PR and HER2 amplification were not associated with overall survival. Those women who received adjuvant treatment of any kind\u2014radiation therapy, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy\u2014had improved overall survival compared with women who did not. In addition, adherence to the composite quality indicator appeared to improve survival (hazard ratio adherence versus non-adherence 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74). This effect of treatment is controlled for breast cancer prognostic factors in the model, but not for comorbidities that may have contributed to decision-making around therapy. Comorbid conditions may have also influenced overall survival, confounding this result.74 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 16 Factors associated with overall survival following treatment for early breast cancer All-cause mortality Cox regression time to death from any cause HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value 4.61 0.000 Detection Breast screen 1.00 reference Not breast screen 1.33 1.14 1.56 0.000 Region ACT 1.00 reference SE NSW/other 1.28 1.14 1.45 0.000 Family history Average risk 1.00 reference Moderately increased risk 1.04 0.85 1.26 0.723 Potentially high risk 1 1.00 reference 2 1.12 0.94 1.33 0.190 3 1.50 1.23 0.000 Unknown 2.03 1.03 0.78 0.847 Absent 1.00 reference Present 1.48 1.28 1.72 0.00075 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017All-cause mortality Cox regression time to death from any cause HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value Unknown 1.19 ER/PR receptor status Negative 1.00 reference Positive 1.16 0.93 1.44 0.195 HER2 status Negative reference 1.21 0.948 Unknown 1.02 0.79 1.31 0.869 Type of Breast conserving 1.00 reference Mastectomy 0.92 0.73 1.16 0.460 Adjuvant 0.69 0.47 0.74 0.000 Note The term 'reference' denotes the subgroup of each factor nominated as the standard case in the Cox regression model. 76 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupBreast cancer specific survival In those women who died, causality was determined from feedback received from treating clinicians and from death certificate documentation. The 5-year breast cancer specific survival rate was 93.5% (95% CI 92.8-94.2) and the 10-year breast cancer specific survival rate was 87.9% (95% CI 86.8-88.8). The results from the Cox multivariate model are presented in Table 17 . Factors associated with a higher hazard ratio and reduced breast cancer specific survival were increasing age, detection not through breast screening services, and rural residence, as well as the classical tumour- related prognostic factors of tumour size, tumour grade, nodal involvement, and lymphovascular invasion. Breast cancer specific survival improved in later 5-year cohorts. Treatment was associated with improved survival and reduced hazard ratio. The administration of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and radiation therapy were all associated with improved breast cancer specific survival. Also, compliance with the 5 quality indicators was associated with improved breast cancer survival. Caution in interpreting these results is recommended as the Cox regression model does not include comorbid medical conditions, which can impact on both treatment decisions and breast cancer specific survival.77 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017TABLE 17 Factors associated with breast cancer specific survival Breast cancer mortality Cox regression time to breast cancer death HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value Age group 2.97 0.000 Detection Breast screen 1.00 reference Not breast screen 1.38 1.10 1.73 0.005 Region ACT 1.00 reference SE NSW/other 1.28 1.09 1.51 0.002 Family history Average risk 1.00 reference Moderately increased risk 0.92 0.70 1.20 0.525 Potentially high risk 0.95 0.70 1.29 1.31 0.017 3 2.25 1.68 3.01 0.000 Unknown / N/A 1.09 0.43 2.74 0.861 Nodal involvement Negative 1.00 reference Positive 2.45 2.00 2.99 Unknown 0.98 0.63 1.52 0.925 Lymphovascular invasion Absent 1.00 reference Present 1.56 1.30 1.88 0.00078 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupBreast cancer mortality Cox regression time to breast cancer death HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value Unknown 1.41 0.95 2.09 reference 1.01 0.83 1.23 0.946 ER/PR receptor status Negative 1.00 reference Positive 1.12 0.84 1.50 0.433 HER2 status Negative 1.00 reference Positive 0.94 0.74 1.19 0.615 Unknown 1.01 0.71 1.42 0.977 Type of surgery Breast conserving 1.00 reference Mastectomy 0.80 0.58 1.10 0.167 Adjuvant chemotherapy Not 1.00 reference 0.85 0.67 1.07 0.163 Adjuvant radiotherapy 1.00 reference 0.54 0.39 0.75 0.000 Endocrine therapy Not received 1.00 reference Received 0.70 0.54 0.009 Diagnosis 0.79 0.000 Note The term 'reference' denotes the subgroup of each factor nominated as the standard case in the Cox regression model. 79 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Breast cancer recurrence The assessment of the risk of breast cancer recurrence over time is an important metric of treatment outcomes. Recurrence means reappearance of breast cancer within the same breast, or the development of secondary cancers related to the initial primary breast cancer. A new breast cancer occurring in the opposite breast was not considered a recurrence for this analysis. Breast cancer recurrence was determined from information contributed by treating clinicians. In addition, persons who died due to breast cancer were included, whereas persons who died from unrelated causes were censored. There is some risk of incomplete ascertainment of breast cancer recurrence because of the reliance on contributed data. The results of the Cox regression analysis are presented in Table 18 . As with breast cancer specific survival, breast cancer recurrence-free survival showed a similar pattern of related factors. Factors associated with a higher hazard ratio, and increased breast cancer recurrence risk, were increasing age, detection not through breast screening services, and rural residence, as well as the classical tumour-related prognostic factors of tumour size, tumour grade, nodal involvement, and lymphovascular invasion. Breast cancer recurrence risk decreased markedly in later 5-year cohorts.80 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 18 Factors associated with freedom from breast cancer recurrence Disease-free survival Cox regression time to recurrence or death due to breast cancer HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value Age group (years) 1.85 0.001 80 1.88 1.38 2.57 0.000 Detection Breast screen 1.00 reference Not breast screen 1.43 1.18 1.73 0.000 Region ACT 1.00 reference SE NSW/other 1.23 1.07 1.42 0.003 Family history Average risk 1.00 reference Moderately increased risk 0.86 0.68 1.09 0.206 Potentially high risk 1.72 0.53 5.54 0.364 Tumour grade 1 1.00 reference 2 1.24 0.99 0.056 3 1.87 1.47 2.37 0.000 Unknown / N/A 1.16 0.56 2.41 0.695 involvement Negative 1.00 reference 2.02 1.71 2.40 Unknown 0.87 0.58 1.30 0.49081 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Disease-free survival Cox regression time to recurrence or death due to breast cancer HR Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI p-value Lymphovascular invasion Absent 1.00 1.28 ER/PR receptor status Negative 1.00 reference Positive 1.02 0.79 1.31 0.893 HER2 status Negative reference 1.24 0.940 Unknown 0.83 0.61 1.12 0.226 Type of Breast conserving 1.00 reference Mastectomy 0.73 0.55 0.97 0.028 Adjuvant chemotherapy Not 1.00 reference 0.84 0.69 1.03 0.090 Adjuvant radiotherapy 1.00 reference 0.60 0.45 0.80 0.000 Endocrine therapy Not received 1.00 reference Received 0.49 0.84 0.002 Note The term 'reference' denotes the subgroup of each factor nominated as the standard case in the Cox regression model. 82 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupSummary The determination of outcome of care over a 20-year period, relying on contributed information, is a difficult exercise. The results show the strong effect of well-known tumour and patient related risk factors for breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Pleasingly, we were able to observe steadily improving outcomes over time, even after controlling for known prognostic factors, confirming a clinically very important improvement in outcomes of care. Treatment accuracy and guideline adherence appears to be important, with deviation from standard care associated with poorer outcomes. Older women The outcomes are, across the board, worse for women aged 70 years or older. This disadvantage plays out even when the known prognostic factors are taken into consideration. Older people tend to have more comorbid conditions which reduce their ability to tolerate more intensive therapies, most notably, chemotherapy. The care of older women with operable breast cancer represents an unmet challenge in cancer care.83 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 20177 Special groups 7.1 Breast cancer in men Sean Robison Breast cancer in males is uncommon and accounts for approximately 1% of breast cancer cases.65 In the 20-year study period, 38 men were enrolled with an average age of 63 years and an age range of 23-85 years. In the ACT, the age-standardised incidence of male breast cancers is 0.3-0.6 per 100,000 males.66 Men typically present with more advanced disease, which is the experience within this cohort. Tumours were on average larger in men than women (48% in the 21-50 mm range in men versus 37% for women) with more nodal involvement (52% in men versus 38% in women). Tumours were of a higher grade, with 57% grade 3 in men versus 37% grade 3 in women (see Table 19 ). The majority of cancers in men were ductal carcinoma (68%) with 5 non-invasive DCIS and 6 with special histological subtypes (see Figure 40 ). The vast majority were ER or PR positive (97%).

No adjuvant therapy was administered in this group. The majority of men were treated with mastectomy (95%), with invasive cases undergoing either axillary clearance (47%), sentinel lymph node biopsy (21%), or both (21%). In those who had invasive cancer, 81% received chemotherapy and 69% radiotherapy. As expected, adjuvant therapy was prescribed more often for node positive males. Endocrine therapy (tamoxifen) was administered to ER positive males (see Table 20 ). Prognosis for men was similar to women when comparing stage-for-stage with an overall survival at 10 years of 64% for node negative men and 40% for node positive men. Twenty men were still alive at the time of reporting and 17 were deceased, with one status unknown. Men in the cohort who are alive were more likely to have fewer or no lymph nodes involved (see Figure 41 ).

It can be divided into synchronous bilateral breast cancer (sBBC) and metachronous bilateral breast cancer (mBBC). sBBC is reported to have a worse overall prognosis and survival rate compared to unilateral breast cancer, while mBBC has similar overall survival rates to unilateral breast cancer. The definition of sBBC also varies in the literature with the diagnosis of the second cancer occurring up to 12 months following the initial diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer. In this report, sBBC was recorded if the second breast cancer diagnosis occurred within 90 days of the initial cancer. The annual risk of mBBC is 0.5%, with a cumulative incidence at 10 years of 3.4%. This rises to 13-40% in women with a breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation.67 Risk factors for BBC include: young age at initial breast cancer diagnosis higher grade tumour hormone-sensitive tumours increased family history lobular subtype for sBBC. Women of Asian heritage with sBBC also have a lower overall survival. Among women with mBBC, an interval of 5 years or more before the diagnosis of the second tumour is associated with longer overall survival. BBC is reported to have a lower pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a corresponding lower disease-free survival. Some of this reported association may be due to the presence of lobular-type cancers that may be less responsive to neoadjuvant treatment.68 Over the 20-year study period, 274 women were diagnosed with sBBC. This forms 3.9% of all new eligible breast cancer diagnoses in the region notified to the project ( N=7,138). In the same time period, 179 women were diagnosed with mBBC (2.6%). The two groups combined form 6.5% of cases in the project. The project data shows that both groups have a higher number of women with a potentially high-risk family history (see Table 21 ). This is difficult to interpret given the small numbers, however a number of these women would currently qualify for genetic testing.87 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017TABLE 21 Characteristics of women with bilateral synchronous and metachronous breast cancer sBBC mBBC (treatment relates to second presentation)Unilateral invasive breast cancer Totals 274* 179* 5,323 Median age at diagnosis (years) 59.2 63.2 58.8 N (%) N (%) N (%) Age group (years) <40 18 (6.6) 3 (1.7) 318 (6.0) 40-49 48 (17.5) 24 (13.4) 1,016 (19.1) 50-59 77 (28.1) 42 (23.5) (30.3) 64 (35.8) 1,438 (27.0) 70-79 38 (13.9) 33 (18.4) 734 (13.8) 80 10 (3.6) 13 (7.3) 259 (4.9) Family history^ Average risk 189 (69.0) 91 (50.8) 4,264 (80.1) Moderately increased risk 52 (19.0) 30 (16.8) 630 (11.8) Potentially high risk 33 (12.0) 58 (32.4) 410 (7.7) Tumour grade 1 65 (23.7) 29 (16.2) 1,132 (21.3) 2 125 (45.6) 71 (39.7) 2,175 (40.9) 3 73 (26.6) 73 (40.8) 1,958 (36.8) Unknown / N/A 11 (4.0) 6 (3.4) 58 (1.1) Tumour type DCIS/Non-invasive 46 (16.8) 39 (21.8) N/A Ductal carcinoma 163 (59.5) 109 (60.9) 4,357 (81.9) Lobular carcinoma 40 (14.6) 20 (11.2) 540 (10.1) Special invasive types 25 (9.1) 11 (6.1) 426 (8.0) Notes * Excludes no surgery for synchronous, N=2 and metachronous, N=5 and male patient for metachronous, N=1 ^ Unknown family history for women with unilateral breast cancer, N=19 Surgery A notable difference with both groups is that mastectomy is more commonly performed compared with women diagnosed with unilateral invasive breast cancer. For synchronous tumours, 72.3% ( N=126) had mastectomy (see Table 22 ). Although it is difficult to elucidate the reasons for this, women may choose bilateral mastectomy for peace of mind, particularly in the synchronous group. Also, for women with metachronous tumours, many may already have had mastectomy to treat their previous tumour, and so would choose mastectomy again for peace of mind and symmetry.88 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupTABLE 22 Treatment data for women with bilateral synchronous and metachronous breast cancer sBBC mBBC (treatment relates to second presentation)Unilateral invasive breast cancer Totals 274* 179* 5,323 N (%) N (%) N (%) Type of surgery Mastectomy 198 (72.3) 126 (70.4) 2,552 (47.9) Breast conserving surgery (29.6) 2,771 (52.1) Axillary surgery No axillary surgery 34 (12.4) 29 (16.2) 227 (4.3) Sampling only 8 (2.9) 4 (2.2) 105 (2) Axillary clearance only 75 (27.4) 25 (14.0) 1,675 (31.5) Sentinel node surgery only 121 (44.2) 101 (56.4) 2,354 (44.2) Sentinel node and axillary clearance 36 (13.1) 20 (11.2) 962 (18.1) Adjuvant chemotherapy Received 128 (46.7) 54 (30.2) 2,608 (49.0) Not recommended 125 (45.6) 114 (63.7) 2,383 (44.8) Offered and refused 21 (7.7) 11 (6.1) 332 (6.2) Adjuvant endocrine therapy Received 226 (82.5) 100 (55.9) 4,048 (76.0) Not recommended 39 (14.2) 73 (40.8) 1,131 (21.2) Offered and refused 9 (3.3) 6 (3.4) 144 (2.7) Note *Excludes no surgery for synchronous, N=2 and metachronous, N=5 and male patient for metachronous, N=1 Reconstruction Within these small groups, there is a trend towards increasing rates of reconstruction, particularly within the last 5-year cohort. Overall, 35 out of the 198 (17.7%) women with sBBC had some type of breast reconstruction, with 14 of these being performed within the last 5-year period. For the 126 women with mBBC, 17 underwent reconstruction (13.3%) and more than half of these ( N=8) were in the most recent 5-year cohort (see Figure 42 and Figure 43 ).89 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 42 Number of women with synchronous bilateral breast cancer undergoing reconstruction by diagnosis period Recons truc tionNumber FIGURE 43 Number of women with metachronous bilateral breast cancer undergoing reconstruction diagnosis period Recons surgery cases, N=5, and male patient, N=1 Axillary surgery Interestingly, Table 22 demonstrates that the rates of axillary clearance do not appear significantly higher in these groups compared with women with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer. Older women Of all cases of sBBC, 18% were women aged 70 years and over. Similarly, in all cases of mBBC, 26% were women aged 70 years and over. This should be considered when discussing ongoing routine breast screening for women in this age group. If these women are considered fit for active breast cancer treatment in terms of their physiological age and other considerations, then ongoing screening should be an important part of their general medical care.90 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group7.3. Women with distant metastases at presentation Yada Kanjanapan Introduction The majority of metastatic breast cancer patients had initial presentation with localised disease and subsequent relapse with distant metastases. However, with improvements in adjuvant systemic treatment, the relative percentage of women with de novo presentation of metastatic breast cancer is expected to rise. Studies from the late 1990s to early 2000s have reported 5-10% of stage IV breast cancer patients present with de novo metastatic disease,69 whereas the proportion of de novo patients has been 19-25% in more recent series.70 In general, superior survival outcomes have been observed in de novo metastatic breast cancer patients, compared with patients initially presenting with early breast cancer who then relapse with distant metastatic disease.71 This survival difference remains even after controlling for prognostic factors such as age and hormone receptor status; with distinct tumour biology and drug resistance hypothesised as potential explanations behind the better outcomes seen in the de novo metastatic subgroup. Currently, the same treatment approach is applied for women with de novo and recurrent metastatic breast cancer. The principle of management involves recognition that stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer is not curable. Nonetheless, improved outcome has been achieved with advances in systemic therapy in particular subgroups, with long-term survival achieved in some patients. Approximately 15-20% of metastatic breast cancers have HER2-amplification, with dual HER2 targeted therapy pertuzumab and and the conjugate (TDM-1), approved in Australia as first- and second-line therapies, respectively. ER positive metastatic breast cancer patients may also have prolonged duration of disease control from endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors in the frontline setting. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer should take into account the likely benefit in symptom control and survival gain, balanced against treatment-related toxicity and impact on patient quality of life. Multimodality treatment delivered through a multidisciplinary team is often utilised. There is a role for local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) in select circumstances such as palliation of painful bony metastatic disease, prevention of impending pathological fracture, and treatment of ulcerating primary breast tumours. Results Between 1997 and 2017, 140 patients presented with de novo metastatic breast cancer. They represented 33% of all cases of metastatic breast cancer in the BCTG Quality Assurance Project. De novo metastatic breast cancer patients made up 2.1% of all breast cancer patients in the current report, compared with 1.7% in both the 10- and 15-year report. Among women with de novo metastatic breast cancer, 72% were ER positive, compared with 82% in early breast cancer patients (see Figure 4 4). However, a higher proportion of patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer were HER2 positive (18%), compared with 11% of early breast cancer patients (see Figure 45 ). Very few de novo stage IV breast cancers were histologically grade 1 (see Figure 46 ). 91 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 44 Percentage of women with distant metastases at presentation versus early breast cancer by oestrogen receptor status Early brea st cancer Metastases Women with distant metastatic unilateral breast cancer, N=137 Women with unilateral early breast cancer, N=5,323 FIGURE 45 Percentage of women with distant metastases at presentation versus early breast cancer by HER2 status Early brea st cancer Women with distant metastatic unilateral breast cancer, N=137 Women with unilateral early breast cancer, N=5,323 FIGURE 46 Percentage of women with distant metastases at presentation versus early breast cancer by tumour grade Early brea st cancer Metastases ePercen tage of patien ts Unknown 3 2 1 Notes Women with distant metastatic unilateral breast cancer, N=137 Women with unilateral early breast cancer, N=5,32392 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupThe initial treatment received by women with de novo metastatic breast cancer included endocrine therapy in 105 (77%) and chemotherapy in 81 (59%) of the 137 women with available data on treatment (see Figure 47 ). Among women with de novo metastatic disease, chemotherapy was received in 76% of women under age 50, compared with 35% in women aged 70 years or older. Radiotherapy (to any disease site) was given in 66 (48%) of women in this subgroup. Of the 140 de novo metastatic breast cancer patients, 95 (68%) underwent surgery for their primary breast tumours. The majority of patients (71%) had mastectomy, and approximately one-fifth (22%) of all patients who underwent surgery to the primary were aged over 70 years (see Figure 4 8).

FIGURE 49 Overall survival of women with distant metastases at presentationSurvival Months since dia 250.00 N=95 Future directions Participants with distant metastases at presentation remain the minority of cases in the project, with under enrolment likely one factor. Even in our small sample size, a median survival of over 4 years is observed, consistent with other literature demonstrating patients with de novo metastatic disease have a favourable prognosis compared with recurrent metastatic breast cancer patients. In our project, the proportion of patients with metastatic disease at presentation who underwent surgery to the primary was higher than expected (68%), as systemic therapy is the primary treatment modality for these patients. Further exploration of the disease burden (for example, oligometastatic disease) and response to systemic therapy in these patients may provide explanations for this observation. It is expected that the percentage of patients in this subgroup is increasing, and increased awareness to capture their data in the project will assist in improving understanding of treatment and outcome for patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer in our region.94 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group8 Ductal carcinoma in situ Angela Rezo Background Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive form of breast cancer considered to be a precursor of invasive breast cancer. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment in DCIS, with most women having breast conserving surgery. Mastectomy is considered when DCIS involves more than one quadrant of the breast, if the cosmetic outcome with breast conserving surgery is likely to be suboptimal, or if there is a strong patient preference for mastectomy. According to the NCCN 2019 Guidelines, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be strongly considered if a patient with apparent pure DCIS is to be treated with mastectomy or if the tumour is an anatomical location that would compromise the performance of a future sentinel lymph node procedure.72 Larger regions of DCIS are more likely to contain foci of invasive disease. SLNB, therefore, may be recommended at the time of initial surgery for larger foci of DCIS, but there is no consensus for this approach. It is widely accepted that in patients having breast conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy, a margin of 2 mm is sufficient to achieve a high probability of local control. As jointly agreed in a consensus statement in 2019 by the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), \"the routine practice of obtaining negative margin wider than 2 mm is not supported by the evidence\".73 Narrower margins may be acceptable in selected cases depending on the risks of further surgery and features of the close margin. Re-operation rates are higher in DCIS than in patients with invasive cancer, as DCIS is not usually palpable and the edges of the involved breast are difficult to determine.74 In summary, re-operation after a diagnosis of DCIS can occur due to margins being close or positive, or if invasive cancer is found so that re-operation with nodal sampling is required. The patients included in this chapter only include those who had a final diagnosis of DCIS after all surgical management was completed. Adjuvant radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery for DCIS is standard practice as it halves the risk of ipsilateral recurrence of breast cancer. Not surprisingly given that DCIS is a pre-invasive condition, there is no observed difference in overall survival with the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy.75 There are unanswered questions in regard to optimal radiotherapy dose, fractionation and when to add a 'boost', that is, extra radiation to the tumour bed. These questions are being addressed in an ongoing randomised study.76 Radiotherapy following mastectomy is rarely indicated given the very low risk of recurrence even in the setting of close margins.7795 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017While adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the relative risk of local recurrence for all women with DCIS, the absolute benefit is small in some. A commonly used definition for 'low-risk DCIS' is for women with asymptomatic, non-palpable, unicentric disease that is less than 2.5 cm in maximal extent, with at least a 3 mm margin, and which is negative mammographically following surgery. A randomised study of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in this low-risk group showed low local recurrence rates overall, but rates were still marginally better in the radiotherapy group.78 The Australian EviQ guidelines note that there is \"high-level evidence that radiotherapy offers an advantage of local control in all groups, however, the benefit should be considered in the context of small absolute gains for certain sub-groups\".79 Since the publication of the BCTG 15-year report, Cancer Australia has published guidelines for the management of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). LCIS is identified in association with DCIS and/or invasive cancer in a small proportion in the 20-year cohort. In these women, the DCIS and/or invasive cancer determined the management. Women with only LCIS have not fulfilled the eligibility criteria for participation in the BCTG study to date, so no comment can be made about the quality of treatment for this group. Adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces the risk of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer recurrence following local treatment with or without radiotherapy. However, no improvement in survival is noted with adjuvant endocrine therapy.80 Results During the 20-year period of this study, 669 women were treated for unilateral DCIS and 63.8% of these cases were detected via BreastScreen (see Figure 50 ). Interestingly, 16.1% of women had self-detected DCIS, as DCIS is not usually palpable. FIGURE 50 Percentage of women with DCIS by method of detection and yearPercen tage of patien ts Year of diagnosis Patient self women had preoperative mammogram (93.8%) core biopsy (90.3%), with preoperative MRI undertaken in 4.8% of women (see Table 23 ).

There were 12 women (2.9% of those who had breast conserving surgery for DCIS) who refused adjuvant radiotherapy. FIGURE 51 Treatment of women with DCISFIGURE 51 Treatment of women with DCIS Radiotherapy recommended situ (DCIS) N=669 Over time, the number of women having breast conserving surgery has increased, and the number having mastectomy has decreased (see Figure 52 ). Also, the number of women having more than one operation for DCIS has decreased over the consecutive 5-year 17.8% in 2012-2017 (see Figure 53 ).97 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 52 Percentage of women with DCIS receiving treatment by diagnosis period Brea st conser ving surger y an d ma stectomy of women with DCIS by number of surgical procedures and diagnosis periodPercen tage of patien ts Diagnosis period Four op erations Note procedures include open biopsy, breast conserving surgery, re-excision, and mastectomy Treatment received according to age and pathological features is detailed in Table 24 . This table divides the total number of 669 women into 3 treatment groups: breast conserving surgery only (32.3%) breast conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy (30.3%) mastectomy only (37.4%). The most common local treatment for women aged under 50 years was mastectomy\u2014with 73.7% of women aged under 40, and 50.8% of women aged in their 40s, having a mastectomy for DCIS. The age group most likely to receive breast conserving surgery alone without radiotherapy were women aged in their 50s; those aged in their 60s were more likely to receive breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy. Women aged in their 70s had mastectomy and breast conserving surgery only in equal numbers (37% in each group), with 26% receiving breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy. Mastectomy was the most common treatment for women with high grade DCIS (46.9%), and those with tumours 21-50 mm (45.3%) or greater than 50 mm (87.1%). In tumours less than 10 mm, the most common treatment was breast conserving surgery alone.98 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupWithin the breast conserving surgery group of 419 women, 57 women had margins less than 1 mm. Of these women, 37 (64.9%) had adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was less likely to be given when margins exceeded 5 mm.

Of the 66 women who had reconstruction at some point in the year 20-year study, 59 were under 60 years of age. Mastectomy without reconstruction was less common over time, and immediate reconstruction became more common than delayed reconstruction over time (see Figure 54 ).99 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 54 Number of women with DCIS undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction by diagnosis period N=247 of all women with DCIS) who had SLNB. Over time, SLNB for DCIS became more frequent (see Figure 55 ). Given SLNB was not routinely performed in the first decade of the BCTG Quality Assurance Project, detailed information with factors associated with SLNB are shown in Table 25 for the 367 women in the 2007-2017 period. Women aged under 40, and those who had breast cancer detected by their GP, their specialist, or themselves, were more likely to undergo SLNB than not. Approximately two- thirds (66.9%) of women undergoing mastectomy had SLNB, compared to 24.1% of women who had breast conserving surgery. SLNB was more likely to occur in tumours 21-50 mm (52.9%) and greater than 50 mm (62.7%). Women with high grade DCIS were more likely to have SLNB (49.3%), and the presence of multifocal disease increased the frequency of SLNB marginally. The number of women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy alone remains low with only 9 women in the last 5 years of the study receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy.

This is the first of the BCTG 5-year reports to demonstrate breast cancer death following an initial diagnosis of DCIS and is consistent with a larger US population-based series of women with DCIS also showing breast cancer mortality at 15 years.81 In the US study, the actuarial 15-year breast cancer mortality rate was 2.33% for patients treated with breast conserving surgery alone, 1.74% for patients treated with breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy, and 2.26% for patients treated with mastectomy. Given that mastectomy was frequent, and breast conserving surgery without radiotherapy was also common in this 20-year period, it is possible that the under-utilisation of radiotherapy is the reason for breast cancer mortality in this report. Older women There are 50 women aged 70 years or older diagnosed with DCIS in this 20-year period. This small number probably reflects the fact that many of these women are no longer on a screening program. Women over the age of 70 are less likely to receive adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery and less likely to have SLNB. Future directions Improving risk stratification in DCIS will reduce the number of women over- and under-treated for DCIS. DCIS nomograms estimate risk and can guide treatment recommendations.82 The role of gene assays, similar to those used in invasive breast cancer, is being explored in DCIS and may play a larger role in the future.83 Radiotherapy fractionation schedules for invasive breast cancer are getting shorter and this trend is likely to apply to women with DCIS.84 Shorter treatment schedules are more convenient and well tolerated, so may increase the utilisation of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Partial breast irradiation, which is now part of American Guidelines for DCIS in selected sub-groups, may also play an important role in increasing utilisation of adjuvant radiotherapy.85102 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group9 Pathological features Jane Dahlstrom OAM Introduction Histopathology of the breast, with or without examination of other tissues such as sentinel node(s), remains essential for determining the diagnosis, prognosis and further management of patients with breast cancer. The major updates since the 5-year report include the publication of the 5th edition of WHO Classification of Tumours: Breast Tumours .86 In synchrony with the updates by WHO, the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) commenced development of a series of 4 datasets for breast cancer to standardise reporting across the globe. These evidence-based pathology datasets have been developed through broad collaboration between pathology colleges, pathology societies, and major cancer organisations internationally\u2014they will be published during 2021 at www.iccr-cancer.org/datasets/ published-datasets/breast . Standard prognostic indicators, such as tumour size, lymph node status and Nottingham grade continue to be highly relevant. Mitotic count has moved from the traditional denominator of 10 high-power fields to a defined area expressed in mm2. Carcinomas with medullary features, including medullary carcinomas, are now all classified as tumour infiltrating lymphocyte rich invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (TIL-rich IBCNST). Next to classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), the pleomorphic and florid subtypes are now recognised. It is now recommended that the classification of breast tumours displaying neuroendocrine expression be based on the recognisable morphological tumour type, such as invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), mucinous carcinoma, or solid papillary carcinoma, rather than primary neuroendocrine tumour unless the neuroendocrine histological features and neuroendocrine marker expression are distinct or uniform. There has been increased understanding of the molecular classification of breast cancers that have prognostic associations (including the intrinsic subtypes, integrative cluster subgroups, triple negative sub-classifications, and mutation-based profiling). Ancillary pathology investigations such as assessment of hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]), proliferation index (Ki67) and HER2/neu status continue to be routinely performed on breast carcinoma samples. These tests help guide adjuvant treatments and also provide additional prognostic information. There has been some refinement in HER2 testing for breast cancer. Testing of core biopsies, rather than excision specimen for HER2 evaluation (including ISH, when necessary) is now recommended. For cases with 2+ or 3+ IHC, the determination of the final HER2 status requires concurrent evaluation of both gene amplification and protein overexpression to determine classification into the appropriate HER2 subgroup. The guidelines now recommend the preferential use of dual probe rather than single probe ISH assays. Single probe ISH assays are still, however, considered acceptable for routine testing.87 Genomic testing, while available, is yet to become part of the routine pathology report. 103 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Results Compared with the 15-year report, most tumour characteristics and the age profile of women have not significantly altered apart from a small reduction in the cancer size at the time of surgery. Some 59% of cancers are less than 20 mm in size, with 35% of these in the 11-20 mm range (see Figure 56 and Figure 57 ), although they are still more likely to be non-screen-detected (see Chapter 4 for methods of detection). Multifocal breast cancer was present in 964 women (18% of all breast cancers). Multifocal cancers were most commonly grade 2 carcinomas and occurred more frequently in women aged 50-59 years (see Figure 58 ). Invasive carcinoma, NST (ductal) is the most prevalent cancer type, making up 82% of the carcinomas reported. This has remained constant over the last 20 years (see Figure 59 and Figure 60 ). The most common tumour grade for women aged under 50 years remains grade 3, whereas grade 1 and 2 carcinomas were more common in women aged 50 years and older (see Figure 61 ). As expected, larger primary carcinomas and carcinomas of higher grade were associated with an increased likelihood of lymph node metastases at the time of surgery (see Figure 62 and Figure 63 ). Overall, carcinomas were most likely to be ER/PR positive and HER2 negative regardless of the woman's age (see Figure 64 , Figure 65 and Figure 66 ). High grade carcinomas were more likely to lack oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression (see Figure 67 and Figure 68 ). These high grade carcinomas were also more likely to show HER2 overexpression (see Figure 69 ). The percentage of carcinomas that were ER/ PR positive or ER/PR negative, and HER2 positive or negative is within the expected range for the Australian population.88 The proliferation index (Ki67) of cancers has been recorded since July 2013. It shows 96% of grade 3 carcinoma, where Ki67 was performed, had a proliferation index of greater than or equal to 15% as expected. Seventy-five per cent of grade 2 carcinomas also showed a proliferation index of greater than or equal to 15% (see Figure 70 ).

Of these women, 44% had a carcinoma greater than 20 mm (see Figure 71 ). These carcinomas were more likely to be intermediate grade (see Figure 61 ), without lymphovascular invasion (see Figure 72 ), and with less likelihood of lymph node metastases at the time of surgery (see Figure 73 ) than women aged less than 40 years. While invasive carcinoma, NST (ductal) was the most common carcinoma in all age groups, invasive lobular carcinoma was relatively more common in women aged 70 years and older (11.8%) than those aged less than 40 years (4.3%) (see Figure 74 ). 109 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017FIGURE 71 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by age group and tumour sizeNumber of pa tien ts Age grou N=10 FIGURE 72 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by lymphovascular invasion and age groupNumber of pa tien ts Age grou p N=156 FIGURE 73 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by age group and lymph node statusNumber of pa tien ts Age node status cases, N=215110 The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment GroupFIGURE 74 Number of women with invasive breast cancer by age group and tumour typeNumber of pa tien ts Age grou p (years) Special in vasive or ot directions Historically, our understanding of breast cancer development, management and prognosis has focussed on the breast cancer cells. Recently, it has become apparent that an aberrant tumour microenvironment (TME) facilitates cancer development, progression, and responses to treatment.89 One example is the realisation that tumour infiltrating lymphocytes has an essential role in mediating response to chemotherapy and improving clinical outcomes in all subtypes of breast cancer. Further analysis of the TME from this cohort may be valuable. Technology continues to improve interfaces between the pathology report and databases. This has the potential to improve accuracy by reducing human error with data entry and enable more detailed analysis of tumour characteristics, including the use of machine learning and soft computing techniques. Given the significance of personalised medicine, the BCTG Quality Assurance Project database fields will need to adapt to utilise these technologies. This will enhance our ability to examine prognostic and predictive features, which may be independent of a certain treatment or integrated in order to guide therapy for breast cancer patients.111 Quality Assurance Project 20-year Report | July 1997-June 2017Appendices Appendix 1: The Breast Cancer Treatment Group 1.1 Terms of reference To develop and review protocols for the treatment and management of breast cancer for each of the clinical groups To disseminate information about those protocols and assist in education both individuals and groups in the management and treatment of breast cancer To develop linkages with other national groups To promote research into current breast cancer treatment in the Canberra region, both basic and outcome based To develop an agreed minimum data-set 1.2 Chairperson(s) Doris Zonta (Dec 1996 - Dec 1998) Shirley Bowen (May 1999 - June 2000) Jenny Brogan (June 2000 - Dec 2003) Jane Dahlstrom (Jan 2004 - Dec 2005) Bev Gow-Wilson (Deputy Chair, Jan 2004 - Dec 2005) Paul Dugdale (Jan 2006 - Dec 2007) Anne Bicknell (Deputy Chair, Jan 2006 - Dec 2007) Carolyn Cho (Jan 2008 - Dec 2009) Jane Dahlstrom (Deputy Chair, Jan 2008 - Dec 2009) Angela Rezo (Jan 2010 - Dec 2018) Lisa Sullivan (Jan 2019 - Dec 2020) 1.3 Breast Cancer Treatment Group Quality Assurance Project team (past and present) Yanping Zhang, Coral Swan, Sally Naylor, Jennifer Bertram, Andrea McDonald, Jacinta Garry, Margaret Clues, Katherine Smallen, Peta Flynn, Robyn Bradley, Thet Khin, Jenny Green.

Predictive factor A measurement that is associated with a response or lack of response to a particular therapy. Premenopausal The period of time when a woman is still menstruating and is considered to be in the reproductive years, with no symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. Primary (tumour) The initial tumour formed. Progesterone A sex hormone. Progesterone (PR) status Positive if the cancer has expressed the genes for the progesterone receptor.
