Moms of autistic children... first symptoms? My hubs has Aspergers, so does his only brother. I know statistically that does not mean a guarantee that my son will too, but I was curious what symptoms moms noticed first? How young were your babies? How long did you wait to seek a diagnosis?

They look for markers at every appointment. Early intervention is key to help with children with autism. So between you and your pediatrician you should be okay hopefully Ok so my son who is almost 3 is not officially diagnosed but the pediatrician said he does present a lot of features consistent with being autistic. I noticed weird things he would do that other children wouldn't when he was about a year old. -He loved textures and would lick and blow raspberries on the couch, my stomach, my neck, certain pieces of clothing as well as any new textures -He didn't start walking until he was 17 months old -he didn't and still doesn't like transitions of any sort -his relationship with food he constantly -how he interacts with other kids he doesn't bother with other kids even when they try to play with him he prefers adults - he has an obsession with shoes and hats and always wears some form of them otherwise he will have a fit he is very delayed in speech he has about 50 words that he uses individually (he should be forming some simple sentences at his age). He started talking about 4 months ago. You'll see more symptoms start around 1. Seek diagnosis if you believe something is wrong as soon as possible because there are waiting lists lots of tests and assessments and professionals and meetings. Earliest predictors can be noted in the very early months. Eye contact and joint attention should be emerging around 3 months. (I have a graduate certificate in ASD, FYI ) you can go to autismspeaks.org and the cdc.gov to do more research to help you feel comfortable with what you're looking for! My husband has Asperger's too, so we're going to be on the lookout young for any sensory issues, transition issues, etc. My aunt is an Early Interventionist and we'll probably have him \"play\" with her a few times at different developmental stages to see so we can start therapies early if needed. That's great you have an aunt who is able to screen like that! And on the note of having an Aspie husband- how has he been in preparation for baby? My hubs is super excited and working harder than ever to provide, he feels like that is the best thing he can do for me right now. Do you think bonding will be an issue? He's suuuuuuper excited and doing everything around the house, etc. I'm not concerned about him bonding (he's amazing with babies), but I know the big changes all at once may be a bit much and I may have to handle more of the logistics at first. How about you? I agree with others- your ped will do a screening at every app starting around 12 months. BUT they also don't see your child everyday, so I think it's good you are keeping an eye on it too. Even earlier than a year you can notice differences in their social interaction like not making eye contact or wanting to engage in play or joint activities with others. Also watch for repetitive behaviors like lining toys up but not playing with them appropriately. I work with young kids with autism (ages 2-6) and I've noticed now that I have a 19 month old the HUGE difference in social skills. My 3.5 year old son has autism. We noticed around 1 yr old. Our first red flags were that he did not point, wave, or look when we said his name. With my son earliest sign was crying for 6-8 hours as an infant. Just completely inconsolable and would look very lost which lasted regularly til he was 3 and still happens during meltdowns. When I started him on solids he wouldn't eat certain colors or textures and if I tried to make him he would panic and cryfor hours with the same lost look. He would cry every time we went in a store and especially bad in the freezer aisle. Never had any interest in being held. Around 9/10 months he would line things up and sort things by shape and color. He was obsessed with things that spin. No eye contact. Would never answer to his name. Then at around 12-18 month he started loosing words which was when I knew for sure he had it and got him diagnosed. My daughter is only 18 months now and I'll be getting her evaluated soon but I'm sure she has it and drs have already confirmed she has red flags but don't want to diagnose too soon. Her first sign was no smiling. She still doesn't smile often and even then it's very hard to get her to. Her other couple signs are that she won't answer to her name and only says mama and dads but not directed towards us. My son after loosing his speech didn't talk again until he turned 3.5 Oh and both kids have horrible tempers that often result in them hurting themselves. And hand flapping. are you or your husband autistic? Thank you for writing in, hearing everyone's experience means so much! How is your son now? my husband has not been diagnosed but we think he might be somewhere on the spectrum. I think he's afraid to find out for sure which is fine by me as long as he continues to work on the few communication problems he has with me. But he has a brother that has autism as well as a niece and 3 first cousins. My little guy is doing so well he sucks with transitions, has a very limited diet and also has speech apraxia but other than that is doing very well and now loves to talk (although for others it's very hard to understand). But most importantly he's happy and healthy. so sorry for the long post but if your baby is diagnosed someday with Autism.. PLEASE DONT GIVE UP..! My son will be 4 in November and he is officially diagnosed with Autism... whenever we notice something was up was when he was very little. -he started walking at 7 months (no help needed, no holding into things) -he has always loved to line things up and not play with them how he should -he loves puzzles and by the age of 1 he was already solving them -he had about 55 words down by the age of 1 English and Spanish He got sick a month after his first birthday and he didn't play or talked for about a week ..after that we noticed -he didn't smiled anymore -he didn't really responded to his name -he would get away from the other kids -any noice would bother him -he lost all his speech At the age of 2 he was officially diagnosed with Autism and since then we looked for anything that would help him ANYTHING!! After that he started home therapy for a year. He was doing a little better but we knew he needed more. Then at the age of 3 he stared to go into a special school for Autistic kids from 12:45pm-3pm. He was in a classroom with 2 other kids that were his age. Well luckily his teacher noticed how smart he really was and everything there was so easy for him, so he wasn't really learning anything. so he started to go during mornings too, so from 8-11am and 12:45-3pm Monday to Thursday... he was now in the morning with 7 different kids ages 4-5(he was still 3 years old) .... well he got the hang of everything-there he loves going in the mornings Since he started going to his little school he has progressed so much - he now plays with other kids - He loves going on rides - He loves to dance and sing on his own way - He still loves solving puzzles - He still isn't potty trained but we are working on it - He now smiles at us and he loves to give us kisses - He loves to play with his dog - He only has about 10 words down but sometimes he will start talking on his own language and we will just act like we do understand him (he has made a lot of progress by us doing this) - There's so many more things he does but it would be a lot for me to write.... Now we are so happy because this coming August he will start to go again to his Autistic school during the morning and during the afternoon 12-3pm he will go to regular Pre-K.. We are doing anything that we can for him!. Wow thanks so much for writing all this! Having a husband with high functioning austism (what they used to call Aspergers and I still do) has me prepared for many different symptoms, and in talking with his mom she relates a lot to your experience. The thing that was so hard for them was that hubs is INCREDIBLY smart and so they thought he was just being belligerent by not playing with other kids, being \"anti\" social and etc. It simply wasn't as understood in the 1980's as it is now! And also to pass on some encouragement- hubs now has a Masters In Business and holds a manager position at a great company. Don't give up on your little one, even in the teen years! They are amazing people! wow that's so awesome!.. hope everything keeps going smoothly!! .. From birth looking back on it. But he was my first and i had nothing to compare him to. He was VERY routine oriented and still is at 13 years old. As a baby he was happy provided he was in a consistent routine. Any deviation from the routine and he was NOT happy for hours. Aaaaand still the same but ar least i can prepare him in advancd at 13 years old. Honestly just enjoy your baby. It won't make a difference to whether baby has asd or not. Asd makes them unique and ao amazing and see the world so differently. Parents of ASD kids are a very special breed too. Whether or not you become one will happen in due time - in the meantime love your baby to bits and try not to worry too much about something that may not be able to be diagnosed for a few years Thank you Being married to someone with ASD has me and him on a really solid routine already that I plan on keeping regardless. I am no stranger to adult symptoms and the way of life for someone in their thirties with autism- but babies and kids are all new!
