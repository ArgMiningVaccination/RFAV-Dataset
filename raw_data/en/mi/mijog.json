EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram As more young children than ever are given commercial milk formula (CMF) in addition to, or in place of, breastfeeding, experts have called for stricter controls against exploitative CMF marketing alongside stronger maternity protections. In 1974, a controversial report, The Baby Killer, accused Nestl\u00e9 of causing illness and infant deaths through its promotion and sale of powdered baby milk in low and middle-income countries. The report's author, Mike Muller, looked at reasons why mothers were turning away from breastfeeding and condemned CMF companies' aggressive marketing practices: from using 'fake nurses' to make persuasive home visits, to false claims that using formula instead of breast milk will make children healthier, happier, or stronger. The paper led to an international boycott of Nestl\u00e9 in 1977; four decades after its publication, the debate persists. A 2023 series of reports on breastfeeding, published in the scientific journal The Lancet, found that the CMF industry still pushes false assertions about the merits of its product. \"Manufacturers claim their products can alleviate discomfort or improve night-time sleep, and also infer that formula can enhance brain development and improve intelligence\u2014all of which are unsubstantiated,\" the series said. While many cannot breastfeed, or choose not to, the researchers argue that the industry is using underhand marketing strategies, designed to prey on the fears and concerns of early parenthood to turn the feeding of young children into big business - one that was valued over \u20ac50 billion in 2022. \"A criticism of the CMF industry's predatory marketing practices should not be interpreted as a criticism of women\", the authors added. Nigel Rollins, World Health Organisation (WHO) scientist and author of a paper on formula milk marketing published as part of the series said that: \"This new research highlights the vast economic and political power of the big formula milk companies, as well as serious public policy failures that prevent millions of women from breastfeeding their children.\" More babies are given CMF than ever before, despite it not having the same health benefits as breast milk, according to the Lancet. Globally, around 50% of newborns are put to the breast within the first hour of life and fewer than half of infants under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, as per WHO recommendations. \"Actions are needed across different areas of society to better support mothers to breastfeed for as long as they want, alongside efforts to tackle exploitative formula milk marketing once and for all,\" Rollins said. The policies in place In 1981, the World Health Assembly adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes - a set of international standards to prevent inappropriate marketing of formula. Such standards include a ban on the advertising of CMF to the public or promotion within healthcare systems, a prohibition of free samples to mothers, healthcare workers, and health facilities and a bar on sponsorship of health professionals or scientific meetings by the CMF industry. However, despite repeated calls for governments to incorporate the Code's recommendations into legislation, in 2023 only 32 countries have legal measures that substantially align with the Code. A further 41 countries have legislation that moderately aligns with the Code and 50 have no legal measures at all, the Lancet said. While Europe has the largest proportion of countries with at least some legal measures on the Code, the European Directive that applies to all EU members and affiliated states only covers some Code provisions. \"Current EU regulations still allow predatory marketing of breast-milk substitutes that are detrimental to breastfeeding,\" Luxembourgish Green EU lawmaker Tilly Metz warned in a Parliamentary question in October. A 2022 WHO status report on the implementation of the Code confirmed that EU countries are lagging behind on its adoption, Metz added. In December, the EU's health chief Stella Kyriakides responded to Metz by highlighting EU food law, which provides specific rules on labelling, presentation and advertising plus the Commission's secondary law restricting the advertising of infant formula to publications specialising in baby care and scientific publications. \"Furthermore, the regulation allows member states to further restrict or prohibit advertising of infant formula. Member States are primarily responsible for the correct application of EU law and must ensure that the relevant requirements of EU food law are respected,\" Kyriakides said. However, loopholes persist, with some EU countries permitting CMF advertising in \"publications specializing in childcare\", according to the Lancet. Digital marketing has also complicated the regulation of baby formula promotion, a WHO report found, through opening up cost-effective marketing techniques that cross national boundaries, thereby creating challenges for the monitoring and enforcement of legislation. The future of breastfeeding Following the Lancet's publication, researchers called for a renewed focus on support for breastfeeding, from increased investment to localised action. Breastfeeding reduces childhood infectious diseases, mortality, malnutrition, and the risk of later obesity. For mothers who breastfeed, the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease decrease. Despite the benefits, the series finds that services supporting breastfeeding are under-resourced, with the industry lobbying against strengthening breastfeeding protection laws and challenging food standard regulations. The study found that some CMF lobby groups have cautioned against improved parental leave. Duration of paid maternity leave is correlated with breastfeeding prevalence and time, and absence of, or inadequate, paid leave forces many mothers to return to work soon after childbirth. Another obstacle to breastfeeding is a lack of safe spaces for breastfeeding or expressing milk in workplaces or facilities to store breast milk. \"Given the immense benefits of breastfeeding to their families and national development, women who wish to breastfeed need to be much better supported so that they can meet their breastfeeding goals,\" said Rafael P\u00e9rez-Escamilla from the Yale School of Public Health in Lancet's press release. \"A large expansion in health professional training on breastfeeding, as well as statutory paid maternity leave and other protections, are vital,\" she concluded.

This week, EURACTIV's health team dig into the European Parliament's role in the ongoing saga on the transparency of the COVID-19 vaccine contracts between the European Commission and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer with MEP Tilly Metz. Increasing physical activity. Increasing physical activity among Europeans could save EU countries \u20ac8 billion annually, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)' estimated in their report published on Friday (17 February). Pfizer in the house. Representatives of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will be allowed continued access to the European Parliament, the leaders of the Parliament's political groups decided on Thursday (16 February), after the company faced the risk of expulsion amid the ongoing controversy over the purchase of COVID vaccines. Probiotics development. Latest developments on the 'probiotics' health claim saga suggest that the time is ripe for overcoming the current regulatory framework which, for more than 15 years, has hindered the EU probiotics sector from flourishing as well as restricting consumer information. Cardiovascular health. The MEP Heart Group - a forum for MEPs committed to the concept of 'cardiovascular health in all policies - released the work programme for their activities in 2023, which shows a focus on the European Health Data Space (EHDS) and the forthcoming European elections in 2024. MEPs visits. A delegation of lawmakers from the European Parliament's special committee on COVID-19 will be in South Africa and Ethiopia this week. The planned visits include the WHO hub in which COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured, South Africa's Parliament, and the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa. Tobacco control in EU. The public consultation period for the legislative framework for tobacco control started on Tuesday (21 February). The Commission's evaluation is to cover product regulation, advertising, promotion and sponsorship, in the broader context of related tobacco control policies in response to the rapid rise in emerging products and recent technical developments. COVID immunity. For someone previously infected with COVID-19, their risk of hospitalization or death is 88% lower for at least 10 months compared to those who had not been previously infected, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the scientific journal The Lancet on Thursday (16 February). The analysis also suggests that the level and duration of protection against reinfection, symptomatic disease and severe illness is at least on a par with that provided by two doses of the mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNtech) for ancestral, Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. \"Vaccination is the safest way to acquire immunity, whereas acquiring natural immunity must be weighed against the risks of severe illness and death associated with the initial infection,\" said lead author Stephen Lim from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine, USA. Mpox. People living with HIV have accounted for 38-50% of those affected in the 2022 multicountry mpox outbreak, a scientific article published on Tuesday (21 February) in the Lancet said. A year of the war. On Friday (17 February) WHO Europe director Hans Kluge, marking a year of the ongoing war in Ukraine listed health priorities which are mental health, rehabilitation and community access to health services. He said that an estimated almost 10 million people may currently have a mental health condition, of whom about 4 million may have conditions which are moderate or severe. When it comes to access to healthcare the latest WHO needs assessment survey finds that 1-in-10 say they struggle to access medicines for various reasons - including damaged or destroyed pharmacies and the unavailability of supplies. Moreover, almost one-third of people surveyed say they can no longer afford the medicines they need. Funding appeal for earthquake response. On Friday (17 February) WHO launched a funding appeal for earthquake response in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria for over \u20ac80 million. Definition of long-COVID in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new clinical case definition for post-COVID-19 condition or 'long COVID' in children and adolescents: \"Post COVID-19 condition in children and adolescents occurs in individuals with a history of confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection, when experiencing symptoms lasting at least 2 months which initially occurred within 3 months of acute COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that symptoms more frequently reported in children and adolescents with post-COVID-19 condition compared with controls are fatigue, altered smell (anosmia) and anxiety. Other symptoms have also been reported. Symptoms generally have an impact on everyday functioning such as changes in eating habits, physical activity, behaviour, academic performance, social functions (interactions with friends, peers, family) and developmental milestones. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. They may also fluctuate or relapse over time. Workup may reveal additional diagnoses, but this does not exclude the diagnosis of post COVID-19 condition.\" Abortion in Malta. Maltese Health Minister Chris Fearne on Friday (17 February) said that a review of the proposed amendment to the criminal code that will allow for abortions to be carried out in specific circumstances will be published after government consultations with stakeholders end in two weeks, Times of Malta reported. PARIS Almost half of French people are overweight.
