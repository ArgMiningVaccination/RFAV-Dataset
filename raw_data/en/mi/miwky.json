VCU Health pharmacist Mandy Gatesman recently spoke at one of Massey Integrative Health's monthly events. I was able to participate and learned so much. I found the information provided to be extremely useful for the consumer, as well as for other healthcare providers. Therefore, I want to help decipher the truth regarding herbal supplements. Below you will find some important facts to keep in mind when you or a loved one may be considering natural products. First of all, what are natural products? By definition, natural products are substances produced from marine organisms, bacteria, fungi and plants. Natural products include vitamins, minerals and probiotics. Some individuals may identify them as dietary supplements, herbals, botanicals and alternative or complementary products. 1. Natural products are NOT safer than prescription medications 2. You CAN use complementary therapies with conventional treatments 3. All natural products CAN NOT be used safely with chemotherapy 4. Reliable resources ARE AVAILABLE for natural product information 5. You SHOULD share all of your questions about natural products with your health care team. When using or considering to use natural products remember safety is key, use reliable resources and be truthful with your care team! Massey does not endorse all integrative and complementary practices. We only recommend those that are known to be safe and have the potential to improve health when used alongside, and never in place of, professional medical care. All cancer patients are advised to consult with their physician before starting any integrative practice, as some may interfere with medical care.
