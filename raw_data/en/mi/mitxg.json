Introduction: The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on poliomyelitis eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan held its meeting in Cairo at WHO/EMRO from 3-4 February 2008. The objectives of the meeting were to review progress towards poliomyelitis eradication in the two countries, particularly duri ng 2007, discuss planned activities for 2008 and make recommendations to address constraint s facing the national programmes on their way to achieve the target. 2. Opening Session: The meeting was opened by Dr Nicholas Ward, Chairma n of the TAG, who welcomed the participants and highlighted the impor tance of the meeting at this very critical stage of the programme. The meeting was then addressed by Dr Mojaddidi, Adv iser to H.E. the President of Afghanistan on Health and Education, who conveye d to the meeting continued commitment of the Government of Afghanistan to the target of polio eradication and the personal involvement of H.E. President Karzai i n ensuring that the programme achieves its objectives. He made an overview of eff orts made by the Government of Afghanistan to bring all stakeholders in the countr y together in support of polio eradication and acknowledged continued support of p artners and close coordination with Pakistan. In his address, Mr Lashari, Federal Secretary Healt h Pakistan, welcomed the participants and acknowledged the support of the TA G in guiding programme direction. He reaffirmed Government's commitment to immunization programmes and specifically to polio eradication. Mr Lashari then spoke about key factors for success and in this regard he emphasized on the importance of ownership, not only by local authorities but also by the community. He thanked p artners for their continued commitment and ended his address by asking the TAG for guidance on the supplemental immunization activities required and o n the type of vaccine to be used. Dr H.Gezairy, Regional Director WHO/EMRO, welcomed the participants and acknowledged their commitment to polio eradication from Afghanistan and Pakistan and the significant efforts of national authorities and the continued support of the partners. He emphasized on the need for coordinated efforts between the two countries who represent one epidemiologic block with respect to the occurrence of poliomyelitis. Referring to the increase in cases in the last few weeks of 2007, and the possible reasons behind them, the RD underlined the importan ce of intensifying eradication efforts, particularly in high risk areas and ensuri ng very high quality in all activities. The agenda and the programme (Annex 1) were endorse d and the list of participants is attached (Annex 2). 2 3. Implementation of previous TAG recommendations The TAG was informed of the status of implementatio n of its recommendations made during the last meetings. It was noted that al l the recommendations were addressed and were or are being implemented. The on ly recommendation which was not implemented is the provision of 8 million doses of vaccine (4 mOPV1 and 4 mOPV3) as a stock to be used to address emergencies and conduct mop ups as soon as indicated. The TAG expressed its great appreciation of the fac t that H.E. the President of Afghanistan has inaugurated 5 SIAs in 2007. It also acknowledged with appreciation the fact that Prime Minister of Pakistan has acknow ledged the efforts of the various districts by distributing shields for all those who were successful to stop transmission. 4. Epidemiologic Situation: In Pakistan, a total of 32 cases of poliomyelitis, 19 due to wild poliovirus type 1, and 13 due to type 3, were reported in 2007 as comp ared to 40 cases in 2006 (20 cases due to each of the WPV of type 1 and type 3). It was noted that 12 of the 32 cases (about 40%) of 2007 had their dates of onset during November and December 2007 representing a si gnificant increase during these two months. The main characteristics of the 2007 polio confirme d cases show that: Two thirds of the cases are under 3 years of age. Two thirds of the cases received no routine immuniz ation. 40% received less than 4 doses of OPV. Cases were reported from 18 districts as compared t o 22 in 2006. o 10 of the infected districts reported only one case , 5 districts reported two cases and the remaining 3 districts (M ardan, Kambar, and Killa Abdallah) reported more than two cases. o Three districts (Nowshera, Killa Aballah, Kambar) r eported cases of both types of wild poliovirus 1 and 3. The main reasons behind the modest decrease in numb er of wild poliovirus cases in 2007 included the inaccessibility to children in security compromised areas, gaps in performance, pockets of refusals and inadequate man agement in some districts. In Afghanistan, as of 2nd February 2008, a total of 17 cases of poliomyeliti s with onset in 2007 have been confirmed (11 due to WPV3 a nd 6 due to WPV1). This shows a significant reduction in the number of reported t ype 3 cases than in 2006 while it was not the case with wild poliovirus type 1 (29 due to WPV3 and 2 due to WPV1). The major endemic zone of Afghanistan remains the S outhern Region, which accounts for 15 of the 17 confirmed cases (all 11 W PV3 and 4 WPV1) and is sustaining endemic transmission of both WPV3 and WP V1. The remaining two cases (both WPV1) were reported from Eastern Region, part of the shared northern transmission zone with North West Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan. Cases are reported from Eastern Region nearly every year, but while there is clear genetic 3 evidence of shared transmission with central NWFP, there is no genetic evidence in 2006 and 2007 of continued independent transmission in Eastern Region. The polio cases reported from Southern Region were in general under- immunized. 10 of the 15 cases had less than 3 doses of OPV. Two of the ten infected districts in the southern region in 2007 were infec ted with both types of poliovirus, WPV1 and WPV3. The two Eastern Region cases, in con trast, were well immunized. All cases reported in Afghanistan were less than 30 months of age except one case, which was 6 years old. The southern region of Afghanistan is part of a lar ger transmission zone extending into Baluchistan and northern Sindh in Pakistan, wi th extensions to Karachi and southern Punjab. This combined southern Afghanistan -Pakistan transmission zone accounts for the majority of cases reported in both countries, and has the localized transmission of persistent genetic lineages with mu ltiple chains of transmission. It is to be noted that the detected wild viruses re present only the tip of the iceberg of circulating wild viruses in both countries. 5. Surveillance activities In Pakistan, in addition to routine surveillance ac tivities, reviews are being carried out to assure data quality as these are being used to conduct risk analysis regularly. Surveillance indicators are generally up to interna tional standards, and analyses of data at lower than district level did not show any serio us gaps. The programme is not only analyzing laboratory conf irmed cases, but is also studying compatibles and suspected cases even those with negative stool samples. Surveillance is also giving special attention to th e investigation of situations in which isolated viruses show long arms on genetic trees as this may indicate surveillance sensitivity gaps. Identified gaps in surveillance are thoroughly anal yzed and plans of actions prepared to address them. The implementation of the se plans is followed regularly. In its efforts to maintain quality, the programme i s giving special attention to training of all those involved and emphasize the ne ed for analysis of data at district and provincial levels. In areas where security is compr omised the programme is strengthening community based AFP surveillance. In Afghanistan, apart from the southern region, sur veillance in the country continues to be satisfactory through extensive netw ork of reporting sites, including a strong community based component. The major potential gaps in surveillance are in are as where security limits access to populations. Measures to address these potential gaps include expansion of contact sampling in selected districts in Western Region, a ctive search for AFP cases during house to house immunization, and periodic reviews o f surveillance quality. There remain potential gaps in the timeliness of AFP case detection and in particular in the timeliness of specimen shipment, in certain areas o f Southern Region. 4 6. Virologic Analysis The WHO Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) Pakista n has been effectively supporting the polio eradication efforts in both Pa kistan and Afghanistan through its excellent performance and timely reporting, which w as particularly impressive given the increased workload in 2006 and 2007. During 2007, the RRL received and analyzed 10,823 s tool specimens from AFP cases and 2,497 from contacts. Detected wild viruse s were reported in a timely manner for action in the field. The non-polio enterovius ( NPEV) isolation rate was consistently above 10% and large numbers of Sabin Like viruses w ere isolated. In addition to timely analysis and reporting of WPV isolates, the RRL is studying their genetic sequence. The laboratory has 100% con cordance in ITD and poliovirus nucleotide sequencing results with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta. In 2007 three type 1 sub-clusters ( A-3A, A-3D and B-4A), and one type 3 sub-cluster (B1-C) were found circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There is strong coordination between AFP surveillan ce staff (both Pakistan and Afghanistan) and RRL. To this effect all fast growi ng virus culture in poliovirus specific L20B cell line are reported to the program me, and same is true about the PCR and poliovirus nucleotide sequencing results. 7. Supplementary Immunization Activities In 2007, Pakistan implemented 4 NIDs and 7 SNIDs. E ach NID involved the recruitment of more than 80,000 vaccination teams, 15,000 first level supervisors (area in charge) and another 4000 higher levels of superv isors. The SNIDs generally covers 35-40% of the target population. They covered all t ransmission zones and high risk areas. In addition, these areas were given special attention in the planning of the SIAs, in supervision and monitoring through deploying add itional staff and addressing any constraint facing accessibility to children and ref usals. Several efforts were made by the programme to seek commitment of political leadership at all levels by involving them in inaug uration and in monitoring. Also, several efforts were made to involve the religious leadership and media. Post campaign assessment coverage rates analyzed fo r districts shows overall high rates. It was noted, however, that analyzing covera ge data by lower administrative levels shows clearly that in many districts especia lly in the transmission zones and high risk areas more than 20% of the Union Councils have coverage rates less than 95%. Retrospective analysis of coverage data by UC showed that this low coverage in certain areas has been ongoing for several consecut ive rounds. The programme continues to give special attention t o improving performance, and is progressing towards changing the present system of post campaign monitoring by completely independent coverage assessment and addr essing reasons for poor performance all over Pakistan with special focus on high risk areas. 5 Afghanistan implemented 4 full NIDs and 7 SNIDs in 2007. The SNIDs focussed on the transmission zones and high risk areas borde ring Pakistan, i.e. Southern Region, South-Eastern Region, and Eastern Region and Faraha province of Western Region. The critical issue for SIA quality remains Souther n Region. The national programme has documented the access issues in South ern Region, round by round. Both epidemiological data and SIA quality data clea rly indicate that large numbers of children continue to be missed in Southern region a nd neighbouring areas. 8. Communication/Social mobilization: In Pakistan, social mobilization efforts since Octo ber 2007 have focused on ensuring that human resources for communication are in place at the provincial and district level. As well priority has been given to ensuring that an issue specific communications plan is in place in the high risk di stricts and that district teams are trained in data driven communications. A set of nat ional communications indicators have been agreed and monitoring tools were used dur ing the January campaign. Future focus will be on tracking trends and the impact of the communications interventions during NIDs. Two research studies were presented. The first is t he study tracking knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The results are showing i mproved understanding of messages over time. The second study, \"refusal study\", was undertaken i n 6 high risk districts. Preliminary data highlights service delivery issues , as well as the need to involve community influentials more extensively in communit y mobilization. The findings of the report on refusals will be used to prepare plan s to address factors behind refusals, and thus to facilitate undertaking corrective actio ns. It was indicated that a communications review proce ss would be undertaken at the provincial level. It was also indicated that upcomi ng research is planned to address service delivery. The Afghanistan team has been progressing with the scaling up of human resources for communication at all levels. Lack of appropriate human resource that meets the required terms of reference is a major ch allenge to rapid recruitments in the field. A KAP baseline study was undertaken to provi de a baseline for measuring community attitudes, perceptions and practices arou nd behaviors related to polio (and routine) immunization. The KAP has also identified barriers that prevent families from getting their children immunized including gaps in service delivery at the health facilities and at the door step. Communication challenges in Afghanistan are differ ent from Pakistan. Refusals are not an issue. However, since there is a lot of movement between endemic areas in both countries, a distinct possibility of refusals creeping into Afghanistan cannot be ruled out. Children not at home, sleeping children and refusals constitute approximately 7% of the missed children. Not openin g the door to vaccinators or 6 declaring children to be out or sleeping can be tac it or 'silent' refusals that have to be factored into the communication planning. A key issue continues to be the lack of access to p riority areas, Anti government elements (AGE) control some areas which make insecurity a primary factor in not being able to reach children. A set o f processes and impact indicators have been agreed to measure the impact of the communicat ion strategy at all levels. The next step is to ensure a communication structure th at is fully functional at all levels to implement the strategy. 9. Specific experiences and approaches: The programmes shared with TAG specific approaches adopted to address certain issues a. Cross border coordination activities: Since the identification of the fact that both Afgh anistan/Pakistan represent one epidemiologic block with respect to poliomyelitis, a plan was made for coordinated eradication efforts between the two countries who s hare a very long border crossed annually by several millions who have strong social and economic ties. Coordination efforts included: 1. Organization of coordination meeting between the hi ghest levels of the Ministries of Health and between responsible office rs for border areas. The latter is being done regularly and as frequent as needed. 2. Regular exchange of epidemiologic information and s uccessful experiences. 3. Establishment of cross border vaccination posts at both sides of the border. The number of these posts increased to 13 posts, which cover all official cross border points. They have been v accinating hundreds of thousands of children under 5 crossing the border a nnually. 4. Coordinating the dates of the campaigns and the typ e of vaccine used. In some campaigns, villages located across the bord er are covered by either Pakistan or Afghanistan depending on the eas iest way to reach them. b. Maintaining interest of political leaders (Punjab e xperiences) The presentation highlighted Punjab's experience in maintaining political commitment and programme ownership together with th e challenges inherent in having multiple centers of influence (federal, prov incial and district). The system of decentralization strengthened the di strict level management which is also influenced by different political and other community and non governmental elements. 7 Political commitment has been interrelated to both community awareness and acceptance and good performance at field level, whi ch should go hand in hand. To achieve political commitment to the goal of pol io eradication different levels of influence from provincial, political and health leadership, district (DCO, Nazims, EDO, DOH), Union Council (UC)/Tehsil level, supervisors, teams and community were addressed using different approaches and tools. Most important in the Punjab experience was joint management team (WH O, UNICEF and Government) to avoid contradicting messages. Regular meetings, feedback, recognition and high profile visits played important role in keeping int erest and ownership. It is still noted that there is a need to ensure mo tivation at UC levels in order to maintain achievements. Level of commitment of the Punjab authorities in 20 07 was very high as reflected by the allocation of resources at distric t level, high quality response to DG Khan case, and campaign inauguration by high level officials. However, the programme is facing the challenges of keeping inter est in polio with no cases, competing priorities, fatigue and anti-vaccine rumo rs. c. Involving religious leaders (NWFP experience) The presentation highlighted the activities conduct ed in NWFP in regard to addressing issues of refusals, misconceptions and i naccessibility related to opposition to polio campaigns. The initial steps for these act ivities included thorough review of the situation and of potential resources. This was followed by several activities involving high level meetings at provincial and dis trict level and including ministry of health, WHO, UNICEF and other partners and media ag encies. These steps resulted in the issuance of religious Fatwa in support of the p olio vaccinations. Later steps focused on community based intervention s by which refusals, rumors and inaccessibility were identified in speci fic communities or localities. Within those areas meetings were held with the appropriate community influentials such as Mullahs and tribal leaders and institutions such as the large religious schools. These activities, including jerga meetings, enabled the p rogram to gain more support, increase the endorsement of the Fatwa, as well as i ncreasing accessibility to communities previously refusing polio SIA activitie s. Identification of key individuals and involving the m in meetings and inauguration of campaigns to increase support to th e program was done. They were helpful to address community concerns and clarify a ny misconceptions that might exit. The multi-faceted approach and the planned activiti es involving religious and tribal leaders, local media and religious instituti ons had a significant positive impact on increasing accessibility to previously inaccessible areas, convincing refusal communities and generating positive messages regard ing both polio eradication activities and SIA as well as routine vaccination. The trend of campaign data in the second half of 2007 confirm these findings. 8 d. Ensuring coverage of mobile population (Baluchistan ): In addition to movement for social and trade reason s, there is also considerable seasonal movement. For example large population mov e from the cold northern region of Balochistan and southern Afghanistan to warm reg ions in eastern and central Balochistan, interior Sindh and Karachi and souther n Punjab from September till early December every year and return back from March to M ay. In 2006, 3 polio cases were reported in Pakistan (2 from Balochistan and 1 Sindh) from highly mobile population. This fact has highlighted the role they play in moving viruses between the two countries. To address this problem, the program studies popula tion movement extensively with respect to their size, reasons, timing, etc. The established strategies to address the situation included: Covering mobile populations (MP) in temporarily set tled areas and micro- planning, issuing of Yellow Cards and inclusion in PCM. MP were also covered at check points with registrat ion with good record keeping and follow-up in the districts Special Round (Mastung and Loralai) Availing OPV during Measles round. No polio cases reported among MP in 2007 in Pakista n and specific interventions expanded from covering MP in temporarily settled ar eas and check posts to availing opportunities after SIA, measles round and routine immunization. e. Achieving periods of tranquility: (Afghanistan expe rience): Afghanistan has the experience of successful days o f tranquility (DOT) in the past. At that time the concept used to convince th e parties in Afghanistan was \" health is neutral and each Afghani child has the right to be immunized \". In 1990s, days of Tranquility were announced for one week, however, d ue to its usefulness it was extended to more than a month. During the last fiv e years, it became critical to revive this approach with the current parties. Efforts were made by WHO, UNICEF, Ministry of Healt h and later on involving higher authorities but it was not possibl e to move forward because of lack of trust between fighting parties. It was noted that most of the wild polio cases were still detected in security compromised areas. WHO continued its efforts to ach ieve days of tranquility and in 2007 WHO Director General and EMRO Regional Directo r visited Afghanistan and met HE President Hamid Karzai, HM, advisor to Presi dent, Deputy Commander ISAF / NATO. The military agreed to have days of de-conf lict. All information on campaign dates and areas of vaccination was shared with them ; however, operations were conducted during the campaign days. ISAF/NATO HQ Br ussels were visited and briefed by WHO, about the polio situation in Afghan istan. They promised to keep the de-conflict situation during campaign days. At the same time, country team explored 9 the possibility of approaching anti-government elem ents (AGE), who issued a letter of support, and announced in the media and communicate d to their to field formations their full support to polio supplementary immunizat ion activities. This letter was helpful to polio staff in the field and in improvin g access to the areas and children. It helped to vaccinate a large number of children who were missed for long period of time. In addition the program adopted specific initiative s including Focused District Strategy (FDS) based on recruitment of village-loca l teams, adding social mobilizers at cluster level, more involvement of community and cl ose monitoring. Staggering approach (dividing the high risk districts into two zones and positioning all human resource in one and shifting to the other later) an d providing additional staff from the other regions was also instrumental. There is a definite progress on understanding the c oncept of DOT, and now we are in a transition from Days of de-conflict to DOT . The AGE is approachable through ICRC. However, seeking the support of ISAF/NATO on Days of Tranquility is still in progress. In this regard, advisor to the President on Health is keeping this issue alive in NSC meetings. It was discussed during a USAID meeti ng with ISAF/NATO Commander. 10. Observations and conclusions: The TAG expressed its appreciation of the efforts d one by national authorities to eradicate poliomyelitis and the detailed analysis a nd briefings provided by the country teams. It also expressed its satisfaction with the ongoing coordination efforts between the two countries and stressed that every effort sh ould be made to maintain and further strengthen this coordination. 1) Reviewing the epidemiologic situation of poliomyeli tis in Pakistan and programme efforts to address the situation, the TAG made the following observations and conclusions: a. Almost all cases of poliomyelitis due to wild polio viruses type 1 or 3 remain largely restricted to known transmission zon es and the adjacent areas with the majority of the population of Pakist an living in polio free areas. b. The sub-clusters of wild viruses circulating in Pak istan continues to decrease from 10 in 2005 to 7 in 2006 and in 2007 o nly 4 sub-clusters, three type 1 and one type 3, are circulating in Pakistan. There is also evidence of restriction of some genetic subtypes to certain are as such as sub-clusters B4A of wild virus type 1 which continues to be prim arily restricted to NWFP for 3 years. However, other sub-clusters such as A3-D and B1-C have been found in more than one area during 2007. 10 2) Transmission of polio viruses in Pakistan occurs in two zones: a) The northern zone involves essentially NWFP. It is mostly due to WPV type 1. The sequence of events and transmission pat terns point to the strong possibility that the circulating viruses continue t o propagate in the tribal areas in Khyber, Bajour, Swat, and Waziristan north and south. From there it reaches heavily populated areas and transit poin ts such as Peshawar, Nowshera and then reaches other areas in Pakistan a nd sometimes extends into eastern region of Afghanistan. b) The southern zone of transmission has both type 1 a nd type 3. The channels of transmission remain essentially along the corrid or of movement between Southern Afghanistan, Baluchistan, North Sindh and Southern Punjab. c) Karachi used to be considered only an indicator dis trict, but in 2007 it has been implicated in the spread to other areas, both in its neighborhood (Thatta and Lasbella districts) and to distant area s including Northern Sindh and as far as Afghanistan. 3) Pakistan continued to conduct large numbers of SIA regularly including transmission zones with the vaccines recommended by the TAG. Also significant efforts were made by the programme to address const raints through several initiatives and a multiplicity of approaches. a. the TAG, however, is concerned that, in spite of in tensive and mostly effective programme activities, both types 1 and type 3 are s till circulating over wide geographical areas in Afghanistan and in both the n orth and south of Pakistan. The dangers imposed by this circulation is shown in the occurrence of importations in Mardan in the north and from Karach i into districts in the south outside those considered at highest risk. This pict ure indicates the presence of sufficient inadequately immunized population groups which are permitting continued viral circulation due to poor quality. b. as much as 40% of the polio confirmed cases were fo und to have received less than 4 doses of OPV and more than half the cases ha ve not received any routine OPV doses. These facts, in addition to the epidemio logic investigation findings, confirm the possibility that some areas are being m issed regularly not only in routine immunization but also during SIAs. c. the majority of areas with low immunization coverag e have no accessibility problem. In these areas, the responsibility rests l argely with the district management, particularly the EDOs, who have the aut hority and capability of ensuring that immunization is carried out with the required quality. There is ample evidence to testify that in districts where t he EDO is deeply involved and effectively supervising work, performance is of a v ery high quality. The reverse was also found to be true. d. the TAG is concerned that 2 components of the progr amme are not reaching an acceptable standard, limiting its' effectiveness, f irstly the quality of management, especially in planning and supervision, in some districts within 11 the high risk areas and secondly, SIA monitoring re sults, largely in these same districts, are not proving credible. This lack of r eliable monitoring can only lead to concealed problems and programme deficienci es, resulting in complacency. e. presenting immunization coverage data by large popu lation groups such as districts has been masking the real picture of inad equate immunization at lower administrative levels in Pakistan. 4) The only endemic zone in Afghanistan is Southern Re gion, which is part of a large transmission zone including southern Pakistan. The main reason for continued endemic transmission in Southern region of Afghanis tan is the compromised access to children during immunization rounds due to the s ecurity situation. a. Although achieving an agreement for periods of tran quillity has not materialized yet it has been possible to seek the a greement of AGE to issue a statement of support to SIAs in the Southern Regi on. This break through combined with the Government of Afghanistan's effor ts to limit hostilities during immunization rounds, have allowed improved a ccess to children in the southern region which has been sustained for se veral months. The impact is not yet obvious in case numbers, but SIA quality indicators started to show encouraging signs of improvement. b. The few sporadic cases reported from the Eastern Re gion represent cross border transmission from NWFP, Pakistan. The good c overage in SIA rounds and the high quality surveillance indicate t hat it is unlikely that eastern region is supporting endemic transmission o f wild polioviruses. 5) AFP surveillance indicators in both countries give the overall impression that surveillance is functioning well. In depth review c arried out in Pakistan shows some evidence that the quality of work in some dist ricts is less than the desired level. This is supported by the genetic characteris tics of some isolated viruses. 6) TAG commended the role and contribution of Pakistan RRL in the polio eradication programme in both Pakistan and Afghanis tan. 7) The TAG was very impressed with the significant lev el of progress made by Pakistan and Afghanistan in social mobilization in a record time since the last consultation. The TAG has also noted that Pakistan has developed and approved a set of indicators, which are to be used for monitor ing communication trends and the impact of communication activities and that Afg hanistan has prepared a draft set of indicators, which are still under discussion . 11. Recommendations With the present low levels of wild poliovirus tran smission in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the first 6 months of 2008 provides a val uable window of opportunity to make dramatic progress towards polio eradication. T he identified problems, with 12 inadequate planning, supervision and unreliable mon itoring of performance could all be corrected easily and rapidly, at least outside a reas of poor security . To this effect the TAG made the following recommendations: Political commitment: 1) In Pakistan, the Federal and Provincial authorities, already wit h well recognized commitment should: a) review performance of District officials, strengthe ning or replacing ineffective management when detected. If this is to be done, as is clearly necessary, a strict time-line needs to be defined a nd enforced for all the TAG recommendations, providing correction, ideally by the March SNIDs and certainly by the ones scheduled for April. b) ensure that the national communication strategy hig hlights the value of immunizing children and should aim at creating dema nd for vaccination within the community. 2) In Afghanistan, the strong political commitment exh ibited should be maintained with continued active involvement and fo llow-up with the provincial national teams, including the Public Hea lth Directors. Supplementary Immunization Activities 3) To address the quality gap in SIAs in Pakistan, the following should be immediately implemented a) The specific plans of action usually developed at d istrict level before SIAs should be further developed and updated based on close review and mapping of identified challenges and inc lude appropriate solutions. Time-bound action plans to address const rains should be prepared and its implementation monitored and follo wed up. b) With the very concerning role being played by Karac hi in receiving and spreading infection in 2007, the TAG feels that it represents a major threat to all the programme. Guaranteeing the quality of work in the city is an increasing priority. To this end, 2 activities should be instituted promptly, firstly an intensification of AFP surveillance, possibly supported by environmental sampling and se condly a guarantee of high performance SNIDs. To this end, n ew initiatives, such as the drafting in of experienced staff, inclu ding high quality supervisors, to conduct mass campaigns at a time sl ightly different from the rest of the Province, should be considered . 4) In both countries, there is need to continue to ens ure and monitor the presence of the following basic elements for all areas in al l round: i. Adequate and effective supervision of the activitie s. ii. Appropriate selection and training of vaccinators a nd continued efforts to ensure that each team includes at least one female. 13 iii. Increasing involvement of the community and its lea dership (including religious and other community leaders) i n order to promote a sense of ownership of the programme makin g use of successful experiences in some areas in this reg ard. 5) Enhanced monitoring and verification of campaign qu ality by: a) Expanding reliance on finger marking as a tool to a ssess coverage and to identify missed areas such as during market surveys. In this regard training of vaccinators on proper use of fin ger marker, should be strengthened. b) Strengthening independent monitoring of SIAs. In th is regard, it is essential that independent monitoring be conducted by females from sectors other than health, e.g. education. Emphasis should be made on the need to include areas expected to be missed such as those deemed to be difficult to reach. The focus should be on obtaining a full picture and hence the data will not represent the best case scenario but better to be the worst case scenario. c) Analyzing campaign data (including monitoring data) to the lowest possible administrative level. 6) Addressing security compromised areas in both count ries: Security compromised areas should be mapped and mon itored round by round to the lowest possible level. The ongoing eff orts to ensure reaching children with vaccine in these areas shoul d be further strengthened using appropriate approaches suitable to the local situation. The programme should make the best possible use of any period of access to security compromised areas to carry out i mmunization activities, regardless of whether or not this is du ring planned rounds. Wherever periods of accessibility are attained in a reas which are not continuously accessible, the possibility of giving consecutive doses of mOPV of the same type within a short period should be considered, provided its logistically feasible. 7) A buffer stock of both mOPV1 and mOPV3 should be ma intained to ensure rapid response to any detected virus and to allow f or additional SIAs in high risk areas (5 million doses of each type of vaccine for Pakistan and 1 million doses of each for Afghanistan). 8) SIA schedule : The TAG feels that its previous recommendations in April 2007 and those of the technical consultation of October 2007 are still, generally, valid and emphasize on the following: i. The general population immunity against all polio v iruses should be assured through conducting at least 4 NIDs using trivalent vaccine all over both countries. ii. Additional rounds of SIAs in between these NIDs sho uld be planned for transmission zones and other high risk areas using appropriate monovalent vaccines. SNIDs in Pakistan should constitute at le ast 50% of the total 14 target population including all of Sindh, NWFP, FAT A, Balochistan, and selected high risk districts of southern Punjab. iii. Large scale mop-up response to the appearance of WP V in polio free areas should be conducted as soon as possible after confi rmation using appropriate mOPV. The emergency stock of mOPVs shou ld be replenished to maintain the stock. iv. A risk analysis concerning the use of various types of vaccines should be conducted as soon as possible. It should demonstra te the expected consequences related to the use of various schedule s and types of vaccines on the occurrence of cases. The results of this st udy should be utilized by the programme in recommending the schedule and type of vaccine to be used. The views of the TAG can be obtained through an email communication or telephone conference and then pres ented to the authorities. v. The recommended schedule for 2008 is shown in the a ttached table. The TAG noted that the coordinated schedule and vaccine type between Afghanistan and Pakistan has been disrupted because of prevailing political situation in Pakistan necessitating changing the da tes for some rounds and recommends that efforts be made to ensure a return to close coordination and synchronization as soon as possible. vi. While the great majority of the population of Pakis tan lives in polio-free areas, this status cannot be guaranteed if transmis sion of WPV persists in the high-risk areas. The programme must guarantee t hat, even in the long- term absence of positive findings from AFP surveill ance, its quality must be sustained and closely monitored for any signs of re ducing effectiveness. Equally important, programme staff should review th e geographical and epidemiological extent of mopping-up campaigns, und erstanding that with the inevitable time delays to case detection virus isolation, plus the likelihood of sub-clinical infection in a well immu nized population, WPV spread will be extensive before the mop-up can star t. 15 Surveillance 9) Surveillance reviews should be regularly conducted to document the quality of surveillance activities and plans of action develop ed to address identified constraints. 10) It is strongly recommended that the programme insti tutes a mechanism by which the data reported on individual AFP cases are independently validated on a regular basis. Communication: 11) The TAG encourages both Pakistan and Afghanistan to continue to implement the recommendations of the communication reviews as soon as possible. 12) The TAG views the establishment of communication in dicators as a particularly important development. In this regard , it recommends that Afghanistan should review and refine its communicat ion indicators and finalize them prior to the next NID. The TAG looks forward to future communication reports based on these indicators. These reports s hould be prepared after each SIA and incorporated into the campaign report. 16 13) The TAG also recommends that communication reviews should continue on a periodic basis as required by country programmes. T he nature, scope and timing of the reviews should be determined by count ry teams and be chaired by the governments with the support of the national te ams and international / national experts as required. These reviews should be based on social issues and challenges and the evolving polio epidemiology and provide realistic and achievable inputs on how to overcome challenges and strengthen the programme. 14) Further expand the study on refusals in Pakistan an d use its findings in preparing plans to address factors identified behin d refusals and undertake corrective actions. Routine Immunization: 15) Immunization data of polio cases in Pakistan in 200 7 showing that two thirds of the cases had received no routine immunization indi cate that substantial number of children in high-risk areas are still out side the immunization delivery system. Every opportunity to reach these children with polio vaccine should be sought to finally eliminate the remaining reservoirs of susceptible children that are enabling low level of poliovirus circulation to persist. A plan of action for routine immunization in the high risk districts should be ready for implementation as soon as possible and results pres ented in the next TAG meeting. 16) Pakistan Government is encouraged to use GAVI/ISS f unds and other resources to urgently develop and implement a management stru cture for improved routine /outreach immunization services particularl y in the high risk districts for polio. The proposed management structure and p lan of action should draw upon the lessons learned in Pakistan for engaging a nd sustaining the interest of political leaders, involving religious leaders, com municating the value of vaccines to the community, and strategies to reach mobile populations and insecure areas.
