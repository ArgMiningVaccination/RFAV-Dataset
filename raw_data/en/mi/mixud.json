The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. 1. Antibody immunity uses B cells to secrete antibodies. The antibodies are circulated through the plasma cells in the body and bind to the transplant. They then attack the transplant because they see it as a foreign body. Cell-mediated immunity also works to attack the \"foreign body\" but is uses T cells that are directly attached to the transplant. This eliminates the infected cell\" before it has time to multiply. (Alberts, B. 1970) Anatomical location- The integumentary system is superior or external to the body. The organs that make up this system are the skin, glands, nails, hair, and sense receptors. In addition, the skeletal frame is superficial to the cutaneous membrane in the human body. The plague raged throughout Europe from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century evoking various responses from the people who experienced its terror. It affected all regions of Europe, killing one-third of the population. Various responses to the plague expressed different beliefs and concerns including exploitation, fear, and religious superstition. During the course of the plague these beliefs and concerns underwent change. During the outbreak of the plague fear dominated Europe, and as time passed fear became more irrational and superstitious. During the mid-fourteenth century, a plague hit Europe. Initially spreading through rats and subsequently fleas, it killed at least one-third of the population of Europe and continued intermittently until the 18th century. There was no known cure at the time, and the bacteria spread very quickly and would kill an infected person within two days, which led to structural public policies, religious, and medical changes in Europe. The plague had an enormous social effect, killing much of the population and encouraging new health reforms, it also had religious effects by attracting the attention of the Catholic Church, and lastly, it affected the trade around Europe, limiting the transportation of goods. As a response to the plague that took place In the first part of the Immortal Lives of Henrietta Lacks, life, Rebecca Skloot expounded on the discovery and origin of HeLa cells and how Henrietta Lacks and her family were involved in this situation. Conversely, the second part of this book was called death, which is the complete opposite of life. After reading the second part, I believe that this segment of the book concentrates more on the aftermath of Henrietta Lacks's death, and elaborate how the discoveries of HeLa cells after her death impacted the world and her family as a whole. Written in a similar fashion of part one of the book, part two not only focused on Henrietta Lacks's family before and after her death, but it also expanded on the scientific breakthroughs and discoveries In Oryx and Crake, Atwood is continuously complex throughout the novel. There are a total of fifteen chapters within the book, each chapter having its own subchapter. The names of each subchapter are significant because it offers some foreshadowing into the chapter and uses syntax to add an element of humor. The use of character names is especially prominent all throughout the book, which can be confusing for some readers, due to the constant nature of switching between the past and present. What is the impact of the distribution of skin receptors in different areas of the body? Many people may think that vaccination is a bad thing, that instead of preventing it causes illness, that is not natural. Natural or not, there are many reasons as to why we should vaccinate us and the younger generation. Most of the time children don't like vaccination because it hurt, but is the responsibility of a parent to seek the wellbeing of his or her child. Vaccination it's a preventive measure of various diseases. Unfortunately, things like the anti-vaccination movement, the misinformation on the Internet, and the believe that vaccination causes more damage than is worth, have led our society to think that it's right not to vaccinate. Talking about skin aging is a sensitive topic these days as no one would like to actually picture the whole process of their skin losing that youthful appeal after a few years. However, it is essential to know that our skin is like any other part of our body. To be more scientific, skin is the largest organ of the human body. This organ is the first layer which serves as the line of defense and prevents the entry of harmful microbes as well as harmful particles. Apart from this, the body temperature is regulated and the moisture content in the body is also regulated to a certain extent by the skin. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel Immunity is when a person is in a state of being resistant to a particular pathogen. The two types of defense are innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the defenses present at birth and always present to protect us against diseases. Innate immunity does not have a memory response but helps to prevent microbes from gaining access to the body and helps to eliminate those that enter the body. An example of the first line of defense is intact skin and an example of the second line of defense is fever. In an immunologically na\u00efve host, viruses attach to the host cells (Tortora, & Funke, 2013). The human body provides the ideal environment for the microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi to enter the body. Thus, it is the jobs of the immune system to keep them out by protect the body from the harmful substances. Immune system is when the networks of cells and tissues work together to defend the body against the foreign invaders.(Menche,2012 and National Institute Health,2003). According to the Latin word, immune come from the word immunis which is free or untouched. So it is mean that our body must free from the all pathogens that can lead to the diseases. The immune system also can recognize all the millions of the foreign invaders by attacking them and prevent them from enter the body, thus All living organisms are continuously exposed to substances that are capable of causing them harm. Most organisms protect themselves against such substances in more than one way --- with physical barriers, for example, or with chemicals that repel or kill invaders. Animals with backbones, called vertebrates, have these types of general protective mechanisms, but they also have a more advanced protective system called the immune system. The immune system is a complex network of organs containing cells that recognize foreign substances in the body and destroy them. It protects vertebrates against pathogens, or infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites. The human immune system is the most complex. Throughout the years there has been an increase in the debate on child vaccinations. People have been debating on whether vaccinations for children at young ages is generally safe. There are numerous organizations throughout the United States that deal with child vaccinations. Some people comprehend that child vaccinations damage a child's body more than they help it, others think different. Vaccinations in children help prevent viruses and bacteria more than causing them.
