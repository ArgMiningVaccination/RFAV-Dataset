Each chapter contains the following sections: \"Introduction,\" providing an overview of the purpose of the chapter and its value for your students \"Principles to Understand,\" listing basic principles to be taught \"Teaching Suggestions,\" providing teaching ideas for each principle \"Suggested Student Assignments,\" containing activities for students to complete outside the classroom that reflect the competency expectations for this course (what students should be able to do as a result of this course) Select the teaching suggestions you wish to use in the classroom. Some teaching suggestions include statements by General Authorities that are not found in the student manual. These statements provide additional material for you to share in lesson presentations and are formatted so they can be easily recognized. Use or modify the teaching suggestions to fit your students' needs as well as your teaching style. Incorporate other teaching ideas to support the theme or principle if needed. Provide opportunities during class for students to identify, explain, and testify about doctrines and principles in each lesson. Throughout the course, students are invited to record their own thoughts or insights as well as answers to questions that are assigned in class. They will need a class notebook or study journal to record these items. Specific options for class notebooks or study journals are included in the introduction to the student manual. A student manual is available for use with this teacher manual. Each chapter in the student manual corresponds with the same numbered chapter in the teacher manual and contains the following sections: \"Introduction\" \"Principles to Understand,\" listing each principle taught in the chapter \"Supporting Scriptures and Statements\" for each principle, including statements by latter-day prophets and apostles and other Church leaders \"Application and Examples,\" presenting hypothetical situations and accompanying questions \"Points to Ponder,\" containing additional questions to help students understand and apply the principles vPreparing Your Lessons Effective teaching requires that you decide what to teach and how to teach it (see Gospel Teaching and Learning: A Handbook for Teachers and Leaders in Seminaries and Institutes of Religion [2012], 52-57). As you study the lesson materials, identify the principles and doctrine you feel are important for students, being sensitive to the prompting of the Spirit. (This is what to teach.) Then choose a teaching idea or learning activity for each of those principles and doctrine. (This is how to teach.) As you prepare and present each lesson, consider the following questions and suggestions: What will students do during the lesson? Use methods and activities that encourage student participation. How can I help keep students interested? Change teaching methods often enough to help students stay interested. What insights, solutions, or behaviors may result from this lesson? Help students apply the doctrine and principles of the gospel in their lives. Follow the inspiration of the Spirit in what you say and do. Help students understand that they must ask for the Spirit and live so that they invite the Spirit to be with them as they participate in class. Ask questions and raise issues that encourage class discussion and build faith (see D&C 38:23; 43:8; 88:77-80, 122; see also Gospel Teaching and Learning, 63-64). To encourage student responses, refrain from answering the questions youask. Allow students time to think and develop insights for themselves. Listen carefully to students and respond to what they say. Share your testimony and invite students to share their testimonies. Have faith in God and the power of His word to inspire and bless students (see 2 Nephi 32:3; Alma 31:5). Have confidence in students and in the Lord's ability to help you be a successful teacher. Adapting the Manual to Those with Disabilities As you prepare to teach, consider the needs of students with disabilities and adjust learning activities and expectations to help them succeed. For example, some students with reading difficulties may benefit from having access to audio recordings of the scriptures (these can be downloaded from LDS.org). For students who have difficulty expressing themselves in writing, you may wish to invite them to give oral responses instead. For more ideas and resources, consult the Disability Resources page at disabilities.lds.org.INTRODUCTION viCHAPTER 1 Understanding the Plan of Salvation for Heavenly Father's Children Introduction Students often face false philosophies of the world regarding the purpose of their existence. As you teach the plan of salvation, help clarify the purpose of mortality and the role of our Heavenly Father's plan to give direction and meaning to life. As students understand the plan of salvation, they will understand how tribulations, joy, work, study, and maintaining physical strength play an important part in their daily experiences. When we follow the Savior's example, we are happier and are better able to bless the lives of our families and those we serve. Principles to Understand Heavenly Father prepared a plan of salvation that teaches us where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going after mortality. Understanding our place in the plan of salvation helps us develop faith and find joy in a world with many inequities. We can use our knowledge of the plan of salvation to help us in our earthly challenges. Teaching Suggestions Heavenly Father prepared a plan of salvation that teaches us where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going after mortality Ask if any student can quote Moses 1:39. If so, give a student the opportunity to do so; then invite the class to recite it together once or twice. Ask a student to explain what this scripture means to him or her. Write The Plan on the board. Write the following scripture references underneath, leaving out the phrases in parentheses: 2 Nephi 9:6 (\"the merciful plan of the 2 (\"the plan of our plan of salvation\") Alma 34:16 great and plan of redemption\") Alma 42:16 (\"the plan of happiness\") Invite several students to take turns reading these verses aloud. Ask students to find some of the names for Heavenly Father's plan for His children. Help students discover that the names given to this plan describe Heavenly Father's purposes for us. Y ou may want to suggest that students consider marking these names. Write the following three terms on the board, which are the three stages of existence: premortal life, mortal life, andpostmortal life. Ask students to share what they know about each stage of Heavenly Father's plan. Refer them to scriptures and statements by the prophets as needed to help them understand the following concepts: Premortal Life Heavenly Father is a celestial being with a glorified body of flesh and bones (see D&C 130:22). He is the Father of our spirits (see Romans 8:16-17; Hebrews 12:9). We lived with Him as spirit children (see Abraham 3:22-23). In \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: \"All human beings\u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. ... \"In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 129). Heavenly Father taught us His plan of salvation (see D&C 138:56). His plan allowed us to come to earth to gain a body and learn obedience (see Abraham 3:24-26). The plan required a Savior and Redeemer; Jesus Christ was foreordained to be our Savior and Redeemer by Heavenly Father (see Moses 4:2; Abraham 3:27). We rejoiced as we began to understand Heavenly Father's plan. (See Job 38:4-7. Latter-day prophets have taught that verse 7 refers to the joy we felt in our premortal existence when we accepted the plan of salvation; for example, see the statement by Elder Richard G. Scott under the section \"Heavenly Father prepared a plan of salvation ...\" in the student manual.)CHAPTER 1 2 Satan rebelled against Heavenly Father's plan and offered an alternative plan that would limit our agency. He and his followers were cast out. (See Revelation 12:7-11; D&C 29:36; 76:25-27; Moses 4:1, 3-4.) Mortal Life Being in our premortal life was keeping our \"first estate\"; our \"second estate\" began with our mortal life (see Abraham 3:26). Because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, we entered mortality in a fallen state. The Fall and our mortal condition are necessary parts of the plan. (See 2 Nephi 2:22-25; D&C 29:40; Moses 5:10-11.) Jesus Christ redeemed us from the Fall. Without His Atonement we could not be resurrected and would live as spirits in misery with Satan forever. (See 2 Nephi 2:26; 9:6-10.) Our experiences during mortality allow us to use our agency to make choices and experience their consequences (see 2 Nephi 2:11-13, 27; Alma 34:32-34; D&C 58:27-28). Establishing and teaching eternal families is a focus of the plan of salvation (see D&C 93:40; 131:1-4; 138:47-48; Moses 2:28). Whatever knowledge and intelligence we gain during mortality through our diligence and obedience will rise with us in the Resurrection (see D&C 130:18-19). Postmortal Life At death, our spirits go to the spirit world to await the Resurrection. There we continue to learn. (See Alma 40:11-14; D&C 138:10-22.) The Lord will judge us according to how we lived our lives and according to the desires of our hearts (see John 5:22, 30; Alma 41:3; D&C 137:9). Those who follow Heavenly Father's plan will return to live like Him in His presence (see D&C 76:92-96; 93:16-20). Discuss the following questions with students: Why are each of these three stages of existence important to becoming like our Heavenly Father? How does knowing you are a son or daughter of God help you to understand your divine potential? What spiritual qualities help us become more like our Heavenly Father? (Faith, obedience, humility, and so forth.) What will be the results if we follow Heavenly Father's plan? (We become like Him, receive a fulness of joy, and so forth.) Understanding our place in the plan of salvation helps us develop faith and find joy in a world with many inequities Ask a few students to take turns reading the following scriptures aloud and to explain why living according to God's plan brings happiness:CHAPTER 1 3 2 Nephi 2:25 Mosiah 2:41 Alma 19:6 Explain that even as we live according to the great plan of salvation, parts of mortality may be very difficult and include severe trials. Nevertheless, we should remember that Heavenly Father wants us to find joy and peace by keeping His commandments. Invite students to name some plays they have seen or read that had more than one act. Why is it important to know what happened in the first act of a three-act play? How would not knowing about our pre-earth life cause misunderstanding about who we are and what our eternal potential is? Invite a student to read aloud the following description President Boyd K. Packer (1924-2015) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave when he likened the plan of salvation to \"a grand three-act play\": \"Act 1 is entitled 'Premortal Life.' The scriptures describe it as our first estate (see Jude 1:6; Abraham 3:26, 28). Act 2, from birth to the time of resurrection, is the 'Second Estate.' And act 3 is called 'Life After Death' or 'Eternal Life.' \"In mortality, we are like actors who enter a theater just as the curtain goes up on the second act. We have missed act 1. The production has many plots and subplots that interweave, making it difficult to figure out who relates to whom and what relates to what, who are the heroes and who are the villains . It is further complicated because we are not just spectators; we are members of the cast, on stage , in the middle of it all! \"As part of the eternal plan, the memory of our premortal life, act 1, is covered with a veil. Since we enter mortality at the beginning of act 2 with no recollection of act 1, it is little wonder that it is difficult to understand what is going on\" (Boyd K. Packer, \"The Play and the Plan\" [Church Educational System fireside for young adults, May 7, 1995], 2). Why does forgetting \"act 1\" (our premortal life) require us to exercise faith in the Lord? How can knowing that we came to earth and entered mortality as a part of a divine plan help us when life is difficult? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Boyd K. Packer: \"We sometimes wonder: If the plan really is the great plan of happiness, why must we struggle to find fulness of it in mortal life? \"If you expect to find only ease and peace and bliss during act 2, you surely will be frustrated. You will understand little of what is going on and why things are permitted to be as they are.CHAPTER 1 4\"Remember this! The line 'And they all lived happily ever after' is never written into the second act. That line belongs in the third act, when the mysteries are solved and everything is put right. ... \"Until you have a broad perspective of the eternal nature of this great drama, you won't mak e much sense out of the inequities in life. Some are born with so little and others with so much. Some are born in poverty, with handicaps, with pain, with suffering. Some experience premature death, even innocent children. There are the brutal, unforgiving forces of nature and the brutality of man to man. ... \"Do not suppose that God willingly causes that which, for his own purposes , he permits. When you know the plan and purpose of it all, even these things will manifest a loving F ather in Heaven\" (Boyd K. Packer, \"The Play and the Plan,\" 2). Review President Boyd K. Packer's statement \"Until you have a broad perspective of the eternal nature of this great drama, you won't make much sense out of the inequities in life.\" Ask students how they would use their knowledge of the plan of salvation to respond to the following statements and questions: My father died before I was old enough to get to know him. Will I ever see him again? I have a friend who does all kinds of bad things, and he seems perfectly happy. Why should I keep God's commandments? My fianc\u00e9e and I agreed that we're not going to have any children\u2014they are too much of a burden financially and emotionally. We'll be happier without a family. We can use our knowledge of the plan of salvation to help us in our earthly challenges Help students understand that we developed talents and abilities in the premortal life and that knowledge of our premortal life should encourage continued faithfulness and development of our talents and abilities during mortality. To help them understand these principles, share the following statements by General Authorities and discuss the questions following them. We developed talents and abilities in the premortal life Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915-85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: \"In this prior life, this premortal existence, this preexistence, we developed various capacities and talents. Some developed them in one field and some in another. The most important of all fields was the field of spirituality\u2014the ability, the talent, the capacity to recognize truth\" (Bruce R. McConkie, \"Making Your Calling and Election Sure\" [Brigham Young University devotional, Mar. 25, 1969], speeches.byu.edu). Why do you think spirituality is \"the most important of all fields?\" In what ways might spirituality affect our ability to understand temporal knowledge?CHAPTER 1 5Knowledge of our premortal life should encourage continued faithfulness and development of our talents and abilities during mortality Ask students to share several common temporal challenges experienced in mortality (for example, finding a job, having sufficient finances to meet basic needs, keeping good health, and understanding trials). Elder Neal A. Maxwell (1926-2004) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: \"Agreeing to enter this second estate, therefore, was like agreeing in advance to anesthetic\u2014the anesthetic of forgetfulness. Doctors do not de-anesthetize a patient, in the midst of what was previously authorized, to ask him, again, if it should be continued. We agreed to come here and to undergo certain experiences under certain conditions\" (Neal A. Maxwell, \"Premortality, a Glorious Reality,\" Ensign, Nov. 1985, 17). How does knowing that you were willing in your premortal life to submit to certain conditions on earth affect how you accept and deal with challenges? How can the knowledge that we developed various talents and abilities in our premortal life help motivate us to develop them in this life also? Suggested Student Assignments 1. Encourage students to explain the plan of salvation to family members during a family home evening lesson. 2. Ask students to write responses to the following questions in their class notebooks or study journals: In what ways can improving our education and employment skills help us fulfill our purpose in mortality? How could our gaining greater training and education bless our families and others both spiritually and temporally?CHAPTER 1 6CHAPTER 2 Receiving the Guidance of the Spirit Introduction Because there are many false voices clamoring for our attention, we need to recognize personal revelation from God. Properly preparing ourselves to receive the Spirit is essential to spiritual communication. The Holy Ghost gives comfort, peace, and direction to our lives in both temporal and spiritual matters. Help students understand the role of the Holy Ghost and how to recognize the promptings of the Spirit. As we learn to recognize and follow the guidance of the Spirit, we can avoid those areas that are a waste of time or of little importance. Principles to Understand The Holy Ghost can bring comfort, peace, and direction to our lives. The guidance of the Holy Ghost is available to all worthy members of the Church. Prayer is a means to receive the guidance of the Spirit. Teaching Suggestions The Holy Ghost can bring comfort, peace, and direction to our lives Divide the class into six groups and assign each group one of the following scriptures. Ask each group to read their assigned scripture and share with the class what it teaches about the Holy Ghost. John 14:26 John 16:13 Romans 5:5 2 Nephi 31:17 2 Nephi 31:18 Doctrine and Covenants 6:15 Write Functions of the Holy Ghost on the board. Then ask students to list their responses under the heading. Invite students to share a personal experience that illustrates one of the roles of the Holy Ghost. Remind students not to share experiences that are too sacred or private. 7Ask a student to read 2 Nephi 32:5 aloud. Write on the board \"The Holy Ghost ... will show unto you all things what ye should do\" (2 Nephi 32:5). Give students one minute to memorize the phrase and the reference. Then erase the phrase and allow two or three volunteers to quote the phrase and give the reference. Ask students to list in their class notebooks or study journals three or four of the most important decisions they face in their lives. Invite a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 aloud. Then ask students to summarize what they should do to receive help from the Spirit of the Lord in each of the decisions they listed. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin (1917-2008) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"[The Holy Ghost] is a revelator and teacher who conveys information to our spirits with far more certainty than is possible by our natural senses . He can guide us in every choice and decision and never will deceive or mislead us . He is a comforter who brings peace to our souls in times of need\" (Joseph B. Wirthlin, \"Deep Roots,\" Ensign, Nov. 1994, 76). What did Elder Wirthlin say about the certainty of the information we can receive from the Holy Ghost? The guidance of the Holy Ghost is available to all worthy member s of the Church Ask a student to read aloud the following teaching: \"The power of the Holy Ghost can come upon a person before baptism and witness that the gospel is true. But the right to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, whenever one is worthy, is a gift that can be received only by the laying on of hands by a Melchizedek Priesthood holder after authorized baptism into the true Church of Jesus Christ\" (Guide to the Scriptures, \"Holy Ghost,\" scriptures.lds.org). What is the key to having the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost? (Worthiness.) Invite a student to read aloud the statement by President Henry B. Eyring under the section \"The guidance of the Holy Ghost ...\" in the student manual. What can we do to be worthy of the influence of the Holy Ghost? Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the last two paragraphs of the statement by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin under the section \"The guidance of the Holy Ghost ...\" in the student manual. What did Elder Wirthlin say can hamper the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives? What have you found that you must do regularly to invite the Spirit? (Responses may include righteous living, scripture study, prayer, following theCHAPTER 2 8living prophets, keeping baptismal covenants, practicing charity, and disciplining our thoughts.) Ask students to list responses on the board, and encourage them to explain the importance of each suggestion as it is made. Invite them to take notes from the discussion. Prayer is a means to receive the guidance of the Spirit If you used the final question of the previous teaching suggestion, you may want to refer students to the list of practices they suggested would invite the Spirit into their lives. Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President James E. Faust under the section \"Prayer is a means ...\" in the student manual. What practice did President Faust emphasize in both his third and fourth point? Was prayer on your list of actions that invite the Spirit? Why or why not? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Heber J. Grant (1856-1945): \"The minute a man stops supplicating God for his spirit and directions just so soon he starts out to become a stranger to him and his works. When men stop praying for God's spirit, they place confidence in their own unaided reason, and they gradually lose the spirit of God, just the same as near and dear friends , by never writing to or visiting with each other, will become strangers. We should all pray that God may never leave us alone for a moment without his spirit to aid and assist us in withstanding sin and temptation\" (Heber J. Grant, in Conference Report, Oct. 1944, 9). Why is prayer important to one who desires the guidance of the Spirit? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Ezra Taft Benson (1899-1994) regarding the relationship between prayer and the Spirit. Invite the rest of the class to listen for each question President Benson asks and think about how they would answer. \"When you pray\u2014when you talk to your Heavenly Father\u2014do you really talk out your problems with Him? Do you let Him know your feelings, your doubts, your insecurities, your joys, your deepest desires\u2014or is prayer merely an habitual expression with the same words and phrases. Do you ponder what you really mean to say? Do you take time to listen to the promptings of the Spirit? Answers to prayer come most often by a still voice and are discerned by our deepest, innermost feelings. I tell you that you can know the will of God concerning yourselves if you will take the time to pray and to listen\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \"To 'the Rising Generation,'\" New Era, June 1986, 8). Note: The following teaching suggestion emphasizes the value of learning to hear the Spirit in order to recognize the Lord's response to our prayers. Because of its length, it may take the majority of class time to complete. Elder Richard G. Scott's counsel is especially pertinent to young adults because they are arriving at many crossroads where they face decisions that will have a lasting impact on their livesCHAPTER 2 9and on the lives of their future families. Help students learn confidence in recognizing the Lord's answers to their prayers so that daily they will humbly turn to Him. Invite students to turn to Elder Richard G. Scott's general conference address, \"Learning to Recognize Answers to Prayer,\" under the section \"Prayer is a means ...\" in the student manual. There are ten questions inserted throughout the address for students to consider. Y ou may want to write the first two or three questions on the board and then ask students if they have ever pondered them. Invite students to use Elder Scott's address as a resource to answer the ten questions. Y ou may want to divide your class into groups and ask each group to search for answers to one or more of the questions. Invite each group to share what they learn with the rest of the class. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to review the \"Application and Examples\" section in the student manual and answer the questions listed there. 2. Invite students to ponder how they can invite the Spirit into their lives. Ask them to record their thoughts in their class notebooks or study journals.CHAPTER 2 10CHAPTER 3 Setting Goals and Managing Time Introduction Many people struggle with setting goals and managing their time effectively. Help students understand how goal setting and wise time management can improve their lives and also help them better serve others. Principles to Understand Setting worthwhile goals gives direction to our lives. We should set goals in a number of different areas. Managing our time gives us control over our lives so we can serve more effectively. Teaching Suggestions Setting worthwhile goals gives direction to our lives Share the following journal entry of a farmer: \"Decided to cut hay. Started to harness up the horses and found that the harness was broken. I took it to the granary to repair it and noticed some empty sacks lying around. The sacks were a reminder that some potatoes in the cellar needed the sprouts removed. I went to the cellar to do the job and noticed that the room needed sweeping. I went to the house to get a broom and saw the wood box was empty. I went to the woodpile and noticed some ailing chickens. They were such sad-looking things that I decided to get some medicine for them. Since I w as out of medicine, I jumped into the car and headed for the drugstore. On the way, I ran out of gas.\" Then ask the following questions: What derailed the farmer from his goal to cut hay? Why do we sometimes behave like the farmer? What is a goal? Why is it important to remain focused on a goal? Why is it important to set goals? How do we reach goals? Share the following concepts, which can help us learn to set worthwhile goals: A goal is an anticipated accomplishment. 11 The value of a goal helps determine its priority. Prioritizing goals means to put them in a desired order. A calendar helps us schedule all that we need to accomplish. Most successful people set goals. Goal setting helps us plan and gives dir ection to our lives. Write on the board Long-Range Goals, Intermediate Goals, Short-Range Goals, and Daily T asks. What do you consider to be long-range goals? What do you consider to be intermediate goals? What do you consider to be short-range goals? What are some examples of daily tasks? List responses on the board under the appropriate headings (see example responses in the following chart). Long-Range GoalsIncrease my skills for advancement in my employment. Be worthy of exaltation and becoming like my Heavenly Father. Intermediate GoalsComplete a year's worth of courses in classes focused toward a degree or certification. Receive the temple ordinances. Serve in the kingdom. Short-Range GoalsEnroll in and complete a semester or quarter of classes toward a degree or certification. Pay tithing and offerings regularly. Be faithful in my home teaching or visiting teaching each month. Daily Tasks Complete assignments for my next class. Read scriptures for 30 minutes each morning. Pray morning and night. Why is a \"Daily Tasks\" list helpful in reaching goals? Why would it be important to review our daily tasks in relation to our long-range goals? How can short-range goals help us achieve long-range academic and spiritual goals? How do the long-range, intermediate, and short-range goals and daily tasks listed interrelate with each other? It has been said that a goal not written is merely a wish. Help students understand that writing their goals can help them remember and reach their objectives. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Franklin D. Richards (1900-1987) of the Presidency of the Seventy:CHAPTER 3 12\"Objectives and goals should not only be worthwhile but also realistic. T hey should be an incentive to work effectively. Thus the setting of realistic objectives and achieving them becomes an important part of the great process of eternal progression\" (Franklin D. Richards, in Conference Report, Oct. 1969, 123). How can you determine whether a goal is realistic? We should set goals in a number of different areas Ask two students to come to the board and ask one to write temporal and the other to write spiritual. Invite a third student to read aloud the statement by Elder G. Homer Durham about John Widtsoe under the section \"We should set goals ...\" in the student manual. Ask the students at the board to list each of John Widtsoe's goals under either temporal orspiritual. Ask students in which category (temporal or spiritual) they would place each of the following: church service, civic service, family, education, career, missionary work, finances, family history, physical exercise, and leisure time. Invite students to suggest specific goals that would be appropriate for each item in the preceding list (for example, in family history, submit a name for temple work; in finances, create a budget). Managing our time gives us control over our lives so we can serve more effectively Discuss the following questions: How many of you wish you had more time each day? Why? Why do we lose control of our time? Write on the board: We gain control of our lives by gaining control of our time. Why is it important that we actively direct the course of our lives rather than just letting things happen? Invite a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 60:13 aloud. Why is it important not to waste our time? Share the following statement by Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In a list of simple things young people can do to keep themselves \"clean, and pure and valiant\" to serve missions, he mentioned: \"Are you careful with your time\u2014 avoiding inappropriate technology and social media, including video games, which can dull your spiritual sensitivity?\" (M. Russell Ballard, \"The Greatest Generation of Young Adults,\" Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 68).CHAPTER 3 13 What principle does Elder Ballard's statement teach? On what do we often waste time? What attitudes lead to wasting time? How can modern inventions be time wasters or time savers? One of the greatest tools we have to manage our time is planning. An old saying is \"Plan your work, and then work your plan.\" Planning helps us bring future events into the present so that something can be done about them now. Write the following simple rules of effective planning on the boar d. (This model could be adapted to accommodate intermediate and long-range goals, such as weekly, monthly, or yearly.) 1. Make a list of everything you need to accomplish today. 2. Assign a value to each item (for example, A = vital, B = important, C = of some value, D = waste of time). 3. Do all of the As first, then the Bs, and so on. Suggest that students refer to the \"Application and Examples\" section in the student manual to learn more about daily planning. Invite several students to take turns reading aloud the statements by President Thomas S. Monson and President Gordon B. Hinckley under the section \"Managing our time gives us control ...\" in the student manual. Ask students to follow along and summarize the counsel given about priorities. List students' findings on the board. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Assign students to take some time during the next week to sit in a quiet place and write their life goals and then describe what must be done during the next five years, one year, six months, and week to move forward toward completion of one of these life goals. Invite them to write a paragraph about each life goal, describing what it means to them. They can write this in their class notebooks or study journals.CHAPTER 3 14CHAPTER 4 Managing Financial Resources Wisely Introduction Many people are concerned about their finances. Many are worried about having the necessary financial resources to provide for themselves or their families. Others may not understand the importance of being honest in their financial dealings because they see others seeming to prosper by being dishonest. Help students understand the importance of paying tithes and offerings, how to avoid debt and save for the future, the need to be honest in their financial affairs, and how to work together as a family to budget resources. When we faithfully keep the Lord's commandments, we will prosper in the land (see 1 Nephi 2:20). Help students understand that this promise does not mean that those who are experiencing financial hardship are neglecting to faithfully keep the commandments, or that keeping the commandments will prevent all financial hardship. Financial hardship is a reality for many faithful Saints. As with all of the Lord's promised blessings, prosperity will come in His time and in His way to those who are faithful. This promise of prosperity refers not only to material goods but also to personal and family blessings. Principles to Understand Paying tithes and offerings brings blessings. Avoiding unnecessary debt and saving for the future helps keep us free from financial bondage. Being honest in our financial affairs shows our personal integrity. Counseling together as families helps us decide how resources should be used. Teaching Suggestions Paying tithes and offerings brings blessings In managing our finances, paying tithing should take first priority. Invite a student to read aloud the following account by President Joseph F. Smith (1838-1918): 15\"My mother was a widow, with a large family to provide for. One spring when we opened our potato pits she had her boys get a load of the best potatoes , and she took them to the tithing office; potatoes were scarce that season. I w as a little boy at the time, and drove the team. When we drove up to the steps of the tithing office, ready to unload the potatoes, one of the clerks came out and said to my mother, 'Widow Smith, it's a shame that you should have to pay tithing.' ... He chided my mother for paying her tithing, called her anything but wise or prudent; and said there were others who were strong and able to work that were supported from the tithing office. My mother turned upon him and said: 'William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold His blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper and to be able to provide for my family'\" (Joseph F . Smith, in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 48). What lessons can we learn from President Smith's mother about the importance of paying tithing? Ask a student to read aloud the second statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley under the section \"Paying tithes and offerings ...\" in the student manual. In what ways, other than increased wealth, might the Lord bless us when we faithfully pay our tithes and offerings? Explain that when we pay tithing we show our faith, love, and commitment to the Lord. The tithing funds are carefully monitored by the First Presidency and are used to build the Lord's kingdom here on earth (see D&C 120). Show students a coin that is of the smallest value in circulation where you live. How can a coin of such small worth be of value to the Lord? During His earthly ministry, the Lord observed a widow paying an offering. Invite a student to read Luke 21:1-4 aloud. Explain that a mite was the smallest valued coin in circulation in Jesus's day. What does it mean that the rich men gave \"of their abundance\" but the widow gave \"all the living that she had\"? Why is our attitude in giving more important to God than the size of our gift? Share the following scenario: Steve was enrolled in school. He had a part-time job and no debts to worry about. However, when he received his paycheck, he found that he did not have enough money to pay for his rent and also pay his tithing. What counsel would you give Steve? Help students understand that we pay tithing because we have faith, not because we have money (see the statement by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin under the section \"Paying tithes and offerings ...\" in the student manual). Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President James E. Faust under the section \"Paying tithes and offerings ...\" in the student manual. Invite two students to take turns reading Malachi 3:8-12 aloud.CHAPTER 4 16 What do you think it means to \"open ... the windows of heaven\"? (Answers may include both spiritual and temporal blessings.) Do you consider tithing a gift to God or the payment of a debt? Why? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"Pay your tithes and offerings out of honesty and integrity because they are God's rightful due. ... \"Paying tithing is nota token gift we are somehow charitably bestowing upon God. Paying tithing is discharging a debt\" (Jeffrey R. Holland, \"Like a Watered Garden,\" Ensign, Nov. 2001, 34). In what ways can we be blessed spiritually when we pay tithing? Who or what do you think is the \"devourer\" spoken of in Malachi 3:11? Explain that the devourer can be an obstacle in our lives that tends to eat up our resources, such as costly accidents, health concerns, and attitudes on spending. Sometimes the devourer is rebuked by the consequence of our actions. The Lord can teach us how to avoid or overcome those challenges. In what ways does paying our tithing help us prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ? (Invite students to read D&C 64:23 to find the answer.) Invite two students to take turns reading aloud the following statements. Ask students to listen for the blessings given to those who pay tithing and why many of these blessings are of more value than money. President Heber J. Grant (1856-1945) testified: \"I bear witness\u2014and I know that the witness I bear is true\u2014that the men and the women who have been absolutely honest with God, who have paid their tithing, ... testify to all the world of the blessings of God that have come to them by the fulfillment of this law, and that God has given them wisdom whereby they have been able to utilize the remaining nine-tenths, and it has been of greater value to them, and they have accomplished more with it than they would if they had not been honest with the Lord\" (Heber J. Grant, in Conference Report, Apr. 1912, 30). President N. Eldon Tanner (1898-1982) of the First Presidency taught: \"The payment of tithing is a commandment, a commandment with a promise. If we obey this commandment, we are promised that we will 'prosper in the land. ' This prosperity consists of more than material goods\u2014it may include enjoying good health and vigor of mind. It includes family solidarity and spiritual increase\" (N. Eldon Tanner, \"Constancy amid Changes,\" Ensign, Nov. 1979, 81).CHAPTER 4 17Invite one or two students to share their experience with paying tithing and how obeying this commandment has strengthened their faith in the Savior. Avoiding unnecessary debt and saving for the future helps keep us free from financial bondage Write on the board: In what ways can being in debt limit our freedom? Divide the class into four groups, and assign each group one of the first four statements by General Authorities under the section \"Avoiding unnecessary debt ...\" in the student manual. Ask each group to find the main point of their assigned statement. After the groups have had a chance to discuss the statements, invite one representative from each group to go to the front of the class for a panel discussion. Ask the following questions to the panel of students and instruct them to r efer, when possible, to the statements in the student manual. What are some good financial habits we should form in our lives? What does it mean to \"be modest in your expenditures\"? Why is it easy to get into debt and hard to get out of debt? What are acceptable debts? In what ways can debt limit our freedom? Invite a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 104:78-80 aloud. Then list on the board the principles and counsel of the Lord regarding debt. Why do you think this is important counsel regarding overcoming debt? In what ways can these verses help you avoid getting into debt? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Heber J. Grant: \"If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means. And if there is any one thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet\" (Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards, comp. G. Homer Durham [1969], 111). Instruct students to turn to the debt-elimination calendar under the section \"Avoiding unnecessary debt ...\" in the student manual. Invite a student to read aloud Elder Marvin J. Ashton's explanation, which precedes the calendar. Ask students to note on the calendar that when debt 1 was paid in July, the monthly payment for that paid-up debt was added to the payments on debt 2 in order to eliminate debt 2 sooner. Invite students to explain the pattern as it continues on the remainder of the chart. Being honest in our financial affairs shows our personal integrity Write the word honesty on the board. Ask students to explain what the word means to them.CHAPTER 4 18 How does being honest affect our relationships with others, such as our parents, spouse, colleagues at work, and friends? Explain that being honest with others reflects how we follow the Lord. The Lord has called us His covenant people. This is because we are willing to make and keep covenants with Him. He has commanded us to deal honestly with Him and all others. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President James E. Faust (1920-2007) of the First Presidency: \"While I was serving as Area Supervisor in South America, a most unforgettable experience happened in Montevideo, Uruguay. I wanted to change some money because I was living in Brazil at the time, so Brother Carlos Pratt took me to a money exchange house in downtown Montevideo. He introduced me to one of the officials, and the official said they would change $1,000. I did not have $1,000 in cash and had only a check drawn on a bank in Salt Lake City. The exchange house had never done business with me before. In fact, they had never seen me before and could not expect to ever see me again. They had no way to verify if I had $1,000 on deposit in the bank upon which I had drawn the check. But they accepted my check without hesitation\u2014based solely on the fact that I was a Mormon and that they had previously done business with other Mormons. Frankly, I was both grateful and pleased because of their confidence\" (James E. Faust, \"These I Will Make My Lambs,\" Ensign, Nov. 1980, 36). In what ways does our individual honesty affect other people's opinions of not just us but also the Church? How is dishonesty a form of selfishness? Invite students to share experiences that exemplify honesty in financial affairs. Share the following statement by President N. Eldon Tanner: \"The ideal of integrity will never go out of style. It applies to all we do. As leaders and members of the Church, we should be the epitome of integrity\" (N . Eldon Tanner, \"Constancy amid Changes,\" 82). Why do you think personal honesty is one of the requirements for a temple recommend? Counseling together as families helps us decide how resources should be used Draw three columns on the board and label them Father, Mother, andExtended Family. Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Invite students to listen for the expectations for each category and to list them on the board.CHAPTER 4 19\"By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families . Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities , fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" Ensign orLiahona, Nov. 2010, 129). Explain that in providing for the necessities of life, a plan showing how much money is earned and where that money will be spent can be very helpful. Such a plan is called a budget. Why is it important that both partners in a marriage participate in a family budget? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Marvin J. Ashton (1915-94) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Ask students to look for additional insights to add to the lists on the board. \"In the home, money management between husband and wife should be on a partnership basis, with both parties having a voice in decision- and policy-making. ... \"Management of family finances should be mutual between husband and wife in an attitude of openness and trust. Control of the money by one spouse as a source of power and authority causes inequality in the marriage and is inappropriate. Conversely, if a marriage partner voluntarily removes himself or herself entirely from family financial management, that is an abdication of necessary responsibility\" ( Marvin J. Ashton, One for the Money: Guide to Family Finance [pamphlet, 1992], 2-3). Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to turn to the budget activity at the end of chapter 4 in the student manual. Explain that whether we have a large or small income, we can benefit from learning to budget our resources. A budget helps us plan and evaluate the money we take in and spend. Ask students to begin an estimated budget using the budget sheet in the student manual. Counsel them to keep their budgets confidential. Y ou may want to list a sample budget on the board, with examples of income and expenditures typical for your area. For \"Income,\" instruct students to list their anticipated income for one month in the \"Planned\" column. This may include money from various sources, such as jobs, savings accounts, and scholarships. For \"Expenditures,\" ask them to estimate anticipated expenses in the \"Planned\" column. Encourage them to include Church donations and savings for future needs and emergencies. For \"Income,\" invite students to record their actual income for one month in the \"Actual\" column. For \"Expenditures,\" ask them to record their actual expenses for one month in the \"Actual\" column. This will help them keep track of what they spend.CHAPTER 4 20Maintaining a budget will be a challenging assignment, requiring students to keep daily records. It will likely take more space than provided on the student manual budget sheet. Students may want to keep daily records in their class notebooks or study journals and then use the budget sheet in the student manual to summarize their income and expenses at the month's end. At the end of the month, students should compare their expenditures with their income. After they total their actual income and expenditures, they will be able to examine what they actually need each month and also expenses they need to reduce. Wise budgeting means balancing income with expenditures and spending less than one earns.CHAPTER 4 21CHAPTER 5 Having Faith in Jesus Christ Gives Us Power to Provide for Ourselves and Others Introduction Faith in Jesus Christ is a principle of power and action that can guide us in improving our lives and helping others. Help students understand that as they exercise faith in Christ and actively seek to improve their station in life, the Lord will help them provide for their physical and spiritual needs. Principles to Understand Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ brings power to grow spiritually and deal with temporal affairs. The Lord promised that He will help provide for us. The Lord will not command us in all things. We must be anxiously engaged in doing much good. When we faithfully turn to the Lord, He will help us understand how we can improve our lives and help others. Teaching Suggestions Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ brings power to grow spiritually and deal with temporal affairs Ask if any student can quote Proverbs 3:5-6. If so, give a student the opportunity to do so; then invite the class to recite it together once or twice. What do you think it means to \"trust in the Lord with all thine heart\"? Does trusting the Lord lessen our need to develop understanding? Why? Write on the board Faith is a principle of power. Ask students what they think it means. Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915-85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: 22\"Faith in its true signification is more than the moving cause pursuant to which men and angels act. It is also a principle of power. Faith is power. And where there is power, there is faith; and where there is no power, there is no faith. Thus, Joseph Smith continues: 'Faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth.' Faith applies in all spheres. All intelligent beings\u2014be they gods, angels, spirits, or men\u2014all operate by its power\" (Bruce R. McConkie, A New Witness for the Articles of Faith [1985], 164). What are some examples from the scriptures that illustrate that faith is power? (For example, see Ether 12:7-22.) How do these examples increase your understanding of faith? Invite students to share some experiences when faith has blessed their lives. Share the following explanation of faith: \"To have faith in Jesus Christ means to have such trust in him that we obey whatever he commands. There is no faith where there is no obedience. Likewise, there is true obedience only where there is faith. As we place our faith in Jesus Christ, becoming his obedient disciples , Heavenly Father will forgive our sins and prepare us to return to him\" (Gospel Principles [1997], 118). What does this teach you about how to increase your faith? In what ways would greater faith give you power to improve your temporal circumstances? Write the following words across the top of the board: Education, Employment, and Family. How can increasing our faith in Jesus Christ help us improve in each of these areas? List students' responses on the board. Help students understand that as we obey God's commandments we gain a greater abundance of the Spirit in our lives to guide us in our temporal pursuits. The Lord can provide opportunities for us to learn and increase our skills, talents, and abilities. Ask students to write in their class notebooks or study journals a brief statement about how they feel faith and obedience can enable them to improve both spiritually and temporally. Invite a few students to share what they write. Share your testimony that as we strive to live the gospel to the best of our abilities, the Lord will bless us in our spiritual and temporal affairs. The Lord promised that He will help provide for us Write on the board Praying for Help in Spiritual and Temporal Affairs. Under that heading, in a single column, list the following scripture references:CHAPTER 5 23Photo courtesy of Nasa Johnson Space Center Alma 34:20 Alma 34:21 Alma 34:22 Alma 34:23 Alma 34:24 Alma 34:25 Alma 34:26 Ask seven students to take turns reading each verse aloud and suggesting a modern application for the verse they read. Invite students to write down what they would like to pray for during the next few weeks. Display pictures of the earth and some of its animals. Ask two students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 104:14-18 aloud. What do these verses teach about the relationship between the Lord and the earth? What do they teach about the Lord's ability to provide for His children? What is our responsibility in qualifying for the Lord's help? Invite two or three students to share examples from their lives of when faith combined with work led to blessings, such as employment or education opportunities. The Lord will not command us in all things. We must be anxiously engaged in doing much good Ask students to think of the last time they did a kind act for someone without being asked to do it. Why did you do it? How did you feel after you did it?CHAPTER 5 24Invite students to write in their own words the teaching in Doctrine and Covenants 58:26-27. Ask two or three to read what they wrote. What does it mean to be \"anxiously engaged\"? What are some good causes in your life that will bless you, your family, and others? What good temporal causes are you working on? Invite a student to read aloud the statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie under the section \"The Lord will not command us in all things ...\" in the student manual. What guidelines would you give for determining the balance between our faith and our works? Remind students that in the early days of the Restoration, the Lord gave Oliver Cowdery permission to translate from the golden plates. Ask a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 9:7-8 aloud. According to the first half of verse 8, instead of simply asking the Lord for help, what else should Oliver Cowdery have done? What can we learn from Oliver Cowdery's experience when seeking the Lord's help? When we faithfully turn to the Lord, He will help us understand how we can improve our lives and help others Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin (1917-2008) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which illustrates the Lord's compassion for others: \"I can easily imagine the deformed legs of a man unable to walk since birth or the tears flowing down a widow's cheek as she follows the body of her only son as it is carried to its tomb. I see the empty eyes of the hungry, the trembling hands of the sick, the pleading voice of the condemned, the disconsolate eye of the outcast. All of them are reaching toward a solitary man, a man without wealth, without home, without position. \"I see this man, the Son of the living God, look on each of them with infinite compassion. With a touch of His holy hand, He brings comfort to the downcast, healing to the sick, liberation to the condemned. With a word the dead man rises from his bier and the widow embraces her enlivened son\" (Joseph B. Wirthlin, \"Inspired Church Welfare,\" Ensign, May 1999, 76). What evidence do you see in the Church that shows that the Lord is concerned today about our temporal needs? Discuss with students the questions from the \"Points to Ponder\" section in the student manual. President Gordon B. Hinckley explained the principle upon which the Perpetual Education Fund is based. Ask a student to read aloud his first statement under the section \"When we faithfully turn to the Lord ...\" in the student manual. InviteCHAPTER 5 25students to follow along and look for how the Perpetual Education Fund may bless their lives and the lives of others. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to interview one or two people in their community who have improved their education or their career by additional training. Students should then write a paragraph about each person interviewed, summarizing how the person has progressed since completing his or her education and how the person's ability to assist others both in and out of the Church has changed. 2. Discuss with students specific ways they feel that being trained and gainfully employed will improve their ability to serve in the Lord's Church as well as care for their family. 3. Discuss how the use of our time relates to the principle of being anxiously engaged in good causes.CHAPTER 5 26CHAPTER 6 Providing for Self, Family, and Others Introduction Temporal responsibilities are related to spiritual growth. For example, there is a relationship between keeping the Lord's commandments and financially providing for our families. Help students learn to recognize priorities and set worthy goals. The Lord can help us fulfill our responsibilities to provide for those we love as we make and follow plans to improve our temporal circumstances. Principles to Understand The temporal and the spiritual are linked. Our priorities should reflect gospel principles. Fathers are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. Teaching Suggestions The temporal and the spiritual are linked Write temporal on the board, and ask students what they think the word means. Y ou may want to share with them the definition from a dictionary. Help them understand that this word is related to time and earthly life and to secular concerns rather than spiritual or sacred concerns. What are some commandments that seem to be temporal in nature? (List students' responses on the board.) Why do those commandments seem temporal rather than spiritual? Why is it inaccurate to believe that what we do on Sunday is spiritual and what we do the other days of the week is only temporal? Invite a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 29:34-35 aloud. Ask students how the commandments listed on the board affect both the temporal and spiritual aspects of our lives. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President George Q. Cannon (1827-1901) of the First Presidency: 27\"The plan of salvation embraces everything that belongs to men in the flesh on the earth. In the mind of our God there is no distinction between that which is spiritual and that which is temporal. He uses this phrase in revelations to us because He adapts Himself to our condition and to our mode of looking at affairs; but with Him there is no distinction between temporal and spiritual things. \"There is no distinction between spiritual salvation ... and temporal salvation. Our bodies are as dear in the sight of God as our spirits. ... God gives revelations for the temporal salvation of His children\u2014that is, for the salvation of their bodies\u2014and they are as important in their place as His revelations concerning their spirits\" (Gospel Truth: Discourses and Writings of President George Q. Cannon, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist [1974], 2:310). How do our spiritual strengths assist our temporal or material needs? In what ways does earning a living relate to our spiritual growth? Our priorities should reflect gospel principles Share the following scenario: A recently returned missionary had a difficult time finding employment. He finally found two jobs that were available. The job that paid the most required that he work on Sundays. He reasoned: \"I know that going to church is important, but this is a very good job offer. And even though I have to work on Sundays, I'm afraid if I don't take the job I'll never be able to take care of my financial responsibilities.\" What important gospel principles should this person consider? (List students' responses on the board.) Invite a student to read Matthew 22:36-39 aloud. Ask students what those verses teach about priorities. Invite a student to read aloud the statement by President Russell M. Nelson under the section \"Our priorities ...\" in the student manual. How can correct priorities be a protection to us? How can we internalize good priorities? Explain that because God cares about our temporal well-being as well as our spiritual well-being, He will help us with both aspects of our lives as we keep Him first in our priorities. Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the following statement by President Ezra Taft Benson (1899-1994): \"We must put God in the forefront of everything else in our lives. He must come first, just as He declares in the first of His Ten Commandments: 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me' (Ex. 20:3). \"When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities. \"We should put God ahead of everyone else in our lives. ...CHAPTER 6 28\"If someone wants to marry you outside the temple, whom will you strive to please\u2014God or a mortal? If you insist on a temple marriage, you will be pleasing the Lord and blessing the other party. Why? Because that person will either become worthy to go to the temple\u2014which would be a blessing\u2014or will leave\u2014which could also be a blessing\u2014because neither of you should want to be unequally yoked (see 2 Cor. 6:14). \"You should qualify for the temple. Then you will know that there is no one good enough for you to marry outside the temple. If such individuals are that good, they will get themselves in a condition so that they too can be married in the temple. \"We bless our fellowmen the most when we put the first commandment first. ... \"God loves us; the devil hates us. God wants us to have a fulness of joy as He has. The devil wants us to be miserable as he is. God gives us commandments to bless us. The devil would have us break these commandments to curse us\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \"The Great Commandment\u2014Love the Lord,\" Ensign, May 1988, 4-6). Invite students to give examples of what would drop out of their lives if they put God first. Ask students to write in their class notebooks or study journals three important decisions they know they will make in the near future. Instruct them to describe how proper priorities will affect each decision. Fathers are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children Ask students to suppose some people think it is not their responsibility to provide and care for themselves and their families. They believe that others should be responsible to provide for them. Invite two students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 42:42 and 56:17 aloud. Why do you think self-reliance is an important gospel principle? Write on the board Responsibilities of the Father andResponsibilities of the Mother. Divide the class into three groups and ask them to study the statements under the section \"Fathers are responsible ...\" in the student manual. Ask the first group to study the statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley. Ask the second group to study the statement by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the statement by President Spencer W. Kimball. Ask the third group to study the statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie. Invite a representative from each group to list on the board the responsibilities of the father and the mother, as taught in their assigned reading. How do these responsibilities of a father and a mother generally differ? What responsibilities listed on the board do they share? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008):CHAPTER 6 29\"Some years ago President Benson delivered a message to the women of the Church. He encouraged them to leave their employment and give their individual time to their children. I sustain the position which he took. \"Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has become very many in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can. I hope that if you are employed full-time you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries. The greatest job that any mother will ever do will be in nurturing, teaching, lifting, encouraging, and rearing her children in righteousness and truth. None other can adequately take her place. \"It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. I know how some of you struggle with decisions concerning this matter. I repeat, do the very best you can. You know your circumstances, and I know that you are deeply concerned for the welfare of your children. Each of you has a bishop who will counsel with you and assist you. If you feel you need to speak with an understanding woman, do not hesitate to get in touch with your Relief Society president\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Women of the Church,\" Ensign, Nov. 1996, 69). Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to write their answers to the following questions in their class notebooks or study journals: What do you think it means to be a good provider? How do the roles of a provider differ between a father and a mother? What do each provide? What are you doing that will enable you to become a good provider for yourself and for your family?CHAPTER 6 30CHAPTER 7 Recognizing and Developing Talents and Abilities Introduction We come to earth with unique combinations of talents and abilities that we further develop during our experiences in mortality. Fears and doubts have kept some people from realizing the full potential of their talents and abilities. Help students learn to recognize their individual talents and abilities and resolve to develop them through dedication, determination, and hard work. The talents and abilities of Church members are reservoirs of blessings when they are willingly shared. Principles to Understand Partly because of our development in the premortal life, each of us comes to earth with a unique combination of talents and abilities. When we rely on the Spirit, the Lord will help us recognize and develop our talents and abilities. The Lord will help us overcome our doubts and fears as we seek His help to develop our talents and abilities. Developing talents and abilities requires individual work. Teaching Suggestions Partly because of our development in the premortal life, each of us comes to earth with a unique combination of talents and abilities Ask students to name some talented or skilled people. List students' r esponses on the board. How long does it take to develop the abilities these people have? How can talents and abilities be used to benefit others? Why do some people seem to be born with certain talents and abilities? Share the following statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915-85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: 31\"Each person in this life is endowed with those talents and capacities which his pre-earth life entitle him to receive. Some by obedience to law acquired one talent and some another in pre-existence, and all bring with them into mortality the talents and capacities acquired there. (Abra. 3:22-23.)\" (Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, [1965], 1:688). Why is it important to develop the talents we brought with us from our premortal life? In what ways might our talents help us decide what type of employment to seek? How can we use these talents in our occupations? How can we use these talents in raising a family? What talents might a mother or father find particularly useful in nurturing children? When we rely on the Spirit, the Lord will help us recognize and develop our talents and abilities How can we determine what our talents and abilities are? Students' responses might include: Recognize what we can do well. Ask others, such as parents and friends, what they think are our talents. Take an interest or skills evaluation test, often given at schools or employment offices. Learn about various skills or talents by reading, observing, or talking with others. Pursue a few areas of interest with the aid of people who are skilled in those areas and can give advice and suggestions. Pray for the Lord's guidance. Prayerfully read our patriarchal blessings. Use leisure time to explore and develop useful skills. Invite students to list a few of their talents in their class notebooks or study journals and describe how they plan to develop these talents. Ask students to think of someone who is very skilled or talented in the following areas and to explain why that person has impressed them: A trade or profession Music, art, or other talent A hobby or home skill Invite a few students to read 1 Nephi 17:7-11, 16 and 18:1-2 aloud.CHAPTER 7 32 What talents and abilities did Nephi use to accomplish the Lord's errand? (He was able to process ore and make his own tools.) What did the Lord do to help Nephi? (The Lord showed Nephi where to find the ore and how to construct the ship.) Help students understand that by relying on the Lord, Nephi was able to useand develop his talents. Ask a student to read 2 Nephi 5:15-17 aloud. Why do you think Nephi was able to teach his people to do all of those things? (He had learned and developed these skills earlier.) The Lord will help us overcome our doubts and fears as we seek His help to develop our talents and abilities Invite a student to read Moses 6:31 aloud. Draw the following scale on the board: (Fearful) 1\u20142\u20143\u20144\u20145\u20146\u20147\u20148\u20149\u201410 (Confident) Ask students to select a number on the scale that indicates how the y think Enoch might have felt about his abilities. (They will probably select a low number.) Invite them to share experiences of when they were faced with a task that they did not feel capable of completing or doing well and what they did to meet the challenge. Ask a student to read Moses 7:13 aloud. Instruct students to follow along, looking for Enoch's accomplishments. Invite students to select a number on the scale that indicates what they think his confidence level was then. Ask what they think made the difference in Enoch's confidence. Invite a student to read Moses 6:32-34 aloud. How did the Lord help Enoch overcome his doubts and fears? What principles in these scriptures can we apply in our lives to help us have confidence? Ask students what counsel they would offer in the following situations: 1. A young man or woman gained confidence while serving a successful mission. However, since returning home, he or she has not felt the confidence needed to find meaningful employment or pursue an education. 2. A young priesthood leader is uncertain about how to balance his Church calling with his education. 3. A young married couple is concerned about their ability to financially support a family. Write on the board Don't give up andDon't you quit. Invite a student to read aloud the following experience that Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared in a conference talk. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles told how as a young man he took his young family across the United States from St. George, Utah, toCHAPTER 7 33Boston, Massachusetts, where he would attend graduate school. They had traveled only 34 miles when their car broke down. Elder Holland left his wife, Pat, and two young children with the car while he walked to a nearby town for help. After help was obtained and the car was repaired and driven back to St. George for inspection, they once again drove off, only to have the car break down again about 15 feet from where it had broken down the first time. Thirty years later, with his children grown and married, Elder Holland and his wife drove by the exact spot where he had left them to walk for help. Thinking back on that incident, he said that in his mind's eye he saw himself as a discouraged young man. He said: \"His shoulders seemed to be slumping a little, the weight of a y oung father's fear evident in his pace. ... In that imaginary instant, I couldn't help calling out to him: 'Don't give up, boy. Don't you quit. Y ou keep walking. Y ou keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead\u2014a lot of it\u201430 years of it now, and still counting. Y ou keep your chin up. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come'\" (Jeffrey R. Holland, \"An High Priest of Good Things to Come,\" Ensign, Nov. 1999, 37-38). Video Presentation\u2014\"Good Things to Come\" Instead of asking students to read Elder Holland's experience, consider showing the video \"Good Things to Come\" (4:55), which portrays his experience. This video is available on LDS.org. How can our not giving up help us overcome our doubts and fears? Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley under the section \"The Lord will help us overcome ...\" in the student manual. What stands out to you about President Hinckley's counsel? Developing talents and abilities requires individual work Show students a picture of a talented person whom you admire and explain why you consider that person talented. Or display a picture of an athlete, concert pianist, leader, or other accomplished person. How do such individuals become so accomplished? (They often develop their talents through much practice and effort.) What part does work and practice play in developing talents? If we all practiced hard enough, could we all become concert pianists? Why? What happens to a person's talent if it is not used or developed? Share the following statement by President James E. Faust (1920-2007) of the First Presidency:CHAPTER 7 34\"President [Heber J.] Grant had a favorite quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson which he lived by: 'That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased'\" (James E. Faust, \"The Power of Self-Mastery,\" Ensign, May 2000, 45). Invite a couple of students to read aloud the following two stories from the life of President Heber J. Grant (1856-1945). These two stories illustrate how he developed skills in areas in which he originally had little ability. When President Heber J. Grant was only a child, he had little experience in sports. He joined a baseball club but had to play with the younger players. He explained: \"One of the reasons for this was that I could not throw the ball from one base to the other; another reason was that I lacked physical strength to run or bat well. When I picked up a ball, the boys would generally shout, 'Throw it here, sissy!' So much fun was engendered on my account by my youthful companions that I solemnly vowed that I would play base ball [sic] in the nine that would win the championship of the Territory of Utah. \"My mother was keeping boarders at the time for a living, and I shined their boots until I saved a dollar, which I invested in a base ball. I spent hours and hours throwing the ball at a neighbor's barn. ... Often my arm would ache so that I could scarcely go to sleep at night. But I kept on practicing, and finally succeeded in getting into the second nine of our club . Subsequently I joined a better club, and eventually played in the nine that won the championship of the Territory. Having thus made good my promise to myself, I retired from the base ball arena\" (Heber J. Grant, \"Work, and Keep Your Promises,\" Improvement Era, Jan. 1900, 196-97). President Grant showed similar dedication in developing another skill: As a young man, President Heber J. Grant \"resolved that some day he would be a bookkeeper in the Wells Fargo and Company's bank. In those days all the records and accounts of the bank were written with a pen, and one of the requisites of a good bookk eeper was the ability to write well. To learn to write well was his first approach to securing this job and the fulfillment of his resolve; so he set to work to become a penman. \"At the beginning his penmanship was so poor that when two of his chums were looking at it one said to the other, 'That writing looks like hen tracks.' 'No,' said the other, 'it looks as if lightning had struck an ink bottle.' This touched Heber Grant's pride and, bringing his fist down on his desk, he said, 'I'll some day be able to give you fellows lessons in penmanship .' ... \"When Heber, still in his teens, was working as a policy clerk in the office of H. R. Mann and Co., he was offered three times his salary to go to San Francisco as a penman. He later became teacher of penmanship and bookkeeping at the University of Deseret (University of Utah)\" (Bryant S. Hinckley, Heber J. Grant: Highlights in the Life of a Great Leader [1951], 39-40). By the time President Grant was 19 years old he had reached his goal to work at Wells Fargo and Company (see Hinckley, Heber J. Grant, 42).CHAPTER 7 35 Why are most successes a result of hard work? Encourage students to develop their talents and abilities. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008): \"I could wish for you nothing better than that your lives be fruitful, that your service be dedicated and freely given, that you contribute to the knowledge and the well-being of the world in which you live, and that you do it humbly and faithfully before your God. He loves you. We love you. We want you to be happy and successful, to make significant contributions to the world in which you will live and to the on-rolling of this great and majestic work of the Lord\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer for Youth,\" Ensign, Jan. 2001, 11). Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to list or review in their class notebooks or study journals what they think are their talents and abilities. Invite each student to then ask someone he or she respects to list what that person thinks are the student's talents and abilities. Ask students to compare their two lists and choose two talents or abilities to focus on for further development. 2. After students have reviewed some of their talents and abilities, invite them to determine which of their talents or abilities might lead to meaningful employment. If none of the talents and abilities you reviewed are directly related to employment skills, could any be used to contribute to a positive atmosphere in the workplace? How?CHAPTER 7 36CHAPTER 8 Building the Kingdom of God on Earth Introduction Each member of the Church has something to offer in building the kingdom of God. The best places to do this are in our own homes, in our own wards, and in our own stakes. Help students understand that in serving the Lord it is not where we serve but how. Being actively engaged in the work of the kingdom, at any level, will bless our lives and provide growth in countless circumstances. Principles to Understand We help build the kingdom of God by living righteously. Individuals and families are strengthened by activity in the Church. We should willingly serve wherever we are. Blessings come as we serve in the kingdom of God. Teaching Suggestions We help build the kingdom of God by living righteously Write Kingdom of God on the board. Ask students to share what they think the kingdom of God is. Then invite a student to read aloud the introduction to chapter 8 in the student manual. Share the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008): \"I invite every one of you, wherever you may be as members of this church, to stand on your feet and with a song in your heart move forward, living the gospel, loving the Lord, and building the kingdom. Together we shall stay the course and keep the faith, the Almighty being our strength\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Stay the Course\u2014Keep the Faith,\" Ensign, Nov. 1995, 72). Why does each member play an important part in the growth of the Church? Ask students to suggest some attitudes and actions of individual Chur ch members that help strengthen the Church. List students' responses on the board. These might include: Be happy. 37 Be positive. Pray and study the scriptures daily (see Joshua 1:8). Repent of sins (see D&C 58:42-43). Be worthy of a temple recommend. Listen to the prophet's counsel (see D&C 1:38). Serve faithfully in Church callings. Pay a full and honest tithing (see Malachi 3:8-10). Attend Church meetings. Have family home evening. Then ask the following question: How do each of the attitudes and activities listed on the board strengthen the Church? Invite students to consider ways we can strengthen ourselves as members of the kingdom of God. Explain that in a talk to youth and young single adults, President Gordon B. Hinckley gave six ways to help us strengthen ourselves against the challenges we face (see \"A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer for Y outh,\" Ensign, Jan. 2001, 4). List the six ways on the board, as follows. Then ask students to share examples of or insights on the prophet's counsel. 1. Be grateful. 2. Be smart. 3. Be clean. 4. Be true. 5. Be humble. 6. Be prayerful. Individuals and families are strengthened by activity in the Church Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President Thomas S. Monson under the section \"Individuals and families are strengthened ... \" in the student manual. How do \"hot coals\" relate to activity in the Church? What can we do to be active in the Church and live up to our commitments to the Lord? Share and discuss the following list given by President Ezra Taft Benson (1899-1994). (Y ou may want to make this list into a handout.)CHAPTER 8 38Suggest that students select and work to improve in three areas from President Benson's list during the next few weeks. Ask them to write in their class notebooks or study journals what they plan to do to improve in each selected area. Encourage them to share their experiences during a future class. We should willingly serve wherever we are Invite a student to recite or read Mosiah 2:17 aloud. Ask students to explain what this scripture means to them. In the early days of the Church, the Lord asked the Saints to gather to the center places of the Church, such as Kirtland, Ohio; Jackson County, Missouri; Nauvoo, Illinois; and Utah. In our day, where should Church members gather? To help answer the preceding question, ask a student to read aloud the following statement by the First Presidency from a letter dated December 1, 1999, in which they reaffirmed the long-standing counsel of priesthood leaders on the importance of members building the Church in their own countries: \"As members throughout the world remain in their homelands, working to build the Church in their native countries, great blessings will come to them personally and to the Church collectively. Stakes and wards throughout the world will be strengthened, making it possible to share the blessings of the gospel with an even greater number of our Heavenly F ather's children. \"We are confident that members of the Church throughout the world will be blessed as they heed this counsel and work to strengthen their local Church units and communities\" (\"Counsel about Immigration,\" Ensign, Mar. 2000, 79). Why is it important to build the kingdom of God in our own country?1. \"We must be a 'light' of the gospel of Jesus Christ to others. ... 2. \"We must seek for opportunities to share the gospel message with others. ... 3. \"We should do all we can to help prepare our sons and grandsons to serve missions. ... 4. \"Our homes should be places of refuge, love, and harmony. ... 5. \"We should seek for the blessings and ordinances of the temple. ... 6. \"We have an obligation to do temple work for our kindred dead. ... 7. \"As families we should strive to be self-reliant. ... 8. \"Priesthood holders need to provide watchcare over quorum members and their families through organized home teaching. ... 9. \"We should participate in the programs and activities of the Church\u2014keep the Sabbath as a holy day, attend our meetings, accept callings extended to us, and magnify those callings. ... 10. \"Every adult member should be a full-tithe payer and contribute a generous fast offering\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \"Strengthen Thy Stakes,\" Ensign, Jan. 1991, 5).CHAPTER 8 39Invite two students to take turns reading aloud the following statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915-85) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"Stakes of Zion are ... being organized at the ends of the earth. In this connection, let us ponder these truths: A stake of Zion is a part of Zion. You cannot create a stake of Zion without creating a part of Zion. Zion is the pure in heart; we gain purity of heart by baptism and by obedience. A stake has geographical boundaries. To create a stake is like founding a City of Holiness. Every stake on earth is the gathering place for the lost sheep of Israel who live in its area. \"The gathering place for Peruvians is in the stakes of Zion in Peru, or in the places which soon will become stakes. The gathering place for Chileans is in Chile; for Bolivians it is in Bolivia; for Koreans it is in Korea; and so it goes through all the length and breadth of the earth. Scattered Israel in every nation is called to gather to the fold of Christ, to the stak es of Zion, as such are established in their nations. ... \"This then is the counsel of the Brethren: Build up Zion, but build it up in the area where God has given you birth and nationality. Build it up where he has given you citizenship, family, and friends. Zion is here in South America and the Saints who comprise this part of Zion are and should be a leavening influence for good in all these nations. \"And know this: God will bless that nation which so orders its affairs as to further his work\" (Bruce R. McConkie, \"Come: Let Israel Build Zion,\" Ensign, May 1977, 118). What did Elder McConkie teach about Zion? What does it mean to be a \"leavening influence\"? In what ways can the Church be a leavening influence in a country? Ask students to share experiences about Church members they know who are a leavening influence in their branch, ward, stake, or community and how they make a difference and bless others. Blessings come as we serve in the kingdom of God Invite two students to take turns reading aloud the statement by Elder Derek A. Cuthbert under the section \"Blessings come as we serve ...\" in the student manual. Ask students to follow along and look for the blessings of service. Then invite students to share examples from their own experiences. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to think of specific areas in their life that they could change in order to live more righteously. 2. Ask students to name three ways they can build the Lord's kingdom where they live and to list them in their class notebooks or study journals. Instruct them to set some specific goals that will help them succeed.CHAPTER 8 40CHAPTER 9 Becoming Self-Reliant in the Lord's Way Introduction \"From the earliest days of the Church, the prophets have taught Latter-day Saints to be independent and self-sustaining and to avoid idleness. True Latter-day Saints will not voluntarily shift from themselves the burden of their own support. So long as they are able, they will supply themselves and their families with the necessities of life\" (Gospel Principles [2011], 158). Help students understand the need to develop self-reliance in the Lord's way. As we learn self-reliance, we develop faith in Him that will lead us to daily seek His help. As we balance the Lord's help and the resources and talents He has given us, we learn to care for our own needs and provide assistance to others. Principles to Understand Righteous self-reliance includes faith in and dependence on the Savior. The gospel teaches us to become self-reliant temporally and grow spiritually and to help others do the same. We have a responsibility to improve ourselves. Self-reliance implies the development of skills and abilities in a variety of areas. Teaching Suggestions Righteous self-reliance includes faith in and dependence on the Savior Display a picture of Jesus Christ. Invite students to list examples of what He has done for them that they could not do for themselves. Ask three students to read aloud the following scriptures: Proverbs 3:5-10 2 Nephi 4:34 2 Nephi 9:42-43 Then invite students to explain what these scriptures teach about our dependence upon the Lord. Share with students the first paragraph of the introduction to this chapter. Write self-reliance on the board. Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the statement by Elder Bruce R. McConkie under the section \"Righteous self-reliance 41includes faith ...\" in the student manual. Invite students to follow along and look for Elder McConkie's explanations about the meaning of the word self-reliance. Ask students to share experiences of when they took the initiative to do something and how the Lord supported them in their efforts. (These might involve studying out a problem and making a decision based on that study and then gaining confirmation from the Lord; getting the best vocational training available and then receiving the Lord's guidance toward appropriate employment; or working honestly to provide for one's family and then receiving the Lord's help to manage resources wisely.) The gospel teaches us to become self-reliant temporally and grow spiritually and to help others do the same Write July 24, 1847 on the board. Ask students what significance this date has in Church history. (President Brigham Y oung and the last of his pioneer company entered the Great Salt Lake V alley on this day.) When the Saints arrived in the Salt Lake V alley they worked hard to transform an unsettled area into a thriving settlement. Share the following description of the pioneers given by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008): \"They had traveled from the Missouri River, taking three months to cover the distance we cover in two hours by airplane. With faith in their capacity to do what needed doing, they set to work. Theirs was a philosophy of self-reliance. There was no government to assist them. They had natural resources, it is true. But they had to dig them out and fashion them. ... They had skills, patiently learned, in masonry, the working of wood, the making and application of plaster, the setting of glass\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"The Faith of the Pioneers,\" Ensign, July 1984, 3). Nearly 100 years after the early pioneers entered the valley, a severe economic depression was impacting the world, and unemployment was very high. The First Presidency organized a welfare program for the Church. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Heber J. Grant (1856-1945), in which he introduced the basic principles of Church welfare: \"Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership\" (Heber J. Grant, in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, 3). What does the Church welfare system teach about self-reliance? What are some ways people can help themselves overcome generations of poverty? Why is it honorable to seek gainful employment? (So that we can provide for ourselves and our families.)CHAPTER 9 42Ask a student to read aloud the scenario in the \"Application and Examples\" section in the student manual. Invite students to answer the question that follows it. Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the two statements by President Spencer W. Kimball under the section \"The gospel teaches us to become self-reliant ...\" in the student manual. What are the blessings of work? What does the statement \"work should be the ruling principle in the lives of our Church membership\" mean to you? We have a responsibility to improve ourselves Why is personal responsibility important in our lives? Write the following statement on the board: We have a personal responsibility to improve ourselves. Divide the class into four groups. Assign each group one of the four statements by the Prophet Joseph Smith, Elder Robert D. Hales, President Russell M. Nelson, and Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin under the section \"We have a responsibility ...\" in the student manual. Instruct each group to create an outline for a two-minute talk on the subject written on the board. Ask them to include in their talk the statement assigned from the student manual. Invite a representative from each group to present the talk to the class. Self-reliance implies the development of skills and abilities in a variety of areas List the following categories on the board: 1. Education 2. Health 3. Employment 4. Resource management 5. Social, emotional, and spiritual strength Ask students to name ways they can become more self-reliant through the first category listed on the board, education. Then invite a few students to take turns reading aloud the material beneath the subheading \"Education\" under the section \"Self-reliance implies the development ...\" in the student manual. Do the same for each of the remaining categories listed on the board, asking students to read aloud from the corresponding subsection in the student manual. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to pray about their needs and to discuss appropriate goals with a parent, spouse, trusted friend, or teacher. Ask them to write in their classCHAPTER 9 43notebooks or study journals one or more goals from each of the five categories: education, health, employment, resource management, and social, emotional, and spiritual strength. Invite them to place a copy of their goals where they can review them regularly.CHAPTER 9 44CHAPTER 10 Seeking Learning by Study and by Faith Introduction The Lord taught that we should \"seek learning, even by study and also by faith\" (D&C 88:118). As we seek both spiritual and secular knowledge, the Lord will bless us. Education is a key to opportunity and should become a lifetime endeavor. It can prepare us to support our families and contribute to the Church and community. Help students understand the need to take advantage of opportunities to improve themselves and further their education. There are always exciting new truths to learn and share with others. Principles to Understand We should seek knowledge and wisdom. Spiritual knowledge is more important than secular knowledge. Education is a key to opportunity. The Lord will guide us to areas of learning that will help us better serve others. Learning is a lifetime endeavor. Teaching Suggestions We should seek knowledge and wisdom Discuss the following questions with students: What is the difference between knowledge and wisdom? (Answers might reflect the idea that knowledge has to do with being able to recite and understand facts, ideas, or principles, whereas wisdom is the timely use of knowledge to benefit others.) How does education contribute to knowledge and wisdom? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008): 45\"I believe in the pursuit of education. What is education? Reduced to its most simplistic definition it is the training of the mind and the body . ... Education is a great conversion process under which abstract knowledge becomes useful and productive activity. It is something that never need stop\u2014no matter how old we grow we can acquire knowledge and use it. We can gather wisdom and profit from it\" (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 170). How can becoming better educated help us serve God and others? Invite a student to read aloud the first statement by President Henry B. Eyring under the section \"We should seek knowledge and wisdom\" in the student manual. How would you summarize President Eyring's counsel? Ask two students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 88:77-80 aloud. What general areas of study are referred to in verse 79? (Answers might include astronomy, geography, history, and so forth.) Invite a student to read aloud the following teaching by Elder John A. Widtsoe (1872-1952) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"Theology is not the only subject in which the Elders should be interested. They should study: \"Things both in heaven\u2014Astronomy. \"And in the earth\u2014Everything pertaining to the cultivation of the soil. \"And under the earth\u2014Mineralogy, geology, etc. \"Things which have been\u2014History, in all its branches. \"Things which must shortly come to pass\u2014Prophecies. \"Things which are at home and abroad\u2014Domestic and foreign politics. \"Wars\u2014perplexities\u2014judgments\u2014The signs of the times, by which the observer may know that the day of the Lord is at hand. \"A knowledge of countries and kingdoms\u2014Physical and political geography, languages, etc. \"These studies, the Lord considers necessary. [Sec. 88:80.] God does not require all His servants to become doctors, or professors, or even profound students of these subjects, but He expects them to know enough of these things to be able to magnify their calling as His ambassadors to the world\" (John A. Widtsoe, Priesthood and Church Government in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [1939], 55-56). What is the value of studying a variety of subjects? (See D&C 88:80.) Ask a student to read 2 Nephi 9:28-29 aloud. Then discuss the following questions: How can learning help us? How might learning harm us? Invite a student to share an experience when he or she was very hungry or thirsty.CHAPTER 10 46 What satisfied your hunger or thirst? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley. Invite students to look for what President Hinckley wants us to be hungry for. \"It is not enough just to live, just to survive. There is incumbent upon every member of this Church the mandate of the Lord to equip ourselves to do something worthwhile in society. The Lord has made it very clear in the Doctrine and Covenants that we are to get an education by study and by faith of things under the earth, and on the earth, and above the earth, of the w ars and the perplexities of the nations, of the times and the seasons of all things of the earth. (See D&C 88:79.) I want to urge our young people to be hungry for education. You will be doing the will of the Lord as you educate your minds and your hands for future work to mak e a contribution to the world of which you will be a part. Sacrifice for it, work for it, save for it, plan for it, and do it\" (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 172). According to President Hinckley, what do we need to do to satisfy the hunger for education? Read aloud the following statement by President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency, and note his use of the word thirst: \"The thirst for education that comes with the change the gospel brings can be a blessing or a curse, depending on our motives. If we continue to seek learning to serve God and His children better, it is a blessing of great worth. If we begin to seek learning to exalt ourselves alone, it leads to selfishness and pride, which will take us away from eternal life\" (Henry B. Eyring, \"Education for Real Life\" [Church Educational System fireside for young adults, May 6, 2001], 2). What is the key to correctly satisfy our thirst for education? Spiritual knowledge is more important than secular knowledge Share the following scenario: Juan was 18 years old and was interested in becoming an engineer. He had thought seriously about serving a mission but was not sure when to do so. He wondered if he should serve a mission immediately or complete his prerequisite courses and then serve a mission. What potential risks are there in postponing missionary service? What advice would you offer Juan? Why? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Spencer W. Kimball (1895-1985):CHAPTER 10 47\"Youth, beloved youth, can you see why we must let spiritual training take first place?\u2014Why we must pray with faith, and perfect our own lives lik e the Savior's? Can you see that the spiritual knowledge may be complemented with the secular in this life and on for eternities but that the secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow? \"Do not be deceived! One need not choose between the two but only as to the sequence , for there is opportunity for one to get both simultaneously; but can you see that the seminary courses should be given even preferential attention over the high school subjects; the institute over the college course; the study of the scriptures ahead of the study of the man-written texts; the association with the Church more important than clubs, fraternities, and sororities; the payment of tithing more important than paying tuitions and fees? \"Can you see that the ordinances of the temple are more important than the PhD or any and all other academic degrees?\" (Spencer W. Kimball, \"Beloved Youth, Study and Learn,\" in Life's Directions [1962], 190). What did President Kimball teach about priorities in learning? How does a knowledge of the Savior complement secular learning? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley: \"Jesus said: ' ... learn of me. ... \"'For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.' (Matt. 11:29-30.) \"I should like to suggest that you follow that injunction given by the Son of God. With all of your learning, learn of him. With all of your study, seek knowledge of the Master. That knowledge will complement in a wonderful way the secular training you receive and give a fulness to your life and character that can come in no other way\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, in Conference Report, Oct. 1964, 118). Ask a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 88:118 aloud. Invite students to describe someone they know who exemplifies a proper balance between spiritual and secular learning. Education is a key to opportunity Display (or draw on the board) a key. What happens if a door is locked and we do not have a key? Write on the board: Education is a key to opportunity. How is education like a key? (It opens opportunities that otherwise would not be available.) Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley:CHAPTER 10 48\"It is so important that you young men and you young women get all of the education that you can. The Lord has said very plainly that His people are to gain knowledge of countries and kingdoms and of things of the world through the process of education, even by study and by faith. Education is the k ey which will unlock the door of opportunity for you. It is worth sacrificing for . It is worth working at, and if you educate your mind and your hands, you will be able to make a great contribution to the society of which you are a part, and you will be able to reflect honorably on the Church of which you are a member. My dear young brothers and sisters, take advantage of every educational opportunity that you can possibly afford\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Inspirational Thoughts,\" Ensign, June 1999, 4). What do you think it means to educate our hands? (Learn skills that require using our hands.) What types of education or skills would you like to acquire? Give students time to list some of their desires for education and skills in their class notebooks or study journals. The Lord will guide us to areas of learning that will help us better serve others Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Henry B. Eyring. Invite another student to summarize in his or her own words what President Eyring said. \"Your life is carefully watched over, as was mine. The Lord knows both what He will need you to do and what you will need to know. He is kind and He is all-knowing. So, you can with confidence expect that He has prepared opportunities for you to learn in preparation for the service you will give . You will not recognize those opportunities perfectly, as I did not. But when you put the spiritual things first in your life, you will be blessed to feel directed toward certain learning and you will be motivated to work harder. You will recognize later that your power to serve was increased, and you will be grateful\" (Henry B. Eyring, \"Education for Real Life,\" 3-4). What can you do to make sure you are prepared for the opportunities God will give you? How can reading the scriptures daily help us prepare for inspiration in all of our decisions? (See 2 Nephi 32:3-5.) When was the last time one of the Savior's teachings helped you make a specific decision? Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President Howard W. Hunter under the section \"The Lord will guide us ...\" in the student manual. Learning is a lifetime endeavor Why should learning be a lifetime endeavor?CHAPTER 10 49Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley: \"Keep on growing, my brothers and sisters, whether you are thirty or whether you are seventy. Your industry in so doing will cause the years to pass faster than you might wish, but they will be filled with a sweet and wonderful zest that will add flavor to your life and power to your teaching. And to all of this you may add the promise that 'whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.' (D&C 130:18.)\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Four Imperatives for Religious Educators\" [address to Church Educational System religious educators , Sept. 15, 1978], 2). Take time as a class to discuss libraries, schools, and educational opportunities that will be available long after their formal education. Y our discussion may include references to local schools and training centers. Who are some individuals in the community who can help you decide how to continue your lifelong learning process? Ask students to share examples of individuals who have continued to learn throughout their lives. Suggested Student Assignments 1. From their notes written during this class, invite students to select one skill or educational goal they would like to acquire. Ask them to discuss this goal outside of class with someone who can help them make important decisions about how to achieve the goal.CHAPTER 10 50CHAPTER 11 Selecting and Becoming an Eternal Companion Introduction Entering into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage is essential to obtain the highest degree of the celestial kingdom (see D&C 131:1-4). One of the most important decisions we make is our choice of an eternal companion, and it is important to not only findthe right companion but to be the right companion. Help students understand that the way they live attracts others with similar values, interests, desires, and goals. Since the commitment between a husband and wife is meant to be eternal, seeking and receiving divine guidance on this matter is critical. \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\" provides counsel on choosing and becoming an eternal companion. As you discuss this topic of eternal marriage, be aware that there are many righteous people who have not yet had the opportunity to enjoy the blessings of marriage. Some of students may be suffering from the effects of a failed marriage or may be struggling in a current marriage. Although marriage is a requirement of the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, please be considerate of students' feelings. Principles to Understand A marriage is enhanced when the husband and wife share similar values and interests. We should prepare ourselves to be the best companion we can. We should seek the Lord's confirmation in choosing a marriage partner. The proclamation on the family is a guide for assessing our attitudes and those of our future spouse. A husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and their children. Teaching Suggestions A marriage is enhanced when the husband and wife share similar values and interests Invite students to think of a happily married couple they know. What interests and values do the husband and wife share? How do these similarities help strengthen their marriage? 51Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the statements by President Spencer W. Kimball and President N. Eldon Tanner under the section \"A marriage is enhanced when ...\" in the student manual. Invite them to name characteristics that help build a happy marriage. Write students' answers on the board. The list might include the following: Similar economic, educational, religious, and social backgrounds Similar interests Similar values regarding money, religion, work, children, use of leisure time, and education Effective communication skills Worthiness for temple marriage Discuss the following questions: Why do similarities tend to strengthen a marriage? In what ways can differences in values weaken a marriage? Ask the students to look at the list of characteristics that build a happy marriage and consider which characteristics they think are the most important. Invite several students to share their feelings about the characteristics they chose. Share the following statement by President Spencer W. Kimball (1895-1985): \"Religious differences are the most trying and among the most unsolv able of all differences\" (Spencer W. Kimball, \"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign, Mar. 1977, 5). Why do you think this statement is true? How does this relate to the counsel of Church leaders to date only those in the Church who have high standards? How does the gospel serve as a unifying bond in marriage? We should prepare ourselves to be the best companion we can Ask students to list in their class notebooks or study journals five or six qualities they consider important in their future spouse. How are you going to find a person with all of those qualities? To what extent have you developed those qualities in your own life? Write the following statement by President Ezra Taft Benson (1899-1994) on the board and discuss how it applies to marriage:CHAPTER 11 52\"Do not expect perfection in your choice of a mate\" (\"T o the Single Adult Sisters of the Church,\" Ensign, Nov. 1988, 96). Why is this statement good advice? Help students understand that having unrealistically high expectations for a future husband or wife may make it impossible to find someone with whom they believe they can be happily married. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Spencer W. Kimball: \"While every young man and young woman will seek with all diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate with whom life can be most compatible and beautiful, yet it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage if both are willing to pay the price\" (Spencer W. Kimball, \"Oneness in Marriage,\" 4). What does it mean to \"pay the price\" to have happiness and success in marriage? Ask a student to read aloud the second statement by Elder Richard G. Scott under the section \"We should prepare ourselves ...\" in the student manual. Invite students to follow along and look for the marriage preparation Elder Scott suggested. We should seek the Lord's confirmation in choosing a marriage partner How do you choose a marriage partner? Why shouldn't you simply pray and ask the Lord to show you whom to marry? In selecting a spouse, why is it important to understand that the choice of whom to marry is ours to make? Ask a few students to take turns reading aloud the statements under the section \"We should seek the Lord's confirmation ...\" in the student manual. Help them understand that they have the responsibility to find someone with whom they can build a happy marriage. They must do all they can to make the proper choice of an eternal companion and shoud seek the Lord's confirmation in fasting and prayer. The proclamation on the family is a guide for assessing our attitudes and those of our future spouse Display a copy of \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World.\" Explain that this inspired proclamation can be a guide to assess our own attitudes and those of a future spouse. Ask several students to take turns reading aloud the following statements from the proclamation. Then discuss the questions that follow each statement. Y ou may also want to select other passages from the proclamation thatCHAPTER 11 53are especially suited to the needs of your students. Remind students that potential marriage partners should have similar views on these important issues. \"We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" Ensign orLiahona, Nov. 2010, 129). Why do you believe marriage is ordained of God? In what ways is the family important in Heavenly Father's plan for the eternal destiny of His children? \"All human beings\u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents. ... Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). How does knowledge of our first estate better enable us to understand the vital role of gender in the Lord's plan? \"Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). What qualities can we develop in ourselves and our families now that would be of eternal worth? How can frequent temple service help keep the ordinances and their importance fresh in our minds? \"We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). Why do you think the Lord commanded us to multiply and replenish the earth? \"We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). How does this statement regarding the sanctity of life address abortion generally?CHAPTER 11 54\"Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). How can this statement be used as a guide in selecting the person you will marry? As a husband or wife, what will you do to build and maintain your family life \"upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ\"? Ask a few students to take turns reading aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008), in which he prescribed a remedy to combat the destructive influences on families: \"As I look to the future, I see little to feel enthusiastic about concerning the family in America and across the world. Drugs and alcohol are taking a terrible toll, which is not likely to decrease. Harsh language, one to another, indifference to the needs of one another\u2014all seem to be increasing. There is so much of child abuse. There is so much of spouse abuse. There is growing abuse of the elderly. All of this will happen and get worse unless there is an underlying acknowledgment, yes, a strong and fervent conviction, concerning the fact that the family is an instrument of the Almighty. It is His creation. It is also the basic unit of society. \"I lift a warning voice to our people. We have moved too far toward the mainstream of society in this matter. Now, of course there are good families. There are good families everywhere. But there are too many who are in trouble. This is a malady with a cure. The prescription is simple and wonderfully effective. It is love. It is plain, simple, everyday love and respect. It is a tender plant that needs nurturing. But it is worth all of the effort we can put into it. \"Now, in closing, I see a wonderful future in a very uncertain world. If we will cling to our values, if we will build on our inheritance, if we will walk in obedience before the Lord, if we will simply live the gospel we will be blessed in a magnificent and wonderful w ay. We will be looked upon as a peculiar people who have found the key to a peculiar happiness\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Look to the Future,\" Ensign, Nov. 1997, 69). How will following the principles taught in the proclamation on the family help our homes become safe places for our families and fortifications against the temptations and sins of the world? A husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and their children How does loving and caring for each other help a husband and wife prepare for fatherhood and motherhood? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Boyd K. Packer (1924-2015) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:CHAPTER 11 55\"I believe in marriage. I believe it to be the ideal pattern for human living. I know it to be ordained of God. The restraints relating to it were designed to protect our happiness. \"I do not know of any better time in all of the history of the world for a young couple who are of age and prepared and who are in love to think of marriage . There is no better time because it is your time. \"I know that these are very troubled times. Troubles like we have now are very hard on marriages. \"Do not lose faith in marriage. Not even if you have been through the unhappiness of a divorce and are surrounded with pieces of a marriage that has fallen apart\" (Boyd K. Packer, \"Marriage,\" Ensign, May 1981, 15). Ask three students to take turns reading aloud the following statements from \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World.\" Then discuss the questions that follow each statement. \"Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). In what ways can we provide for our children's physical and spiritual needs? What are you doing now to prepare for the responsibilities of parenthood? \"Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer , repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). What can you do to ensure that those principles are a part of your marriage and family relationships? What are you willing to do to build a successful marriage? \"We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further , we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World,\" 129). What do you regard as the most serious threats to the family today? How can strengthening a family contribute to a stronger community and nation?CHAPTER 11 56Invite students to prayerfully ponder the qualities they desire in a spouse. Encourage them to set meaningful goals to become the kind of spouse that will always live up to the standards of \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World.\" Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to think of two families whom they admire. What qualities do they have that contribute to their success and happiness? In what ways are they different, and how are they similar? How do they respond to difficult situations? Invite students to interview one of the couples from these families to discover: What character traits they love about each other. A regular practice each has personally implemented that helps him or her be a better spouse. How, as a couple, they strengthen their faith. Ask students to write what they learn in their class notebooks or study journals and to add a paragraph describing what they plan to do to prepare for marriage or to become a better spouse.CHAPTER 11 57CHAPTER 12 Observing the Laws of Physical Health Introduction The Apostle Paul taught that our bodies are temples of God (see 1 Corinthians 3:16-17), but many people think and act otherwise. Living the Lord's law of health brings untold blessings. Help students understand how they can maintain and improve their health in a variety of ways. Examining healthful practices as well as the effects of harmful substances helps fortify our resolve to treat our bodies with reverence and respect. Principles to Understand Good health habits are important in living the gospel. The Word of Wisdom is an important part of the Lord's law of health. Proper diet, rest, and exercise provide significant health benefits. We must avoid substances and practices that are harmful to our bodies and minds. Teaching Suggestions Good health habits are important in living the gospel Display a few pictures of temples and discuss some of the beautiful features of the buildings and their grounds. Y ou may want to encourage students to write their responses to the following questions in their class notebooks or study journals: What and whom do these buildings represent? Why are these buildings so well cared for? In what way does the care of these buildings help those who attend feel the Spirit? Invite a student to read 1 Corinthians 3:16 aloud. In what ways can our bodies be compared to temples? Ask a student to read aloud the statement by President Thomas S. Monson under the section \"Good health habits are important ...\" in the student manual. Why is it important to balance both physical and spiritual needs? 58Invite students to share examples of health problems we cannot control. Ask two students to take turns reading aloud the following statement by President Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a former heart surgeon: \"For reasons usually unknown, some people are born with physical limitations. Specific parts of the body may be abnormal. Regulatory systems may be out of balance. And all of our bodies are subject to disease and death. Nevertheless, the gift of a physical body is priceless. Without it, we cannot attain a fulness of joy [see D&C 138:17]. \"A perfect body is not required to achieve a divine destiny. In fact, some of the sweetest spirits are housed in frail frames. Great spiritual strength is often developed by those with physical challenges precisely because they are challenged. Such individuals are entitled to all the blessings that God has in store for His faithful and obedient children [see Abraham 3:25-26]. \"Eventually the time will come when each 'spirit and ... body shall be reunited again in ... perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame' [Alma 11:43; see also Alma Then, thanks to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can become perfected in Him. \"How should these truths influence our personal behavior? ... \"We will regard our body as a temple of our very own [see 1 Corinthians 3:16]. We will not let it be desecrated or defaced in any way. We will control our diet and exercise for physical fitness\" (Russell M. Nelson, \"We Are Children of God,\" Ensign, Nov. 1998, 86-87). How can physical challenges help us develop spiritual strength? How can lack of concern for our physical health affect our potential? In what ways have good health habits helped you fulfill your daily responsibilities? The Word of Wisdom is an important part of the Lord's law of health Write Word of Wisdom on the board, and invite students to share what this phrase means to them. Why do you think the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom? (See D&C 89:4.) Make three columns on the board. Write one of the following words at the top of each column: warnings, recommendations, andpromises. Ask two students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 89:4-9 aloud. Invite students to list on the board the warnings the Lord gave, the recommendations He provided, and the promises He offered. To emphasize physical blessings of keeping the Word of Wisdom, invite a student to read aloud the first part of a story related by President James E. Faust (1920-2007) of the First Presidency. Then ask students the question that follows.CHAPTER 12 59\"When I was the president of the Cottonwood stake, one of our stake patriarchs was Dr. Creed Haymond. ... As a young man he was the captain of the University of Pennsylvania track team. In 1919 Brother Haymond and his team were invited to participate in the annual Inter-Collegiate Association track meet. The night before the track meet his coach ... instructed his team members to drink some sherry wine. In those days, coaches wrongly felt that wine was a tonic for muscles hardened through rigorous training. All the other team members took the sherry , but Brother Haymond refused because his parents had taught him the W ord of Wisdom. Brother Haymond became very anxious because he did not like to be disobedient to his coach. He was to compete against the fastest men in the world. What if he made a poor showing the next day? How could he face his coach?\" (James E. Faust, \"The Enemy Within,\" Ensign, Nov. 2000, 44-45). If you were Brother Haymond's friend, what would you counsel him to do? Ask another student to read aloud the rest of the story related by President James E. Faust: \"The next day at the track meet the rest of the team members were very ill and performed poorly or were even too sick to run. Brother Haymond, however , felt well and won the 100- and 220-yard dashes. His coach told him, 'You just ran the two hundred and twenty yards in the fastest time it has ever been run by any human being.' That night and for the rest of his life, Creed Haymond was grateful for his simple faith in keeping the Word of Wisdom\" (James E. Faust, \"The Enemy Within,\" 45). Would you view his decision to not partake of the wine any differently if he had done poorly and his team members had done well? Why or why not? Do we always see the positive results of our proper choices soon after we make them? What part does faith play in keeping commandments such as the Word of Wisdom? Ask a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 89:18-21 aloud. Invite students to list the blessings made possible by living the Word of Wisdom and keeping the commandments. Discuss each blessing, as appropriate. Proper diet, rest, and exercise provide significant health benefits Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Ezra Taft Benson (1899-1994), and invite students to listen for what he said we must do to stay healthy. \"The condition of the physical body can affect the spirit. That's why the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom. He also said that we should retire to our beds early and arise early (see D&C 88:124), that we should not run faster than we have strength (see D&C 10:4), and that we should use moderation in all good things. In general, the more food we eat in its natural state and the less it is refinedCHAPTER 12 60without additives, the healthier it will be for us. Food can affect the mind, and deficiencies in certain elements in the body can promote mental depression. A good physical examination periodically is a safeguard and may spot problems that can be remedied. Rest and physical exercise are essential, and a walk in the fresh air can refresh the spirit. Wholesome recreation is part of our religion, and a change of pace is necessary, and even its anticipation can lift the spirit\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \"Do Not Despair,\" Ensign, Nov. 1974, 66). Why would people be more capable of serving the Lord if they received sufficient rest? What spiritual benefits are there to wholesome recreation? Prepare the following survey for each student: Using a scale of 1 through 5, with 5 being the highest, rank yourself on each of the following statements: 1. My diet includes fruits, vegetables, and grains. 2. I exercise regularly. 3. I get adequate sleep most nights. 4. I am informed concerning common diseases and the cures that are available when needed. 5. I avoid practices and substances that are bad for my body and mind. 6. I strive to keep myself, my family, and my home clean and orderly. After students have completed the survey, ask them to discuss how improving performance on each item could affect their health. Encourage them to set reasonable goals that could improve their health and to record these goals in their class notebooks or study journals. In what way does exercise help us control our weight and maintain good health? Briefly remind students that exercise burns calories; helps us control our weight and reduce our blood pressure; strengthens muscles; reduces stress, tension, and fatigue; increases energy; and increases our mental and emotional well-being. Read the following statement by Elder J\u00f6rg Klebingat of the Seventy: \"Please use good judgment in what and especially how much you eat, and regularly give your body the exercise it needs and deserves. If you are physically able, decide today to be the master of your own house and begin a regular, long-term exercise program, suited to your abilities, combined with a healthier diet\" (\"Approaching the Throne of God with Confidence,\" Ensign orLiahona, Nov. 2014, 35). Encourage students to select an exercise that they could do over the next few months. Explain that they should set reasonable goals. They may even wish to share their goals with each other or work on them together. Making a chart toCHAPTER 12 61record their progress is also helpful. Another idea to help them stay motivated is to get a partner with whom to exercise. We must avoid substances and practices that are harmful to our bodies and minds How would you respond if you were a parent who had a child that said to you, \"It's my body and I can do what I want with it\"? Write the following equation on the board: Drugs = Addiction = Misery. Why will drug addiction not lead to happiness? How does improper drug use affect what people can accomplish with their lives? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Marvin J. Ashton (1915-94) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"I am thinking of a young husband and father who is participating in drug abuse . He stands to lose family, employment, personal pride, and his own life. His cries of 'I'm hooked' tug at the soul. The use of cocaine and other drugs causes those involved to become totally chained to their addiction. Those who peddle drugs not only provide chains for others, but shackle themselves with the weights of unrighteousness as well. To those not involved, avoid drugs in any form with all of your might. To those involved, seek help to remove the chains that will drag you down and smother you. Drugs are not a 'quick fix.' They are a quick exit through a door which too often swings only one way\u2014toward heartache and self-destruction. \"Believe me when I tell you that some of the saddest sights I have ever witnessed in my life are people living with drug addiction. They are prisoners within their own bodies. Many feel totally helpless, dependent, and desperate. But none should feel hopeless. Lift those chains and fight back for personal dignity, peace, and purpose. Anyone who tells you drug use is the 'fun' way is a liar\" (Marvin J. Ashton, \"Shake Off the Chains with Which Ye Are Bound,\" Ensign, Nov. 1986, 15). What would you say to people who claim that their drug addictions only hurt themselves? How can a drug addiction destroy a person's family? What are some steps a person can take to become free from an addiction? Ask half of the class to read the statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley under the section \"We must avoid substances ...\" in the student manual and the other half to read the statement by President Boyd K. Packer under the same section in the student manual. Invite each group to teach the other group what they learned from their statement. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to monitor their eating habits for a week and determine if they are eating well-balanced meals. 2. Invite students to begin an exercise routine if they do not already have one.CHAPTER 12 62CHAPTER 13 Facing the Challenges of Life Introduction Challenges and trials are part of our mortal probation. Faithfully coping with life's difficulties can become opportunities for us to grow spiritually. Help students understand that with the Savior's help we can have peace during our trials (see John 16:33). Elder Neal A. Maxwell (1926-2004) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught that adversity is to be endured and that we are to learn from it: \"Real storm fronts do pass turbulently through our lives, but they do not last forever. We can learn the important difference between passing, local cloud cover, and general darkness\" (Lord, Increase Our Faith [1994], 43). Principles to Understand Adversity is part of our mortal experience. The challenges of mortality can help us grow. Maintaining faith in Jesus Christ helps us solve problems and overcome adversity. We must endure to the end. Teaching Suggestions Adversity is part of our mortal experience Ask students how they would complete the following sentence: \"My life will be easier when I finally ____________________.\" Remind them that it is common to hope that life could be simple and pleasant, y et for many, life is difficult. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Boyd K. Packer (1924-2015) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"We will not as a people, as families, or as individuals be exempt from the trials to come. No one will be spared the trials common to home and family, work, disappointment, grief, health, aging, ultimately death\" (Boyd K. Packer, \"The Cloven Tongues of Fire,\" Ensign, May 2000, 8). Explain that three categories in which trials can be placed are: 631. Those brought on by our own mistakes. 2. Those imposed upon us because of others. 3. Those that are just a part of mortal life. Invite students to share examples from any of the three categories. Remind students that they should not share experiences that are too personal or private. Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008), and invite students to listen for how we should respond to our trials: \"I have enjoyed these words of Jenkins Lloyd Jones, which I clipped from the newspaper some years ago. Said he: ... \"'Anyone who imagines that bliss ... is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed. \"'[The fact is] ... most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. ... \"'Life is like an old-time rail journey\u2014delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. \"'The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride' (\"Big Rock Candy Mountains,\" Deseret News, 12 June 1973, A4)\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"A Conversation with Single Adults,\" Ensign, Mar. 1997, 60). Ask two students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 and 136:31 aloud. Y ou may want to suggest that students consider marking the phrase in each verse that indicates why the Lord allows trials in the lives of His children. Invite them to list in their class notebooks or study journals some of the trials they have faced. How have you become a better person as a result of your trials? Show some sandpaper and a piece of wood. While sanding the wood, ask the following questions: What value can this rough paper have? What can sanding this wood be compared to in our lives? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Neal A. Maxwell: \"In life, the sandpaper of circumstances often smooths our crustiness and patiently polishes our rough edges. There is nothing pleasant about it, however. And the Lord will go to great lengths in order to teach us a particular lesson and to help us to overcome a particular weakness, especially if there is no other way\" (Neal A. Maxwell, Notwithstanding My Weakness [1981], 67-68). How can our trials smooth us and prepare us for eternal life?CHAPTER 13 64 How does our attitude make a difference as we face the challenges of mortality? The challenges of mortality can help us grow Ask a student who is physically able to come to the front of the class and do ten push-ups. Then ask another student to stand up and do the hand and arm motions of a push-up in the air. How is resistance an important factor for muscle growth? In what ways can this be compared to spiritual growth? Help students understand that life's trials often provide the resistance by which we can increase our strength as Latter-day Saints. Write the following sentences on the board: Stepping-stones or stumbling blocks? Trials can polish. Afflictions can be divine chastening. Invite three students to take turns reading aloud the statements by Elder John B. Dickson, Elder Richard G. Scott, and Elder Neal A. Maxwell under the section \"The challenges of mortality ...\" in the student manual. Ask students to explain how the sentences on the board relate to each statement. What are the most typical challenges that young people encounter? What have you found to be the most helpful responses to these kinds of challenges? In what ways have your difficulties helped you become a better person? Maintaining faith in Jesus Christ helps us solve problems and overcome adversity Invite students to think about a time when they faced overwhelming obstacles and were not certain what to do. Then ask them to name which of the following questions are most conducive to growth during serious trials and why: Why does this have to happen to me? What can I learn from this experience? Is there anything I should change about myself? Why do I have to suffer this now? Have I done anything to cause this? How has the Lord blessed me and helped me through past trials? Invite a student to read 2 Kings 6:14-15 aloud and look for the question Elisha's servant asked. Then ask another student to read verses 16-17 aloud.CHAPTER 13 65 What great lesson did Elisha teach his servant about facing adversity and trials? (See verse 16.) What did Elisha know that his servant did not know? (See verse 17.) How do you think the young servant felt when he was able to see the horses and chariots of fire? How can we apply this story to our own lives? Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"In the gospel of Jesus Christ you have help from both sides of the veil and you must never forget that. When disappointment and discouragement strik e\u2014and they will\u2014you remember and never forget that if our eyes could be opened we would see horses and chariots of fire as far as the eye can see riding at reckless speed to come to our protection. They will always be there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham's seed\" (Jeffrey R. Holland, \"For Times of Trouble,\" New Era, Oct. 1980, 15). Why is it important to remember that when we are following gospel principles the \"armies of heaven\" will support us? We must endure to the end Assign three students to take turns reading the following three scriptures aloud and to share what they teach about enduring to the end: 2 Nephi 31:20; Doctrine and Covenants 24:8; 121:7-8. Explain that we must never stop trying when problems and their attendant pains multiply. We can draw strength from the Lord, knowing that uncertainty about our problems is part of our test in mortality. We demonstrate our faithfulness and love of the Lord by living gospel principles while facing our unexpected challenges. Enduring to the end is not just sitting through the difficult parts of life. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder Neal A. Maxwell: \"Since there was no exemption from suffering for Christ, how can there be one for us? Do we really want immunity from adversity? Especially when certain kinds of suffering can aid our growth in this life? To deprive ourselves of those experiences, much as we might momentarily like to, would be to deprive ourselves of the outcomes over which we shouted with anticipated joy when this life's experiences were explained to us so long ago, in the world before we came here. \"Life is a school in which we enrolled not only voluntarily but rejoicingly; and if the school' s Headmaster employs a curriculum\u2014proven, again and again on other planets, to bring happiness to participants\u2014and if we agreed that once we were enrolled there would be no withdrawals, and also to undergo examinations that would truly test our ability and perceptivity, what would an experienced Headmaster do if, later on, there were complaints? Especially if, in His seeming absence, many of the school children tore up their guiding notebooks and demandedCHAPTER 13 66that He stop the examinations since these produced some pain? ... One learns by taking the full course!\" (Neal A. Maxwell, All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience [1979], 26-27). Ask a student to read aloud the fifth verse of the hymn \"How Firm a Foundation\" (Hymns, no. 85). Invite students to listen for what it teaches about adversity. Y ou may want to sing the hymn as a class. When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply. The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Ask students to think of two people they know who have endured many trials in their lives and, if possible, to ask those people how they grew from their experiences. Encourage students to express their gratitude to those people and to convey their feelings and admiration for what they shared. Tell them to be prepared to share in the next class any insights they gained about how to endure well the challenges we often face.CHAPTER 13 67CHAPTER 14 Honoring Covenants Introduction Making and keeping covenants is an essential part of the plan of salvation. As we strive to reach our divine potential, we must receive the ordinances and covenants of the gospel through those who hold the proper priesthood authority. Help students understand that though we live in a world where keeping promises is often disregarded, the Lord expects us to keep promises and blesses those who are willing to make and keep covenants with Him. When we make and keep covenants with the Lord and endure to the end, we receive the promise of eternal life. Principles to Understand A covenant is a sacred promise between God and His children. By honoring our covenants we can fulfill our divine potential. Priesthood authority is necessary to receive the covenants and ordinances of salvation. Honoring our covenants prepares us to receive eternal life. Teaching Suggestions A covenant is a sacred promise between God and His children Show a marriage certificate, a wedding ring, or a wedding pictur e. Ask what the object represents. What promises are made between two individuals when they get married? What blessings can come to them when they keep these promises? What will be lost if they do not keep their covenants? Write covenant on the board. Ask students what the word means. Invite a student to read aloud the statement from the Guide to the Scriptures under the section \"A covenant is a sacred promise ...\" in the student manual. Instruct students to write their answers to the following questions in their class notebooks or stud y journals: What are some of the covenants you have made? 68 How are words such as promises, contracts, andcommitments related to covenants? Who is affected when covenants are not kept? In what ways are the covenants we make with God different than agreements we make with each other? What preparation should precede gospel covenants? Explain that covenants are two-sided. Ask a student to read aloud the explanation by President Russell M. Nelson under the section \"A covenant is a sacred promise ...\" in the student manual. Write the following scripture references on the board. Invite three students to read them aloud. Then discuss with students what they learn about covenants from each scripture. Mosiah 18:13 Doctrine and Covenants 42:78 Doctrine and Covenants 101:39 Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President James E. Faust (1920-2007) of the First Presidency: \"Covenants are not simply outward rituals; they are real and effective means of change. 'Being born again, comes by the Spirit of God through ordinances' [Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (2007), 95]. We should always honor and keep sacred the saving covenants we make with the Lord\" (James E. Faust, \"Search Me, O God, and Know My Heart,\" Ensign, May 1998, 17). How can keeping covenants help you resist temptation? By honoring our covenants we can fulfill our divine potential Ask students to sing the first verse of \"I Am a Child of God\" (Hymns, no. 301). What important lessons do we learn from this song? Invite two students to take turns reading Abraham 3:22-26 aloud. Then discuss the following questions: What did Abraham learn about his potential? What does this help us understand about ourselves? Ask two students to read aloud the following statements by President Spencer W. Kimball (1895-1985):CHAPTER 14 69\"Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. ... You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles!\" (Spencer W. Kimball, \"The Role of Righteous Women,\" Ensign, Nov. 1979, 102). \"We made vows, solemn vows, in the heavens before we came to this mortal life. ... \"We have made covenants. We made them before we accepted our position here on earth. \"Now we made this commitment, '... all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us.' We committed ourselves to our Heavenly Father, that if He would send us to the earth and give us bodies and give to us the priceless opportunities that earth life afforded, we would keep our lives clean and would marry in the holy temple and would rear a family and teach them righteousness. This was a solemn oath, a solemn promise\" (Spencer W. Kimball, \"Be Ye Therefore Perfect\" [devotional address at the Salt Lake Institute of Religion, Jan. 10, 1975], 2). How can understanding that we made covenants in our premortal life influence our decisions here in mortality? How can making covenants help us live up to our potential? Priesthood authority is necessary to receive the covenants and ordinances of salvation Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008). Ask students to listen for what he said the \"qualification of eligibility\" is. \"The Lord has given [the priesthood] to men who are considered worthy to receive it, regardless of station in life, the color of their skin, or the nation in which they live. It is the power and the authority to govern in the affairs of the kingdom of God. It is given only by ordination by the laying on of hands by those in authority to do so. The qualification for eligibility is obedience to the commandments of God. \"There is no power on the earth like it. Its authority extends beyond life, through the veil of death, to the eternities ahead. It is everlasting in its consequences\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"The Cornerstones of Our Faith,\" Ensign, Nov. 1984, 52-53). What are priesthood keys? Share the following explanation about priesthood keys:CHAPTER 14 70\"Keys are the right of presidency, or the power given to man by God to direct, control, and govern God's priesthood on earth. Priesthood holders called to positions of presidency receive keys from those in authority over them. Priesthood holders use the priesthood only within the limits outlined by those who hold the keys. The President of the Church is the only person on earth who holds and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys\" (Guide to the Scriptures, \"Keys of the Priesthood,\" scriptures.lds.org). Invite a few students to take turns reading Doctrine and Covenants 132:7-14 aloud. What promises and warnings are found in these verses? Ask a student to read Doctrine and Covenants 138:58 aloud. How can vicarious ordinances affect those who have died? Honoring our covenants prepares us to receive eternal life How would you feel if you paid for one horse and ended up being given a whole herd? How is this like the blessings God gives His children? Draw two columns on the board. Label one Ordinances and the other Promises. List the following ordinances in the \"Ordinances\" column: baptism, sacrament, priesthood, temple endowment, temple marriage. Invite several students to take turns reading aloud the following scripture references listed with the ordinances. Ask students to look for the promises we make, and list the promises in the \"Promises\" column on the board. Help students understand why receiving ordinances and making covenants is an important part of their lives. Y ou may want to invite them to complete this exercise in their class notebooks or student journals so they can refer to it later. Baptism. Read Mosiah 18:8-10 and Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. (We promise \"to bear one another's burdens,\" \"to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places,\" to \"serve [God] and keep his commandments,\" to repent, to \"take upon us the name of Jesus Christ,\" and \"to serve him to the end.\") Sacrament. Read Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79. (We partake of the sacrament in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and we renew the promises we made at baptism. Among those promises are to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, to always remember Him, to keep His commandments, and to be witnesses of Him to show that we remember Him.) Priesthood. Read Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-42 and 121:34-36. (Those who receive the priesthood promise to magnify their priesthood callings, obey the commandments, and live by every word of God [see Elder Carlos E. Asay, \"The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood,\" Ensign, Nov. 1985, 43-45].) Temple endowment and temple marriage. Share the following statement by Elder James E. Talmage (1862-1933) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. (Be cautious about discussing the promises we make in the temple endowment in more detail than that given in Elder Talmage's statement.)CHAPTER 14 71\"The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth and the uplifting of the [human] race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth; and to seek in every w ay to contribute to the great preparation that the earth may be made ready to receive her King,\u2014the Lord Jesus Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each obligation a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the faithful observ ance of the conditions\" (James E. Talmage, The House of the Lord [1968], 84). Share your testimony of the great opportunity and blessing it is to receive ordinances and make covenants with the Lord. Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to ponder the covenants they have made thus far in their lives. Recommend that they ask the Lord during their prayers and their next sacrament meeting what He would have them do to honor and magnify the covenants they have made.CHAPTER 14 72CHAPTER 15 Serving One Another Introduction Service is an important part of our eternal progression. We grow by serving others and by allowing others to serve us. Encourage students to plan for a lifetime of meaningful service, and help them understand that they should not feel guilty or ashamed about receiving help. Those who are served go on to serve others in many different ways. Principles to Understand The Lord's servants and the scriptures teach us to serve each other. Everyone needs help at some time. We can serve each other in many different ways. Serving each other should be a lifetime pursuit. Teaching Suggestions The Lord's servants and the scriptures teach us to serve each other Tell students the following story: Andrew was a popular athlete in his school. He was also somewhat proud of his accomplishments. One day his bishop asked him to spend two hours a week helping at a nearby orphanage. He was upset by his bishop's request. Ask students to use the study helps in their scriptures to find verses they could share with Andrew regarding his bishop's request for his service. Invite several students to share a scripture they found and to explain why they feel it applies to Andrew. Ask several students to read aloud the statements by General Authorities under the section \"The Lord's servants and the scriptures teach us ...\" in the student manual. Invite students to find principles and ideas they could share that would also be relevant to the bishop's request. In what ways might Andrew grow from this experience? Of what value might his service be to those in the orphanage? Why do you think the subject of service is mentioned frequently in the scriptures and by the Lord's servants? In what ways does serving others draw you closer to the Savior? 73Everyone needs help at some time Share the following story: Cinthia was always available to help others. Nearly everyone in her ward had received her help at some time. She seemed to know when people needed something even before they told anyone. One day she fell down some stairs while helping another family clean their home. She br oke her leg and was placed in a full-length leg cast for several months. The many people she had helped gathered around her and offered to help by serving her. To their surprise, she refused to allow them to help. Ask students to discuss this situation and the advice they would offer to Cinthia and those in her ward. Invite students to share who they think might need the service or strength we can offer. List students' responses on the board. The list might include the following: The sick The lonely The sad The widowed The hungry The poor Newly-called missionaries Parents with young children Single parents Children who are fatherless or motherless Those suffering the effects of sin Explain that we sometimes look for opportunities to serve others when those who have the greatest needs are within the walls of our own home. Why do we sometimes overlook the needs within our own families? Ask a student to read aloud the excerpt from \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\" under the section \"Everyone needs help at some time\" in the student manual. What does the proclamation on the family teach about service? What reasons do we sometimes give for not serving our family? Invite students to share examples of times they served members of their family and how they felt about serving them. Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008):CHAPTER 15 74\"We are prone to speak of large numbers such as the total membership of the Church. But we must never forget that we are all individuals with our own needs and problems, our own hopes and dreams, our own faith and convictions. Some are strong, some weak, but we all try. We have problems to deal with\u2014they are serious and difficult. We need one another to build and strengthen each other. We must never lose sight of the fact that we are to 'succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees' (D&C 81:5)\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"The Work Moves Forward,\" Ensign, May 1999, 5). How do you feel when you receive needed help? Why is it important to be humble enough not only to frequently give service but to receive it when we need it? We can serve each other in many different ways The miracles Jesus performed exemplify acts of service. Write the following scripture references on the board, leaving out the phrases in parentheses. Divide the references among class members. Instruct students to silently read their assigned scripture and then write on the board next to the scripture reference a brief description of the service the Savior rendered. (Depending on the size of your class, you may need to add to the list or use fewer references.) Matthew 8:1-3 (healed a leper) Matthew 9:27-31 (gave blind men their sight) Matthew 14:16-21 (fed a multitude of people) Mark 1:23-26 (cast out an unclean spirit) Mark 2:5 (forgave sins) Luke 7:11-17 (raised a widow's dead son) John 2:1-10 (turned water into wine for wedding guests) John 4:46-54 (healed a nobleman's son) Disuss the following questions: What are some acts of service we can perform for others? What are some acts of service we can give to God? (After responses, invite a student to read Mosiah 2:17 aloud if it was not mentioned.) How important is our attitude when giving service? Why? The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has become internationally recognized for its humanitarian efforts. Invite a student to read aloud the following statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley:CHAPTER 15 75\"[In the Church] will be found hundreds of thousands of men, from all honorable walks of life, endowed with authority to act in the name of God and obligated under the very nature of the sacred gift each has received to strengthen and assist one another. ... \"This is one of the great purposes of quorum organization in the priesthood of the Church\u2014to bring an awareness of the needs of others and an opportunity and a vehicle to strengthen one another\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"What Will the Church Do for You, a Man?\" Ensign, July 1972, 71). Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by Sister Mary Ellen Smoot, who served as Relief Society General President, to the women of the Church: \"I am constantly inspired by your faith, your goodness, and your desire to do what the Lord wants you to do. Thank you for your service. ... Everywhere I go, I see the fruits of Relief Society being manifest in the lives of the sisters of the Church. Each of us is an instrument in the hands of God. ... \" ... When we unitedly serve each other and all of our Father's children, we can be instruments in the hands of God, not only to relieve physical suffering but, more importantly, to succor those who are in need spiritually\" (Mary Ellen Smoot, \"We Are Instruments in the Hands of God,\" Ensign, Nov. 2000, 89, 91). In what ways can you and your family do more to help those in need? Invite several students to take turns reading Mosiah 4:16-27 aloud. Then discuss the following questions: What should our attitude be about \"impart[ing] of the substance that [we] have\" (verse 21)? Should we give money to everyone who asks for it? Are there times when other kinds of service would be more helpful? What should our attitude be if we \"have not and yet have sufficient\" (verse 24)? What does it mean to \"see that all these things are done in wisdom and order\" (verse 27)? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder H. Burke Peterson (1923-2013) of the Seventy: \"We have been taught in [the scriptures] that no matter how great and significant our mortal accomplishments, no matter how much was accomplished under our hand\u2014as a bishop, a clerk, a president, a teacher, or a parent\u2014unless we learn to exhibit charity, we are nothing. (See 1 Cor. 13:1-3.) All our good deeds will not weigh in our favor if charity is lacking. \"Charity is measured in several ways. Perhaps a supreme form of charity may be exhibited by one who withholds judgment of another's acts or conduct, remembering that there is only one who can look into the heart and know the intent\u2014and know the honest desiresCHAPTER 15 76found therein. There is only one whose right it is to judge the success of another's journey through life. Uncalled-for judgments or prejudiced feelings keep many from displaying a truly charitable attitude or a willingness to help those in need, even those in our own family circle\" (H. Burke Peterson, \"Our Responsibility to Care for Our Own,\" Ensign, May 1981, 81). Help students understand that we should find ways to help those in need that truly strengthen them. Y ou may want to review with students the principles in chapter 9, \"Becoming Self-Reliant in the Lord's Way.\" Serving each other should be a lifetime pursuit Invite students to think of a person they know personally whose life has been filled with service. Write on the board How they served. Without having students give the name of the person they are thinking about, ask students to share the kinds of service that person gives to others. List students' responses on the board. How does this person's service follow the principle taught in Matthew 6:3-4? According to Doctrine and Covenants 64:33, what does the Lord teach about small acts of service? What are some of the oldest people you know doing to help others? What does their example teach you about the importance of serving throughout our lives? Tell students that when some people are released from a calling that required great service, such as a mission, they mistakenly feel that because they have done so much they are entitled to rest from serving others. Why can this attitude be spiritually dangerous? Ask a student to read aloud the following statement by Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"To those of you who have already served [full-time missions], please remember that you were released from your missions but not from the Church. Y ou spent two years as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. We expect you to always look and act like one of His disciples. Look the part. Act the part. Don't follow worldly trends and fashions. ... The rules for happiness and success after your mission are pretty much the same as they were during your mission: pray hard, work hard, and be obedient\" (M. Russell Ballard, \"The Greatest Generation of Missionaries,\" Ensign orLiahona, Nov. 2002, 49). How is Elder Ballard's counsel applicable to all Latter-day Saints? Why must we continue to serve the Lord and His children throughout our lives? Suggested Student Assignments 1. Invite students to consider ways to help someone in their family, in their local Church congregation, and in their community during the coming week. AskCHAPTER 15 77them to think of a person in each of the three categories if possible. Invite students to write about their experiences in their class notebooks or stud y journals.CHAPTER 15 78 "}
