Forward- looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such words and terms of similar meaning i n connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the Market Abuse Regulations, UK Listing R ules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward- looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors should, however, consult any additional disclos ures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes and/or files with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All investors, wherever l ocated, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and investors are cauti oned not to place undue reliance on the forward- looking statements. Forward -looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factors that ar e beyond the Group's control or precise estimate. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this presentation, c ould cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward- looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 3.D 'Risk factors' in the Group's Annual Report on Form 20- F for FY 2017. Any forward- looking statements made by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the knowledge and information available to the Directors on the date of this presentat ion. A number of adjusted measures are used to report the performance of our business, which are non IFRS measures. These measures are defined and reconciliations to the nearest IFRS measure are available in our second quarter 2018 earnings release on page 39 and Annual R eport on Form 20- F for FY 2017. All expectations and targets regarding future performance should be read together with \"Assumptions related to 2018 guidance and 2016- 2020 outlook\" on page 40 of our second quarter 2018 earnings release.Cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements 2GSK has a strong presence and history of leadership in four major areas Leadership in Respiratory Medicine Leadership in VaccinesLeadership in HIV/AIDS Leadership in Global Health Science and partnership Innovation 3-44Driving our growth outlook beyond and themselves Source: \"Reinvent your business before it's too late\", Paul Nunes and Tim Breen, Harvard Business review, Jan- Feb 2011 The key is understanding what problem you are trying to solve, and what levers you have to engender the changeInnovation 53 Components to our new R&D approach Science Technology CultureX X The industry needs more innovative medicines for patients with real unmet needs.
