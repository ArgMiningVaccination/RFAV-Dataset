Children in the United States increasingly are at risk for health problems that are precipitated orexacerbated by social, community, and environmentalfactors. Currently, pediatricians are unable to sufficientlyaddress these health conditions without expanding their roles beyond that of providing health care to individualpatients. Thus, to improve child health, physicians mustwork within their communities to identify the needs ofthe population they serve and take appropriate action toinfluence the private and public policies that addressthese needs. Healthy People 2010 establishes a well-supported framework that confronts the social and com-munity factors that affect children's health and servesas a resource for community-minded pediatricians. Inaddition to Healthy People 2010, other successful initia- tives have been created by pediatricians, and they must be expanded if the pediatric community is to alleviatethe social, community, and environmental factors thatnegatively affect child health. Pediatrics 2005;115:1124- 1128; advocacy, child health, collaboration. As pediatricians enter the 21st century, it has become apparent that the face of child healthis rapidly changing and challenging the skills of those charged to protect it. Child health is becom-ing more dependent on social, community, and en- vironmental factors, which may cause various dis-ease states and impair functioning, place certainpopulations at greater risk for morbidity and mor-tality, and interfere with a pediatrician's ability topromote health and diagnose or treat disease ade-quately. Whereas the late 20th century witnessed the in- creasing demands of the \"new morbidity\" (ie, behav-ioral and emotional disorders, functional distress,learning disabilities, and educational needs), we arenow observing a \"millennial morbidity.\" 1Major life - style changes brought about by the technologic ad- vances of the 20th century are now exerting a signif- icant effect on the health of children for better and forworse. Mass media and environmental decay present new health and behavior risks for children as evi- denced by school violence, decreased physical activ-ity, and increased fast-food consumption among youth in the United States. At the same time, familiessuffer from new stresses caused by dynamicallychanging family configurations and worsening eco-nomic and social conditions that have increased child-poverty rates. 2Given the direct relationship between poverty and ill health in the United States and the fact that child poverty and deprivation are worsening in many parts of the country,3a decline in the health of a significant number of US childrenmay be forthcoming. Children deserve a chance for a healthy start in life; however, researchers across the country havedescribed many examples of the negative effect thatsocial and economic disparities and hardship exerton child health. Patients who are poor and medicallyunderserved and minorities experience significantlyworse health outcomes than those with higher socio-economic status, with health insurance, or who arewhite. In 2002, close to 900 000 children were deter-mined to be neglected or abused, resulting in nearly4 deaths per day nationwide. 4This is not surprising, given the fact that 20% of female heads of house- holds on welfare were abused in 1994 versus 1.5% of a comparable group of women who were not onwelfare, and female parents with low income showsigns of depression at 2 to 4 times the rate of thegeneral female population. 2Similarly, children who are poor suffer twice as much dental caries as their more affluent peers, and their disease is more likely to be untreated.5Significant racial disparities also exist. Black and Hispanic children are more likely to be underimmunized, become overweight, develop diabetes, become pregnant as teens, and suffer fromasthma than their white counterparts, and the mor-tality rate for black infants is twice that of whiteinfants. These disparities result from complex inter-actions among environmental factors, specific health behaviors, and differences in health care access and quality. 6 Although many surgical and medical advances have been achieved, they have yet to demonstratesignificant efficacy in alleviating many of the currentmajor causes of mortality among individuals /H1102125 years old: short gestation and low birth weight, un-intentional injury, violence and assault, and suicide. 7 Public health experts ascertain that social factorssuch as socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, andeducation are among the most important determi-nants of health throughout the course of life. 8,9 McKeown10and Szreter11argue that rising standards of living or public health initiatives were more in-From the *National Center for Primary Care, Morehouse School of Medi- cine, Atlanta, Georgia; and Department of Pediatrics, University of Roch-ester, Rochester, New York.Accepted for publication Dec 22, 2004.doi:10.1542/peds.2004-2825C No conflict of interest declared.Address correspondence to David Topa, MD, Care of Santina Tu, Depart-ment of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Box American Acad-emy of Pediatrics. 1124 PEDIATRICS Vol. 115 No. 4 April 2005 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from strumental in the significant decline in overall mor- tality in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries thanthe advent of vaccines and antibiotic therapy. It now seems that the next major advances in decreasing pediatric morbidity and mortality will require socialand public health policy changes as well as contin-ued scientific innovation. Many resources that our patients require are ra- tioned by a system that is not under a physician's direct control; rather, these resources fall within therealm of public or corporate policy. Although a pe-diatrician can write a prescription for an antibiotic,the pediatrician cannot write a prescription for 1 ofthe 9.2 million children (12.1%) who are uninsured. 12 Although a primary care physician can refer a pa- tient to a nutritionist, the healthy foods that arerecommended often cost more than junk food and may not be geographically or financially available. 13 Neonatologists make great strides in ventilatory sup- port, yet the nation's infant mortality rate wasranked 28th among industrialized countries in 1998. 14More effective medications are available to pulmonologists, yet poor environmental quality isresponsible for 25% of preventable illnesses. 9A sur - geon may be able to extract a bullet from a wound,but is unable to remove the victim from the environ- ment of failing schools, gangs, drugs, violence, andstruggling families that constitute the culture of pov-erty. 2Such obstacles to health require pediatricians to expand their roles to include that of advocate, not just for the individual but for the population of chil- dren as a whole. In addition to the needs of our patients, future workforce pressures also may require practitionersto expand their roles and areas of expertise. As theratio of children to general pediatricians decreases, 15 the field of pediatrics may need to redefine itself, placing more pediatricians in the role of political,social, or public health advocates for children and practicing community-oriented primary care 16(see also American Academy of Pediatrics policy state-ment \"The Pediatrician's Role in Community Pedi- atrics\" 17). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Healthy People 201018provides guidance for pe - diatricians who wish to become better advocates for the children of their communities. This broad-based collaborative effort among federal, state, and territo-rial governments, as well as hundreds of private,public, and nonprofit organizations, has set nationaldisease-prevention and health-promotion objectivesto be achieved by the end of this decade in the hopeof accomplishing its 2 goals of increasing quality of life and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities. Tenhigh-priority public health issues were chosen as indicators of the nation's health to focus efforts onimproving them (Table 1). These leading health in-dicators result from the combination of a vastamount of knowledge, collaboration, and commit-ment and were chosen for their ability to promoteaction. The status of each of the indicators dependson several factors such as information people haveabout their health and how to make improvements; behavioral factors; environmental, economic, and so-cial conditions; access to health care; and character-istics of the health care system. Pediatricians can play an integral role in achieving the goals set forth in Healthy People 2010. Many ofthe indicators have roots in childhood and pediatriccare. Each indicator depends on risk-taking behav-iors, the antecedents to many of which are framed inchildhood before the behaviors emerge in adoles-cence. These risk behaviors may then persist intoadulthood. For example, during childhood the ante-cedents of overweight and obesity (eating and activ-ity behaviors) are formed. 19Although the pedi - atrician may encourage increased activity to an overweight individual, if that person does not have a safe environment in which to exercise, little progresscan be achieved. Thus, action extending beyond ad- vocacy on behalf of the individual is required to ensure that safe environments that promote goodhealth are available. When working to improve children's environ- ments, it is important to look beyond air and waterquality. Pediatricians can work with communitymembers to identify the messages that their commu-nities are sending to children about their self-worth.A community in which the role models are few, cleanand safe play areas are rare, and vandalism anddereliction run rampant may lead to a state of hope- lessness and cause children to believe that they arenot worthy of a better environment or existence.Such hopelessness may contribute to poor academicperformance and risky behaviors. Children are veryaware of the risks and messages of their environment(as shown in Fig 1). This photograph is one of manytaken by sixth-grade students of a school that is inone of the poorest areas of Rochester, New York. Thechildren were asked to document by photograph andessay health risks that they see in their communityand thus provided a sobering view of the threats totheir well-being. Such projects may provide morecompelling information than any survey or focusgroup and should be embraced by physicians look-ing to help the children of a community. WHAT CAN A PEDIATRICIAN DO, AND HAS ANYONE DONE IT? The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step . Lao Tse20 Often, the most difficult aspect of advocacy lies in finding an issue about which one is passionate and taking the first steps to address the issue. Once goalshave been established and collaboration achieved,advocacy projects take on a life of their own. We encourage pediatricians to discover an issue of in-TABLE 1.

One may choose to advance aleading health indicator as it pertains to children. 21 However, successful advocacy often originates froma desire to fill a need witnessed within one's owncommunity. The advancement of pediatric knowl-edge originated from physicians recognizing, de-scribing, and treating patterns of medical and psy- chiatric disease. Likewise, pediatricians may identifyamong their patients patterns of poor health or func-tional impairment that may result from inadequatesocial, economic, or physical environments or poorpublic policy. In response, physicians may advocatefor their patients in a number of ways: by writing aletter to a legislator, composing an editorial piece,volunteering to work in a community clinic, educat-ing others in the community about the needs of itsmembers, serving on steering committees of commu-nity organizations, or running for political office. Many pediatricians already are involved in theircommunities and serve as effective advocates as in-dividuals, members of institutions, and members of national movements. On a national level, Action for Healthy Kids ad- dresses pediatric obesity, a health issue that is wideranging, touches nearly every community, and hasroots in behavior, public policy, education, and med-icine. 22Launched at a national Healthy Schools Sum - mit, the initiative has united pediatricians, family practitioners, school administrators, teachers, nutri- tionists, nurses, student organizations, parents, leg-islators, food-industry representatives, and research- ers in an effort to improve nutrition and physical activity in schools. By striving for schools that pro-vide a healthy environment in which children learnand participate in positive dietary and lifestyle be-haviors and practices, the organization works toeducate state and local leaders to enact curricularand environmental changes in schools. Action forHealthy Kids provides opportunities for advocacy atthe national, state, and local levels as well as in theoffice setting. Every state has a team of advocates, Fig 1. Abandoned houses: \"There is an abun- dance of abandoned houses in our neighbor- hood. There are so many abandoned houses be-cause landlords do not want to fix them. Thelandlords don't want to fix them because theywill just get broken again. Some people don'tcare about their houses. Abandoned houses areproblems in our neighborhood. A little girl fromour school was assaulted behind an abandonedhouse. Drug dealers come to abandoned housesto sell drugs. People have fights in abandonedhouses. Abandoned houses are often dangerous,because they are in neighborhoods where littlekids play and can get hurt. I would like to seepeople fix abandoned houses or knock themdown if they can't be fixed. I would like to seethis happen so there won't be as much trouble.Our neighborhood would be better and a saferplace if we didn't have so many abandonedhouses.\" Zondrea Capps, sixth-grade studentfrom Rochester on one of her neighborhood'sthreats to the well-being of children. 31(Photo - graph courtesy of Ms Capps.) 1126 EXPANDING ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN IN IMPROVING CHILD HEALTH at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from and physicians have played a key role in the estab- lishment of healthy schools. Providing evidence-based expertise, individual pediatricians have testi-fied to school boards about the importance ofphysical education and nutritious cafeteria food. They also have taken leadership roles within theircommunities, running for local school boards, andbringing health issues to the forefront of school pol-icies. The National Center for Primary Care, based at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia,likewise encourages individual physicians to im-prove community health. By establishing partner-ships with regional health care professionals, thecenter promotes research into primary care practices,education of primary care physicians, development of community programs, and analysis of health carepolicies related to primary care. Adopting a visionstatement of \"Optimal Health for All\u2014Our Passionand Unmet Need,\" the center uses a 3-dimensionalmodel that monitors disease states and prevalencein the community, facilitates behavioral and healthservices and laboratory investigations of the deter-minants of community health, and initiates environ-mental changes based on its research and surveil-lance efforts. By incorporating and coordinating theefforts of community physicians, the center is devel-oping primary care policies and practices to combatdisparities in health. Although institutions and national organizations may offer clearly defined opportunities for advocacy,many individuals effectively advocate on behalf ofchildren at a local level. The work of Burton 23in South Carolina exemplifies how an individual pedi- atrician identified and embraced the needs of hiscommunity and, in doing so, initiated a process bywhich he could ensure health care access for thou- sands of children. Similarly, the work of a pediatrician in training demonstrates how those with a minimal amount of time can make a difference in their community. Di-ana Kudes, MD, recently completed residency train-ing in pediatrics at the Golisano Children's Hospitalat Strong in Rochester. As an intern she recognizedthe inadequacy of mental health resources availablein the community. After enlisting the efforts of alocal community-based organization that providessupport to families of children with mental illnesses, Dr Kudes assessed the needs of families, local pri-mary care physicians, and residents concerning theavailability of mental health services. With the sup-port of the community-based organization, the ef-forts of the support staff of the department of pedi-atric's advocacy office, and a protected half-day permonth, she initiated several projects that benefitedthe children and child health care professionals ofthe greater Rochester area. Dr Kudes directed thecompilation of a practical mental health referralguide for local primary care professionals. Wishingto improve resident education, she established amental health elective and worked to increase resi-dent mental health experiences in the general curric-ulum. Finally, she served on a mental health taskforce that includes representatives from the healthinsurance industry and seeks to optimize the provi-sion of mental health services to those in the Roch-ester area. This task force has improved mentalhealth access by establishing a hotline that primarycare physicians can call during designated hours tospeak to a child psychiatrist about mental healthissues that their patients face. Most of the works cited in this article highlight collaboration as a key component to successful ad-vocacy. Just as pediatricians sought partnershipswith statisticians and epidemiologists to recognizepopulation-based patterns of diseases in the pastcentury, they now must reach out to educators, socialworkers, public servants, and politicians to eliminatethe inequalities and significant social and environ-mental risks that threaten the health of the nation'schildren. Our colleagues in the United Kingdomhave been successful in doing so, often following the lead of other advocacy organizations when appropri-ate. 24Health improvement is a shared responsibility of the federal government, states, localities, policy makers, health care professionals, business execu-tives, educators, community leaders, and the USpublic. 9Academic health centers and other health institutions should reach out and develop partner-ships with community organizations to promotehealth and fulfill their roles as \"health\" centers, asopposed to \"disease\" centers. 25Currently, on a na - tional and institutional level, the weight of funding and interest in research is concentrated on rare con- ditions and their cures, whereas social determinantsof health receive limited research funding or atten- tion. 8Our institutions should follow the lead of es - tablished academic-community partnerships and promote more social and community-based research and lobby local, state, and national government en-tities to embrace the knowledge gained from success- ful demonstration projects. Academic health centers and national health agencies should offer resourcesto individuals in their communities in the form ofmanpower, program-evaluation expertise, andgrant-development education and thus serve as \"ad-vocacy homes\" for the community. SEE ONE, DO ONE, TEACH ONE Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Margaret Mead26 We challenge pediatricians to recollect why they first chose to pursue a career in medicine and then pediatrics. Most will cite a genuine desire to help themost vulnerable members of our society who mayhave the most to gain from early intervention and prevention. Many reading this article likely haverealized that a child whom they help may grow up tomake the world a better place. From a medical stand-point, the field of pediatrics has made significantstrides in promoting the physical health of children.However, the World Health Organization has de-fined health as \"a state of complete physical, mental,and social well-being and not merely the absence ofdisease or infirmity.\" 27We live in a society that claims to cherish childhood while allowing the SUPPLEMENT 1127 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from abuse, molestation, incarceration, subjugation, segre- gation, and exploitation of children.28It is the re- sponsibility of pediatricians to use their significantprofessional capital 29to inspire their societies, gov- ernments, colleagues, and patients' families to en-sure that each and every child has an opportunity toenjoy good health. Such efforts should not precludededication to one's family and personal responsibil-ities but rather should be incorporated into eachperson's daily practice of pediatrics. Anyone who can learn the Krebs cycle can learn to be a child advocate. J. A. Paulson30 REFERENCES 1. Richmond J, Palfrey J.
