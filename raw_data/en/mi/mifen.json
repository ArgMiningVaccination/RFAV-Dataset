Knowledge of classic medicine formulas is the basis of TCM diagnosis and treatment and is the core of TCM inheritance. The large number and flexibility of medicine formulas make memorization difficult, and understanding their composition rules is even more difficult. The multifaceted and multidimensional properties of herbal medicines are important for understanding the formula; however, these are usually separated from the formula information. Furthermore, these data are presented as text and cannot be analyzed jointly and interactively. </p> </div><div class=\"section\"> <a class=\"named-anchor\" id=\"d3008084e227\"> <!-- named anchor --> </a> <h5 class=\"section-title\" id=\"d3008084e228\">Objective</h5> <p id=\"d3008084e230\">We aimed to devise a visualization method for TCM formulas that shows the composition of medicine formulas and the multidimensional properties of herbal medicines involved and supports the comparison of medicine formulas. </p> </div><div class=\"section\"> <a class=\"named-anchor\" id=\"d3008084e232\"> <!-- named anchor --> </a> <h5 class=\"section-title\" id=\"d3008084e233\">Methods</h5> <p id=\"d3008084e235\">A TCM formula visualization method with multiple linked views is proposed and implemented as a web-based tool after close collaboration between visualization and TCM experts.
