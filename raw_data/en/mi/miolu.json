An update was most recently presented to the Audit and Governance Committee in October 2020. 2.0 Strategic Risk and Opportunity Register - Monitoring Summary 2.1 Risk Champions have reviewed the strategic risks to identify those that could impact the work directed towards the recovery and reinstatement of council services, including ensuring safe systems of work for staff and customers and the recovery of the econo my. Risk owners have been asked to update current mitigation and action plans with the results presented today. 2.2 Attac hed to this report at Appendix B is the updated Strategic Risk and Opportunity Register. The Appendix offers additional information in cluding detail on Key Controls and Sources of Assurance and how progress against mitigation will be measured. 3.0 Headline Issues 3.1 Two strategic risks have a risk rating of Red, t hese relate to Finance and Education att ainment . Two further risks relating to the demands on Children's Social Care and the economic impact of COVID -19 have been reduced to an amber rating. Two new risks have been added to the register, these are; Risk number 16 - Failure to meet Carbon Reduction target to reach net zero by 2030, this risk has been rated amber. Mitigation includes actions within the Climate Emergency Action Plan and the City Carbon Reduction Plan. Risk number 17 - Risk of financial impact of delivering proposed changes to Waste Services as set out in the Government's Draft Environment Bill. Risk number 15 relating to A dult Social Care provider or market failure has a new score of 16, up from 12, this because the implications of the risk being changed from 'moderate risk' to a 'major risk' for the Council. The risk does however retain the amber rating. Increasing demands on services for care and hospital pressures was the main consideration when re -scoring the risk. 4.0 Risk update table PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 5 of 15 OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner 1 The Council's expenditure exceeds the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period (2020 - 2022) Investment in income earning assets. Ambitious capital programme and strategic investments from income earning assets. Cross department s trategy on grant maximisation and savings delivery. Regular review of M edium Term Financial Plan and resource position. 20 Red Red since Feb 2020 Brendan Arnold 2 Failure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services Additional social work capacity agreed to support effectively delivery of casework. Fostering Project Delivery Plan in place High cost placement review supported by named Service Manager Adolescent Support Team reunificatio n and edge of care service supporting over 60 young people at anyone time. Ongoing rigour in decision making to manage demand via Placement Panel which takes place weekly and overseen by a dedicated service manager with responsibility for reducing costs o f individual placements and ensuring timely step down. Ensuring action plan milestones are reached via monthly monito ring at Programme Board/Finance Directorate Management Team meetings . All delivery plans have been reviewed and progress is being achieved to mitigate delays caused by COVID -19 response. 15 Amber Alison Botham 3 Insufficient pupil attainment to achieve economic / quality of life outcomes across secondary cohort Plymouth Education Board (PEB) (and sub groups) is being reviewed to strengthen education partnership. Strengthen School Causing Concern procedure - New data tracking process has been put in place with regular meetings for officers to discuss identified schools. A clear criteria has been developed and is being shared with schools. 20 Red Red since July 2020 Alison Botham PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 6 of 15 OFFICIAL School improvement work w ill create a partnership of distinct interventions to drive improvement and raise achievement. Cause for concern meetings. Inclusion Strategy Board as an added strand of PEB work. Proposed Inclusion Mark for the City to celebrate inclusion. The work of t he Plymouth Commission has been developed into a D epartment for Education piloted place -based initi ative for school improvement. Schools are being offered a catch up premium of \u00a380 per pupils for most schools, to assist with programmes of learning to suppo rt pupils who require additional support. Inclusion Strategy Board has been established to scrutinise and monitor the city's inclusion projects and actions with a shared aim. Good buy in and commitment from school leaders and M ulti Academy Trust CEOs. 4 Insufficient economic performance to sustain the City's economy as a result of the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic The impact of COVID -19 on the economy has been sharp and has affected different sectors of the economy in different ways. We are focussing, through Resurgam, on 6 areas to help our economy to recover, to protect local jobs and to support our communities. These are: Spend 4 Plymouth - A massive focus on local procurement for local j obs. Build 4 Plymouth - An ambitious capital programme and economic stimulus to support construction jobs, building a better and greener Plymouth. Skills 4 Plymouth - Extensive new support for young people and retraining our workforce for future j obs through our skills launch pad. City Centre Renaissance programme - support for our city centre and a regeneration plan. Resurgam Beacons - A focus on our future. We will seek to create new jobs in the Blue and green economy. That is our amazing marine sector and a new green deal for jobs. Sector Action Plans - a bespoke package of interventions lead by the private sector for our 11 key sectors, building on our Resurgam plans and innovating and collaborating together though our newly establish ed Sector Hub. Supporting our sectors whether they are in critical shock, stable, or capable of high growth. These sectors are: o Construction and The Built Environment o Creative Industries 16 Amber Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 7 of 15 OFFICIAL o Digital o Defence o Health and Care o Fishing o Manufacturing o Marine o Retail o Tourism and Hospitality o Transport and Distribution We have also established the cross cutting theme of inclusive growth. Our aim is to 'build back better' growing a prosperous economy that reduces inequality, is sustainable and trul y serves the wellbeing of all the people of Plymouth. 5 Ongoing COVID -19 rates ( with historically high current infection rates ) affect city's recovery / reset plans. It is not yet clear what mitigations will be needed for us to live wi th COVID -19. (1) Vaccination programme continues, with additional work to reduce health inequalities (2) L ocal Outbreak Management Plan revised and includes ability to respond to new variants of concern, as well as various mitigations which wil l help the city to live with COVID -19 such as asymptomatic testing . 16 Amber Ruth Harrell 6 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities Persistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The public health team and partners continue to work with employers (year one focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You campaign across the cit y. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the city as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The focus on arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations) will continue throughout 2020 and 2021. The Thrive Plymouth Network will continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure delivery of the prog ramme. As a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, the Public Health Team is developing a framework which provides an approach to assessing the broad health and wellbeing impacts and resulting inequalities on the population of Plymouth as a result of COVID -19. The work will aim to 16 Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 8 of 15 OFFICIAL bring partners together via the Health and Wellbeing Board to contribute to a discussion on how these impacts can be mitigated. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross -party Child Poverty Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people will be carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the O ffice of the Director of Public Health and the Public Health Team in particular is now to try to prevent a resur gence of COVID -19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. 7 The Council having insufficient workforce capacity and resilience to deliver the required range of services to meet statutory obligations and administration priorities Develop online training programmes Implementation of 'The Way We Work' programme (technology, information management, accommodation) to enable the right conditions for success.

One of the earliest tasks will be to flesh out a programme, having regard to these dates. However, it can be anticipated that the work would need to cover the following basic elements: 1. Documentation of the context for a new waste plan - e.g. all legal and policy drivers as well as the local and regional context 2. Review of high level policy aspirations - including the Plymouth Plan policy - to ensure it continues to work for the current context 3. Evidence base review - waste arising forecasts for the period to 2041 4. Review of effectiveness of current approaches and plans for managing these new waste management demands and challenges into the future 5. Identification of strategic alternatives for waste management, including site specific implications of these alternatives and using the Joint Local Plan (JLP) sustainability framework model to ensure that this is robust and will be found sound when tested at JLP public examination 6. Identification of preferred options/s for waste management - with identification of specific sites where needed 7. Draft plan for waste published 8. Draft waste policies of JLP published 9. Plan for waste approved 10. JLP review tested through its various statutory stages 12 Amber (New Risk) PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 12 of 15 OFFICIAL 5.0 Conclusion and Summary 5.1 The Council's success in dealing with the risks that it faces can have a major impact on achievement of key priorities, objectives and ultimately therefore, the level of service to the community. 5.2 Risk management is formally aligned and working alongside other compliance functions which helps to promote a joined -up approach to all aspects of governance. 5.3 This aligned approach acts as an effective early warning system for the recording, monitoring and management of risks that th reaten the delivery of the Council's strategic objectives and plans. 5.4 The next formal review of the Strategic Risk and Opportun ity Register will take place in August 2021. PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 13 of 15 OFFICIAL 6.0 Scoring Guidance and Risk Matrix To ensure that a consistent scoring mechanism is in place across the Co uncil, risks are assessed using the agreed criteria for likelihood and impact. Risk scoring guidance is shown below: - Score Likelihood Threat / Risk 5 Almost Certain (80-100%) Is expected to occur in most circumstances Will undoubtedly happen, possibly frequently e.g. annually or more frequently Imminent/near miss For health and safety risk - one in 100 chance of the adverse event happening 4 Likely (50-80%) Will probably occur in many circumstances Will probably happen, but not a persistent issue e.g. once in three years Has happened in the past For health and safety risk - one in 1000 chance of the adverse event happening 3 Possible (25-50%) Could occur in certain circumstances May happen occasionally, e.g. once in 10 years Has happened elsewhere For health and safety risk - one in 10,000 chance of the adverse event happening 2 Unlikely (10-25%) May occur only in exceptional circumstances Not expected to happen, but is possible e.g. once in 25 years Not known in this activity For health and safety risk - one in 100,000 chance of the adverse event happening 1 Rare (0-10%) Is never likely to occur Very unlikely this will ever happen e.g. once in 100 years For health and safety risk - one in a million chance of the adverse event happening Risk Impact (Severity) Score Impact Threat / Risk 5 Catastrophic Risk Risks which can have a catastrophic effect on the operation of the Council or service. This may result in critical financial loss, severe service disruption or a severe impact on the public. Examples: - Unable to function without the aid of government or other external Agency Inability to fulfil obligations Medium - long term damage to service capability Severe financial loss - supplementary estimate needed which will have a catastrophi c impact on the Council's financial plan and resources are unlikely to be available Death (single or multiple) or work related diagnosis leading to death Adverse national publicity - highly damaging, severe loss of public confidence Significant public inte rest Litigation certain and difficult to defend Breaches of law punishable by imprisonment Very significant exposure of public funds with funding being managed across organisations and complex reporting Very complex stakeholder community with new partnersh ips, collaborations and suppliers/stakeholder environment volatile or with significant external change factors PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 14 of 15 OFFICIAL Extensive use of leading edge, novel or innovative technology which requires specialist management and external audit 4 Major Risk Risks which can have a major effect on the operation of the Council or service. This may result in major financial loss, major service disruption or a significant impact on the public. Examples: - Significant impact on service objectives Short -medium term impairment to service capability Major financial loss - supplementary estimate needed which will have a major impact on the Council's financial plan Extensive injuries, major permanent harm, long term sick Permanent/significant disability Major adverse local publicity, major loss of confidence Litigation likely and may be difficult to defend Breaches of law punishable by fines or possible imprisonment 3 Moderate Risk Risks which have a noticeable effect on the services provided. Each one will cause a degree of disrupt ion to service provision and impinge on the budget. Examples: - Service objectives partially achievable Short term disruption to service capability Significant financial loss - supplementary estimate needed which will have an impact on the Council's financial plan RIDDOR (Reporting of injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences regulations) or major injury Medical treatment required, semi -permanent harm up to one year Some adverse publicity, needs careful public relations High potential for complaint , litigation possible Breaches of law punishable by fines only 2 Minor Risk Risks where the consequences will not be severe and any associated losses will be minor. As individual occurrences they will have a negligible effect on service provision. If acti on is not taken, then such risks may have a more significant cumulative effect. Examples: - Minor impact on service objectives No significant disruption to service capability Moderate financial loss - can be accommodated at head of service level Three day + injury First aid treatment, non -permanent harm up to one month Some public embarrassment, no damage to reputation May result in complaints/litigation Breaches of regulations/standards Budget within delegation 1 Insignificant Risk Risks where the consequences will not be severe and any associated losses will be relatively small. As individual occurrences they will have a negligible effect on service provision. If action is not taken, then such risks may have a more significant cumulative effect. E xamples: - Minimal impact, no service disruption Negligible impact on service capability Minimal loss - can be accommodated at senior technical accounting level PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Page 15 of 15 OFFICIAL First aid injury Unlikely to cause any adverse publicity, internal only Breaches of local proce dures/standards Budget within delegation and relatively small or within operational costs When assessing the risk, the highest measure identified in each table is the score taken to plot the risk level on the risk matrix. The risk ratings for each part of the assessment are multipli ed to give an overall ranking for each risk. The risk matrix uses a \"traffic light\" approach to show high (red), medium (amber) and low (green) risks.
