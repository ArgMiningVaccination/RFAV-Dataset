Integrative Chiropractic Clinic Offers Much more than back adjustments Focus on comprehensive care for your whole health We provide alternative medicine through the integration of acupuncture, chiropractic, individualized nutrition, and dietary recommendations along with various modalities to restore patient function, mitigate disability, and promote optimal health. We aren't just experts in addressing your neck and back pain; we are also experienced in dealing with a wide variety of health issues including fibromyalgia, head injury, infertility, surgical recovery, IBS, headaches, acne, frozen shoulder, pain management, smoking cessation, weight loss, colitis, digestive disorders, menstrual irregularities, sleep issues, allergies, and general fatigue. Attention to diet as an integral part of your whole health At Integrative Chiropractic Clinic, we use whole food and herbal supplements to aid in the optimal functioning of your body. There is a vast array of ways in which nutrition can affect your body's overall performance. A supplement to support gall bladder function may be all that is needed to address symptoms of acid reflux. A supplement to help metabolize sugar can aid in mitigating the effects of hypothyroidism. Eliminating dairy, corn, and sugar from your diet can be a key ingredient in addressing chronic inflammation. Most of us do not get the nutrients we need. Our eating habits are not always as they should be. We may eat too much-processed food or eat erratically. Stress can contribute to poor digestion. Our ability to absorb nutrients from our food can decline with age. Much of the food we eat is grown in depleted soil. Pollution and pesticides create an environment of toxicity that compromises our immune systems. High-quality care for all Our providers are compassionate and dedicated, as well as board-certified and licensed. Our doctors were recognized for Outstanding Achievement in Clinical Nutrition last year. Our goal is to promote and support overall health and wellness, treating the causes of patient issues rather than the symptoms. Our mission is to help as many people as possible to reach their maximum health potential. Contact us Thank you for your interest. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
