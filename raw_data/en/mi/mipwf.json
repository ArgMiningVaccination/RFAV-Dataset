The Healing Properties of Crystal Jewelry For centuries, crystals have been recognized for their healing properties, which stem from their natural and powerful vibrations. These vibrations assist in the realignment and recalibration of positive energies. The vibrations within healing crystals affect the natural vibrations in the human body and have the power to provoke lasting change. Many people utilize the power of crystals when they're looking to transform their energy to meet specific life goals or achieve enhanced healing standards. At Zen Jewelz, we provide customers with healing stone jewelry that promotes personal healing at all levels. This includes accessing energy related to hope, strength, courage, harmony, serenity, and love. We use healing crystals that are directly linked to luck, abundance, wealth, self-confidence, and spirituality, as well. While some of our crystals are designed for protection purposes, others promote fertility or help our customers to find a sense of inner peace. Whether you're on a journey of psychic development or are aiming to achieve new levels of success in life, crystal jewelry can help. Healing crystal labradorite jewelry is particularly powerful in this respect. Labradorite crystal jewelry not only raises vibrations in those who wear it, but it also works to open up potential on many levels. Labradorite crystal bracelets have been known to stimulate psychic gifts, clarify intuition, and promote the growth of spiritual awareness. Healing crystal labradorite bracelets can diminish feelings of fear, while enhancing a sense of strength and understanding of the self. It's considered to be a highly protective stone that's often turned to as a means of achieving stress relief. In addition to labradorite, amethyst is another crystal often selected for its unique healing properties. Amethyst is known for attracting positive energy that subsequently provides an energetic shield of protection. Some equate this energy to a bubble of spiritual light that surrounds the body. Individuals that opt for amethyst healing jewelry frequently do so in order to rid themselves of negative emotions and reduce symptoms related to anxiety and depression.
