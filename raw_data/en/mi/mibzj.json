Upon arriving in Cusco we were met by Janet and Jenny and both of them made us feel immediately welcome and part of the family. Throughout our time there Jenny was our on-hand guide (to put it lightly) to help with anything we needed. Janet was not on site however when we required something of her she always came through and helped us beyond our expectations. The time spent at Peru Shamans was unforgettable. Jenny, Maestro Lizardo and Fedelia collectively created an experience whilst there that was second to none. Their attention to detail and thoughtfulness was felt continuously. Maestro Lizardo remains a hero to me; his approach to his work and caring towards us made me fall in love with him. So, so kind and considerate and his laugh always made me laugh! Fedelia was so lovely and I regularly called her \"madre\" or \"abuela\" out of sheer respect for her nature as a mother and loving leader. Her being was motherly and made us both feel so at home. Her cooking is sensational!! If you are fortunate to experience her on site feel very privileged. Jaiver, our on-hand nurse always making sure we were medically fit and settled for our ceremonies; thank you. Thank you for escorting me to and from the restroom on many occasions and just looking after my wellbeing when I was so in need of such support. Jenny was everything. Absolutely incredible to us all throughout our stay. I couldn't imagine our time there without her. She is a credit to Peru Shamans and maybe even Peru as a whole! We absolutely loved Jenny. From her cooking to her exceptional English, her Incan massage, her love and care, everything she did was done so with coraz\u00f3n. A lifelong friend. We thoroughly loved our time there and were sad to leave and I remain sad as I write this in not being there in the flesh! If you are considering going to Peru and experiencing ayahuasca, look no further. You will be cared for, well kept, warmly welcome and safer beyond safe in their care. You will have an unbelievable experience, just like we did. 10/10!

Sep 2022 I had already booked most of our trip when I found Peru Shamans. Janet went above and beyond formatting a program for us and rebooking our Machu Picchu tickets, so we could go with Erich and Maestro Danilo for the crystal ceremony and tour. It was a magical experience. We began our trip with the water ceremony with Maestro Danilo and it was incredible. He is a gifted shaman and very special soul. I can't adequately put the ceremonies that we had with him into words. They were divine and I still feel the love that he poured into us. I also had a 1 day San Pedro ceremony with Maestra Lucia and Jenny. I will be forever grateful for our day in the dreamy place they took me too. I am still processing it I think. Janet and her team are kind, compassionate and trust worthy people; exactly what you need when exploring plant medicines and altered states of consciousness. I always felt in good hands and am incredibly grateful for the experiences they shared with us. I highly recommend Peru Shamans! I am so excited to go back to work with them again!

Sep 2022 Couples My husband and I did an ayahuasca retreat on a Saturday and a San Pedro retreat the next day. They were fantastic and life affirming. I have never done either one before and was a little nervous because I have heard stories of people having negative ayahuasca experiences in Peru. If you are looking to have this experience in Peru, please do yourself a favor and spend the money to work with Peru Shamans. I felt safe and cared for the whole time. Our translator and guide for the ayahuasca retreat, Jenny, was warm and caring and kept telling us, \"you are family now, treat this like your home.\" After the retreat, the shaman (who spoke no English and did ayahuasca with us) told my husband and I things about ourselves that he couldn't possibly have known, yet somehow picked up during the retreat. That's the magic of ayahuasca!! The San Pedro was a more mild experience but lasted a lot longer l, so keep that in mind if you do it. It took about 8 hours to fully wear off. Our guide and translator, Eric, was warm and friendly and we trekked all over outer Cusco to a few temples. If you are on the fence - just do it!!! It is an experience of a lifetime and Peru Shamans are the real deal. The San Pedro was a more mild experience but lasted a lot longer l, so keep that in mind if you do it.

Sep 2022 I booked the 5 day Ayahuasca and Machu Picchu retreat and added the one day San Pedro Sound Healing ceremony. This experience absolutely changed my life. I am 100% satisfied and believe I made the correct choice by booking with Peru Shamans. Janet and her team curated an absolutely perfect, safe, caring, and loving experience for me. The retreat center is relatively new and very clean, comfortable, and modern. Their tradition, ceremonies and shamans (maestras/maestros) have an authentic legacy and unlocked deep spiritual connections, visions, and learnings. They provided healing on levels I simply cannot sufficiently put to words. This was my first experience with both plant medicines and I found them to be very complimentary. I had been in a bit of a rut in my life with the challenges of work/career, parenting, and daily life. I came in with an open heart and was open to what the medicine might reveal for me, although I was uncertain what it would reveal. Now, on the other side of this, I can say with confidence that the medicine went exactly where it needed to go and in ways I truly didn't expect. The journey with the song and music in both ceremonies were so incredibly powerful and beautiful. Each ceremony provided different experiences but, together, a complete spiritual and mental health reset, a complete release of past accumulated traumas, and gave me a new foundation to work from in daily life. My heart was opened and love rushed in. I have a deep respect for these medicines. This is a pure mental and spiritual health surgery. It should be approached from a spiritual and clinical perspective; certainly not recreational. Peru Shamans are a wonderful team of beautiful people and I am so incredibly grateful that the universe brought us together. I highly recommend them!!!

Feb 2022 Friends I attended the 4 day Ayahuasca & San Pedro retreat. It was my first experience of Ayahuasca and San Pedro and the I couldn't have asked for more. The Shamans and the team are very attentive and professional. It was also an amazing experience to work with Authentic Shipibo, Peruvian and Shamans from the Andes. It was the perfect experience and I would return when called to use plant medicine again. Highly recommended. Thank you to everyone at Peru Shamans.

Nov 2021 I was very pleased with my experience with Peru Shamans. Jenny and Kathy made me feel so welcomed, gave me all of the information and guided me through this life changing ceremony. I felt comfortable as well as welcomed and safe. Grateful for the expense and knowledge I gained.

Dec 2019 Friends I joined Peru shamans on a one day retreat. Shamans they work with are seriously amazing! At such a vulnerable state of mind I couldn't have asked for anyone better. They were really experienced, their attention to detail (instructions/getting us ready for what to expect/equipment etc) was amazing . They went above and beyond for us.

Mar 2020 Solo I was very impressed with the people who were organizing and operating the experience. They were some of kindest, most comforting individuals I met. The shamans were wonderful and were able to introduce you to Mother Aya and to the experience which guides you to yourself. It was very intimate, relaxing, and cleansing. Most of all, I felt VERY safe during the entire event. After my experience, my itinerary for Machu Picchu was planned out to the smallest detail. I was able to enjoy the trip without worrying about the details. I recommend Peru Shamans...as did several of the people I spoke to in Cuzco.

Mar 2020 I booked a one day experience with the Peru shamans on line, and was very impressed with how modern their website and booking was. Unfortunately, that did not translate to our actual experience. When we booked, we were told we would be at a retreat in the Sacred Valley, but we were taken to this awful house in the suburbs of Cisco that had no WiFi, no heat, no hot water, no furniture other than hard beds with cheap linens. There were workman doing construction on the top floor, there were random people coming and going all day and all night - it was not at all conducive to the journey I had hoped for. The shaman led experience was, again, disappointing. I had asked for my own private experience (I was traveling with friends who all wanted to go together) and I was lumped in with my friends and again, couldn't focus on what I wanted. The shaman and his assistant did seem entirely sincere and they did have some insights for me after the fact. I did have a perfectly pleasant experience, but nothing transformative or insightful. One of my friends had a much worse experience, and the \"nurse\" who was supposed to monitoring us simply left and left us to care for our frightened, hallucinating, deeply upset friend on our own. The shaman assistant stayed at the prison house with us, and she did make a big effort to help, but she also peeled off at some point and never checked back in with us. All said, I wish we had skipped the PeruShamans part of our trip. It added nothing to our vacation. The shaman led experience was, again, disappointing.

Showing results 1-10 of 34 I am seriously considering attending a 6 day shaman school training next August. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has attended on what the experience was like? I'm finding lots of positive reviews regarding ceremonies but not really finding any on the shaman school training. Thank you! Dear Carol, thank you for contacting us! we do have a review about a couple on TripAdvisor she is from NY and she is under the name of Mariposa, also you will find more information in Facebook, there are some comments about people who attend to our 1 week program, we just finish the 2nd week to become a Shaman and there are many comments . Also this week of shaman school program is for people that want to learn about the shamanic practices of the Andes and our culture, we could tell you many things to convince you but this is not about it, you need to hear the call and follow your intuition because they are the voices of your heart, and our hearts never fail. Love and blessings, Rosmery Hello Sara, I am researching attending the Peru Shaman school and also doing a ayahuasca ceramony. I will be traveling alone and wanted to get advice from another female on how your experience was. I feel very drawn to attend the school, but a little nervous about going alone. I would appreciate any feedback you have to offer. Warm regards, Karen I been maturing the idea of attending the shaman school early next year. Does anyone that have done has any feedback? Hi, I would really like to know how to find a Shaman who is a true healer. I was told that a lot of fake Ayahuasca healers are there. How do know who is genuine and who is fake. Can you please recomend a sherman. Thx. Marina. Dear Marina Thank you for contacting us! here we will send some information that is our blog in our website to know more about the Shamans and how someone will recognize a true Shamans. How to recognize an authentic Ayahuasca shaman? The work of a shaman is to sing the \"Icaros\", chanting songs that gives thanks to the influence of drinking Ayahuasca. Through his songs, the shaman can communicate and modulate the energy in favor of the patient. The shaman always drinks Ayahuasca in ceremony. Some \"shamans\" say that they don't need to drink, because they already have the spirit of the plants inside. These are excuses or exaggerations: the work must be done under the influence of the medicine. A real shaman goes beyond simply creating beautiful music. A good example of the capacity of a skilled shaman is that they can see or read your energies and point where you have a problem and sometimes tell you the reasons of that problem. Shamans spend a lot of time becoming educated on how to become a master and then a doctor. They can move up in their education and obtain more knowledge and abilities by drinking more sacred plants. This is called the \"dieta\" or diet. A sacred plant dieta is a ceremony where the shaman drinks the concentrate of special plants in order to gain their powers. These ceremonies take place in nature where they fast for many days and are deprived of certain foods, sexual intercourse, city stress, etc. It's possible that one of the effects of the Ayahuasca medicine can be synesthesia perceptions. For example, any sound, melody of a song or instrumental music can become visual too. This is a typical effect of the Ayahuasca communication with the spiritual world, so that, when any kind of self-proclaimed \"shamans\" or Gurus sing or play an instrument, they can create beautiful visual sound vibrations. However, be careful; they can easily make you think they are special or unique simply through their beautiful music, but usually it is just the influence of the Ayahuasca brew. The truth of Ayahuasca shamans is that they are like skilled doctors that work using the sacred plant energies. However, that doesn't mean that they are fully enlightened or are more advanced than others. We suggest that anyone thinking about drinking ayahuasca does research to ensure the shamans have been properly trained. When working with energies and sacred dimensions, you must not be alone or without appropriate guidance. It is very important to have a good shaman to provide protection and to give proper healing. Peru Shamans is a group of shamans and spiritual guides who can help you in case you want to do an Ayahuasca ceremony. Here you can have more information. Love and blessings Peru Shamans I read your review about the shamanic experience and was curious. How long did this take and where did you go to do it? Are there different types of things that these shamans do? Just curious how this works and what it encompasses. Looking forward to hearing your feedback! Steve Hi Steve! Sorry for the long delay in responding\u2014somehow didn't see this question, hope my response comes in time. The location was outside of Cusco, but they provided transport\u2014near Saksaywaman. I spent the night there because I did it in the evening. I had about an hour-long conversation with the shaman beforehand so that he could effectively accompany me on the journey, and we had wrap-up/review session the following day. The ceremony itself lasted about 5 hours. Yes, the shamans offer a variety of treatments, but it is definitely advisable to look around for AUTHENTIC practitioners. I don't know that Peru Shamans is offering ayahuasca at the moment, unfortunately\u2014didn't see it on their site when I last checked. I'm currently in Ecuador and I'm going to inquire today about a shaman here for another treatment. Please let me know if I can be of additional help, and I'll be sure to check for your message!
