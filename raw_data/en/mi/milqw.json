Type I Diabetes (Insulin Dependant ) is a global deficiency of insulin production by pancreatic beta -cells Usually antibody mediated Insulin levels LOW Type II Diabetes (Non -Insulin Dependant ) is a metabolic condition where there is systemic insulin resistence Associated with obesity, hypertension, & hyperlipidemia Insulin levels HIGH Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes A1C 6.5% OR Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) OR 2-h plasma glucose 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT OR A random plasma glucose 200 mg/ dL (11.1 mmol /L)* Diabetes Care 2018 Jan; 41 Plasma blood glucose rather than A1C should be used to diagnose type 1 diabetes in individuals with symptoms of hyperglycemia. E Screening for type 1 diabetes with a panel of autoantibodies is currently recommended only in the setting of a research trial study or in first -degree family members of a proband with type 1 diabetes. B Persistence of two or more autoantibodies predicts clinical diabetes and may serve as an indication for intervention in the setting of a clinical trial.

Diabetes Care 2018 Jan; 41 Criteria for Testing for Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adult Individuals (1) Physical inactivity First-degree relative with diabetes High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) Women who delivered a baby weighing >9 lb or were diagnosed with GDM Hypertension (140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) HDL cholesterol level <35 mg/ dL (0.90 mmol or IFG on previous testing Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans ) History of CVD *At-risk BMI may be lower in some ethnic groups. 1. Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2*) and have additional risk factors: 2. In the absence of criteria (risk factors on previous slide), testing for diabetes should begin at age 45 years 3. If results are normal, testing should be repeated at least at 3 -year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g., those with prediabetes should be tested yearly) , and risk status Criteria for Testing for Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adult Individuals (2) Correlation of A1C with Average Glucose (AG) Mean plasma glucose A1C (%) mg/dL mmol/L 6 126 7.0 7 154 8.6 8 183 10.2 9 212 11.8 10 240 13.4 11 269 14.9 12 298 16.5 These estimates are based on ADAG data of ~2,700 glucose measurements over 3 months per A1C measurement in 507 adults with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes. The correlation between A1C and average glucose was 0.92. A calculator for converting A1C results into estimated average glucose ( eAG), in either mg/ dL or mmol /L, is available at http:// professional.diabetes.org /eAG. To avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, the A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the NGSP and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay. B Marked discordance between measured A1C and plasma glucose levels should raise the possibility of A1C assay interference due to hemoglobin variants (i.e., hemoglobinopathies) and consideration of using an assay without interference or plasma blood glucose criteria to diagnose diabetes. B In conditions associated with increased red blood cell turnover, such as sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, or erythropoietin therapy, only plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes.
