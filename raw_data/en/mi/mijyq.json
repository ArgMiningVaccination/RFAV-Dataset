But who are the new food gurus, and should we listen to them? Rachel Shabi Saturday 8 January 2005 Food is at the root of all your problems. If you are tired, achy, irritable or gloomy; if your kids are failing at maths, or your partner is habitually turned off - all these problems and more are caused and, ergo, can be fixed by food. That, at least, is the impression created by the plethora of nutrition information currently bombarding us in Britain. We are in the grip of a sort of \"you are what you eat\" mania. Check the newspapers and magazines (from Zest to Heat), the TV, the bookshops, the supermarkets, and you'll see it: the rise of the \"nutritionist\" as the new guru who can cure so much of what ails us. But pretty much anyone can, without qualification, call themselves a nutritionist, a nutritional therapist, an alternative nutritionist or a clinical nutritionist and then peddle a range of often dubious and contradictory food theories. \"By the time people come to see us, they are often completely apathetic to everything we suggest, because they have heard so many conflicting messages,\" says Sarah Stanner, a registered dietician and spokeswoman for the British Nutrition Foundation. Most commonly, people tell her that dieticians are fickle. \"They think, 'If the scientists can't even agree on anything, then why should we listen to them?'.\" So who are these new diet gurus, and just how credible is their advice? In truth, dieticians have stuck to much the same message for decades, the one that runs: eat a healthy, balanced, varied diet, low in fat, big on fruit and vegetables, some lean protein and plenty of complex carbohydrates. (The problem is not that this message is wrong, but that not enough of us listen to it.) Dietician, unlike \"nutritionist\", is a protected name, and the only state-recognised nutrition licence in the UK at the moment. Dieticians, who all belong to the British Dietetics Association (BDA), need to hold a recognised degree and register with the health professions council. A nutritionist, conversely, is not regulated. \"People who call themselves nutritionists may have no qualification whatsoever, or a qualification gained from attending a weekend course,\" explains Jeanette Crossland, a registered dietician who works with the British Olympic Medical Institute. There is the Nutrition Society, a professional body that registers sufficiently qualified nutritionists on a voluntary basis. This society has registered around 850 nutritionists but its spokesman, Bob Wenlock, says: \"We think there are several thousand people out there who call themselves nutritionists and are not properly qualified.\" The BDA and Nutrition Society each recognise the other's qualifications. The British Association of Nutritional Therapists (Bant), has more than 1,000 members, some of them students. The Nutrition Society does not recognise Bant members unless they have degrees in nutrition, believing that they may not otherwise be sufficiently qualified. Wenlock says of some of the courses recognised by Bant: \"They aren't in enough depth, don't do enough biochemistry or physiology or epidemiology.\" Jayne Nelson at Bant says that the core curriculum for nutritional therapy \"has been established after rigorous discussion with training providers of both diploma and degree status in order to standardise the depth of knowledge of all graduates\". Nutritional therapy has been around for a while but as a discipline it \"received official recognition in 2003 with the publication of the national occupation standards for nutritional therapy,\" she adds. Bant is currently in the process of getting all members to meet those standards. In 2003 the Department of Health decreed that nutritional therapy was unlikely to be of sufficient risk to the public to require statutory regulation. Among those not registered at all or registered with Bant are a few high-profile individuals who have variously written books, appear as TV experts or have set up their own nutritional institutes. Opinions about these three vary both within and outside the medical establishment. Dr Gillian McKeith, author of You Are What You Eat, has a primetime Channel 4 series on nutrition and sells an assortment of snacks and supplements under the Living Food range. She is frequently described as a \"health expert\" and a \"highly acclaimed clinical nutritionist\". Despite her media prevalence, some have questioned McKeith's qualifications, pointing out that her PhD was gained via a distance learning programme at a non-accredited college, the American College of Holistic Nutrition, now known as Clayton College of Natural Health. The Guardian tried to speak to McKeith, but she was too busy shooting the next series of You Are What You Eat. \"Gillian chose this institution as it is one of the few which offers a PhD in Holistic Nutrition, a subject which would not have been available at conventional colleges or universities,\" said a spokeswoman for McKeith. \"Like many students in postgraduate education, she undertook this via distance learning and was required to produce work for her qualification, do a dissertation, pass exams and coursework modules. Clayton College is accredited by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board. These are professional associations that offer professional accreditation in naturopathy and other areas of natural health. Both are private accrediting associations designed to meet the needs of non-traditional education and are not affiliated with any government agency.\" Doubt has also been cast on the value of McKeith's certified membership of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants, especially since Guardian journalist Ben Goldacre managed to buy the same membership online for his dead cat for $60. McKeith's spokeswoman says of this membership: \"Gillian has 'Professional Membership' which is membership designed for practising nutritional and dietary professionals, and is distinct from 'Associate Membership' which is open to all individuals. To gain Professional Membership Gillian provided proof of her degree and three professional references.\" Patrick Holford, the founder of the Institute of Optimum Nutrition (ION), has an MSc in experimental psychology, and a nutrition qualification from his own institute. Appearing in the press over the years, Holford has \"evolved from nutritional therapist, to nutritionist, to clinical nutritionist and is always now quoted as a leading clinical nutritionist,\" says Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George's Hospital, London and a spokeswoman for the BDA. Holford, who undoubtedly has many years' experience in his field, argues that since the 1970s there has been much research showing that nutrients \"have a significant impact not only on the prevention of a wide variety of diseases but also on their reversal\". The dieticians have not heeded all this research, he says - by implication they are out of date. (Indeed, the wider argument about dieticians among nutritional therapists is that they are orthodox and focused on the sick, rather than on wellness.) Another high-profile nutritionist, Ian Marber, has a qualification from Holford's institute, and has applied to study nutrition at MSc level at Middlesex University. He considers himself separate to the \"extreme\" nutritional therapists who he says do not represent the majority. He turned to nutritional therapy after being diagnosed with coeliac disease (a serious gluten intolerance). He has published several books, has a food range and runs his own clinic, all under the trademarked title of The Food Doctor. In April 2002, the Nutrition Society complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the term \"Food Doctor\" implied a medical qualification, but this was not upheld; the Food Doctor argued that \"doctor\" was also used to describe people who gave advise about homes or gardens, and that nobody feasibly thought such individuals were medics. Marber's website ( These three are regularly quoted in the health media, and some of their practices have caused concern for registered dieticians. McKeith, for instance, is frequently focused on bowel movements and colonic irrigation (to clean the system). \"Her theories on bowel movements and nutrient absorption are a bizarre way of diagnosing potential health issues and are not recognised by conventional health practitioners,\" says Collins, adding that such theories come over as medieval. Indeed, theories on autointoxication, whereby toxins formed by a stagnating colon can poison the body, did hold sway in days of old - particularly amongst the ancient Egyptians who were big on laxatives and enemas. Today we know that, with very few exceptions, this is nonsense. \"Most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine and very few in the large intestine [colon],\" says Collins in relation to McKeith's theories on using colonic irrigation to promote nutrient absorption. Moreover, the bacteria in our bowels is very rarely hostile and more usually of a helpful variety, meaning that it may not be a good idea to suck it out of there. Examining people's bowel movements, as McKeith does on her Channel 4 programme, is not much use either, suggests Collins. \"Stools in a healthy person will vary in texture, amount and frequency depending on hydration and food intake,\" she says. \"It is impossible to diagnose medical conditions from looking at a normal brown stool.\" McKeith's spokeswoman disagrees: \"The views on stool analysis and colonic irrigation are two of the key points in the debate between complementary and conventional practices. Gillian is a practitioner of holistic nutrition, and as such, she believes in the efficacy of these practices.\" She adds that McKeith uses a range of techniques, including more conventional tests and that \"McKeith's results speak for themselves\". McKeith, Marber and Holford are, to varying degrees, advocates of nutritional supplements and all also sell them. In April 2000, HealthWhich? sent researchers claiming to have the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for consultations with 15 nutritional therapists, found via Bant, ION, Yellow Pages, newspapers and complementary therapy centres. Products were recommended or sold at 12 of the consultations; these included vitamin and mineral supplements, digestive enzymes, blue-green algae, herbs, lecithin granules, psyllium husks and probiotic supplements. Only the latter two might be of benefit in addressing the symptoms of IBS, according to orthodox medicine. (More worryingly, five of the 14 consultants made no reference to their clients' GPs, despite the fact that the symptoms of IBS could equally be the symptoms of bowel cancer.) The nutritional therapy camp often argues that vitamin supplements are a vital part of diet. In his book, Supplements for Superhealth, Holford writes: \"Whatever your age, lifestyle and particular needs you'll discover how the correct supplements can increase your energy, boost your immune system, reduce pain and inflammation, slow the ageing process, balance your hormones and improve your digestion.\" Holford uses vitamin C dosage to illustrate the errors of conventional wisdom on supplements. He says there is a proven link between large doses of vitamin C and a reduction in the duration, symptoms and severity of colds, and points to the Cochrane review of all the research on colds and high-dose vitamin C to support that. The review looked at 29 trial comparisons of vitamin C in doses greater than 200mg. It concludes, with minor qualifiers, that mega-dose vitamin C is \"not rationally justified for community use\". Holford says we need around 1,000mg of vitamin C a day (the RDA is 60mg). The BDA disagrees: \"If there was evidence, we would recommend that - why would we not?\" asks Collins. Marber concedes that \"a lot of people are taking far too many\" supplements, though he does have plenty for sale on his website. Can we trust him not to sell us stuff we don't need? \"There is a potential conflict if you are someone without ethics,\" he says, before adding, \"I gave up three years of my life to study; I've practiced this for many years ... the idea that I'm doing it for the money or am not properly qualified is terribly unfair.\" While splurging on supplements, the new \"nutritionists\" often favour the purging of entire food groups - wheat and dairy products being the current food villains. Last month, the ION produced \"Britain's largest-ever health survey\", which polled 37,000 people and found that only 6% were in \"optimal health\". The rest had frequent low energy, constipation, stress, recurrent colds, and so on. These people would feel better, the survey went on to extrapolate, if they made a few simple dietary changes. The survey, pronounced ION's Holford, \"shows that the conventional wisdom that a well-balanced diet should contain plenty of dairy products and bread is wrong\". This was lapped up by sections of the health press. For example, an article in The Daily Telegraph in October last year read: \"A traditional breakfast of cereal, milk, toast and tea could be one of the worst possible starts to the day, a new survey suggests.\" But the same survey was, according to the BDA, based on \"largely subjective information and anecdotal evidence, self-reported by a self-selected, highly biased, skewed population.\" The 37,000 individuals involved had been invited to complete an online questionnaire, posing questions such as \"Do you suffer from flatulence?\" and \"Do you wake up tired?\" The respondents also answered various dietary questions and links were then forged between their food preferences and their subjective assessments of wellbeing. Holford, meanwhile, points out that his survey is still the largest of its kind and highly significant. The dieticians are exasperated by food exclusion fads. \"I've seen awful cases of people who have been put on wheat-free, fat-free, sugar-free and dairy-free diets for no reason and without even the right supplements,\" says Luci Daniels, a dietician at the BDA. Food \"allergies\" are often detected using questionable methods: reflexology, hair testing, Vega testing, which claims to test the body's energy levels as it comes into contact with different foods, or kinesiology, by which an allergy is detected by measuring arm strength while the patient holds different food test materials. According to AllergyUK, 2%-3% of us suffer from a food allergy, while a fifth of the population believe they have a food intolerance. Patrick Holford and the ION think differently again, claiming that 45% of the population probably has a food intolerance. \"It really is a huge problem.\" To some extent, food intolerances and nutritional obsessions are a faddy fashion statement and indicative of status. But such preoccupations may be symptomatic of our capacity for self-delusion. \"If I had a penny for each time someone said to me, 'I'm overweight, do you do allergy testing?',\" says Daniels. \"Being overweight is nothing to do with allergies, but people prefer that to a lifestyle reason, that they eat too much and exercise too little.\" Peter Rogers, a food and behaviour psychologist at Bristol University, extends the realms of the delusion. \"Nutrition is an area where we can potentially gain control over our lives,\" he says. \"It can be comforting to blame the diet we eat for our unhappy feelings or our kids' bad behaviour, and means we can avoid confronting potential issues in other areas of "}
