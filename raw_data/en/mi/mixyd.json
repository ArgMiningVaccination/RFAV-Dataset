Occasionally, these bacteria get through the skin barrier and cause a skin or soft tissue infection. Most infec-tions are mild, but staph bacteria can also get into the bloodstream or lungs and cause severe illness. What is MRSA? Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) are staph bacteria that have a resistance to common antibiotics. Infections caused by MRSA are harder to treat since there are fewer antibiotic choices. MRSA infections can be seen in hospitals and health care facilities where the wounds of patients weakened by disease or injury may be infected. MRSA can also cause infections outside of health care facilities in otherwise healthy people. This is called Community Acquired MRSA. What do MRSA infections look like? The skin is the most common site of staph infectio ns. The infections may look like redness with warmth, boils, pimples, spider bites, insect bites or infected wounds. Drainage may or may not be present. Complicated MRSA infections can be infections of the lungs, bone or blood. How is MRSA spread? MRSA is usually spread by direct contact with the hands, skin, drainage, or secretions from a per-son who is infected or colonized. It may also be spread through contaminated objects or surfaces.

Rahman Calder, RN, MSEileen Walsh, RN, MPHBobbie Rose, RN by Judy Calder, RN, MSHealth and Safety Course Regulations Q AI'm getting licensed to do family child care and need to take the 15-hour health and safety course required by regulations. How do I nd these courses? The health and safety course has three components: pediatric CPR, pediatric rst aid including asthma management, and preventive health practices which address illness and injury prevention and management in the child care setting. All family child care providers and suf cient number of teachers from child care centers must take this course to provide coverage when children are present. They must also have up-to-date rst aid and CPR certi cates. Courses that qualify must either be offered at an accredited college or university; taught by an instructor who has been approved by EMSA (Emergency Medical Services Authority) in pediatric rst aid, pediatric CPR and/or preventive health and safety; or, exempt. Exempt training pro-grams are the Ameri-can Heart Association (AHA) pediatric CPR course, and Ameri-can Red Cross (ARC) pediatric rst aid and pediatric CPR. EMSA approved instructors must issue an EMSA sticker for the compo-nents they teach. It's very important to keep records on le that include the stickers, the course outlines, or the ARC or AHA certi cates. You can locate approved instructors or courses in several ways. Your local Child Care Resource and Referral service (R&R) will have a listing of colleges, American Red Cross and Heart Association of ces, and local EMSA approved instructors. The R&R may also sponsor approved courses or can refer you to family child care associations which may offer courses. To nd your local R&R visit the R&R Network website at www.rrnetwork.org. You can also visit the EMSA website www.emsa.ca.gov for a list of trainers as well as the training requirements and the asthma management curriculum you must have on le. The California Child Care Healthline (800-333-3212) can also respond to your questions related to training and other concerns related to health and safety, and can help you nd a trainer in your vicinity.child care health connections November + December 2005 3infant + toddler care Music time Incorporating music into your day is enjoyable for young children and for staff. Music improves rhythm and coor-dination and helps children learn new words. You can plan to have \"music time\" each day, but you can also add music and songs to other activities such as hand washing and clean up time. Try this musical activity:Instrument Parade Give the children instruments such as drums, shakers, and tambourines. Sing or play a recording of a song as you lead them around the facility. Allow each child to enjoy the music in their own way and at their own time. After the parade, collect the instruments for the next time. Adapted from Active Learning for Twos, 1998, by Debby Cryer, Thelma Harms, and Beth Bourlandhen an unexpected event puts the staff and chil- dren of a child care program at risk for injury or other harm, the setting should be evacuated and everyone moved to a safe location. Among the events that might render a setting unsafe are earthquake (if strong enough to cause building damage), re, fl ood, industrial accidents with environ- mental contamination, or police orders given for the protection of the community. In emergencies, young children are not able to assess risk and make sound decisions. They rely on adult caregivers to be pre-pared and to take whatever steps are necessary for safety. With good planning, education of staff about roles and responsibili-ties and routine practice drills including evacuation, programs increase the likelihood that staff and children will survive emer-gencies unharmed. How can we prepare for emergencies? Create a disaster plan. All licensed child care sites, including child care centers and family child care homes, are required by Community Care Licensing (CCL) regulations to have a disas-ter plan in writing. The plan should designate a leader who will direct the evacuation and should assign other important roles to key staff. The plan should include a description of the routes to be taken in an evacuation, including a diagram or sketch of the facility, and should designate a relocation point. The plan should also describe in detail how infants, toddlers, and any children with impaired mobility or other special needs will be protected and transported. CCL publishes forms to facilitate disaster planning. These forms, called LIC 610 (for centers) and LIC 610A (for fam-ily child care homes) are available online at www.dss.cahwnet.gov/cdssweb/On-lineFor_293.htm. CCL also publishes tools for programs who want to measure how well prepared they are and identify ways to improve. These self-assessment guides are online at http://ccld.ca.gov/Self-Asses_2031.htm. Prepare the children. Children may not fully understand the risks in an emergency, but they can be taught simple and impor-tant safety messages. For example, during a disaster drill, teach children to duck and cover under tables or other sturdy furni-ture. Teach them to crawl or shimmy on the ground, in case they ever need to evacuate through smoke- lled rooms or corridors. Emergency drills should be practiced at least every six months, and more often if possible. Keep supplies ready. When a program relocates, children will need food, milk, water, diapers, clean clothes and other necessi-ties. Some programs ask parents to pack a small backpack with provisions along with a special toy, a blanket and a family pic-ture. These backpacks are stored at the program, to be worn only during drills or during an evacuation. Alternatively, a program may keep necessities in the planned relocation site. Tips for success Practice evacuations at least every 6 months. Maintain current rst aid and CPR certi cations. Check emergency supplies at least every 6 months for expira- tions dates on food items or outgrown clothes/diapers. Consider children with special needs and make arrangements for any medications or therapeutic devices to be evacuated with the child. Assess your program's disaster preparedness by using the tools made available by Community Care Licensing or call the Healthline at (800) 333-3212 for additional assistance.Plan and Practice Evacuation to Minimize Risk in an Emergency Eileen Walsh, RN, MPHWNovember + December 20054 child care health connectionsnutrition Bean Bag Toss Cut three or four holes into a large box. Decorate with contact paper. Put a basket with several beanbags on the fl oor near the box. Have a child stand by the bas-ket and toss each beanbag at the box. When nished,have the child collect the beanbags in the basket for the next child to have a turn. As the children become more skilled, move the basket a step or two back. This activity will aid in eye-hand coordination, and will help children learn to follow directions and take turns.by Bobbie Rose, RNCaring for Children with Food Allergies food allergy is an abnormal response to a food by the body's immune system. Allergic reactions range from mild to life threatening. Food intolerance can be con- fused with a food allergy. The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance which affects digestion but does not involve the immune system. Signs that a child may have a food allergy An allergic reaction to food can occur within a few minutes to an hour after consuming the food. You may see: Skin reactions. Hives are the most common allergic reaction to food. They are red, very itchy, swollen areas of the skin that may arise suddenly and leave quickly. Itching and swelling of the nose, mouth and throat. Asthma-like symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, or dif culty breathing. Digestive symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and abdomi- nal cramping, a red rash around the mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, swelling of the stomach and gas. Common food allergies The most common food allergies are to milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, sh and shell sh. Children will often outgrow allergies to eggs and milk but allergies to peanuts are usually life long. Tree nuts and peanuts are the most common cause of seri-ous allergic reactions that call for emergency treatment. How to prevent an allergic reaction? Avoid the food that triggers the reaction. Read labels for ingredients. Post a food allergy notice in food preparation and eating areas. Don't allow children to share food. For a child with severe allergies, consider limiting foods that can be brought in by other parents in your program. How to reduce the risk of allergies in young children? Promote breastfeeding. Dairy should not be introduced until age one. Eggs should not be given to children until age two. Peanuts, tree nuts and sh should not be given to children until age three (AAP , 2000). Care plans for children with allergies: Child care settings must have a detailed care plan written speci cally for each child with a food allergy. Training for all staff members must be provided. The plan must include what to do in an emergency and speci c symptoms that indicate the need for intervention. Emergency intervention: Severe allergic reactions such as: severe vomiting, breathing dif culty, loss of consciousness, will need medical intervention. Administer epi-pen if prescribed, as per care plan. Call 9-1-1, then notify parent.

Although young children are curious about their environment and pre-dictably put everything in their mouths, children with pica go beyond this simple exploration of their surroundings. The eating disorder of pica is typically de ned as the compul- sive eating of non-food items for a period of at least one month at an age for which this behavior is developmentally inappropri-ate (after age 18 to 24 months). It is different from geophagy, the intentional eating of soil associated with cultural practices. Which non-food items are consumed? What people consider un t for food varies by region and ethnicity. People with pica frequently crave and consume items such as clay, dirt, sand, stones, hair, feces, lead, laundry starch, vinyl gloves, plastic, pencil erasers, ice, n- gernails, paper, paint chips, coal, chalk, wood, plaster, light bulbs, toothpaste, needles, string and burnt matches. What causes pica? Although the speci c causes of pica are unknown, numerous theories have been proposed ranging from nutrition de ciency (e.g., iron, calcium or zinc de ciency) to emotional distress and developmental disorders. How dangerous is eating dirt? Continuous eating of non-food items can be harmful to your child's health. Depending on the nature and amount of ingested objects, it may cause the following health problems: Lead poisoning. Eating soils contaminated with lead is a rec- ognized cause of lead poisoning. Malnutrition. Consuming non-food items leaves less oppor- tunity to eat nutritious foods. Bowel problems. Eating objects that could get lodged in the intestines may lead to intestinal obstruction or damage. Dental injury. Consuming hard substances may harm the teeth. Parasitic infections. Eating soil has been shown to be a sig- ni cant risk factor for exposure to soil-transmitted parasites and infections. What are other ways in which children ingest considerable amounts of soil? Contaminated food, soiled hands, and inhaled dust add soil to our diets. Observations show that normal behav-iors in young children (e.g., putting objects in their mouths, playing with pets, handling food, eating after play-ing outdoors, sucking thumbs, biting ngernails, playing in sandboxes, and engaging in other hand-to-mouth activities) may also contribute to soil and dust exposures. However, the extent of exposure depends on fac-tors such as where children play, what they wear, and how often they wash their hands. When should you call your health care provider? Professional help may be needed if: Your child is constantly eating non- food objects. You have concerns about your child's growth. Your child is unwell, tired and not eating. Mealtimes are causing lots of stress and anxiety. If your child has consumed a harmful object, seek medical care immediately. If you think your child has ingested some-thing poisonous, call Poison Control at (800) 222-1222. References and Resources Pediatrics, Apr 2004.

Rahman Zamani, MD, MPHNovember + December 20056 child care health connectionsInfant Feeding in Child CareHealth & Safety Notes Families with a new baby face important and some- times confusing choices about feeding their infant. When an infant is enrolled in child care, the situa-tion is even more challenging. Questions to consider include: Should the infant breastfeed exclusively? When and how often should the baby also drink from a bottle? Should the family ever give formula? Should we feed on demand or on a schedule? When is it time to wean, or to introduce cereals, fruits and other solids? Whatever a family's choice, it is sure to impact not only the baby, but the mother, the family and the program staff too. Here's a review of infant feeding choices with a summary of the considerations for each type and best practice recommendations for infant caregivers. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding offers many bene \u00c0 ts to infants and mothers. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed for the \u00c0 rst six months of life, with rare exceptions. After six months, breastfeeding should continue until at least age 1 year, with the gradual addition of complementary foods. Breastfeeding is still bene \u00c0 cial to mother and child after the \u00c0 rst year, and should continue as long as mutually desired. Bene\u00c0 ts of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed a baby and offers many health advantages. The nutrients in breastmilk are easily digested and absorbed by most infants. Addition-ally, breastfed babies have lower rates of respiratory and intestinal infections during infancy, and also en-joy long-term positive effects such as decreased risk of diabetes, allergies and asthma later in childhood. Breastfeeding also offers health advantages to moth-ers. Some studies show that women who breastfeed have lower risk for ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer compared with the general population. Considerations when breastfeeding. According to the AAP , breastfed infants need dietary supplemen-tation of Vitamin D, and may need supplementation of iron, both of which are present in very low amounts in breastmilk. The need for supplementation and the dosage should be determined by the infant's medi-cal provider. Who shouldn't breastfeed? A woman should not breastfeed her infant under the following circum-stances: She is infected with human immunode \u00c0 ciency virus; She is being treated with radiation or chemo- therapy for cancer; She is an abuser of alcohol or recreational drugs, which are passed to a baby in breastmilk. Breastfeeding and child care. An infant who attends a child care program can still enjoy the bene \u00c0 ts of breastmilk. With careful planning and support from her employer, family and child care staff, a mother can pump and store her milk for use during child care hours. For more information, including recom-mendations for storing and handling breastmilk in child care, refer to the CCHP document Health & Safety Note: Supporting Breastfeeding Families . Infant formula There are many types of infant formula available. Formula made from cow's milk is the most common type. Soy formula is also popular and accounts for about 25 percent of all formula sales. In addition, formulas are available for infants with special di-etary needs. Why some families choose formula. Formulas meet the recommended nutrient intakes for infants. In child care health connections November + December 2005 7California Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Healthline 1-800-333-3212 www.ucsfchildcarehealth.orgaddition, formulas are forti \u00c0 ed with iron and Vitamin D. Formula-fed infants usually don't need dietary supplementation of vitamins or minerals. Addition-ally, some families choose formula because they feel that bottle-feeding gives a mother more opportuni-ties for her time, and allows other family members to share in feeding the baby. Some mothers return-ing to work choose formula feeding in anticipation of enrolling their infant in child care. Considerations for formula feeding. Compared to breastmilk, formula is less easily digested. The incidence of constipation or diarrhea is greater in formula-fed infants than breastfed infants. Formula offers no protective components, such as antibod-ies and antibacterial properties, which help infants \u00c0 ght infection. Formula feeding is also more cost- ly to families than breastfeeding. Families need to purchase the formula as well as supplies, including bottles and nipples. They also need to replace sup-plies which become worn or are lost. Introducing complementary foods When an infant is ready, soft foods other than breast-milk or formula should be added to the diet. The AAP and World Health Organization recommend that complementary foods rich in iron should be added starting at around 6 months of age. What are the cues of readiness for complementary foods? There are many physical signs that an infant is ready. Before starting solids, infants should be able to control their head movement. They should be able to accept a small infant-sized spoon into their mouth without re \u00c1 exively pushing it out with the tongue. Behavioral cues include hunger shortly after breast-milk or formula feedings, indicating that the baby needs more calories than he or she is getting from milk alone. Infants at this stage may act interested in the foods being eaten by others, reaching out for or staring at the food on parents' or siblings' plates. When these signs appear, parents should discuss in-troducing solids with the baby's medical provider, and if there is an agreement, it's time to start! Practical tips for baby's \u00c0 rst solids. Iron-forti \u00c0 ed infant cereal made from rice or barley is the most common \u00c0 rst solid food. Cereal provides energy, protein and, if forti \u00c0 ed, vitamins and minerals too. Cereal should be prepared using formula or breast- milk, according to package directions. Mix cereal to a thin consistency and use an infant-sized spoon. A variety of cereals should be introduced gradually, one at a time. Most infants start with rice cereal, fol-lowed by oats and barley, with wheat-based cereals added last (since children may develop an allergic reaction to wheat if it is introduced too early). Each time a new food is added, parents and caregivers should wait a few days before adding another. Mon-itor the baby for reactions such as gas, diarrhea or diaper rash after each addition. After cereals, a baby may be given pureed vegetables and fruits, includ-ing carrots, yams, potatoes, mashed bananas and applesauce. These are also added gradually, with a few days' wait between new additions. Solids for older infants. Once an infant begins teething, chewable \u00c0 nger foods can be started. A baby who is ready for these foods is able to grasp and hold small items. To prevent possible chok-ing, parents and caregivers must carefully prepare foods and must also keep watch when the baby is eating. Among the common early \u00c0 nger foods for infants ages 8 to 12 months are bite-sized pieces of toast, bits of banana, pea-sized chunks of chicken or meat, and scrambled egg yolk. Never offer a baby any round, hard foods, which are choking hazards. These include: grapes, hot dogs, popcorn, chunks of peanut butter or carrots. Infancy is a time of joy and discovery in all aspects of living, including food! Child care professionals have the opportunity to help all children establish healthy, happy food habits, with a lifetime of posi-tive results.

From braces to adapted vehicles, from a piece of tape to Braille typ ewriters and com- puters, assistive technology has given people the special tools to be mobile, to communicate, connect, read and write. It also has helped children and adults to see, walk, play and hear. Ultimately, assistive technology has helped them to become independent and productive members of society. What is assistive technology? Assistive technology is any device or equipment that compen-sates for skills or abilities that an individual lacks. It enables individuals with disabilities to be more independent, produc-tive, self-con dent, and better integrated into the mainstream of society. Assistive technology can be high-tech, mid-tech and low-tech\u2014from a simple piece of Velcro or tape, to highly com-plicated equipment, or, anything in between. How do children bene t from assistive technology? Assistive technology makes it possible for children with disabili- ties to do more for themselves from the beginning of their lives. Many types of assistive technology are readily available and easy to obtain. Who is eligible for assistive technology? Any child with a disability who is enrolled in Special Educa-tion services is entitled by law to obtain the assistive technology devices that the child may need. For example, children with hearing and speech problems can communicate by using a por-table electronic device that \"speaks,\" and children who are not able to feed themselves bene t from modi ed utensils to feed themselves independently. Do children automatically receive assistive technology? No. Assistive technology does not become part of a child's spe- cial education plan automatically. It is often up to the child's parents and advocates identifying and requesting this type of assistance at the initial Individual Family Services Plan (IFSP) review or annual Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) meeting. However, in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), public agencies must ensure that assis-tive technology devices or services are made available to children with identi ed disabilities. Moreover, under the Free Appropri- ate Public Education (FAPE), assistive technology devices or equipment are free of charge for children with disabilities. For more information or if you have any questions on how to obtain assistive technology for children, please contact the toll-free Healthline at (800) 333-3212, or contact the National Information Center for Handicapped Children and Youth (NICHCY) program at (800) 695-0285.

The leaves of the poison oak plant are coated with an oily substance (urushiol) to which many people are allergic. Because the plant grows low on the ground and thrives in California, young children who play outdoors are at risk for contact with poison oak. Some people can touch the leaves of poison oak and experience no reaction because they are not allergic to it. But in allergic persons, contact with poison oak causes a reaction that can be very uncomfortable and even dangerous. What is poison oak dermatitis? Poison oak dermatitis is the rash which emerges in allergic persons after contact with the oily leaves of the poison oak plant. The rash appears as itchy, blistery hives which appear on the areas of the skin that touched the oily leaves, usually within two to three days of exposure. The hives may be a small area of red, raised bumps, or if widespread, may run together and ooze clear fl uid. Oil from the leaves can remain on clothes, and later contact between the skin and unwashed, contam-inated clothes can cause additional rash. Poison oak can also cause a severe reac- tion that is not con ned to the skin. This extreme reaction is rare but can be life threatening. Symptoms of extreme aller-gic reaction include itching all over the body, swelling of the tongue or throat, and dif culty breathing. This situation is a medical emergency. Can a child with poison oak rash attend child care? A child with poison oak rash can attend a child care program, provided that the rash is not infected and the child feels well enough to participate in program activities. The child may bene t from soothing treatments, such as lotions, for the itching. Program staff must obtain complete documentation and instructions from parents regarding the use of any over-the-counter or prescription treat-ments, in accordance with Community Care Licensing Regulations. Contrary to myth, poison oak rash is not contagious. A caregiver or another child will not contract the r ash if they touch the hives of an affected child. However, the rash can be contracted by touching the oily residue of the leaves, either on a plant or on the clothes of a person who has recently been in contact with the plant. Because the rash is so intensely itchy, affected persons tend to scratch fre-quently, even while asleep. Constant scratching can result in skin trauma and vulnerability to skin infection. Other complications include irritability from discomfort and inability to sleep soundly, resulting in fatigue. Children with poison oak should be monitored for any of these complications. Fingernails should be trimmed to minimize trauma to the skin from scratching. It's also important to educate staff, families and children about the appearance and presence of poison oak in the community and environment, to prevent contact before it happens.PNovember + December 200510 child care health connectionsspecial feature publications updatesPrevention of Poisoning hildren under ve years of age are the most likely to get poisoned. They are curious and will eat and drink almost anything\u2014even if it does not taste good. Although most childhood poisoning occurs at home, it can also occur in the child care setting. Poisons can be found in any room of the house or center, and poisonings can happen anywhere. However, most poisonings occur in the kitchen, bathroom or bedroom, in the presence of parents or caregivers, and when products are not in their usual storage area and are within reach of young children. Poisonings occur from many common items found in a household or in the child care environment. Items that can be poisonous to a child include medicines (both prescription and non-prescription such as aspirin, cough and cold preparations, vitamins and iron), household cleaning products (such as furni-ture polishes, detergents and drain cleaners), substances stored in the garage (such as car and gardening products), mushrooms, plants (such as castor beans, foxglove and oleander), cosmetics, batteries, arts and crafts materials, and lead-containing paint, dust and pottery. Poisoning can occur by ingestion (eating or drinking), absorption (contact with skin, getting in the eyes), inhalation (breathing the fumes), injection (puncture wounds), and animal and insect bites. What you can do to reduce the risk? Modi cation of environment. Child care providers should make a room-by-room inspection and evaluate the outdoor play area for potential poisons in the child care environment. Removing all hazards and risks for exposure to poisons provides a protected environment. Supervision. Remember that no area is 100 percent safe. Good safety practices and supervision help prevent accidents involving poisoning. Discourage children from mouthing paint-brushes, crayons or other objects and materials. Education. Teach children never to put anything other than clean food into their mouths. Be prepared. Children act fast, and so do poisons. Even when people are very careful, poisoning exposures can occur. It is important to be prepared before something happens:1. If a poisoning exposure occurs, call the emergency number (800) 222-1222; document the incident and your actions. 2.

Ensur-ing that children have access to routine health visits is one way to sup-port the overall health of young children. Even children who do not have special needs or a current health problem should have routine visits with a health care provider. Children with special health problems or an acute health problem may need more frequent visits to a health care provider. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends fourteen well-child visits in the rst ve years of a child's life. Each well-child visit should include a review of the child's health and developmental history, a complete physical exam, including height and weight, hearing and vision screening, developmental and behavioral assessment, immunizations, and communication with caregivers about issues such as nutrition, injury and violence prevention. There are additional screenings and procedures recommended throughout the rst ve years, depending on age and risk factors. In California, the California Department of Health Services Child Health and Disability Prevention Program (CHDP) offers health care to children from birth to 21 years old who meet certain eligibility criteria. CHDP recommends eleven well-child health visits in the rst ve years of life and refers to the AAP's guidelines for the visits. A full schedule of the recommended ages and elements of each health visit can be found on-line at http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;105/3/645.
