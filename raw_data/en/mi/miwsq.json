Symptoms of sinus congestion and dry cough that lingers on for weeks seems to be making its' rounds around the community. I wanted to share a traditional recipe that I was taught by a Chinese Herbalist. This simple three ingredient steamed pear remedy is often prepared to prevent or treat a persistent dry lingering cough after a cold or flu. In Chinese Medicine terms, it helps to strongly moisten and tonify the Lung Yin while dissolving phlegm. Chuan Bei Mu, pinyin for Fritillaria Bulb, is used to dissolve phlegm, moistens the lungs, clear heat and irritation, and stop cough. It is traditionally used for dry chronic cough or cough with heat signs from Yin deficiency, with symptoms such as dry cough, sputum that is scanty and difficult to expectorate, and a heavy sensation in the chest. Asian Pears are called for in this recipe and considered to have the strongest medicinal effect to moisten the Lungs. However, western pear varietals are more moist and are considered by some western practitioners to actually be better Yin tonics. So whatever organic pears you can find at your local store will work. Raw Honey has expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial qualities, to treat respiratory conditions such as sore throats, coughs, bronchitis and asthma. In addition, raw honey contains many natural antioxidants, enzymes and minerals, including calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, phosphorus, and selenium, and high amounts of B vitamins. INGREDIENTS: - 1 large ripe pear (Asian or western varieties) - Chuan Bei Mu (Fritillaria bulb) - 1TBs (roughly 10 grams) These can be purchased from your local herbal dispensary or from [www.mayway.com](http://www.mayway.com/) - Raw honey to taste (up to 1tsp) - Optional: add a gram or two of Xing Ren (Apricot Kernal) and Chen Pi (Tangerine Peel) to strengthen the ability to stop cough. DIRECTIONS: - Wash the pears, but do not peel. Cut off the top of the pear and core out the middle, making a hole but leaving the bottom intact. - Place the Chuan Bei Mu in a coffee grinder, VitaMix, or food processor and grind into a powder (this may take some time). - Place Chuan Be Mu powder into the hole in the pear. Add raw honey to taste. Replace the top to the pair. - Transfer the pear to a steamer and cook, covered, for about 30-40 minutes, or until soft. (If you don't have a steamer, steam the pear in a glass or ceramic bowl placed in a covered pot containing an inch of water.) The pears are steamed to increase their Yin-moistening quality, so optimally a double boiler would be used. - Eat while warm. The liquid from the pears should be drunk as well for maximum benefit. "}
