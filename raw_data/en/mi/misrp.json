The space is absolutely gorgeous and serene. My specialist made me feel completely comfortable throughout my first Botox treatment. I felt great when I walked out and am excited to come back for a hormone panel and future skin treatments. Stacey H. 5 stars for my first visit! Enjoyed the website design and the option to book an appointment online. The service was excellent from start to finish. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The doctor was very thorough when explaining the botox process. She did a great job and the I love the results!! I will definitely be back in 3-4 months! Christina K. Modern Age's approach to integrative health is truly one-of-a-kind. Wellness trends emerge daily & decision fatigue is real. \"What's the best path for me?\" has become a confusing question to answer, but Modern Age IS that filter. Their approach offers personalized mapping that ensures you're headed down the right path. Tanya M. I had a great experience here. I have tried places like this in the past that felt pushy but Modern Age was not. The clinical staff here were extremely knowledgeable and kind. The space itself was beautiful and relaxing. I had microneedling done and am thrilled with the results already. Highly recommend! Mollie D. I loved my experience at Modern Age! I got the NAD+ IV treatment and I felt incredible after. I had more energy, brighter skin, and mental clarity. Plus, the staff and studio space were bright, clean, and welcoming. I can't wait to go back for my next treatment! Laurel R. The staff is personable, cheerful, knowledgeable and very friendly. They are well versed and are able to field questions with ease. Highly recommend for anyone just starting out on their health journey or even for the seasoned client. There's something for everyone!
