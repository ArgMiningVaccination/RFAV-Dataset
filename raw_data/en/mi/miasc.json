As a naturopathic doctor and psychotherapist, I also practice functional medicine, family constellations therapy and EMDR. After treating thousands of patients, I've noticed most physical and mental health conditions improve when you heal the core pillars of your health: Your gut, diet, liver, adrenal glands, stress and emotional trauma. This book focuses on healing both your body and your mind in the most complete way, with holistic medicine and emotional healing, so that you can feel better faster, stay well for longer, and rely less on expensive medicines and supplements. If you have taken medicines or nutritional and herbal supplements but haven't resolved your past emotional issues, or if you spend a lot of time in therapy and read positive thinking books, but haven't completely fixed your body holistically, you're going to learn how to integrate all these ways of healing yourself. I share what I've learnt from my own personal healing journey as well as from over 15 years of clinical experience, helping patients find long-term relief from health issues, anxiety, depression, stress, chronic pain, fatigue and even weight problems. I have personally benefitted from these techniques and so have many people around the world. I start this book with emotional and stress healing exercises, and then focus on healing your gut, liver, adrenal glands and chronic inflammation. This will give you a comprehensive approach to your wellbeing. Here is what you will learn in this book. Part 1 introduces different factors which affect your emotions. You'll learn how physical factors affect your emotional experiences. I'll show you how stressful experiences have a long-term impact on emotional wellbeing and I give you powerful mental techniques to heal from stress and painful emotional experiences. You'll find out how to resolve turbulent emotions, change negative thoughts and beliefs, rewire your brain and develop more positive thoughts and habits to become more emotionally resilient and remain well for longer. Part 2 gives you holistic therapies for your gut, liver, thyroid and adrenal glands and teaches you how your body affects your mind. You will learn to create balance throughout your body and heal the root cause of emotional and physical health issues using foods, herbs, supplements, lifestyle changes, yoga, breathing techniques and other powerful therapies. My approach reduces the need for excessive supplements and reduces the likelihood of your health issues recurring. You can read Part 2 before Part 1 or interchange between the two parts because it is vital to heal your mind and your body concurrently. Part 3 discusses how energy affects your mind and your body, and why energetic healing, counseling and psychotherapy can be so important to your long-term wellbeing. You will understand how to use different homeopathic remedies, Bach flower remedies, nutritional supplements, acupuncture points and herbal remedies so that you can treat the root cause of your issues and remain healthy. Mental Health Even though I use the terms anxiety and depression liberally throughout this book, I have written it for anyone who wants to feel better. The advice in this book is useful for anyone who wants to be less stressed, heal from past stressful experiences, or just wants to feel more energized, healthy and positive. We all experience difficult situations in our lives that we need to heal from. It is not the goal of this book to replace medical advice. My goal is to help you treat the root cause of your health and emotional issues and resolve unfinished emotional experiences that contribute to your current emotional state, and to enable you to make healthier decisions for your road to wellbeing. I also hope that psychiatrists will read this book and look beyond mere medications to help people feel better. You might find that by using the techniques in this book you will require less medication. Please be responsible with your health and consult with a qualified professional before changing any of your medications or using some of the therapies described here. Unfortunately, surveys indicate that many people avoid seeking treatment or even refuse to admit that they have a problem because of the negative stigma associated with emotional problems. Some people think they will be judged as being weak or incapable of coping with life, not realizing that they have a very treatable condition that stems from very reasonable and non-shameful causes. Some people think their depressed emotions are part of their core personality and that they do not have emotional issues, so they do not seek help. Sadly, many of these people do not get help in time and let their life deteriorate further, sometimes even to the point of suicide. Health Resources As a naturopathic doctor, I have found that using professional quality supplements and herbs makes a bigger difference to your health than using random supplements from online stores and certain pharmacies, which can be a waste of money. Most non-professional grade supplements do not contain a therapeutic dose of good ingredients in them. Some even boast to have many ingredients in them - but the dose of each ingredient is much lower than what you might need. Some of these companies compromise on their quality of processing herbs and nutrients, so you get low quality blends with little or no therapeutic value. To get the best supplements, please contact a health practitioner or create an account with one of the reputable world dispensaries on my website health.drameet.com/shop . Video Course You can take your health further with some free videos I've made for you and with my Board approved online program on health.drameet.com/freegift . My online program has been approved by professional associations for dietitians, nutritionists and naturopathic doctors at the time of writing this book, and you get it at a special rate for purchasing this book.
