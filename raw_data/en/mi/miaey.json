As they accumulate in our body, it can have a number of adverse affects on our health -- from weight gain and fatigue to brain fog, bloating and more. The Dr. Cabral Detox is a comprehensive, full body Functional Medicine detoxification system that gently eliminates harmful toxins while rebalancing the body at an underlying root cause level. You deserve it all -- health, energy, vitality and your ideal body. In our modern world however, there are an increasing number of challenges preventing you from looking and feeling your best. From household cleaning products to personal care and cosmetics, you come in contact with more toxins before you leave your house than you can count. Add to that environmental pollutants, chemicals from food and day-to-day stress and it's no wonder you feel powerless to take back your health. The truth is though, that regaining control over your health is easier than you think -- and it starts by addressing the underlying reasons that are keeping you stuck where you are right now. By combining the science of Functional Medicine with ancient Ayurvedic traditions, the Dr. Cabral Detox is a comprehensive method of restoring the body to a state of dynamic equilibrium. Whether you're dealing with issues such as weight gain, brain fog, low mood and bloating, or something more serious, they all have something in common -- they are symptoms, but they are not the cause. That's because the true problem starts at a deeper level due to an imbalance, toxicity or deficiency that can be difficult to uncover. Thankfully, no matter what your individual health challenges are, the path back to amazing health is the same, with results you can see and feel in as little as 7-days! You know how important it is to fuel your body on a daily basis with the nutrients it needs to thrive. The problem is, even if you're eating healthy, it's nearly impossible to achieve optimal nutrition through food alone (even organic). This is why the EquiLife Daily Nutritional Support was formulated by Dr. Cabral. It is a vegan, hypoallergenic protein powder, fortified with a wide range of activated vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, detox co-factors, and electrolytes, making it a one-stop-shop to fill the nutritional gaps in your diet. The AYU Detox utilizes rare botanical extracts that have been used in traditional Aryuvedic medicine for centuries to assist the body through detoxification. Triphala, a combination of three ayurvedic herbs, has been formulated in careful synchrony to support the body through both phases of liver detoxification. The FM Detox provides your body with important amino acids, antioxidants, herbal extracts, trace minerals, and essential vitamins to promote and enhance detoxification, while protecting the liver. Liver detoxification occurs in two phases. During both, the body requires specific nutrients that induce and enhance detoxification pathways. The FM Detox utilizes the best of Functional Medicine to enhance detoxification, while supporting the liver. This detox is the best detox I've found! It's tough to do the first couple of days but after that it's not so bad and the cravings subside! I'm loving the results and have lost 18 pounds already and I'm on day 10 of the 21 day detox! But more than the weight loss I FEEL amazing!!! So grateful for this detox and the benefits that come! I have done this detox twice and have been pleased with thec results both times. I come away feeling lighter and more energized! I did use it for 2 weeks and list 13 pounds I have more energy and less brain fog with just a 7 day detox! I have had no pain or bloating eating salad, beans or vegetables since eating on day 3 of detox. On days 1 and 2, I had fatigue and traveling muscle and tendon soreness, but I kept telling myself, the temporary discomfort is worth it and it's better than having to endure chemo! My emailed questions were answered promptly with very helpful specific podcast suggestions. I am very satisfied with the product, the support and all I am learning. I'm also reading The Rain Barrel Effect which is very informative. Thank you Equi.life team!
