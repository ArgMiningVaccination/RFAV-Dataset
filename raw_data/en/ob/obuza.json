For a complete copy of the Student Conduct Code (https:// wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/ university-student-judicial-code/), visit the university website. Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy Effective learning, teaching and research all depend upon the ability of members of the academic community to trust one another and to trust the integrity of work that is submitted for academic credit or conducted in the wider arena of scholarly research. Such an atmosphere of mutual trust fosters the free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential. In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged, and work that is presented as original must be, in fact, original. Faculty, students and administrative staff all share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at Washington University. Scope and Purpose This statement on academic integrity applies to all undergraduate students at Washington University. Graduate students are governed by policies in each graduate school or division. All students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behavior. The purpose of the statement is twofold: 1.To clarify the university's expectations with regard to undergraduate students' academic behavior; and 2.To provide specific examples of dishonest conduct. The examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive. Violations of This Policy Include but Are Not Limited to the Following: 1.Plagiarism Plagiarism consists of taking someone else's ideas, words or other types of work product and presenting them as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to be attentive to proper methods of documentation and acknowledgment. To avoid even the suspicion of plagiarism, a student must always do the following: Enclose every quotation in quotation marks and acknowledge its source. Cite the source of every summary, paraphrase, abstraction or adaptation of material originally prepared by another person and any factual data that is not considered common knowledge. Include the name of author, title of work, publication information and page reference. 11Bulletin 2020-21 About Washington University in St. Louis (01/15/21) Acknowledge material obtained from lectures, interviews or other oral communication by citing the source (i.e., the name of the speaker, the occasion, the place and the date). Cite material from the internet as if it were from a traditionally published source. Follow the citation style or requirements of the instructor for whom the work is produced. 2.Cheating on an Examination A student must not receive or provide any unauthorized assistance on an examination. During an examination, a student may use only materials authorized by the faculty. 3.Copying or Collaborating on Assignments Without Permission When a student submits work with their name on it, this is a written statement that credit for the work belongs to that student alone. If the work was a product of collaboration, each student is expected to clearly acknowledge in writing all persons who contributed to its completion. Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise, it is dishonest to collaborate with others when completing any assignment or test, performing laboratory experiments, writing and/or documenting computer programs, writing papers or reports, or completing problem sets. If the instructor allows group work in some circumstances but not others, it is the student's responsibility to understand the degree of acceptable collaboration for each assignment and to ask for clarification, if necessary. To avoid cheating or unauthorized collaboration, a student should never do any of the following: Use, copy or paraphrase the results of another person's work and represent that work as one's own, regardless of the circumstances. Refer to, study from or copy archival files (e.g., old tests, homework, solutions manuals, backfiles) that were not approved by the instructor. Copy another's work or permit another student to copy one's work. Submit work as a collaborative effort if they did not contribute a fair share of the effort. 4.Fabrication or Falsification of Data or Records It is dishonest to fabricate or falsify data in laboratory experiments, research papers or reports or in any other circumstances; to fabricate source material in a bibliography or \"works cited\" list; or to provide false information on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or other document in connection with academic efforts. It is also dishonest to take data developed by someone else and present them as one's own. Examples of falsification include the following:Altering information on any exam, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Altering, omitting or inventing laboratory data to submit as one's own findings. This includes copying laboratory data from another student to present as one's own; modifying data in a write-up; and providing data to another student to submit as one's own. 5.Other Forms of Deceit, Dishonesty or Inappropriate Conduct Under no circumstances is it acceptable for a student to do any of the following: Submit the same work, or essentially the same work, for more than one course without explicitly obtaining permission from all instructors. A student must disclose when a paper or project builds on work completed earlier in their academic career. Request an academic benefit based on false information or deception. This includes requesting an extension of time, a better grade or a recommendation from an instructor. Make any changes (including adding material or erasing material) on any test paper, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Willfully damage the efforts or work of other students. Steal, deface or damage academic facilities or materials. Collaborate with other students planning or engaging in any form of academic misconduct. Submit any academic work under someone else's name other than one's own. This includes but is not limited to sitting for another person's exam; both parties will be held responsible. Engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. To seek clarification, students should ask the professor or the assistant in instruction for guidance. Reporting Misconduct Faculty Responsibility Faculty and instructors are strongly encouraged to report incidents of student academic misconduct to the academic integrity officer in their school or college in a timely manner so that the incident may be handled fairly and consistently across schools and departments. Assistants in instruction are expected to report instances of student misconduct to their supervising instructors. Faculty members are expected to respond to student concerns about academic dishonesty in their courses. 12Bulletin 2020-21 About Washington University in St. Louis (01/15/21) Student Responsibility If a student observes others violating this policy, the student is strongly encouraged to report the misconduct to the instructor, to seek advice from the academic integrity officer of the school or college that offers the course in question, or to address the student(s) directly. Exam Proctor Responsibility Exam proctors are expected to report incidents of suspected student misconduct to the course instructor and/or the Disability Resource Center, if applicable. Procedure Jurisdiction This policy covers all undergraduate students, regardless of their college of enrollment. Cases will be heard by school- specific committees according to the school in which the class is listed rather than the school in which the student is enrolled. All violations and sanctions will be reported to the student's college of enrollment. Administrative Procedures Individual undergraduate colleges and schools may design specific procedures to resolve allegations of academic misconduct by students in courses offered by that school, so long as the procedures are consistent with this policy and with the Student Conduct Code. Student Rights and Responsibilities in a Hearing A student accused of an academic integrity violation \u2014 whether by a professor, an assistant in instruction, an academic integrity officer or another student \u2014 is entitled to do the following: Review the written evidence in support of the charge Ask any questions Offer an explanation as to what occurred Present any material that would cast doubt on the correctness of the charge Receive a determination of the validity of the charge without reference to any past record of misconduct When responding to a charge of academic misconduct, a student may do the following: Deny the charges and request a hearing in front of the appropriate academic integrity officer or committee Admit the charges and request a hearing to determine sanction(s) Admit the charges and accept the imposition of sanctions without a hearingRequest a leave of absence from the university (however, the academic integrity matter must be resolved prior to re- enrollment) Request to withdraw permanently from the university with a transcript notation that there is an unresolved academic integrity matter pending A student has the following responsibilities with regard to resolving the charge of academic misconduct: Admit or deny the charge. This will determine the course of action to be pursued. Provide truthful information regarding the charges. It is a Student Conduct Code violation to provide false information to the university or anyone acting on its behalf. Sanctions If Found Not in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If the charges of academic misconduct are not proven, no record of the allegation will appear on the student's transcript. If Found in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If, after a hearing, a student is found to have acted dishonestly or if a student has admitted to the charges prior to a hearing, the school's academic integrity officer or committee may impose sanctions, including but not limited to the following: Issue a formal written reprimand Impose educational sanctions, such as completing a workshop on plagiarism or academic ethics Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the assignment (a given grade is ultimately the prerogative of the instructor) Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the course Recommend to the instructor that the student receive a course grade penalty less severe than failure of the course Place the student on disciplinary probation for a specified period of time or until defined conditions are met. The probation will be noted on the student's transcript and internal record while it is in force. In cases serious enough to warrant suspension or expulsion from the university, refer the matter to the Student Conduct Board for consideration. Additional educational sanctions may be imposed. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Withdrawing from the course will not prevent the academic integrity officer or hearing panel from adjudicating the case, imposing sanctions or recommending grade penalties, including a failing grade in the course. 13Bulletin 2020-21 About Washington University in St. Louis (01/15/21) A copy of the sanction letter will be placed in the student's academic file. Appeals If a student believes the academic integrity officer or the committee did not conduct a fair hearing or if a student believes the sanction imposed for misconduct is excessive, they may appeal to the Student Conduct Board within 14 days of the original decision. Appeals are governed by Section VII C of the Student Conduct Code. Records Administrative Record-Keeping Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the academic integrity officer in each school to keep accurate, confidential records concerning academic integrity violations. When a student has been found to have acted dishonestly, a letter summarizing the allegation, the outcome and the sanction shall be placed in the student's official file in the office of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. In addition, each school's academic integrity officer shall make a report of the outcome of every formal accusation of student academic misconduct to the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards, who shall maintain a record of each incident. Multiple Offenses When a student is formally accused of academic misconduct and a hearing is to be held by an academic integrity officer, a committee, or the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, the person in charge of administering the hearing shall query the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards about the student(s) accused of misconduct. The director shall provide any information in the records concerning that student to the integrity officer. Such information will be used in determining sanctions only if the student is found to have acted dishonestly in the present case. Evidence of past misconduct may not be used to resolve the issue of whether a student has acted dishonestly in a subsequent case. Reports to Faculty and Student Body School and college academic integrity officers are encouraged to make periodic (at least annual) reports to the students and faculty of their school concerning accusations of academic misconduct and the outcomes, without disclosing specific information that would allow identification of the student(s) involved.Graduate Student Academic Integrity Policies For graduate student academic integrity policies, please refer to each individual graduate school.

This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of food cultural studies and to its theories, methods and practices. The course also uses the topics of food studies to train students into different forms of public writing, including reviews, longform magazine essays, blogs and others. The course will discuss the ways in which different disciplines focus on the study of food (including history, anthropology, philosophy and others), basic elements of global food history (the medieval spice trade, the Columbian Exchange, the role of colonialism and empire, and so on), case studies around different cuisines (including but not limited to Mexican, Italian, and Chinese), and the work of some of the major food writers of our time (e.g., Samin Nosrat, Michael Pollan). Credit 3 units. - Graduate (01/15/21) U96 DLA 604 Contemporary Latin American Female Writers This course examines the newest and most cutting-edge novels and short story collections by women writers in Latin America. We will develop a set of tools for literary analysis in order to examine these works from the point of view of style and literary expression, but we will also examine how these young authors engage with the issues facing women in the region today, including politically and sexually motivated violence, collective memory, gender and race, and citizenship. We will also address what it means to be a Latin American woman author in the 21st century, and we will look at issues including structural barriers in the industry, institutional erasure, sexism and the literary canon. Evaluation will be based on writing assignments and on a multimedia portfolio addressing a writer of the student's choice, which they will present to the instructor and the class at the end of the semester.

Students will analyze works from at least four disciplines (e.g., literature, art history, film, history, philosophy, women and gender studies, religion, political science, anthropology, history of science) and write a progressive research paper, submitted and reviewed incrementally, that demonstrates comparative, analytic, and critical thinking. Course topic changes each semester. Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 606 Darwin, Marx, and Wagner This seminar studies three works completed in 1859 that profoundly influenced all western thought to the present day: Karl Marx's Treatise on Political Economy , Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, and Richard Wagner's Tristan and Isolde . We will explore how these three works share remarkable and intriguing parallels: an inherent belief in evolution; materialism permeated with romanticism; faith in progress; and a similar (\"dialectical\") approach to understanding the dynamics of change, the application of change in all aspects of the natural and social the world. These three works will enable the class to consider aspects of 19th- century intellectual, economic, and social sociopolitical history. No special knowledge of biology, political science, or music is required. Same as U98 MLA 505 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 607 Humanizing Technology In order to explore the ways that technology had changed the way we read and write, this course examines the myriad ways that technology and the humanities interact in shaping culture and identity in contemporary society. We will study the interactions between the internet and literature, examining the ways that short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and novels like Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson have first shaped the ways that we use and think about the internet. We will investigate new approaches to writing inspired by digital technology with the Bolivian novelist Edmundo Paz Sold\u00e1n's novel Turing's Delirium .The class will consider the development of a technological posthuman identity in society, literature, and films through an analysis of Philip K. Dick's novel Ubik, the film The Matrix , along with the work of cultural theorists Donna Haraway (\"A Cyborg Manifesto\") and Katherine Hayles ( How We Became Posthuman ). To examine the development of digital humanities as a discipline, students will read selections from Jerome McGann, Radiant Textuality and Schreibman, Siemens, and Unsworth, A Companion to Digital Humanities . Same as U98 MLA 5072 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 6117 Popular Culture in Latin America This course examines popular culture in Latin America both as it thrives today and as it has developed historically since the 1800s, when countries achieved their independence. We will study different forms of cultural practice, analyzing how they become \"popular\" and how they involve connections between artistic expression, politics, economics, ethnicity, and race. The class will consider differences between \"high culture\" and popular culture; folklore traditions; the impact of modernization and the dream of \"being modern\"; the role of the media; and the growth of globalized popular culture. Our cultural geography will survey the gauchos (cowboys) of Argentina and Uruguay; national dances such as salsa and reggaeton in the Caribbean; forms of cultural resistance to military rule in Chile; and the pervasive economic, political, and emotional power of soccer (f\u00fatbol). Students will examine the best-selling novel The Gaucho Juan Moreira, the engaging political essay \"The Open Veins of Latin America,\" stories of urban life, and contemporary texts that explore the rise of populism (elites vs. others), dictatorship and social revolution, and the immigrant experience. We will also consider examples of music; films including The Secret in Their Eyes and Paper in the Wind; and a pair of riveting television series (telenovelas) from Mexico and Argentina. Same as U98 MLA 5117 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 620 DLA Counterpoints and Flashpoints: Topic for Spring 2019: The Experience of Modernity This course explores what it means to be modern. Our expansive study will engage the concept of radical change as it affects a range of historical periods and geographical areas. Er will consider how modernity entails a break away from tradition; the development of new intellectual, scientific, and geographic frontiers; and the experimentation with new technologies and art forms as a way of creating new futures and ruptures with the past. Examining questions of time, space, innovation, and translation, we will study key literary and cultural works that express a groundbreaking sense of modernity and revolution in ways that highlight epistemological, political, and social tensions. Works studied include Cervantes's Don Quixote, Blake's poems, Wharton's Age of Innocence, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Lorca's Poet in New York, Achebe's Things Fall Apart, and Lispector's Hour of the Star. We will also discuss Dal\u00ed's collaboration with Bu\u00f1uel in their film An Andalusian Dog [Un Chien Andalou], along with Kurosawa's Rashomon and other visual works that capture the inventions, uncertainties, and energy of the modern experience.

Each topic will focus on a certain type of art (although not exclusively) and on one or more mental faculties: How do pictures represent? How do we understand stories and what roles do they play in the life of the mind? What do we like in the arts and why, according to psychological theories based on brain research? What is style in the arts and can there be a scientific explanation of its history? A parallel concern is with how distinctive features of the arts might shed special light on the nature of the mind. Readings will include essays by prominent art historians, philosophers, psychologists, and scientists. Same as U98 MLA 5310 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 633 Against the Grain: Transgression and Controversy in Modern Art This course will examine the public controversies that have surrounded the development of modern art over the last 150 years to probe the question of the social and political functions of transgressive art. After reviewing key theories of the avant- garde, we will analyze both the persona of the modern artist (Gauguin, Picasso, Pollock) and the place of women artists in the revolutions of modernism (Cassatt, H\u00f6ch, Kahlo). A key issue to address is how modernism tests limits by asking what is (and what is not) art (Duchamp, Brancusi). Some of the most controversial exhibitions in this time frame, from the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1863 to Mirroring Evil in 2002, highlight the challenges raised by modern artists' treatment of the body. Debates waged over public art in St. Louis and recent controversies over public funding of contemporary art will close the course. No prior knowledge of art history required. Same as U98 MLA 5301 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 643 Imagining Germany in the Long 19th Century Between the start of the French Revolution (1789) and the outbreak of the First World War (1914), Germany was transformed from a patchwork of over 300 sovereign territories into a unified nation-state with immense political and economic power. This course examines the crucial role played by literature and the arts in creating a sense of a German national community during this period. Our materials will include national anthems, fairy tales, painting, public monumental art, opera, essays, propaganda, and popular culture, and we will investigate these materials with an eye toward the different and sometimes opposing visions of the nation and national character to which they give expression. Within this broader context, we will address the perceived contribution of men, women, and the family to the project of nation building; the role of language, of national heroes and legends, and of geography in creating a sense of unity; and the ways in which national identity is defined in opposition to a perceived Other (in this case, France). We will also consider Zionism as an offshoot of the European nationalisms and a response to anti-Semitism in Germany. Works studied include fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm; essays and poems by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, and Berthold Auerbach; Germany, A Winter's Tale by Heinrich Heine; The Patrioteer by Heinrich Mann; and The Jewish State by Theodor Herzl. Credit 3 units.U96 DLA 645 Global Cinema: A Love Story Focusing on the ubiquity of love stories in cinema, this seminar will explore connections between romance, anxieties, and aspirations in contemporary society. Studying celebrated films from the United States ( When Harry Met Sally, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ), Latin America (Love in the Time of Hysteria ), Europe ( Amelie, Caf\u00e9 au Lait ), Lunchbox ), and East Asia ( 2046, Happy Together), among others, we will consider how love functions as a symptom of what ails society. The class will examine not only personal relationships but also social structures, economic systems, and political conflicts. Topics will cover issues of class, gender, and race; the construction of economic identities; and the formal structures and aesthetics of film. Students will be required to watch two films per week as well as to complete selected short readings. Same as U98 MLA 5450 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 6464 Medicine and Morality in Global Perspective What does it mean to be sick? What does it mean to be a patient, or a healer? Is it possible to imagine a universal morality in which our understanding of medical ethics is shared among peoples worldwide? What are some of the ethical dilemmas associated with genetic testing, organ transplants, and global disparities in health? Framed by these questions, our class will examine how culture shapes our concepts of disease and our expectations for treatment. Similarly, we will consider how social class, race, and ethnicity influence both health and access to health care worldwide. Our readings will focus on medical history and the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of disease; health disparities; the varying relations of patients and healers in different cultures; African health crises; public health controversies; folk illness in Latin America; medical technologies and ethical conflicts; and other issues of medical anthropology pertaining to the prevention and treatment of illness and the healing process around the globe. We will also discuss three documentaries: Frontline: Sickness Around the World; Donka: X-Ray of an African Hospital (Doctors Without Borders); and Dan Rather Reports: Kidney Pirates (with anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes).

U96 DLA 665 From Mikado to Makudo: A Literary View of Japan This course will survey Japan's social and cultural history through selected literary works that span the seventh century (Mikado) to the present day (Makudo). Our readings \u2014 including fiction, poetry, drama, and personal writings \u2014 will serve as guides to key historical epochs: the aristocratic culture of the Heian era ( Tale of Genji ), the warrior society of the medieval era (Tale of the Heike ), and the Tanizaki, Mishima, and Oe will expose the complexities of modern Japan. Students will gain an appreciation of Japan's unique heritage, social complexity, and place in East Asia and the world today. Same as U98 MLA 5565 Credit 3 units. UColl: CD 19Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) U96 DLA 667 Translating Worlds This course studies different forms of cultural translation, that is, the communication of knowledge, behavior, and language from one culture to another. We will examine how an author reworks earlier and foreign traditions, adapting ideas and practices for which there may be no direct equivalent in the author's own culture. In the new cultural setting, do the roles of men and women shift? Do questions of ethnicity, class, religion, and sexuality become more pronounced, or do they fade away? These questions will frame our study of historic cultural encounters, colonialism, exile, and other processes that shape modernity. Students will explore two dramatic points of cultural intersection: Tolkien's modern reworking of Sir Orfeo, a medieval version of the classical myth of the musician Orpheus and his wife Eurydice; and Goethe's Italian Journey, the journal of the German writer's experiences with the people, art, and history that he encountered during his travels. We will see how diaspora and migration shape perceptions in works by Alejo Carpentier ( The Kingdom of this and Jhumpa Lahiri ( Interpreter of Maladies ). The class will also learn how different scholarly and artistic fields address the concept of cultural translation, including cultural anthropology (James Clifford), film adaptation (Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, inspired by Chekhov's play), and colonial history (Vicente Rafael). In addition, we will discuss how digital technology affects cultural translation today (Google Translate, and projects using geographic information system [GIS] technology). Students will consider challenges facing the humanities and the sciences as these technologies advance. Will it be possible to make all knowledge, and all culturally-specific information, universally accessible? No foreign language experience required. Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 675 From Buggy to Benz: Global Capitalism, Gender, and Race In this course, students will examine global capitalism with particular attention to how it intersects with gender, race, and place in specific historical moments. Using critical, historical, and ethnographic perspectives, we will consider the emergence of and changes in capitalism and how it relies on and reproduces particular gender, racial/ethnic, and other hierarchies. Course materials will draw examples from around the world and will include novels, ethnographic and historical case studies, social theory, films, and articles from the popular media. Through written assignments, students will demonstrate the ability to examine the impact of capitalism on the environment, health, indigenous and marginalized groups, policy, and access to education, jobs, housing, and other resources. Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 676 Haunting the World: Refugees in Literature & Film By 2019, 65.8 million people (or 1 in 113 individuals) will have been forcibly displaced within their own countries or across borders. In this course, we will study literary texts, film, and other forms of cultural production that will provide a window into the complex lives of displaced individuals from World War II to the present. In addition to contextualizing the historical and legal significance of such terms as refugee, asylum, sanctuary, non-refoulement, and forced displacement, our discussions will also allow us to engage with the broader meanings of concepts that include human rights, hospitality, identity, belonging, andcitizenship. The course will move chronologically from the early 20th century to the present; the last part of the semester will focus specifically on new forms of storytelling that have emerged as a response to the current \"crisis.\" Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 678 Representing Religion, Race, and Gender in Early Modern Latin America This seminar explores the history of religion, gender, and empire in Latin America, focusing primarily on the colonial period (1492-1821) but including some precolonial materials. Through primary documents, secondary scholarship, and student- centered discussions, we will consider connections between religious beliefs, gender norms and relations, and the ways that race, class, and gender intersected with ideas about religion, empire, and power. We will study the clash of religions that occurred during the conquest and its terrible aftermath; the politics of evangelization; and how marginalized subjects such as women, African slaves, and Indigenous peoples navigated religious authoritarianism to develop their own spiritual beliefs and expressions. Finally, we will take a brief look at how some of these religious practices have persisted until the present day and what these legacies can tell us about questions of race and gender in a religious context in Latin America. This course will also introduce students to key research methods in the humanities and to the conventions of graduate-level writing necessary for completing the degree thesis. Credit 3 units.

American Culture Studies The Master of Arts in American Culture Studies addresses the intellectual and moral questions of American identity and belonging that no single disciplinary perspective can comprehensively and satisfyingly resolve. What does it mean to live and work in an American culture devoted to individual success and autonomy and at the same time be a citizen of a nation devoted to collective needs and well-being? The Master of Arts in American Culture Studies provides the instruction , both in specific disciplines and in cross-disciplinary conversations, to help students answer important questions about American society. It also introduces some of the social, political and cultural issues that have shaped American culture and identity. Most fundamentally, it provides a critical skill set that fosters the analysis of an array of cultural objects \u2014 a place, an event, a work of art, a political institution \u2014 from a rich and diverse foundation of knowledge and perspectives. Students' studies culminate in a self-directed project that allows them to explore an area of personal interest while participating in a multidisciplinary scholarly community. Part of the excitement of this kind of learning is the opportunity to engage in creative, rigorous exchange with faculty in the humanities and social sciences at Washington University in St. Louis as well as with leading practitioners in the St. Louis professional and policy world.Studies may span American literature, history, politics, religion, philosophy, art, music and film.

U89 AMCS 412 Sports and Culture: Reading Race and Racism Through Spectator Sports This course will examine the role of spectator sports in American life, seeking to understand the way athletics have influenced the politics and discourse of the United States and its citizens. In particular, we will consider the prominent role sports have played in affecting the way Americans understand race and racism. We will focus on athletes of significance since the Civil War, including Isaac Burns Murphy, Jack Johnson, Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, and others. At the same time, we will examine how media shapes our understanding of athletes and the competitions we consume. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACS U89 AMCS 413 Writing the Documentary Lyric This course explores American culture through poetic accounts that focus on the personal experience of social issues ranging from ecological crisis, consumer culture, race, labor, war, and autobiography as coextensive with local history. Students will blend research with creative writing, reading exemplary texts (such as Birdlovers, Backyard ; Giscombe Road ; Citizen; Port of Los Angeles ; Shut Up, Shut Down ; and 100 Notes on Violence ) while producing their own creative work. The readings and writings will be focused on documentary writing which incorporates quotations from daily life, the news, films, diaries, public documents, and maps. The readings studied are \"lyric\" instead of journalistic, following a poetic approach that connects inner experience and outer event, intimate and distant occurrences, people and places, private and public life. Students will engage in weekly creative-writing exercises while developing a final research-based creative-writing project. The course will include conversations with some of our books' authors, who will offer insights into their processes of cultural research grounded in personal experience and language-conscious cultural critique. This course will count toward the major in American culture studies for day students. This course fulfills the Art distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF U89 AMCS 4151 Nonfiction: Reading and Writing the Memoir Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 420 The History of American Architecture This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of American architecture. Throughout readings that will include a survey text in addition to topical works covering the social history of housing, the vernacular architecture of Las Vegas and the rise (and fall, and rise) of Frank Lloyd Wright, students will learn the definitive characteristics of American architecture. A centralpoint of study will be examining contradictory tendencies in the American practice of architecture: the embrace of exceptionalism through modern forms and styles representing a new national identity, occurring alongside the emulation of classical and European precedents to legitimate a new nation's buildings. The readings will illuminate how the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic and political structures of its production. Ultimately, students will be able to read an American building to discern evidence of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility. This course will count toward major in American Culture Studies for day students. This course fulfills the Humanities distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. It also counts toward the MD and some concentration area requirements for the AMCS major and minor. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 4220 The Presidency and American Political Culture This course seeks to analyze the ways in which the President of the United States is not only a political, but a symbolic head of the nation. This process of constructing the nation is mutually constitutive, in which the president works to construct the nation by rhetorically and materially uniting it, and the people construct the presidency, both in the powers they confer upon it and the ways in which they imagine its significance. Along with more traditional definitions of political power, this course will examine the presidential use of power through rhetoric and self-portrayal in such forms as portraiture and campaigns. Also included are the people's depictions of the presidency, such as photography, monumental architecture, and popular films. The specific case studies of presidential administrations include James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 423 Topics in American Politics Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 4331 Illness and the American Cultural Imagination This multidisciplinary course examines how representations of illness in America reveal a culture that is always negotiating philosophical, ethical, and political questions about the body and disease. We will study a range of texts \u2014 medical articles, religious treatises, films, and history of public health \u2014 with a particular emphasis on fiction. Students will be asked to consider the distinction scholar Arthur Kleinman makes between illness and disease \u2014 illness as the patient's experience and disease as medicine's focus \u2014 in order to negotiate the subjective experience of illness and the biological reality of disease. We will explore how we understand illness through our metaphorical descriptions of it, our characterizations of those who contract it, and our visions of who/what cures it. Readings will demonstrate shifts in both popular and medical views of illness as we think about how different historical periods are marked by a preoccupation with specific diseases: small-pox, yellow fever, cholera, tuberculosis, polio, cancer, AIDS, etc. This course fulfills the Humanities and Social Science distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACS 22Bulletin University College AMCS 4400 How're Things at Home? Family, Domestic Life and Material Culture Since the Civil War This multidisciplinary course is a study of the cultural meanings of the objects with which Americans surround themselves and define their worlds \u2014 particularly in the spaces of the home. These domestic things \u2014 from the decorative to the utilitarian, the locally-made to the globally-circulated \u2014 have animated the cultural imagination often in the last 150 years, evoking ideas of individualism, private enterprise, personal identity, national security, the nuclear family, and the dangers of industrialization and greed. They have also symbolized American heritage and personal as well as collective memory, motivating a preservation movement that continues to influence views of the past today. And they have served as sites of cultural critique, as in the work of Marx, Veblen and Baudrillard. As we explore some of the dramatic shifts in material life occasioned by the rise of consumer capitalism, and look at objects of particular significance during this period, we will also consider influential theories and models of material culture study. Local cultural sites and museum collections will serve as laboratories for our work, and will likely require a couple visits outside of class time (which will be scheduled with input from the students). Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACS U89 AMCS 4402 Gateway to the Atomic Age: St. Louis and Nuclear Legacies of the Cold War This course studies radioactive waste sites and illness in the vicinity of St. Louis arising from the region's contribution to nuclear weapons production in the 20th century. We will examine the context of Cold War nuclear production and subsequent attempts to address its consequences for environment and health, with attention to political pressures, public understanding, and scientific knowledge, together with the universe of federal regulation and compensation emerging around the atom since 1945. Source material will include federal reports and correspondence produced by state agencies, journalistic and scholarly accounts, and mass media evidence generated from the early 20th century to the present. Includes field trips to local sites. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 442 Reading Historical Figures: Cultural Analysis and Afterlives Walt Whitman famously wrote, \"If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\" Although we will not be looking under any bootsoles in this course, we will be looking for -- and finding -- U.S. historical figures everywhere in contemporary culture, from television and film to fiction, advertising, and social media. During the semester, Whitman will serve as our case study, and students will be asked to read his poetry and prose. However, our ultimate aim is more wide-reaching. This course approaches a broad question -- What is American identity now? -- from a specific point of reference: the afterlives of figures from the past who are increasingly important to our modern national identity. During the semester, each student will undertake their own research project centered on a figure from the past whose presence in American life looms large today, such as Audre Lorde, Che Guevara, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James Baldwin, or Alexander Hamilton, among others. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, HSM, HUSU89 AMCS 444 American Conspiracy This course will trace the prevalence and power of modern conspiracy theories in American culture that have their roots in the birth of the republic and continue to flourish today. We will analyze the specificity of conspiracy theories \u2014 UFOs, Communists, the Moon landing, JFK's assassination, AIDS and the CIA, 9/11 Truthers \u2014 but our purpose will be to \"theorize\" the conspiracy theory. How do Americans perceive and misperceive their culture, and for what ends? Much of our work will be methodological insofar as distrust and paranoia are produced in many realms \u2014 psychological, social, political \u2014 and we must organize and analyze these overlapping anxieties in our practice of American culture studies. This course fulfills the Humanities distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 445 Introduction to American Culture Studies This course will introduce students to the history and methods of the interdisciplinary field of American studies. Questions we will ask throughout the semester include: How do we define \"culture,\" and how has that definition changed over time? What are the social, intellectual, and political stakes of how we define culture and the ways we study it? Throughout the semester, students will have the opportunity to read published work by AMCS-affiliated faculty, who will join the class to discuss their work and the practice of American studies. While the course will use AMCS's four program initiatives \u2014 American Intimacies, Modern Segregation, Visual and Material Culture, and Performance and Pop Culture \u2014 as a means to consider the range of analytical methods commonly utilized by American studies scholars, the course will be useful to students in other fields interested learning more about social and cultural history and/or cultural studies.

A&S IQ: HUM Art: HUM Ifemelu: Gender and the Fall(s) Gender and The Fall(s) will explore perceptions of gender, \"virtue,\" and fallenness throughout history and in different cultural contexts by focusing on a broad range of literary representations of women and men. We will read a series of works from multiple genres and cultures in order to examine how each text constructs, interrogates, contests, and/or promotes the concept of fallenness. We will be particularly interested in the interactions and constructions of fallenness and gender roles. How do these authors construct, envision, and re-envision the (their) fall(s) over time, and how are historical gender roles reified or revised by these authors? We will review scholarly texts from an array of disciplines such as psychology, English, history, autobiography, sociology, and political science in order to gain a multidisciplinary, academic framework in which to understand these falls. The course will also include other interdisciplinary elements such as film and art. Time will be dedicated to analyses of samples from various film versions of select works, focusing on these films' own 20th- and 21st- century perceptions of the texts. We will also examine famous pieces of art that seek to illustrate and interpret the concept of fallenness. This course is fully online.

UColl: OLI U89 AMCS 464 The Seductive Bargain: Fake News and the Controversies of the 2016 Election The aftermath of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and election victory galvanized public attention with regard to how commonplace digital technologies were used to promote agendas at odds with liberal democratic values. The proliferation of fake news, hate speech, missing emails, trolling activity, and voting hacking as well as the spectre of Russian interference eroded confidence in the security of market-dominant technologies and the stability of political institutions. Bad actors weaponizing seemingly benign social media technologies shook the tech industry and drew the ire of politicians. At the same time, the public learned anew how the industry collected and capitalized on user information for corporate profit. These realizations reignited debate about tech company accountability, platform security, free speech, privacy, and national security, and it cast these concerns as symptoms of a democracy under siege. In this class, we will investigate the cultural and political fallout of the nefarious subversion campaigns that defined the 2016 election and center these activities within the broader historical context, including the Facebook scandals of 2016 and 2017, the Edward Snowden leaks of 2012, the emergence of internet culture in the 1990s, and the protest movement against data aggregation of the 1960s. From this will emerge a deeper understanding of the complex issues related to privacy, free speech, business practices, and national security as well as of frameworks for considering the ethical, legal, and moral implications of a culture deeply wedded to technologies of convenience. This course fulfills the Humanities or Social Science distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. The course may also count toward the undergraduate major or minor. Credit 3 units.

U89 AMCS 469 Television and American Culture: 1950-1970 Since its widespread debut in the 1950s, television has become the primary medium for the circulation of information and storytelling in American society. This course takes a thorough look at the introduction of this art form and explores its contributions to the American cultural imagination its first20 years. We will view and analyze series from the 1950s and 1960s, and consider the representation of nation, family, gender, ethnicity, and other issues debated in norms and policies of this era. We will also examine the introduction of television into the home, exploring how an appliance could affect notions of community and family. Students will leave the class with an understanding of the complicated and contested role television played in the establishment of the post-WWII economy and as a mainstream arbiter of 1960s social movements. Prerequisite: Refer to course listings. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 4692 Perspectives on America in the 1950s and 1960s This course will combine an effort to explicate particular \"texts\" with an exploration of how such things might be at once a way into and the product of a particular time and place. The material for our study will be drawn from the rich cultural tumult of post- war America and will include such books as The Catcher in the Rye; The Invisible Man ; The Lonely Crowd; The Feminine Mystique; On the Road ; JB; The Making of a Counter Culture ; and Armies of the Night . Additional texts will include movies, political speeches, and such events as the Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate, the marches on Washington, and the 1968 Democratic National Convention. This course is designed for graduate students with a strong interest in doing research on some aspect of American culture and who will bring the perspectives of their home departments to this interdisciplinary class. Undergraduate admission with instructor's permission only. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 474 Studies in American Cultural Identity: The Civil War to the Jazz Age The course is an exploration of later 19th- to early 20th-century American literary, visual, and musical art in relation to key themes, decisive moments, and cultural developments which have shaped and defined our national character. Struggles for religious, racial, and gender rights; American violence; our polarities of innocence and experience, of individual and group welfare, individualism and conformity; and complex expressions of The American Dream and its dreamers, all receive attention. We view American Post-Romantic, Realistic, Naturalistic, and Post-World War I visual art, architecture, and photography; listen to late 19th-century, turn of the century, and Jazz Age music; and read from major and less well-known literary figures to consider how the social and political developments of the time influenced our artists as the flourishing of a distinctly American art became an internationally acknowledged fact. The course counts toward the American culture studies major for day students, and fulfills the Humanities or Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS master's program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 475D Landscapes Through Time: The History of St. Louis' Built Environment From the Mississippian mound builders to the urban conditions of the present day, this course will investigate the different approaches of various cultures to creating built environments that meet the needs of their time in terms of landscapes and structures. Using the City of St. Louis and particularly its riverfront district as an example, the course will examine the layout and infrastructure of the city at various periods, discussing the effects of technological changes in the creation 24Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) of structures, improvements to transportation and sanitation, facilitation of trade and the effects of these forces on the cultural and built landscape of the city. We cover the structures and landscapes that defined individual eras in the history of the city, and the ways in which these were successful or unsuccessful. Further, the course investigates the cultural needs, whims and desires that dictated certain types of structures and landscapes for civic, recreational, commercial, residential and religious purposes. Students will be expected to make a short 15-20 minute presentation to the class on a local structure, based on a personal field trip to the site, during the course of the semester. Credit 3 units.

UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 4781 St. Louis in the 1870s: From Revolution to Reaction This course will examine the decade of the 1870s in the United States through the lens of events and occurrences in St. Louis that helped to shape the city and the nation. St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the United States at the time (or claimed to be), and its central position astride the nation's major travel arteries seemed to ensure its continued growth and well-being. However, the growth of Chicago to the north worried many St. Louis business leaders, and the rise of the railroads -- in combination with the \"punishment\" of St. Louis as a southern city in the aftermath of the Civil War -- caused many to question whether the city's future was indeed a rosy one. Meanwhile, St. Louis wrestled with its own internal demons of race and civil rights, political corruption, and labor strife. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACS U89 AMCS 478A American Folklore in Context For the last several election cycles, candidates and supporters from across the political spectrum have invoked \"the real American.\" But what does it mean to be authentically American? A simple answer might be that they are \"us.\" A more complex one requires that we dive into American folklore. The scholarly field of Folklore may be defined loosely as exploring what we say, what we do, and what we believe. Following this schema, this course will probe the question of what it means to be \"American folk\" by examining how folklore informs and shapes the world around us and our everyday lives. More particularly, we ask how race and ethnicity, class and gender are encoded and contested through folk expression. Beginning with the question \"who are the folk,\" we will look at classic and contemporary texts in folklore studies to explore how our food, our stories, our daily rituals, and our music, to name a few, interweave to create a complex, multilayered, and uniquely American folk. Readings pair specific genres with different theoretical approaches and include jokes, urban legends, folktales, foodways, music, and material culture. Crucially, we seek to trouble popular notions of folklore as \"antiquities\" to question how the lens of Folklore studies may reveal how American culture not only consists of folklore but is constructed by it as folk forms are deployed in contemporary contexts, from Slenderman to Snopes to modern slave auctions. The course will entail several small collection projects to give students an understanding of the work a folklorist does in the field and how folklore is coproduced within a community, and a longer research project. This course satisfies the Humanities requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies.Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 480A Death Becomes Us: Death, Culture, and Necrofolklore That everyone dies is an oft-repeated truism, but it is equally true that we cannot seem to stop talking about death. Death graces folklore new and old: it dances macabre through our folk tales and ballads; we relish it in our murder mysteries, legends, and true crime podcasts; and we have built rituals and industries around it. We live with death, and we are haunted by death. Drawing on texts from folklore studies, American studies, history, and popular culture, this course will look at how American people think about and react to death. The course is roughly divided into three sections. We will begin with how we talk about death in ballads, legends, and jokes. Following this, we will consider the material problem presented when someone dies. The course will conclude with an investigation of the threat of the unrestful dead. Throughout, we will examine how folklore mitigates and mediates the unknowability of death, often in unexpected ways. We may have a field trip to Bellefontaine Cemetery. This course satisfies the humanities or arts distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. This course can also count toward the undergraduate major or minor. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 482 And Justice for All? American Inequalities In this course we examine social inequality in the contemporary United States, with a particular focus on disparities related to health, wealth, housing and neighborhoods, criminal justice, and education. The St. Louis metropolitan region will serve as a guiding case study, tying together the course themes with a common example of how inequality shapes material and political life. We will investigate the current empirical reality and historical roots of American inequality, the key theories and methodological tools used to examine and explain inequality, the institutions responsible for its reproduction, and possibilities for reducing inequality via social policy and social movement. Within each topic area, we will pay special attention to the significance of race and ethnicity, social class, and gender \u2014 as well as their intersections and cleavages. We will largely constrain our inspection of inequality to American metropolitan areas as we analyze the spatial or place-based effects associated with disparities in urban America. Readings are drawn from sociology, urban history, geography, political science, economics, social epidemiology, and education. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACS U89 AMCS 483 Race and Real Estate in St. Louis 1869 to Present This course analyzes how real estate continues to influence the racial history of St. Louis, focusing on the laws, policies, and practices that have shaped and hardened racial divides in this city. While race-based policy in St. Louis has resulted in a sharp black/white divide, these legal instruments of exclusion were developed in tandem with an increasingly robust taxonomy of racial classifications across the globe. Thus, the course is focused on one city and its unique racial dynamics, but we will also put St. Louis history in the context of the history of ethnology and the rise of racial science. We will conduct primary- source research in the St. Louis city and county archives, the Missouri History Museum Library, and the office of the recorder of deeds. We also will read about St. Louis' unique history of 19th-century privatized urban infrastructure, the city's industrial 25Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) boom and post-industrial bust, suburbanization, urban decline, and gentrification in the 21st century. We will conduct research on specific parcels of property in the city, tracing not only the residents of the property, but also the chain of ownership. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACS U89 AMCS 485 Worth a Thousand Words: American Visual History and Methods \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" \"The camera never lies.\" These idioms capture our collective understanding of photography as a form of visual evidence, demonstrating our faith in a photograph's operation as \"proof.\" At the same time, American history is full of examples of photographic practices that manipulated or otherwise challenged this assumption. This seeming contradiction invites us to think critically about photographs' function as historical documents and how we use them to write history. Students in this course will study historical examples of Americans' use of photography to challenge negative stereotypes, pursue economic opportunity, and claim civil rights. We will also examine the different ways that scholars use photographic images and archives to study American culture and history. Through class visits to archives on and near campus, students will become acquainted with the visual resources available to them and the procedures for conducting research in those archives. Students will increase their visual competencies by working closely with images sourced from these archives as well as their own family and personal photography collections. Reading and writing assignments will introduce students to key theories of visual history and archives, examine case studies in American visual history, and build toward a final research project, designed in collaboration with the instructor, related to the student's broader research interests. This course fulfills the Humanities or Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. The course may also count towards the undergraduate major or minor. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 486H The End of All Things: Technology and the Narratives of Imagined Futures Stories of apocalyptic ruin or dystopias of oppression or of individual denigration typically feature tech as levers for enslavement, murder, destruction, or stifling social control -- in other words: bad things. By contrast, utopian strategies generally arc away from cataclysm and toward the perfected ideals of cooperative social and political beneficence brought about, at least in part, by technological innovation. No matter the flavor, these narratives imagine futures near and far as spaces of radical departure from contemporary contexts where authors experiment with critiques of culture, power, and morality. But in such spaces, how can technology be both the bellwether of pacified and harmonious societies and the instrumentation of dehumanization and destruction? In this course, we will examine the role of technology in the North American narratives of demise and salvation from the 19th century through our cultural moment, sampling from novels, short stories, film, and a modernist stage play. We will examine these narratives as literary texts, interrogating their plots, devices, and the historical construction of the genres in which they participate. We will also study these as cultural objects addressing political, theological, social, and feminist anxieties of their time, carefully unwinding how the technological threads cultural commentary into forecasts of future realities.

U89 AMCS 490A St. Louis Blues: The Musical History of a City From bustling Mississippian city to frontier port town to the eclectic, innovative, storied metropolis of today, St. Louis never seems to stand still. In this course, we will explore the history of St. Louis through the musics that have been made, sustained, and remembered here. In the words of ethnomusicologist John Blacking, music is nothing less than \"soundly organized humanity.\" Our musical investigation will lead us to consider how St. Louis-area residents have constructed geography, place, ownership, and identity. We will progress through several chronological-topical units that engage with race/ethnicity, class, regional identity, and cultural memory. Celebrities and musical icons such as Chuck Berry and Tina Turner will share our attention with grassroots and community music-makers such as the musicians of Little Bosnia and the protesters who sounded off sounded during the Ferguson demonstrations. This course satisfies the humanities or arts distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. This course also can count toward the undergraduate major or minor. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 491 \"St. Louis Got the Best of Me\": Music in American Culture This course will explore how music functions as a folklore, centering on the many musical styles, musicans, and fans that have shaped St. Louis from the early ragtime to today's diverse music scene. The term \"folk music\" may bring images of banjos and accordions, but every kind of music has a \"folk\" \u2014 folk who use music to represent their identities, their beliefs, and their struggles. Throughout the semester, students will question what \"American\" music sounds like and what happens to music and culture as it is played, recorded, and represented. St. Louis provides us with a hothouse of musical cultures, incubating the blues and Jeff Tweedy, encouraging ethnic traditions from Ireland to Bosnia and beyond, providing a haven for fans like the Juggalos and a nationally renowned superfan, and fostering a homegrown fiddling style all our own. The course will use St. Louis' music culture \u2014 with lots of listening \u2014 to examine what music means to both ingroup and outgroup musicians and listeners, and it will also look at the roles music plays in an ongoing dialogue about authenticity, traditionality, and appropriation between the individual, the community, and the larger society.

U89 AMCS 492 Decoding the City Does the space between a house and the sidewalk tell you something about class? Does a vacant lot on a dead-end street record the forced relocation of thousands of black residents? Can street names narrate the relationship between the growth of the city and national narratives of immigrant assimilation, continental expansion and world wars? The answer to these questions is yes, but it is far from obvious. The built environment of an American city like St. Louis can seem opaque and silent, when actually it is laden with social, economic, political, gender and racial meanings. This course unpacks St. Louis' built environment by drawing broad historic and theoretical readings on urban space to specific local sites. Readings will 26Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) assist students in the interrogation of actual places in St. Louis through field visits, so that the streets become unquiet and the embedded meanings in plain sight. This is a hybrid course, with an online discussion component and weekly field work sessions. Attendance at these field work sessions is mandatory. The course counts toward the American Culture Studies major for day students, and fulfills the Humanities and Social Science requirements for the M.A. Program in American Culture Studies.

This history and creative-writing course explores the contexts and expressions of 20th century and contemporary protest movements, ranging from labor, civil rights, the Vietnam War, ethnic people and women's movements, to contemporary social and environmental justice movements. We will explore speeches, manifestos, visual and oral texts, songs, and poetry to consider how dissent is voiced in response to specific social contexts and historic events. We will consider the role of personal expression in enacting democracy, focusing on poetry that helps articulate what is at stake in the protest movements of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine how language moves people, raising awareness of the facts and felt experiences of injustice, helping to fuel social movements and \"call forth a public\" to make change.

We will develop a set of tools for literary analysis in order to examine these works from the point of view of style and literary expression, and we will also examine how these young authors engage with the issues facing women in the region today, including politically and sexually motivated violence, collective memory, gender and race, and citizenship. We will also address what it means to be a Latin American woman author in the 21st century, and we will look at related issues, including structural barriers in the industry, institutional erasure, sexism and the literary canon. Evaluation will be based on writing assignments and on a multimedia portfolio on a writer of students' choice, which they will present to the instructor and the class at the end of the semester.

U89 AMCS 506 Spiritual Quests in American Culture In contemporary American spiritual questing, Americans find respite from alienation, cynicism, materialism and routine as they seek grounding and growth in spiritual realities. It is often through resistance to the American cultural landscape that individuals search for personal meaning and deeper social connection and understanding. Their quests take many forms, running the gamut from political to monastic. Some are religious, many are not. In this course, we identify and explore American spiritual life within social, political and economic contexts. For historical grounding, we will read A Common Faith by John Dewey and The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James. We will examine recent scholarship on spirituality by reading works by Parker Palmer, Henri Nouwen and Amanda Porterfield among others. We will also read a host of spiritual memoirs by writers such as Elizabeth Gilbert, Kathleen Norris and Anne Lamott. The class will attempt to discern the uniquely American characteristics within the narratives we read. We will also pay special attention to the distinctiveness of spiritual language as it is noted by many writers in the field. Its terms, in general public discourse, are often denigrated, marginalized, sugar-coated or omitted altogether. In this course, we legitimize and lend life to such terms as hope, vision, gratitude, silence, healing, joy and wonder among others. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 507 John Dewey's Vision of American Democracy This course begins with an examination of the life and education of John Dewey. We go on to study some of Dewey's works on democracy and pragmatism with a focus on his commitment to democratic \"methods\" and ideals. We also focus on Dewey's notion that the moral aims and foundations of American democracy distinguish it from other democratic conceptions. We examine how Dewey links his views regarding liberty, community 27Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) and individualism to the domains of education, philosophy and public life. Finally, we ground our studies in an analysis of democracy as it exists in America today, and consider if and how Dewey's theories prevail. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 511 The Legal Landscape in a Changing American Society This course is designed to examine the qualitative relationship between shifts in the transformations in law in America and the structure of American behavioral patterns and values. The course will scrutinize some of the intersections between the transformations in contemporary law and legal practices and the values that Americans impute to their legal system. Potentially, this review will include appraisals of such topics as: (a) Americans' perceptions of their legal agents; (b) claims of excessive litigation; (c) inequalities in access to the legal system; (d) law as mass media events; (e) shifting assessments of liability; (f) malaise over the capacities of juries; (g) the conversion of the legal profession to the business of law; and (h) the elusive costs of attempting to effect justice.

In the war against terrorism, how should the Supreme Court balance the demands of free speech and national security? Should the Supreme Court interpret the First Amendment to permit the government to punish \"hate speech\" about members of minority racial and religious groups? Are computer-generated images of children performing sexual acts protected by the First Amendment? Can government make speech denying the Holocaust a crime?

No previous musical background required. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 5203 America: Through a Glass Darkly This course studies depictions of America by non-Americans. We will examine the social, political, and economic aspects of their accounts and their influence on America's beliefs, policies, and international reputation. The class will consider fundamental values as well as ethnic and gender-based differences. Comparing historical periods from both Western and Eastern perspectives, students will read texts written during the past three centuries from England, France, Germany, Cuba, and China. For the colonial/Revolutionary War period, we will study Charlevoix, History & Description of New France and Cr\u00e8vecoeur, \"Letters from an American Farmer.\" Readings from the 19th century include Tocqueville, Democracy in America ; Frances Trollope, Views of Society and Manners in America ; Dickens, American Notes ; Francis Lieber, The Stranger in America; and newspaper articles by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed.

U89 AMCS 5217 Paint It Black: Understanding American Film Noir A product of highly diverse influences and traditions, film noir is known for its stylized visual aesthetic, crackling dialogue, moral ambivalence, and existential paranoia. Its style and language continue to inform filmmakers in Hollywood and worldwide. This seminar positions the aesthetic shapes and traumatic narratives of film noir within the context of American culture and film history during the war and post-war years. As importantly, it explores film noir as a test case in order to probe notions of film history, genre, and authorship, of cultural and intermedial transfer and the popular. Required screenings will take place during the second half of each week's class.

How does it resonate and influence our politics, advertising, and especially the arts? We will discuss the experience of immigration and assimilation, how foreigners with different cultural backgrounds enter American society. Beginning with the implications of America's image as a \"brave new world\" in European thought and philosophy (including Shakespeare's The Tempest ), and the prescient view of our culture by de Tocqueville and others, we will examine how the dream of success and wealth has been depicted and employed in theater, fiction, cinema, and the visual arts. Texts include: Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , Williams's West's Day of the Locust , Lorraine Hansberry's the Zoo Story\" and \"The American Dream,\" and John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves. We will consider modern painters whose work offers a commentary on the dream, such as Edward Hopper and Andy Warhol. We will also study cinematic innovators from Charlie Chaplin to Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola who have used \"The American Dream\" as significant elements in their work.

U89 AMCS 535 Mark Twain: Humor and Politics in 19th- Century America Mark Twain's unique status as a writer who has become a cultural icon cannot be explained merely in terms of literary gifts and aesthetic achievement. He is America's best-known author in large part because of his engagement with issues central to our institutions and political practice. The \"southwestern\" humorists who profoundly influenced his work used humor as a basis for political commentary and cultural criticism, a traditionto which Twain's own satirical treatment of everything from Congress to juries belongs. This course will examine both the literary achievement of Mark Twain and the ways in which his writings provide a critique \u2014 built over a lifetime \u2014 of American culture, probing the central issues of our politics (domestic and international) and our complicated relationships to one another.

U89 AMCS 536 Heaven and Earth Magic: Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music Harry Smith (1923-1991) was an experimental filmmaker, visionary painter, amateur anthropologist, alchemist, student of occult lore, polymath, and legendary archivist of sediments of human activity in motion. He was also a roots music anthologist whose Anthology of American Folk Music, a six-LP set released in 1952, has been called the founding document of the American folk revival and one of the most influential recorded collections of the second half of the 20th century. This course will explore the musical/cultural context, content and influence of Smith's Anthology. Topics discussed will include the musicians and musical traditions represented on the Anthology, the Anthology's impact on the American folk revival of the 1950s and early 1960s, and the Anthology's role in the emergence of folk-rock and rock in the mid-1960s. The course will also attempt to unravel some of the mysteries still associated with this important but enigmatic collection of American music. No previous musical background is required.

U89 AMCS 537 Women's Health Care in America This course provides a broad historical overview of women's health care in America. We begin with an examination of midwifery in 18th-century America, then look at the increasing medicalization of childbirth and the new emphasis on women's biological difference in the 19th century, and finally study changes in the medical profession and their impact on women's health care in the early to mid-20th century. Through a wide range of material \u2014 including primary texts, such as doctor- authored tracts, diaries, letters, and fiction, as well as secondary material written by historians, feminist scholars, and medical writers \u2014 we trace the changing perceptions and conceptions of women's bodies and health.

Did the Roosevelt presidency influence how Americans of different class, race and gender relate to one another? Did it influence the role of the federal government during two of the most significant events of the 20th century, the Great Depression and the Second World War? We will probe these questions and related issues to assess Roosevelt's historical legacy.

U89 AMCS 549 Greening of Hollywood The class will analyze presentations of the natural world, the environment, and environmental issues in American film. Applying the methodology of ecocriticism, we will examine how American film has responded to and portrayed environmentalism and nature. Combining ecocriticism with film studies, we will discuss how the interaction between audience and film both educates audiences and illustrates the state of environmentalism in American culture. The aim will be to find a common ground between the films' portrayal of environmentalism and nature with discourses that occur publicly. We'll seek to identify any system of images, conventions, languages, and discourses that provide insight into the messages Americans are receiving. Furthermore, by demonstrating how Hollywood portrays environmentalism, nature or environmental problems, the class will pursue a perspective on how Americans are dealing with \"environmental problems,\" its discourses, assumptions and stereotypes.

U89 AMCS 553 Lewis and Clark: Exploration, Discovery, and the Americanization of the West This course examines the 1804-1806 \"Voyage of Discovery\" led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. It will also investigate broader issues of culture by looking at how peoples of different perspectives and cultures interact; how they explore the unknown and try to explain it; how they gather and develop \"knowledge\" and accept or reject information. Through a careful reading of the journals written by members of the Corps of Discovery, related documents, and supplemental scholarship, we will examine the expedition from the perspectives of its participants, Native Americans, African Americans, and the Spanish and French peoples of the borderlands. We will then shift to considering how scholars have investigated themes associated with the expedition. These two pieces are designed to work together, providing both a foundation in the historical specifics of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and a scholarly context for considering North American cultures at the turn of the 19th century. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 555 American in the 1930s: America Responds to the Great Depression The course is a multidisciplinary approach to the 1930s and American responses to the Great Depression. The course will consider the contradictory impulses toward experimental, escapist, documentary, modernist, and reactionary responses. Some of the topics the class will examine are the escapist nature of American cinema during the era, American Literature, the development and popularity of radio, the music of Woody Guthrie, the Federal Arts Project, the rise of documentary style photography, the New York World's Fair, and political activism.

It is, in fact, a multi-dynamic propellant of that evolution. This course examines the genesis and function of American musical genres, and the defining composers and artists who have provided the sonic architecture forsociety's evolution, and continue to define our individual and collective American identities. The Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, World War II, the Sixties Youth Revolution, the Civil Rights movement, etc., can be defined, and were often precipitated, by their signature musical styles and artists. Organized by the chronological occurrence of major cultural, socioeconomic, and geopolitical events occurring in the past century, \"Songs of the American Dream\" is a course designed to examine how the interdependence of music and social identity has nurtured and inspired our individual creative lives.

UColl: ACF U89 AMCS 560 The Constitution in American Political Culture The U.S. Constitution serves not only as the country's supreme law but also as a powerful symbol, frequently deployed and much contested. Its meaning as a symbol derives from longstanding principles and from shared and remembered experience. Although constant in important respects, that meaning has also changed in significant ways over time. This course examines the cultural understanding that the Constitution embodies and the role it plays in American politics, using historical episodes such as the Framing and Reconstruction; recurring issues such as the commerce power and war power; materials such as court opinions, political tracts, public opinion surveys, and official acts; and throughout, the application of constitution-based claims, in both modern and historical contexts.

UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 562 Metropolitan America: Cultures and Landscapes of the 20th-Century City This course introduces students to theories and issues in the study of urban and landscape history. We focus our examination of American cities, their cultures, and their built environments in the metropolitan age. We approach the American city as a landscape of socially and historically produced urban spaces, both public and private, whose forms are the result of multiple negotiations at many levels. We study cities as \"texts,\" as legible palimpsests upon which various groups attempt to inscribe power and resistance. At the same time, we place the \"textual\" city within the broad contexts of political, economic, and cultural forces that shape it over time. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 566 What Were They Thinking? Founding Intent and the Institutions of the U.S. Government When the institutions that structure the U.S. government were formed, they were supported or rejected by different kinds of arguments. Some of these arguments were moral in nature, but most focused on the legal and political effects these institutions would have on the nation. For example, would a low presidential salary encourage only those with pure motives to run for office, or would it encourage bribery and kickbacks once there? Were large electoral districts likely to produce representatives better able to secure the common good, or would the more distant relationship between representative and voter undermine a representative's accountability to their constituents? Using some of the classic texts from the history of American political thought \u2014 including a large portion of the The Federalist \u2014 we will investigate what the founders were thinking when they argued for, and against, the institutions that were proposed. We will look at large, constitutional institutions \u2014 like the Electoral College to select the president \u2014 as well as more recent, non-constitutional 30Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) institutions \u2014 like the Senate filibuster. We will also consider some unsuccessful proposals \u2014 a 20-year presidential term of office, or giving states a veto over federal legislation. Our focus will be unpacking the expected practical effects of these institutions, and ask whether and why these expectations were met. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 567 Machine Politics in the U.S. Machine politics practiced in American cities are unique in the Western world. Machine politics, whether in the form of a hierarchical machine or a more fragmented \"machine style,\" began in the mid-19th century and remains in some cities to this day. More often than not, machine politics is principally located in the Midwest and the eastern United States, home to many immigrant groups. Machine politics functions as a series of exchange relationships \u2014 favors \u2014 regarding employment, contracting, and the licensing of vice. It has provided an informal network of social services although it deals in individual cases and not systemic causes. Machine politics engenders its own code of ethics with a strong emphasis on loyalty. In this course, we will look in depth at a fragmented machine city \u2014 St. Louis \u2014 and the city that had the strongest and most powerful hierarchical machine, Chicago. We will be able to draw comparisons and contrasts and discern how institutions affect political culture and political behavior, including race relations. Credit 3 units.

Avoiding hagiography, legend and appreciation is a primary goal of the course, which will assess these often iconic figures in fresh, resolutely historical terms to understand their place in American popular culture and history. This analysis will be based primarily on audio recordings and film and television appearances, supplemented by textual evidence connected directly to the singers, such as interviews and autobiographies. Recent secondary sources, both historical and critical, will inform the course as well. This course counts toward the AMCS MA distribution requirement in Arts. Credit 3 units.

While not a uniquely American medium, comics have a specifically Americancontext, and the emerging field of comics studies has a particular place and a particular role in the American academy. This course recognizes the importance of graduate students' need to understand the overall cultural and academic importance of visual culture, as represented in sequential art, and the way comics studies, as an emerging field and body of theory, fits into this larger picture. This course will investigate how a new topic (comics) develops a new suite of theory and methodology (sequential art theory) and works its way into the academy. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 575 American Cultural Identity: The Civil War to The Jazz Age In his Letters From An American Farmer, J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur wasn't the first nor will he be the last to encounter the complex issues revealed by even a modest exploration of American identity. We will do so together in this course by examining selected Post-Civil War literature, music, visual art, and popular culture, paying special attention to recurrent themes woven into the fabric of our cultural heritage. It is a truism that understanding cultural patterns of the past provides a benchmark for a grasp of the complexities we find around us today. Learning to translate knowledge from one context to another illustrates one of the course's central themes: how visual, written, and performed art is rarely produced in cultural isolation, but rather from a rich matrix of social, geographic, psychological, political, historic, spiritual, economic, scientific, and accidental developments.

Through primary documents, secondary scholarship and student-centered discussion, we will consider connections between religious beliefs, gender norms and relations, and the ways that race, class, and gender intersected with ideas about religion, empire and power. We will study the clash of religions that occurred during the conquest and its terrible aftermath, the politics of evangelization, and how marginalized subjects such as women, African slaves, and Indigenous peoples navigated religious authoritarianism to develop their own spiritual beliefs and expressions. Finally, we will take a brief look at how some of these religious practices have persisted until the present day and what these legacies can tell us about questions of race and gender in a religious context in Latin America. This course will also introduce students to key research methods in the humanities and to the conventions of graduate-level writing necessary for completing the degree thesis.

UColl: OLH 52Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) International Affairs Breathtaking changes in political, economic and social relations have taken place over the past several centuries. Living and working in a rapidly changing global environment presents great opportunities to advance the human condition, promote growth and development, create political liberties, recast bargains between governments and their societies, transform social welfare, and advance the boundaries of knowledge and scientific exploration. However, the same context presents great risks as people fear loss of identity, worry about economic subordination and loss to those beyond their borders, encounter environmental degradation, and confront potential decline in personal and social autonomy. Our heightened economic, political, social, cultural and environmental interdependence generates serious challenges in areas such as social justice, health, security, development, human rights, social welfare, inequality, diversity and technology. These challenges create the possibility for conflict but also for cooperation and compromise. The Master of Arts in International Affairs offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding global issues. The program draws on teaching and expertise from Washington University faculty and experienced practitioners in the St. Louis region, and it provides knowledge and skills for understanding and working with some of the most difficult international and cross-cultural problems faced by states, societies and communities.

The other three core courses, selected from a list of core courses, provide a theoretical and substantive foundation for the analysis and understanding of international affairs. Students choose at least three core courses as indicated by the \"International Affairs Core (IAC)\" attribute in the course description. Examples include the following: Code Title Units IA 5080 U.S. Law and International Relations 3 IA 509 International Organizations 3 IA 510 The United Nations and International Security3 IA 511 International Law and the Use of Force3 IA 519 International Growth and Development3 IA 5310 National Security Decision-Making 3 IA 535 American Foreign Policy 3 IA 5410 Alternative Analytic Techniques for International Affairs3 IA 5571 Politics of Global Finance 3 IA 574 International Relations 3 IA 5772 State Failure, State Success and Development3 These courses are designed to enable students to develop expertise and understanding of dominant analytical frameworks, tools, and common language in the field of international affairs so that they are better prepared to engage with other professionals in the field. A selection of three core courses, which are overlapping, ensures that this foundation will be sound and robust. Additional International Affairs Courses: 15 units 53Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) These courses may be chosen from International Affairs seminars or, with permission, from graduate-level courses in other departments.

U85 IA 505 Why Were We in Vietnam? Until the Afghan War, the American war in Vietnam was the United States' longest and most costly war in blood and treasure. This course will investigate the origins and ideological context of this war more than 45 years after its end. How and why did the American commitment begin? How did the conflict unfold? How did it end, and at what price? How did the American effort affect U.S. national security and American interests in Asia? Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5053 Cultural Policy and the Politics of Culture in Latin America This course will examine cultural policy making in Latin America, which has developed from the close relationship between the state and a nation's writers, intellectuals, and artists. Focusing on case studies from Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, we will explore ways in which the arts have connected with civil society and the public sphere, in turn becoming engines of economic development, political mobilization, and social intervention. We also will examine the evolution of Latin American media and the manner in which public intellectuals have shaped public opinion in the region. Authors include Mary Coffey, George Yudice, N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini, Nicola Miller, and Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, IAAU85 IA 5080 U.S. Law and International Relations This course examines how law and politics interact to define the limits on government authority in foreign policy. Separation of powers is a key tenet of the U.S. political system, and nowhere is this principle challenged more than in the realm of foreign policy. All three branches of our government struggle with the inherent tension between the need for decisive action and secrecy on the one hand and the desire for democratic deliberation and accountability on the other. These tensions have been with us since the beginning of the nation, but they have become even more prominent with recent changes in technology, new international threats, and increased globalization. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, OLI U85 IA 509 International Organizations This course examines the role of major international organizations in the modern world \u2014 the UN, EU, NATO, IMF, WTO, MERCOSUR, and others. We explore the background for the creation of these organizations, the purposes they serve, and those whose interests they promote. We also consider how they adapt and evolve over time. Our survey centers on three broad areas of investigation: First, we examine how international organizations promote and maintain international security. Second, we consider organizations designed to regulate and promote economic growth and development. This entails a focus upon the process of globalization and the challenges presented in an era of heightened economic interdependence. Finally, we examine growing efforts at regional cooperation though the emergence of organizations such as NAFTA, the EU, and MERCOSUR. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI, OLI U85 IA 5093 Politics of the European Union This course provides a political overview of the European Union and its 27 member states. Attention is paid to the emergence of European supranational governance in the 1950s and its trajectory to the present day. We also consider the interplay of geographical, economic, and cultural factors, together with an assessment of the EU and its place in the larger global political sphere. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 510 The United Nations and International Security The aim of this course is to gain a deeper understanding of the United Nations (UN) and its role in world politics. Beginning with an examination of the history of the UN and its precursors, we will discuss the UN's structure and its three-part mission as outlined in the UN Preamble: international peace and security; human rights; and development. We will assess the strengths and weaknesses of the UN and its agencies in these three substantive areas, within the context of a rapidly shifting geopolitical climate. Attention will be paid to the ongoing debate among proponents and detractors of the UN, and the unique role played by the U.S. in this debate. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI, OLI U85 IA 511 International Law and the Use of Force This course will combine legal and political science approaches to the study of international law. We will explore the source of international law, the law of treaties, the interaction of international and national law, international jurisdiction and sovereignty, state responsibility, the peaceful settlement of 54Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) disputes, and the use of force. In addition, we will examine political science theories that seek to explain why international law does (or does not) influence the behavior of states in international affairs. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI, OLI U85 IA 512 Humanitarian Intervention in International Society One of the more striking features of post-Cold War international society has been the development of a theory and practice of humanitarian intervention. This course explores the background, causes, nature, and limits of these changes. The course is interdisciplinary in nature, combining legal, moral, and political analysis, with an emphasis on the legal question of whether today there is so-called legal right of humanitarian intervention. The course does not assume prior background in international relations. We therefore also spend time introducing a few central concepts and issues in international relations in order to provide a theoretical framework for our substantive inquiries into humanitarian intervention. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLI U85 IA 5130 Dirty Wars and State Terrorism in South America This course will explore the historical, political, and cultural impact of the so-called Operation Condor military dictatorships in 1970s and 1980s South America. We will focus on two of the most notorious dictatorships, those in Argentina and Chile, but we will also examine the examples of Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. We will use historical accounts, remembrance sites, declassified U.S. government documents, literary works, and film to assess the various causes and results of a period that has marked these countries in ways that continue to influence national identities. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 5142 Sustainable Development and Conservation: Madagascar This course focuses on sustainable development in rural subsistence economies, using Madagascar as case study. Students from diverse disciplines are challenged to develop and assess the feasibility of projects that can have a positive impact on communities constrained by poverty traps. The span of projects includes topics such as forest conservation and use, nutrition, health, food security, clean water, education, and bottom-up economic growth. Students in humanities, social sciences, business, design, engineering, physical sciences, law, social work, economics, political science, public health and others use their different perspectives to search for answers. Teamwork and peer teaching are central to the course. Competitively evaluated projects will be field-tested in Madagascar. Selected teams will travel to Madagascar in May and work with the Missouri Botanical Garden Community Conservation Program to adapt projects to conflicting environmental, cultural, economic, and political factors. Poster board sessions for students taking the trip occur in the fall term. Project teams selected to go to Madagascar will be assessed a lab fee at the time their participation in the trip is confirmed. The lab fee covers the cost of airfare, in-country transportation, and approximately three weeks of in-country lodging and food. Undergraduate students should register for the course using one of the undergraduate cross-listed course numbers. Credit 3 units.U85 IA 5170 Gender and Globalization Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5181 International Economics This course provides an analysis of the international economy, the economic theories that help explain it, and analysis of important current issues of international economic policy. When David Ricardo proposed his famous theory of comparative advantage in 1821, he set out to explain why England exported cloth to and imported wine from Portugal. Today, international trade is much more complex. Apple devices are designed in Silicon Valley while their most expensive component, the hard drive, is manufactured by Toshiba in Philippines before it is finally assembled in China. Can Ricardo's theory explain today's patterns of international production and trade? Today, the number of these currencies has been reduced through the formation of the European Union. What are the cost and benefits of currency unions? Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI U85 IA 519 International Growth and Development Few subjects in international relations attract as much attention as growth and development. Why do some nations develop while others languish? What accounts for the disparities in the distribution of wealth and opportunity in the world? This is far more than an economic puzzle. This seminar explores the interaction of politics, history, culture, society, the environment and economics as we try to understand what governments and societies do to promote or hinder growth and development. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI U85 IA 5213 Latin America in World Affairs This course examines Latin American foreign relations from the 1820s to the present with an emphasis on the period since 1945. Focusing on transnational relations, the course analyzes long term patterns and trends among Latin American states and between Latin America and the United States, Europe, and the global South. Attention will be paid to the way Latin Americans have sought to manage foreign influence. To this end we will analyze patterns of inter-American conflict and cooperation. The course will explore how elite culture, domestic social forces, development, and cultural identities influenced national political cultures, and how these in turn shaped Latin American foreign policies. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U85 IA 5215 Grand Strategy Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5230 The Law of the Sea: Governing the Oceans and Marine Resources Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 524 Methods and Research Design in International Studies This course introduces students in the International Affairs program to research design and methods and to the relationship of theory to research in the social sciences, with the aim of preparing students for writing research papers. Areas to be explored include overall research design, case selection, and literature reviews. The importance of theory is stressed. 55Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5264 Environmental Ethics Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5273 Introduction to Israel Studies An exploration of Israel in the Jewish experience from antiquity to modernity and in the history and culture of the Middle East. Special attention will be paid to the modern state of Israel and current issues in its politics, economy, and society. L75 5273 is intended for graduate students only. Same as L75 JIMES 3273 Credit 3 U85 IA 5290 China's Role in the 21st Century This course will examine China's global impact in the 21st century. Beginning with an overview of its current political and economic configuration, we will explore China's complex global interactions, examining these from the perspective of Western and Asian nations, together with the view from within China. Drawing from the interdisciplinary scholarship of political scientists, economists, and anthropologists, as well as the writings of politicians, business leaders, and ordinary people, we will investigate how Chinese society and its mix of political and economic institutions have the potential to reshape international politics, the global economy, and the environment. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 530 Modern Middle East This online course will explore the rapidly changing role of the media in Arab and Muslim societies in reporting about revolts and conflicts, the \"Arab Spring,\" and the chronic impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. We will study the impact of social media, which have afforded greater access to \"real- time\" images of the Syrian civil war than was possible with previous conflicts. We will investigate the formation of public opinion in the Arab and Muslim worlds \u2014 in particular, the role of state-supported media operations such as Al Jazeera. We will compare the style and substance of Israeli and Arab media sources and the role of professional versus citizen journalists in covering newsworthy events. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 5306 The Modern Mediterranean: Facts and Fictions The countries and cultures around the entire Mediterranean basin have provided, and have been the scene of, much of the world's recorded history. In the 20th century, however, writers set out to explore, either by actual travel or else in their imagination alone, many of its lesser known corners: forgotten imperial ruins in Tunisia; remote and semi-primitive mountain villages of Crete; dusty and disease-ridden towns steeped in medieval customs in the Sahara; the secretive, aesthetically dazzling souks of Alexandria. In doing so, they often found many fascinating, if previously hidden and frequently disturbing places, peoples, behaviors. But sometimes, instead, they discovered mere symbolic fodder for an implied or sometimes even explicit critique of their own native lands and social mores. In this course, we shall consider examples of the former in works like Andre Gide's Immoralist , Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Sheltering Sky, and Lawrence Durrell's Justine. As for the latter, our attention will turn to even more contemporary works, such as Derek Walcott's Omeros, which is partially based on the Homeric tale of Ulysses'wanderings around the Mediterranean, but which aims primarily at questioning the history of colonialism and cultural memory of his own Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. While students will pay attention to the stylistic features of these works, to understand better the role rhetoric plays in such fiction, they will also study closely the various important sociopolitical, economic, religious, and philosophical concerns raised by their authors. Some excerpts of film adaptations of these works are also used. Primary readings should be mostly completed in advance of the course. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5310 National Security Decision-Making This course will simulate our national security decision-making process. Students will embody the various perspectives and priorities of strategic decision-makers, gaining an appreciation for the interagency process and the challenges of making foreign policy in a complex and fast-paced environment. Students will hone professional writing, oral presentation, negotiation and collaboration skills as we explore potential flashpoints with two geostrategic rivals, China and Russia. We will consider our treaty obligations, alliances, and how to employ our diplomatic, military, economic and unconventional tools to achieve our nation's strategic goals. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, OLI U85 IA 5321 Africa and International Development Aid Policy This course will examine the role that international actors play in the process of domestic development policy. With a focus on the nations of Africa, we will explore the history and evolution of key international entities, including financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, nongovernmental organizations such as OxFam, and multinational organizations such as the United Nations. We will consider competing theories and strategies on what constitutes the best development policy practices. A selection of case studies will help us assess the effectiveness of policy tools to promote or hinder development in poor countries. Readings will include works by Jeffrey Sachs, Paul Collier, Amartya Sen, and William Easterley. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 5333 The Post-Cold War Order This course will cover key developments in post-Cold War politics. Beginning with an assessment of the problem of achieving order in an international system lacking central authority, we will examine the emergence of international institutions intended to regulate global and regional security, nuclear weapons proliferation, the world economy, and the global environment. We will then consider ethnic and cultural sources of cooperation and conflict, including the \"end of history\" and \"clash of civilizations\" theses. Next, we will examine the challenge posed by American primacy, the development of international law and cooperation, and trends toward both globalization and regionalization. We will conclude by assessing approaches to the global war on terror. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA, IAI 56Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) U85 IA 535 American Foreign Policy This course begins with a survey of the historical foundations of American foreign policy. Having established a broad understanding of the issues that have confronted the nation, we closely examine the current political climate, and the challenges that the United States faces both in terms of its economic and physical security. Finally, we consider strategies for dealing with the threats and challenges that beset this nation. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, OLI U85 IA 5400 NGOs in the International System Over the past several decades, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) have become an integral part of international politics, addressing crucial problems pertaining to environmental degradation, human rights, immigration, poverty, disease, and so forth. This course will explore ways in which NGOs influence the shaping and execution of policy in international affairs. We will first consider the rise of NGOs and the rationale for their emergence, then examine \u2014 through case studies in Africa, Asian, South America, and the former Soviet Union \u2014 how they have approached their mission and whether they have succeeded. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5402 Mathematical Modeling in Political Science This course is designed to provide mathematical tools useful for the rest of the statistical methods sequence, as well as for other courses in formal theory or mathematical modeling. Throughout the course, the mathematical tools are motivated by applications to the general problem of how politics can be modeled for purposes of statistical analysis, deductive reasoning, or conceptual theorizing. This motivation is accomplished by means of a consistent focus on such processes as individual decision making, the representation of issues, statistical phenomena, and phenomena of change over time. The course assumes a sufficient background in elementary algebra, logic, functions, and graphs; remedial work in these areas will be offered through a review course during the last week or two of summer. Mathematical topics covered include: sets and relations; probability; differential calculus and optimization; difference equations; and linear algebra. Same as L32 Pol Sci 5052 Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5403 Global Collective Action: Why Do Nations Cooperate? Climate Change and Other Cases Nation-states act in their self-interest \u2014 so how and when do they come together to address global problems? From nuclear disarmament to small pox eradication to tackling climate change, nations must transcend or transform self-interest to deal with these problems. Collective action and concepts such as tragedy of the commons, free riders, and prisoner's dilemma, will be taught in the context of global problems. We will examine the role of the nation-state, non-state players and the sub-national players in the pursuit of global governance. With a focus on climate change negotiations, we will delve into what collective action means for the big economies (U.S., China, Russia), for the not-so-big economies and for the small island nation-states and indigenous peoples, and what this action means within the current international system and regimes. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI, OLIU85 IA 541 The Global Village in the 21st Century More than 50 years ago, McLuhan predicted that humans across the globe would become part of a global village linked by various forms of communications. With the internet and telecommunications, that day has arrived. This online course will explore how global communications systems have evolved, how they work and how they affect vital policies of nation-states as well as central banks, political leaders and ordinary citizens. We shall explore the ways in which hackers can penetrate secure systems, such as elections, and create misleading images and impressions, as well as how to counteract those actions. A research paper is required. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI, OLI U85 IA 5410 Alternative Analytic Techniques for International Affairs This course instills analytic rigor and imagination into the consideration of our most pressing national security issues. Based on structured analytic techniques employed in the Intelligence Community, students in this course will hone critical thinking skills, consider overlooked ideas, and develop unique perspectives. Students will be given the tools to recognize and overcome biases, mental shortcuts, and unstated assumptions and to challenge conventional wisdom through the analysis of U.S. foreign and counter-terrorism policy and current events in the Middle East, China, and North Korea. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI U85 IA 5443 Drones, Surveillance, and Biometrics: Global Cyberwar in the 21st Century This course examines how the practice of militarism is changing worldwide through the development of new technologies. How are governments reshaping the practice of war and diplomacy with the use of unmanned drones to fight wars, biometric eye and finger scanners to patrol borders and immigration, wiretapping on civilian populations to conduct surveillance of foreign terrorists, etc.? How are civilians and nonstate actors engaging in cyberwar, as in the network attacks from China on major corporations like Google? What does it mean that anyone (from militants to humanitarian groups) can now buy drones on the market from private firms? How has a former judge in Montana posed online as an Iraqi cyberspy for the U.S. government? We will assess theories and implications of these developments in readings from sociology, international relations, and science and technology studies. Guest speakers will be invited from institutions around the St. Louis region, such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Boeing, legal specialists, and privacy advocates. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5450 Confronting Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD): International Legal, Political, & Military Frameworks This course will examine and evaluate the mechanisms employed by states to address the global problem of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \u2014 nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and their means of delivery. We will establish a framework of understanding about WMD while exploring relevant historical developments. We will focus on a comparison of states' WMD-control/nonproliferation strategies and their WMD- counter-proliferation strategies. We will also consider the matter of complementing the latter strategies with UN Security Council action. The course will conclude with a consideration of the nuclear-weapon abolition debate and viable WMD-control futures. 57Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5451 Global Poverty This course examines the contributions of economists and political scientists to analyzing the nature of poverty, to evaluating strategies for reducing or eliminating poverty, and to considering the effects of globalization on the poor. We also focus on ethical matters; namely, our moral obligation to the poor \u2014 both those in foreign lands and those who are fellow citizens. The relevant arguments and planning schemes will be assessed and compared. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5494 Indonesia: History, Society, Culture, and International Relations Indonesia is the largest nation in Southeast Asia and the world's fourth most populous, with its largest Muslim population. This course will survey the history, politics, and culture of Indonesia. It will cover topics relating to religion, the arts and media, terrorism and ethnic violence, and a burgeoning economy that has generated serious ecological damage. In addition to studying the complexity and diversity of the Indonesian archipelago and its people, we will explore Indonesia's evolving presence on the global stage. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 550 Current Issues in International Affairs Topic varies from semester to semester. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5501 Civil War and Peace This course examines the causes and consequences of civil war as well as potential solutions to it, drawing on examples from countries throughout the world. The potential causes of intra- state violence include ethnic and religious identities, economic and security concerns, elite manipulation, and international diffusion. The different tools for managing intra-state conflict that we examine include minority representation, power-sharing, decentralization, and partition. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 551 The Culture of Global Neoliberalism This course will study neoliberalism, a key socioeconomic approach to the free market and influential model for development, as a phenomenon that has fundamentally affected politics, ideology, and culture across the global- local spectrum. We will explore concepts such as globalism, citizenship, consumerism, private governance, NGOs and the commodification of identity. Our coverage will incorporate the work of David Harvey, Aihwa Ong, Slavoj Zizek, N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda U85 IA 5523 Planetary Problems: International Competition and Cooperation in Outer Space This course will explore the crucial role of outer space in global affairs and the challenge of confronting potentially dire consequences of an increasingly crowded orbital environment. We will study three key decisions that shaped the American manned space program: Kennedy's Apollo program; Nixon's space shuttle; and Reagan's space station. We will also examinethe role of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). Most broadly, we will consider the growing importance of space to humanity at large and the attendant challenges that confront the international community. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 553 International Business Today's business environment has become increasingly global, and it is imperative that business leaders understand the theories, institutions, and environmental elements that underlie international commerce. Globalization of businesses presents not only the opportunity to sell to world markets but also the challenges of potential competitors in nearly every industry. The objective of this course is to provide students with an introduction to economic theories, international commercial entities, and the political and cultural environments that form the context for global business. Topics include country-market differences, trade and investment patterns, the international financial environment, issues in business-government relations, and strategies for international business. We focus on opportunities for, threats to, and options facing the multicultural business enterprises. Credit 2 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5553 Geopolitics in the 21st Century In this course we undertake a conceptual history of geopolitics. The term \"geopolitics\" emerged near the end of the 19th century in relation to new forms of nationalism and imperialist competition in Europe and beyond. During the Cold War, geopolitics was used to denote a global struggle between the capitalist Western bloc and the Soviet Eastern bloc, which finally ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, geopolitics is more relevant than ever as new global power struggles characterize the post-post-Cold War world. The realm of geopolitics has expanded in the 21st century to include issues and questions previously ignored during the Cold War: civilizational clashes, global warming, social movement struggles, global finance, and transnational communication networks. Geopolitics now implicates global environmental degradation and ethnonationalism. We will examine the history, concepts, policies, and practices of geopolitics from the late 19th century to the present. We will also critically investigate the \"new geopolitics\" of an emerging multipolarity, the return to Great Power politics, and the renewed interest in geopolitical narratives of the 21st century. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLI U85 IA 5571 Politics of Global Finance Global finance underwent stunning transformations over the past 40 years. The changes contribute to interdependence, challenge national sovereignty, alter state-society relations, affect economic development, and influence the distribution of wealth and power in the global political economy. The seminar examines the political economy of monetary relations, the globalization of capital markets, and their effects upon domestic and international affairs. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI U85 IA 5581 Domestic Politics and U.S. Foreign Policy Decision-Making This course examines U.S. foreign policy from the perspective of domestic politics, with the aim of understanding how our political institutions affect foreign policy outcomes. The first section of the course provides an overview of the paradigms that have been used to understand foreign policy decision-making 58Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) and examines the electoral and interest group pressures that influence decisions. The second section studies the chief political branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) and their role in foreign policy. The final section covers the major bureaucratic agencies involved in foreign policy decisions. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 559 International Political Economy in Theory and Practice Globalization, the accelerating rate of interaction between people of different countries, creates a qualitative shift in the relationship between nation-states and national economies. Conflict and war is one form of international interaction. Movement of capital, goods, services, production, information, disease, environmental degradation, and people across national boundaries are other forms of international interactions. This course will introduce the study of global political-economic relations and will develop a theoretical tool kit that will help students explore the globalization of material and social relations. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5630 Inside the Intelligence Community This class will provide an in-depth look at the United States Intelligence Community (IC) \u2014 specifically, the different agencies that compose the IC and their varying missions, priorities, and resources \u2014 and how intelligence informs national security decision making. Students will analyze long- term national security issues on which the government would like to focus as well as the short-term crisis issues on which the government must focus. We will write strategic analytical products and simulate inter-agency coordination and testimony before Congress. Systems and infrastructure designed around security make virtual interaction the preferred means of communication for analysts with shared problem sets who operate around the world and around the clock. Accordingly, this course, which has been designed for students who are interested in understanding and/or becoming part of our nation's national security apparatus, will simulate the robust yet virtual nature of communication and collaboration within the IC. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC U85 IA 565 From Mikado to Makudo: A Literary View of Japanese Culture This course will survey Japan's social and cultural history through selected literary works that span the seventh century (Mikado) to the present day (Makudo). Our readings \u2014 including fiction, poetry, drama, and personal writings \u2014 will serve as guides to key historical epochs: the aristocratic culture of the Heian era ( Tale of Genji ), the warrior society of the medieval era (Tale of the Heike ), and the Tanizaki, Mishima, and Oe will expose the complexities of modern Japan. Students will gain an appreciation of Japan's unique heritage, social complexity, and place in East Asia and the world today. Same as U98 MLA 5565 Credit 3 units. UColl: CDU85 IA 5652 Korea: History, Culture, and People This course will provide a comprehensive overview of Korea \u2014 its long history, its cultural heritage, its people \u2014 and the complexity of Korea's place within East Asia and in the larger global context. Topics will include: the Korean War and its aftermath, the fraught North-South relationship, national and cultural identity, the gender question, collective memory, and the tension between tradition and modernization/globalization. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, IAA U85 IA 5684 Globalism and Neoliberalism in Latin American Culture This course examines the ways in which Latin American culture has engaged with new global realities and the neoliberal policies of the 1990s. We will use political, economic, and cultural theory to assess various artistic explorations of newly globalized Latin America cultural identities from the Caribbean to Argentina. The course will include extensive theoretical readings and a series of novels and films that create productive dialogues with that theory. Authors to be considered include, among others, Fredric Jameson, Edmundo Paz Sold\u00e1n, Ricardo Piglia, Junot D\u00edaz, 3 units. UColl: CD, IAA U85 IA 5711 Issues in Applied Ethics The aim of this course is to examine crucial ethical questions that have come to shape contemporary international relations. For instance, what is the responsibility of affluent countries to those in poverty? Should nations have a right to close their borders to immigrants seeking a better life? What is the normative justification for an international criminal court, and under what conditions should this court override the laws and sovereignty of nation states? We will survey the major ethical schools of thought and apply their approaches to prevalent moral debates. This theoretical background will facilitate our investigation of and reflection upon the challenging moral issues that confront us today. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 572 The Politics of International Trade This course examines the politics and debates surrounding international trade. The course begins with a brief overview of the basic economic theory underlying the idea of free trade. With that as a background, we explore the distributional and political consequences of trade flows in terms of both the politics of trade liberalization and the politics of protectionism. The course then explores the World Trade Organization and attempts at regional integration such as the EU, NAFTA and the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. The course concludes with a series of in-class debates on several major trade policies, such as the issue of outsourcing, agricultural subsidies in developed countries, the recent Dubai sports deal, and the apparent resurgence of economic nationalism, as well as the relationship between increased trade and environmental protection.

UColl: IAI U85 IA 5721 Energy, International Politics, and the Quest for Power This course will examine the history and political implications of oil, the world's preeminent strategic resource. We will trace the \"flow\" of oil from its discovery in 1859 to its current role as fuel for the global economy. We will explore oil in relation to 59Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) military conflict and to the energy competition among Russia, China, the U.S., and other powers. We will study the relation between energy resources, business strategies, political power, and foreign policy. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 574 International Relations Globalization, the accelerating rate of interaction between people of different countries, creates a qualitative shift in the relationship between nation-states and national economies. Conflict and war is one form of international interaction. Movement of capital, goods, services, production, information, disease, environmental degradation, and people across national boundaries are other forms of international interactions. This course introduces major approaches, questions, and controversies in the study of international relations. In a small group seminar we will examine the building blocks of world politics, the sources of international conflict and cooperation, and the globalization of material and social relations. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, OLH, OLI U85 IA 5772 State Failure, State Success and Development This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to examining the role governments play in development and economic outcomes. We will look at some of the competing arguments about governments in failed and successful states and compare those arguments to the empirical world, or data. In so doing we will recognize that how governments affect development and economic outcomes in society is neither straightforward nor consistent with any of the ideological screeds that often dominate public discourse. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAC, IAI U85 IA 5784 Global Leadership This course will study leadership issues in various global and multicultural settings. We will focus on developing an understanding of global leadership skills and the means of fostering such skills.

We will discuss exemplary leaders such as Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Nelson Mandela. The course will feature an in-depth coverage of relevant theories and research on leadership in global and multicultural organizations. We will discuss team leadership and team collaboration skills within a culturally diverse world, as well as current events relating to global leadership. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5820 Ukraine in Turmoil This course will examine recent events in Ukraine and their underlying long-term causes. We will consider the riots of February of 2014 and how the subsequent overthrow of the scandal-ridden Yanukovich government became a bloody civil war in Eastern Ukraine. The class will study the geopolitical Ukraine in the Eurasian land mass, and the tension it has generated between the Russian Federation, United States, and western Europe. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAAU85 IA 5825 Cold War 2.0 and the Balkans This course examines the prospects of reemerging Cold War tensions between the United States and the Russian Federation with the Balkans serving as the central focus of such tensions.

Topics include: grand strategy, arc of instability, competing pipeline corridors, ethnic and confessional strife, non-state actors operating in Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, and Bulgaria. Credit 1 unit. U85 IA 5861 Virtual Money Makes the World Go Round: Paypal, Bitcoin, and the Global Politics of Demonetization Markets are shifting from paper to virtual currencies, but are the benefits experienced evenly around the world? This course will examine the transformation to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and mobile payment systems like Paypal. It will ask how state governments and policymakers are responding and the impact for communities of the poor, ethnic minorities, and women in the global south. Can mobile money circumvent broadscale governmental corruption, or does it solidify the power of elites? Are farmers in Kenya able to use their phones to get better prices for their harvests, or do mobile payment apps submerge them in debt to financial institutions? Why does the demonetization program in India, which removed lower- currency paper bills from circulation, rob rural women of their life savings? Who are the hidden workers of these new industries, like villagers in outsourcing centers who process financial data for the global north? What is the impact on the environment, as Bitcoin servers around the world collectively consume as much energy as the country of Denmark? What does it mean that widespread cryptocurrencies are operating completely outside of state regulations and oversight? We will bring in financial and international development experts and explore local debates in St. Louis, such as the role of our tech hub in designing mobile payment apps and the activist campaigns against payday lenders. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5880 Against Development: International Affairs Otherwise One of the key tenets of 20th-century geopolitics -- from various models of modernization theory to contemporary understandings of neoclassical and neoliberal theory -- has been the ideal of development as a key goal to address economic and political inequalities in the world system. This course focuses on different lines of thinking that challenge this worldview. We examine the work of both global north dissident thinkers and global south traditions of thinking, such as dependency theory, decolonialism, and liberation philosophy. The course will depart from critiques of the idea of development as an extension of colonialism and imperialism by authors like John Patrick Leary and Arturo Escobar. It will continue to discuss critiques of the contemporary geopolitical and geo-economic orders from the perspective of global south countries through concepts such as necropolitics (Achille Mbembe), gore capitalism (Sayak Valencia) and slow violence (Rob Nixon). The course will conclude with the study of theories that propose postdevelopmental and counterdevelopmental models of economic organization and political engagement, including decolonialism (Macarena G\u00f3mez Barris and others), College - Graduate (01/15/21) U85 IA 5881 Israel and the Middle East Places Israeli political issues and events within the context of existing political theories.

Afghanistan is the most recent example of the phenomenon; we will also consider the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Lebanese civil war, and the political failures of Somalia and Cambodia. Beginning with a general examination of the international system and various styles of government, we will identify the causes of state failure and the remedies offered by governments and international organizations, and consider why these remedies often fail. Finally, we will discuss the ways countries may recover from their sick \u2014 and therefore often threatening \u2014 condition. Readings will include recent journal articles as well as books by Hans Morganthau, Noam Chomsky, Chalmers Johnson, Robert Kaplan, and others. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 592 Modern Russia and the International Community: New Cold War The Cold War supposedly ended in the late 1980s, yet the United States and Russian Federation are on the brink of another period of escalating tensions. In a recent press conference the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, issued a dire warning to the United States and its NATO allies. He said the forward deployment of U.S. \"Aegis Ashore\" missiles in Romania posed an offensive threat to Russia, and forthis reason the world is in great danger. This course examines how this new era of strained relations between nuclear powers came to pass with special emphasis on U.S.-Russian relations from 1989 to 2016. Ancillary topics include the Ukraine crisis and Erdogan's volte-face with Moscow. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA Master of Liberal Arts We live today in a rich and varied culture. Every moral, social, political and cultural question we face demands the broadest consideration we can give it, and it is important that we draw from the multiplicity of methods and perspectives nurtured and cultivated in the many disciplines of a great university. The Master of Liberal Arts (MLA) program fosters intellectual breadth through courses that address a broad range of cultural issues from different academic perspectives. Students may explore questions of identity through art, literature and religion. They may analyze the politics of race in fiction, historical documents, the visual arts and music. They may debate ethical choices presented by fiction writers, jurists, philosophers and scientists from antiquity through the present. MLA seminars examine literary, artistic and cinematic masterpieces; historic moments of discovery and change; traditions of thought; cultural differences; and civic responsibilities. MLA students sharpen their thinking about contemporary values and choices through courses that ask them to reflect on the individual's relation to society, technology and the spread of ideas, challenges to freedom, and inspiration and creativity. Students pursue course work and independent research with Washington University scholars from a number of academic disciplines, including architecture, art, film, history, literature, music, philosophy, religion and science. The MLA program emphasizes critical thinking and inquiry, close reading, intensive writing and problem solving, all of which are hallmarks of a liberal arts education and essential skills for a range of professional contexts. Requirements Master of Liberal Arts Required Courses: 30 units Students complete 30 units total, including at least 15 units of core MLA interdisciplinary seminars and a final research project that typically earns 3 credits. 61Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) Core MLA Seminars The MLA program consists of seminars that introduce students to the methods and questions of different disciplines. These seminars are planned and taught by full-time Washington University faculty, and they cover a wide variety of topics and issues. Most core seminars are held one evening a week during the fall and spring semesters and twice a week during the summer term. Some students take all required courses as the seminars that are designed specifically for the MLA program; others augment a particular interest by taking up to 12 units of related courses drawn from different departments, with MLA department approval. Final Project A 3-credit final research project, developed under the supervision of a Washington University faculty member, is required for the MLA degree. This project presents an opportunity for the student to independently and extensively explore an area of personal interest, and it must be completed at the conclusion of a student's course work. Under special circumstances and with permission, some students complete a final project that comprises two semesters of research and writing for 6 units of credit.

In this course, we will explore the history of St. Louis through the musics that have been made, sustained, and remembered here. In the words of ethnomusicologist John Blacking, music is nothing less than \"soundly organized humanity.\" Our musical investigation will lead us to consider how St. Louis-area residents have constructed geography, place, ownership, and identity. We will progress through several chronological-topical units that engage with race/ethnicity, class, regional identity, and cultural memory.

We will develop a set of tools for literary analysis in order to examine these works from the point of view of style and literary expression, and we will also examine how these young authors engage with the issues facing women in the region today, including politically and sexually motivated violence, collective memory, gender and race, and citizenship. We will also address what it means to be a Latin American woman author in the 21st century, and we will look at related issues, including structural barriers in the industry, institutional erasure, sexism and the literary canon. Evaluation will be based on writing assignments and on a multimedia portfolio on a writer of students' choice, which they will present to the instructor and the class at the end of the semester. This course fulfills the research methods requirement for both the Master of Liberal Arts and the Master of Arts in American Culture Studies programs. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH, GRES U98 MLA 505 Darwin, Marx, and Wagner This seminar studies three works completed in 1859 that profoundly influenced all western thought to the present day: Karl Marx's Treatise on Political Economy, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species Natural Selection, and Richard Wagner's Tristan and Isolde . We will explore how these three works share remarkable and intriguing parallels: an inherent belief in evolution; materialism permeated with romanticism; faith in progress; and a similar (\"dialectical\") approach to understanding the dynamics of change and the application of change in all aspects of the natural and social the world. These three works will enable the class to consider aspects of 19th-century intellectual, economic, and social sociopolitical history. No special knowledge of biology, political science, or music is required. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5072 Humanizing Technology In order to explore the ways that technology had changed the way we read and write, this course examines the myriad ways that technology and the humanities interact in shaping culture and identity in contemporary society. We will study the interactions between the internet and literature, examining the ways that short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and novels like Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson have first shaped the ways that we use and think about the internet. We will investigate new approaches to writing inspired by digital technology with the Bolivian novelist Edmundo Paz Sold\u00e1n's novel Turing's Delirium . The class will consider the development of a technological posthuman identity in society, literature, and films through an 63Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) analysis of Philip K. Dick's novel Ubik, the film The Matrix , along with the work of cultural theorists Donna Haraway (\"A Cyborg Manifesto\") and Katherine Hayles ( How We Became Posthuman ).

We will study different forms of cultural practice, analyzing how they become \"popular\" and how they involve connections between artistic expression, politics, economics, ethnicity, and race. The class will consider differences between \"high culture\" and popular culture; folklore traditions; the impact of modernization and the dream of \"being modern\"; the role of the media; and the growth of globalized popular culture. Our cultural geography will survey the gauchos (cowboys) of Argentina and Uruguay; national dances such as salsa and reggaeton in the Caribbean; forms of cultural resistance to military rule in Chile; and the pervasive economic, political, and emotional power of soccer (f\u00fatbol). Students will examine the best-selling novel The Gaucho Juan Moreira, the engaging political essay \"The Open Veins of Latin America,\" stories of urban life, and contemporary texts that explore the rise of populism (elites vs. others), dictatorship and social revolution, and the immigrant experience. We will also consider examples of music; films including The Secret in Their Eyes and Paper in the Wind; and a pair of riveting television series (telenovelas) from Mexico and Argentina.

U98 MLA 5120 Breath on the Mirror: Ancient Maya Religion Contemporary scholars of Maya religion are gradually coming to appreciate the grand myth cycles, cosmogonic visions, and understandings of the Maya divine beings, due in large part to the increasingly productive decipherment of ancient texts and imagery. This course surveys what we know and how we document our current interpretations of ancient Maya religion. Topics include the Maya's famous calendar systems mathematics, astronomy, including Maya archaeoastronomy and time keeping. We will analyze the complexity and dynamism of Maya understandings of the supernatural. The class will examine enduring ideas and stories at the core of the Maya religion, as told in the Popol Vuh , the Quiche' Book of Counsel . We will also study recent field research and discoveries, exploring links between classic Maya religion and the religion of the great highland Mexican society of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. The professor will share information about his ongoing field research project in northwestern Peten at the site of El Peru-Waka. The class will learn what scholars have unearthed, literally, about El Peru-Waka, the capital of a kingdom and seat of a royal dynasty established in the Preclassic period that endured more than 500 years and boasted more than 26 successors to the throne.

UColl: ACF U98 MLA 5173 The Origins of Political Thought in Classical Antiquity In order to understand the origins and development of politics and political ideas in Greco-Roman antiquity, we examine several of the most influential imaginative and philosophical texts of this period, including selections from the works of Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles, Plato, Cicero, Virgil, and Augustine. What is the nature of politics altogether and in its historically distinctive expressions in the ancient Mediterranean? What is the relationship between political ideas and the development of democratic, republican, and monarchic constitutions? Why is an understanding of ancient politics significant for citizens of modern democratic nation-states? To answer such questions, we concentrate on ancient ideas about virtue and vice, political education, citizenship, and the distribution of power and wealth. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5200 Visions and Re-Visions: 19th-Century Arts and Society In this multidisciplinary course we will examine how 19th- century literature, painting, and music reflected, as well as affected, contemporary Western life, both in Europe and the United States. We will consider how different writers and artists attempt first to represent and then to modify, either directly or indirectly, several important sociopolitical and economic situations of their time, such as the institution of marriage; increased urbanization and industrialization; and the spread of nationalism. Included among the literary works to be studied are Romantic,Transcendentalist, and utopian texts by Balzac ( P\u00e8re Goriot), Sand (The Country Waif ), Thoreau ( Walden), Hugo (Last Day of a Condemned Man ), Baudelaire (\"The Painter of Modern Life\"), and Robert Owen ( A New View of Society). In the field of art history we will analyze the social impact of paintings from the Realist and Barbizon schools. In the areas of theater and opera we will study works by Ibsen (A Doll's House ), Wagner (\"Opera and Drama\" and examples of his Ring Cycle). Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5203 America: Through a Glass Darkly This course studies depictions of America by non-Americans. We will examine the social, political, and economic aspects of their accounts and their influence on America's beliefs, policies, and international reputation.

Credit 3 units. 64Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) U98 MLA 5204 Patterns of Thought Exploring how patterns shape our understanding, this seminar will focus on recurring motifs in literature and art. Our study of patterns will refer to thematic elements as well as to repeated figures, structures, and designs. We will examine the function of mirrors in paintings by van Eyck, Velazquez, and works of the Italian Renaissance, as well as the \"mirror function\" of paintings within paintings in works by Dutch Golden Age painters Vermeer and his contemporaries. We will also study the importance of mirroring in short stories by Borges and novels about novel writing (\"metafiction\"), including Krauss, History of Love ; Auster, The City of Glass; and Knausgard's autobiographical novel My Struggle . The class will analyze the distinctive narrative structures of Lafayette, The Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves and Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , novels in which art figures prominently. We will contrast these works with Flaubert's Madame Bovary , where art is eclipsed by consumerism, and Nolan's film Memento, which plays with chronological sequencing. We will further consider the patterns of urban landscapes evident in Abelardo Morell's camera obscura images of world capitals and Andreas Gursky's crowds and large-scale images, contrasting these contemporary works of photography with breaks in associative patterns in the surrealist paintings of Magritte. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5217 Paint it Black: Understanding American Film Noir A product of highly diverse influences and traditions, film noir is known for its stylized visual aesthetic, crackling dialogue, moral ambivalence, and existential paranoia. Its style and language continue to inform filmmakers in Hollywood and worldwide. This seminar positions the aesthetic shapes and traumatic narratives of film noir within the context of American culture and film history during the war and post-war years. As importantly, it explores film noir as a test case in order to probe notions of film history, genre, and authorship, of cultural and intermedial transfer and the popular. Required screenings will take place during the second half of each week's class. Films will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon , Phantom Lady , Double Indemnity , Laura, Gun Crazy , Somewhere in the Night , The Glass Key , The Blue Gardenia , and Chinatown.

UColl: ACF U98 MLA 524 The American Dream: Myth and Reality This course will examine the origins and history of \"The American Dream.\" What do we mean when we use this term? How does it resonate and influence our politics, advertising, and especially the arts? We will discuss the experience of immigration and assimilation, how foreigners with different cultural backgrounds enter American society. Beginning with the implications of America's image as a \"brave new world\" in European thought and philosophy (including Shakespeare's The Tempest ), and the prescient view of our culture by de Tocqueville and others, we will examine how the dream of success and wealth has been depicted and employed in theater, fiction, cinema, and the visual arts. Texts include: Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , Williams's West's Day of the Locust , Lorraine Hansberry's the Zoo Story\" and \"The American Dream,\" and John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves. We will consider modern painters whose work offers a commentary on the dream, such as Edward Hopper and AndyWarhol. We will also study cinematic innovators from Charlie Chaplin to Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola who have used \"The American Dream\" as significant elements in their work. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5290 Exploring Medieval Literature This course will read widely in medieval literature, from Britain and Western Europe. We will investigate how authors depict battle (Beowulf, The Song of Roland), love (troubadour poetry and romance), travel, and quest (Mandeville's Travels, The Book of Margery Kempe ). In addition, we shall study work by some of the most important writers in the emerging vernacular literatures of medieval Europe: Marie de France, Jean de Meun (The Romance of the Rose ), Dante, Boccaccio, Machaut, Chaucer, and the anonymous poet of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Texts will be studied in translation, sometimes in full and sometimes in extract, and will be placed in their historical and cultural contexts. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5300 Modernism This course will explore modernism's search for new ways to narrate experience in a radically changed world. Traveling across time and space, from East to West, and into modern cities and uncharted locations, we will explore how writers and filmmakers in the 20th and 21st centuries experiment with innovative forms of artistic expression in response to the growing influence of foreign cultures; technological changes and developments in science; the globalization of world markets; and issues of identity, gender, race, and ethnicity. The class will analyze modernism as a rejection of social and political norms, a crisis of identities, and the fragmentation of life. Works to include Franz Kafka, The Metamorphosis ; James Joyce, Dubliners ; Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness ; Amos Tutuola, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts; Italo Calvino, If on a Luis Borges, Fictions; Alejo Carpentier, The Kingdom of This World ; Salman Rushdie, East, West: Stories; and Don DeLillo, The Body Artist , as well as films by Christopher Nolan ( U98 MLA 5301 Against the Grain: Transgression and Controversy in Modern Art This course will examine the public controversies that surround the development of modern art over the last 150 years, to probe the question of the social and political functions of transgressive art. After reviewing key theories of the avant-garde, we analyze both the persona of the modern artist (Gauguin, Picasso, Pollock) and the place of women artists in the revolutions of modernism (Cassatt, H\u00f6ch, Kahlo). A key issue to address is how modernism tests limits by asking what is (and is not) art (Duchamp and Brancusi). Some of the most controversial exhibitions in this time frame, from the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1863 to Mirroring Evil in 2002, highlight the challenges raised by modern artists' treatment of the body. Debates waged over public art in St. Louis, and recent controversies over public funding of contemporary art, will close the course. No prior knowledge of art history required.

Each topic will focus on a certain type of art (although not exclusively) and on one or more mental faculties: How do pictures represent? How do we understand stories and what roles do they play in the life of the mind? What do we like in the arts and why, according to psychological theories based on brain research? What is style in the arts and can there be a scientific explanation of its history? A parallel concern is with how distinctive features of the arts might shed special light on the nature of the mind. Readings will include essays by prominent art historians, philosophers, psychologists, and scientists. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5353 Cultural Geography: Mapping Paris This course explores how, over centuries and across national borders, Paris remains central to our sense of Western culture. Our focus on Paris will extend from the 16th century through the present via pairings that join the French capital with other European cities. We will study King Francis I's expansion of the Louvre in Paris in conjunction with the proliferation of castles in the Loire Valley, the court's patronage of Italian artists, and the arrival of Leonardo da Vinci in Amboise. The class will examine the 17th-century court of Versailles as it casts a shadow over Paris, and we will compare the art of the French monarchy during this period with that of Vermeer and his contemporaries in Delft and Amsterdam. We will analyze views of Paris and London the 18th century that show new architectural features and home decor and we will contrast paintings of Boucher, Fragonard, and Watteau in France with those of Hogarth and Gainsborough in England. The class will consider desire in the 19th century as it radiates both through Paris in Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Vienna in Freud's Dora. We will consider contemporary portraits of Paris and New York in Barbery's The Elegance of the Hedgehog and Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close . The animated film The Triplets of Belleville will offer a contemporary take of these cities. Open to all MLA and DLA students, including those who have taken Paris and New York. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5416 Urbis & Civitas: Florence Beyond the Tourist's Gaze This course explores the urban history of Florence, Italy, from its origins as a small Roman town at the edge of an Etruscan settlement to its contemporary position as the industrial, commercial, and cultural center of a sprawling metropolitan area along the Arno river valley. We will study Florence's long history as it comprises periods of rapid development, symbolic and intellectual pre-eminence, and political influence, on the one hand, and economic stagnation, internal conflicts, depopulation, and subjection to external control, on the other. Our focus on both the urbis (the built environment, the physical realm) and the civitas (the social constituency, the civic sphere) will reveal Florence to be a complex artifact that is constantly shaped and reshaped by human action and social imagination. In order to look beyond the tourist image of Florence that we have inherited from the late 19th century, we will examine what defines our experiences and conceptions of a city. This investigation will include comparisons of Florence with other urban centers and discussion about the meanings of urban memory, culture, and citizenship. Readings will address the study of the urban history of Florence as well as urbanization, urbanism, and the publicsphere, including works such as An Outline of Urban History by Silvano Fei, Grazia Gobbi Sica, and Paolo Sica; A Brief History of Florence by Franco Cardini; and Florence: Architecture, City, and Landscape edited by Marco Bardeschi. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5420 History of American Architecture This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of American architecture. Throughout readings that will include a survey text in addition to topical works covering the social history of housing, the vernacular architecture of Las Vegas and the rise (and fall, and rise) of Frank Lloyd Wright, students will learn the definitive characteristics of American architecture. A central point of study will be examining contradictory tendencies in the American practice of architecture: the embrace of exceptionalism through modern forms and styles representing a new national identity, occurring alongside the emulation of classical and European precedents to legitimate a new nation's buildings. The readings will illuminate how the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic and political structures of its production. Ultimately, students will be able to read an American building to discern evidence of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility. This course will count toward major in American Culture Studies for day students. This course fulfills the Humanities distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. It also counts toward the MD and some concentration area requirements for the AMCS major and minor. Same as U89 AMCS 420 Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U98 MLA 5430 Imagining Germany in the Long 19th Century Between the start of the French Revolution (1789) and the outbreak of the First World War (1914), Germany was transformed from a patchwork of over 300 sovereign territories into a unified nation-state with immense political and economic power. This course examines the crucial role played by literature and the arts in creating a sense of a German national community during this period. Our materials will include national anthems, fairy tales, painting, public monumental art, opera, essays, propaganda, and popular culture, and we will investigate these materials with an eye toward the different and sometimes opposing visions of the nation and national character to which they give expression. Within this broader context, we will address the perceived contribution of men, women, and the family to the project of nation building; the role of language, of national heroes and legends, and of geography in creating a sense of unity; and the ways in which national identity is defined in opposition to a perceived Other (in this case, France). We will also consider Zionism as an offshoot of the European nationalisms and a response to anti-Semitism in Germany. Works studied include fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm; essays and poems by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, and Berthold Auerbach; Germany, A Winter's Tale by Heinrich Heine; The Patrioteer by Heinrich Mann; and The Jewish State by Theodor Herzl. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5450 Global Cinema: A Love Story Focusing on the ubiquity of love stories in cinema, this seminar will explore connections between romance, anxieties, and aspirations in contemporary society. Studying celebrated films from the United States ( When Harry Met Sally, Eternal 66Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ), Latin America (Love in the Time of Hysteria ), Europe ( Amelie, Caf\u00e9 au Lait ), Lunchbox ), and East Asia ( 2046, Happy Together), among others, we will consider how love functions as a symptom of what ails society. The class will examine not only personal relationships but also social structures, economic systems, and political conflicts. Topics will cover issues of class, gender, and race; the construction of economic identities; and the formal structures and aesthetics of film. Students will be required to watch two films per week as well as to complete selected short readings. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5454 Medicine and Morality in Global Perspective What does it mean to be sick? What does it mean to be a patient, or a healer? Is it possible to imagine a universal morality in which our understanding of medical ethics is shared among peoples worldwide? What are some of the ethical dilemmas associated with genetic testing, organ transplants, and global disparities in health? Framed by these questions, our class will examine how culture shapes our concepts of disease and our expectations for treatment. Similarly, we will consider how social class, race, and ethnicity influence both health and access to health care worldwide. Our readings will focus on medical history and the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of disease; health disparities; the varying relations of patients and healers in different cultures; African health crises; public health controversies; folk illness in Latin America; medical technologies and ethical conflicts; and other issues of medical anthropology pertaining to the prevention and treatment of illness and the healing process around the globe. We will also discuss three documentaries: Frontline: Sickness Around the World; Donka: X-Ray of an African Hospital (Doctors Without Borders); and Dan Rather Reports: Kidney Pirates (with anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes). Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5478 American Folklore in Context For the last several election cycles, candidates and supporters from across the political spectrum have invoked \"the real American.\" But what does it mean to be authentically American? A simple answer might be that they are \"us.\" A more complex one requires that we dive into American folklore. The scholarly field of Folklore may be defined loosely as exploring what we say, what we do, and what we believe. Following this schema, this course will probe the question of what it means to be \"American folk\" by examining how folklore informs and shapes the world around us and our everyday lives. More particularly, we ask how race and ethnicity, class and gender are encoded and contested through folk expression. Beginning with the question \"who are the folk,\" we will look at classic and contemporary texts in folklore studies to explore how our food, our stories, our daily rituals, and our music, to name a few, interweave to create a complex, multilayered, and uniquely American folk. Readings pair specific genres with different theoretical approaches and include our jokes, urban legends, folktales, foodways, music, and material culture. Crucially, we seek to trouble popular notions of folklore as \"antiquities\" to question how the lens of Folklore studies may reveal how American culture not only consists of folklore but is constructed by it as folk forms are deployed in contemporary contexts, from Slenderman to Snopes to modern slave auctions. The course will entail several small collection projects to give students anunderstanding of the work a folklorist does in the field and how folklore is coproduced within a community, and a longer research project. This course satisfies the Humanities requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies. Same as U89 AMCS 478A Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U98 MLA 5497 Shakespeare and His Contemporaries Though we often read Shakespeare in isolation, he developed his art in the vibrant theatrical culture of late 16th- and early 17th-century London, whose audiences discovered his distinctive qualities in comparison with other playwrights. In this course, we will read plays both by Shakespeare and by some of his most interesting contemporaries \u2014 including Kydd, Marlowe, Jonson, Webster, Beaumont, and Fletcher \u2014 and consider why some plays are \"of an age\" and others \"for all time.\" This course will count toward the major in English literature for day students.

The class will analyze individual instances of envy, greed, anger, and brutality in novels depicting the early modern through the present, including Dunant, Birth of Venus ; Racine, Ph\u00e8dre; Laclos, Dangerous Reader; Coetzee, Disgrace; and Barnes, Sense of an Ending, as well as examples of contemporary cinema by Kassovitz (Hate) and Haneke ( The White Ribbon ). Our goal is to consider the causes and effect of violence in order to appreciate aesthetic and ethical responses that combat the destructive effects of cruelty. Students enrolled in the DLA program should register for U98 581. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 554 Paris and New York Cultural icons, Paris and New York represent brilliant successes in art, theater, film, and urban design. We will study how the French and Americans define themselves through their premiere cities, notably in the works of leading writers, artists, and architects. The themes of innovation and tradition, order and disorder, integration and isolation as represented by Emile Zola, Marcel Proust, Baron G.-E. Haussmann, Edouard Vuillard, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Stieglitz, Henry James, Jackson Pollock, Adam Gopnik, Woody Allen, and others will guide our examination of the powerful hold Paris and New York have on our imagination. We will study history as reflected in public spaces (monuments, museums, and the streets themselves), exploring how each city functions as a locus of collective memory even as it fashions the future.

Our readings \u2014 including fiction, poetry, drama, and personal writings \u2014 will serve as guides to key historical epochs: the aristocratic culture of the Heian era ( Tale of Genji ), the warrior society of the medieval era (Tale of the Heike ), and the Tanizaki, Mishima, and Oe will expose the complexities of modern Japan. Students will gain an appreciation of Japan's unique heritage, social complexity, and place in East Asia and the world today. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U98 MLA 567 Translating Worlds This course studies different forms of cultural translation, that is, the communication of knowledge, behavior, and language from one culture to another. We will examine how an author reworks earlier and foreign traditions, adapting ideas and practices for which there may be no direct equivalent in the author's own culture. In the new cultural setting, do the roles of men and women shift? Do questions of ethnicity, class, religion, and sexuality become more pronounced, or do they fade away? These questions will frame our study of historic cultural encounters, colonialism, exile, and other processes that shape modernity. Students will explore two dramatic points of cultural intersection: Tolkien's modern reworking of Sir Orfeo, a medieval version of the classical myth of the musician Orpheus and his wife Eurydice; and Goethe's Italian Journey, the journal of the German writer's experiences with the people, art, and history that he encountered during his travels. We will see how diaspora and migration shape perceptions in works by Alejo Carpentier ( The Kingdom of this and Jhumpa Lahiri ( Interpreter of Maladies ). The class will also learn how different scholarly and artistic fields address the concept of cultural translation, including cultural anthropology (James Clifford), film adaptation (Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, inspired by Chekhov's play), and colonial history (Vicente Rafael). In addition, we will discuss how digital technology affects cultural translation today (Google Translate, and projects using geographic information system [GIS] technology). Students will consider challenges facing the humanities and the sciences as these technologies advance. Will it be possible to make all knowledge, and all culturally-specific information, universally accessible? No foreign language experience required. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5701 The Making of the Modern Catholic Church This course will look at three church councils that put their stamp on the Catholic Church at key moments in its history, making it what it is today. The first section will be dedicated to the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which defined the high medieval church as an all-encompassing papal monarchy with broad powers over the lives of all Europeans Christian and non-Christian alike. In the second section, we will turn our attention to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which responded to the threat posed by the Protestant Reformation by reforming the Catholic Church, improving clerical education, tightening ecclesiastical discipline, and defining and defending Catholic doctrine. We will conclude with a consideration of the largest church council ever, Vatican II (1962-1965), which reformed the liturgy and redefined the church to meet the challenges of the modern, multicultural, postcolonial world. Credit 3 units.U98 MLA 572 Genre Cinema: The Art of Variation This seminar explores the role of genre as a powerful means of mainstream cinema to tell compelling stories and structure the viewer's identification. Even though genres such as the melodrama, the western, the romantic comedy, the musical, the science fiction film, the horror film, or the thriller are often seen as quite predictable staples of dominant filmmaking, they also inspire and allow for considerable formal experimentation and thematic departure. This seminar examines the logic of some of the most important genres of Hollywood filmmaking while at the same time emphasizing the creative possibilities of working with certain genre expectations. We discuss such classic representatives of certain genres as Imitation of Life , Stagecoach , His Girl Friday , The Day the Earth Stood Still , 42nd Street , and North By Northwest , and then juxtapose these paradigmatic examples with more contemporary films reworking or pushing the limits of the classical genre system such as Far from Heaven , Lone Star , Blade Runner, Dancer in the Dark , and Breathless . Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 575 From Buggy to Benz: Global Capitalism, Gender, and Race In this course, students will examine global capitalism, with particular attention given to how it intersects with gender, race, and place in specific historical moments. Using critical, historical, and ethnographic perspectives, we will consider the emergence of and changes in capitalism and how it relies on and reproduces particular gender, racial/ethnic, and other hierarchies. Course materials will draw examples from around the world and will include novels, ethnographic and historical case studies, social theory, films, and articles from the popular media. Through written assignments, students demonstrate the ability to examine the impact of capitalism on the environment, health, indigenous and marginalized groups, policy, and access to education, jobs, housing, and other resources. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 576 Haunting the World: Refugees in Literature & Film As of 2019, 65.8 million people \u2014 or 1 in 113 individuals \u2014 have been forcibly displaced within their own countries or across borders. In this course, we will study literary texts, film, and other forms of cultural production that will provide a window into the complex lives of displaced individuals from World War II to the present. In addition to contextualizing the historical and legal significance of such terms as refugee, asylum, sanctuary, non-refoulement, and forced displacement, our discussions will also allow us to engage with the broader meanings of concepts that include human rights, hospitality, identity, belonging, and citizenship. Our course will move chronologically from the early 20th century to the present; the last part of the semester will focus specifically on new forms of storytelling that have emerged as a response to the current \"crisis.\" Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 578 Representing Religion, Race, and Gender in Early Modern Latin America This seminar explores the history of religion, gender, and empire in Latin America, focusing primarily on the colonial period (1492-1821) but also including some precolonial materials. Through primary documents, secondary scholarship and student-centered discussion, we will consider connections 68Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Graduate (01/15/21) between religious beliefs, gender norms and relations, and the ways that race, class, and gender intersected with ideas about religion, empire and power. We will study the clash of religions that occurred during the conquest and its terrible aftermath, the politics of evangelization, and how marginalized subjects such as women, African slaves, and Indigenous peoples navigated religious authoritarianism to develop their own spiritual beliefs and expressions. Finally, we will take a brief look at how some of these religious practices have persisted until the present day and what these legacies can tell us about questions of race and gender in a religious context in Latin America. This course will also introduce students to key research methods in the humanities and to the conventions of graduate-level writing necessary for completing the degree thesis. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 581 DLA Interdisciplinary Proseminar This gateway course to the DLA program provides training in analytic thinking and writing through critical examination, discussion, research, and progressive writing on interdisciplinary topics such as historical narrative, text and image, the life of the mind, the creative impulse, the good life, and other major themes that have guided scholarly investigation and research in many fields. Students will analyze works from at least four disciplines (e.g., literature, art history, film, history, philosophy, women and gender studies, religion, political science, anthropology, history of science) and write a progressive research paper, submitted and reviewed incrementally, that demonstrates comparative, analytic, and critical thinking. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 592 Decoding the City Does the space between a house and the sidewalk tell you something about class? Does a vacant lot on a dead-end street record the forced relocation of thousands of black residents? Can street names narrate the relationship between the growth of the city and national narratives of immigrant assimilation, continental expansion and world wars? The answer to these questions is yes, but it is far from obvious. The built environment of an American city like St. Louis can seem opaque and silent, when actually it is laden with social, economic, political, gender and racial meanings. This course unpacks St. Louis' built environment by drawing broad historic and theoretical readings on urban space to specific local sites. Readings will assist students in the interrogation of actual places in St. Louis through field visits, so that the streets become unquiet and the embedded meanings in plain sight. This is a hybrid course, with an online discussion component and weekly field work sessions. Attendance at these field work sessions is mandatory. The course counts toward the American Culture Studies major for day students, and fulfills the Humanities and Social Science requirements for the M.A. Program in American Culture Studies. Same as U89 AMCS 492 Credit 3 units. UColl: U98 MLA 5931 The of and Bach In his magisterial J.S. Bach , Albert Schweitzer observes that we \"classify the arts according to the material [artists] use to express the world around them.\" We describe tones for a musician, colors for a painter, and words for a poet. But \"the material,\" he notes, \"is secondary. [Each] is not only a painter, or only a poet, or only a musician, but all in one.\" In this course we will examine works by the poet Milton, the artist Rembrandt, and the musician J.S. Bach, three major figures of the Baroque era. We will examine how they conceive their role and the function of theirworks, as well as their treatment of both religious and secular subjects. We will also consider the rich variety of techniques that these artists employ to achieve the most complex and compelling rendering of subjects that extend from the mystery of divine justice in a dark world to the most intimate and searching self-examination. Works to include, among others, Milton's Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes; Bach's St. Matthew Passion and Art of the Fugue ; self-portraits by Rembrandt, as well as some of his Biblical paintings and etchings. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5941 Milton This course analyzes the world of John Milton, arguably the greatest of English poets and also among the greatest of polymaths. The class will examine how, for Milton, extensive learning rhymed with magnificent poetry. Having read every significant book published up until his time in an attempt to educate himself \"to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war,\" Milton produced an epic poem of such scope and power that \"the world would not willingly let it die.\" We will closely read that poem, Paradise Lost , as well as his other major poems ( Paradise Regained ; Samson Agonistes ), adding lesser poems and prose works to illuminate his development as a writer and thinker, and his relation to theological, literary, intellectual, and political currents of the 17th century.

Sociocultural anthropology is a good foundation for careers with an international focus as well as those such as education, medicine and business, which require an understanding of human cultural behavior. Biological anthropology provides background for work in zoology, conservation and public health venues. Archaeological anthropology is particularly useful for historical and cultural approaches to institutions.

U69 Anthro 100 Introduction to Anthropology Anthropology is a field that seeks to synthesize and integrate all aspects of what it means to be human, including the study of human diversity across time and space. Anthropologists are collectively interested in studying humans from a holistic perspective, including cultural, linguistic, and biological anthropology and archaeology. This course aims to introduce students to basic concepts within anthropology, integrating the perspectives and methods of each of the subfields into the approach. We will examine how culture, environment, and biology are intertwined in the variation seen within humans both past and present. Topics addressed will include aspects of human evolution and variation, non-human primates, Paleolithic cultures, subsistence strategies, kinship, political organization, the rise and fall of complex societies, religion, language, globalization, and anthropology in the present and future.

U69 Anthro 190 Introduction to Archaeology Archaeology plays a critical and unique role in understanding the human past. Through study of the methods and theories of archaeology, and a survey of important firsts in the human past, this course introduces students to the way archaeologists use material culture to reconstruct and understand human behavior. Chronologically ordered case studies from around the globe are used to look at social, ecological, and cultural issues facing humans from the earliest times to the present. Students gain practice reconstructing the past through hands-on participation in two 1-hour labs focusing on lithics and animal bones. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to think critically about how the past is presented, and why, and the importance of the past as it relates to the present and future.

Same as L48 Anthro Achievements of Past Civilizations This course is a selective survey of some milestone achievements of past civilizations that have a far-reaching impact on our modern society. Using examples from archaeological sites around the world this class will explore how these achievements have changed the developmental trajectory of humanities. A feature of this course is that it will not only discuss the achievements of the so-called cradles of civilization but also those areas that receive much less scholarly attention in the study of ancient civilizations, such as Central Asia and Sub-Sahara Africa. Besides learning about archaeological facts, students who take this course will also get exposure to basic archaeological theories and methods. Some topics we will cover in this class include the domestication of crops and animals, the emergence of early cities, the invention of metallurgy, and the arrival of state societies. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 260 Topics in Health and Community A survey of current topics in community health and medicine, with an emphasis upon social science approaches to issues affecting medicine and medical care in contemporary U.S. society. Issues include ethical debates in health care delivery, social stratification and health, access to health services, and factors affecting community wellness at local, national, and global levels. Presented as a weekly series of topical presentations by community health experts from the St. Louis area. Required for students enrolled in the Medicine and Society Program, and also open to other interested students.Credit 1 unit. U69 Anthro 280 Introduction to Anthropological Genetics Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. In the post-genomic era, we now have the capability to uncover the genetic basis of being human. This course will examine the intersection of genetics and anthropology. Students will be taught the basic principles of molecular evolutionary analysis and population genetics that are applied to the study of humans and other primates. In addition, students will learn how genetic data can supplement the archaeological, linguistic, cultural, paleoanthropological, and comparative primate research of traditional anthropology. Specifically, we will survey (1) methods of measuring and drawing inferences from human genetic variation, (2) theories of modern human origins and peopling of the world, and (3) recent advances in studying the genetic underpinnings for human disease. The first portion of every class will be devoted to lecture while the latter half will be a discussion of the assigned articles. There will be one in-class laboratory in which we explore some of the electronic resources available to anthropological geneticists. Finally, we will spend part of one class engaged in lively scientific debate over the question: are modern humans still evolving? Students should leave this class with a basic understanding of the contribution of genetics to the field of anthropology and how anthropological knowledge can illuminate genetic findings.

U69 Anthro 3004 Second Sight: Topics in Visual Anthropology Visual anthropology is as old as the camera, and, like North Atlantic anthropology, it shares a long history with colonial exploitation and expansion. This course examines the history of both ethnographic film and photography and considers the ethics of visual anthropology in the 21st century. This survey of ethnographic film and photography aims to familiarize students with the concepts of visual anthropology and to introduce a variety of ethnographic and media studies concepts, theories, methods, and ethical considerations. Drawing from a broad spectrum of materials, we will focus on analyzing film and photography in class, discussing ethics, challenging the boundaries of ethnographic conventions, and inviting filmmakers and photographers into conversation via Skype. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3014 Wining and Dining in the Classical World The focus of this course will be food culture in Greek and Roman societies from the Archaic to the late Roman period. However, foodways from adjacent contemporary cultures will also be briefly examined. Sources will include textual evidence, as well as ethnographic studies of ancient people, iconographic and archaeological evidence, specifically osteological and botanical remains from archaeological sites. Experimental studies will be conducted in class to augment the learning experience of students.

The emphasis is on historical and ethnological relationships, social and political structure, religious pluralism and contemporary youth issues. We will explore the lived experiences of the peoples in the modern nation-states of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, and Iran. We will access this material through short stories, poetry, biographies, essays, videos, blogs, and political and anthropological reports. Same as L48 Anthro to Human Ecology Human ecology investigates the complex relationships between humans and their environment. The discipline is typically divided into two primary fields of research: cultural ecology (the study of cultural solutions to environmental challenges) and human biological ecology (the study of physical changes that occur in response to environmental stressors). This course examines both biological and cultural human adaptation to the earth's major ecosystems and surveys human subsistence strategies within these environments. Students will investigate the consequences of population growth, modernization, nutritional disparities, medical ethics, and environmental stewardship in a globalized world. The final section of the course will focus on world globalization, modernization, inequality, and health. Credit 3 units. UColl: ML U69 Anthro 3038 Ancient Technologies This course is designed to examine technologies developed in the ancient world, from Prehistoric to Roman times. The course is structured around the use of key materials such as wood, textile, stone, clay, and metal. Larger themes, such as agriculture, warfare, and seafaring, combine these technologies to fulfill necessary and desired functions. The main focus of this course is Greek and Roman technologies, though some references will be made to adjacent cultures, such as Mesopotamian hunting, Egyptian engineering, Scythian tattooing, and the foodways and medicines of Germanic tribes. After the first two sessions, class will meet every alternate week for this hybrid course. Two meetings will include field trips to make pottery and observe cuttlebone metal pendant molding at Craft Alliance (material costs included in the fees), and examine manufacturing techniques from real artifacts at the Saint Louis Art Museum. Same as U02 Classics 3036 Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 308M Race Matters! How Race and Racism Affect Health and Medicine This course grapples with the relationships among race, racism, health, and medicine, both in the United States and abroad. It examines the historical roots of medical racism, the role of medical and genetic research in constructing and deconstructing race as a biological concept, and the ways that systemic racism harms health. This course will also consider how race operates with other intersecting social and political identities (e.g., ethnicity, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability) to influence health outcomes. Although anthropological andcritical race theories will frame our learning, we will read broadly across other disciplines, including (but not limited to) sociology, the history of medicine, law, public health, and science and technology studies.

UColl: OLI U69 Anthro 3093 Anthropology of Modern Latin America A survey of current issues in the anthropological study of culture, politics, and change across contemporary Latin American and the Caribbean. Topics include machismo and feminismo, the drug war, race and mestizaje, yuppies and revolutionaries, ethnic movements, pop culture, violence, multinational business, and the cultural politics of U.S.-Latin American relations. Attention will be given to the ways that anthropology is used to understand complex cultural and social processes in a region thoroughly shaped by globalization. Same as L48 Anthro 3093 Ancient Civilizations of the New World An examination of the Inca empire in Peru, and the Maya and Aztec empires in Mexico through the inquiry into the roots, development, form, and evolutionary history of pre- Colombian civilization in each region from its earliest times to the rise of the classic kingdoms. Examples of respective artistic accomplishments will be presented and discussed. Same as L48 Anthro 310C Credit 3 HUM U69 Plants in the Life of New World Cultures: Past and Present Perspectives This course looks at the diverse ways in which past cultures in the New World domesticated, processed, consumed, and ritualized plants. Looking at pre-Columbian societies, we will study how certain plants native to the New World were used in daily and sacred activities, and how some are featured in myths and creation stories. We look at the period after the Columbian exchange to understand how colonialism in the New World and the introduction of Old World plants impacted societies in the New World. We will also consider how some of these New World plants shape the world we live in today. We will study both archaeological and historical perspectives, and learn to evaluate archaeologic evidence that relates to the plant world in the Americas. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 3164 Origins of Chinese Civilization and Arts This course traces Chinese civilization from its formative period, extending from the Neolithic period (10,000 BP to circa 3000 BCE), through the Bronze Age (from circa 3000 BCE to the Shang and Zhou dynasties) to the early dynastic period (Qin and Han dynasties). We cover a wide variety of contributions and achievements from early Chinese civilization, such as bronze vessels and metallurgy, porcelain, jade, writing systems, martial arts, and cuisine, as we become familiar with the history and material culture of the critical formative period of Chinese civilization.

UColl: CD 91Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) U69 Anthro 3206 Global Gender Issues This course compares the life experiences of women and men in societies throughout the world. We will discuss the evidence regarding the universal subordination of women, and we will examine explanations that propose to situate women's and men's personality attributes, roles, and responsibilities in the biological or cultural domains. In general, through readings, films, and lectures, the class will provide a cross-cultural perspective on ideas regarding gender and how gendered meanings, practices, and performances serve as structuring principles in society.

U69 Anthro 3215 Food, Culture, Power The foods we eat, the way we get them, the way we produce them, and the way in which we eat them speak volumes about our beliefs, our technology, our understanding of how the world works, and our ability to function within it. Food connects consumers and producers through vast global supply chains that enable cheap fresh food year-round for some but require others to live on desperately low wages. Throughout the world, the way we eat has serious consequences for how we make a living, manage our environment, and stay healthy. This course is designed to make students think critically about the food they eat and the way it is produced. This course is divided into four parts and each week will have a thematic focus. We will begin at the beginning \u2014 the origins of agriculture, modern hunting and gathering, and pastoralism. What did we evolve to eat? Is agriculture \"better\" than hunting and gathering? What does it mean to say that? The third section of the class will introduce us to the commodity chain \u2014 the way by which people who do not produce food themselves eat. How have the history and politics of our economy shaped the way that we eat globally? How has food been used to understand other cultures? Then we will discuss the views of food and agriculture that have informed our modern perception of food and production. Are there too many people? What does the future of food look like? Why do some foods make us nauseous while people love them? We will conclude by examining the recent wave of interest in alternatives to that system, questioning how food came to take such a prominent place in our society after such a long period of neglect.

BU: SCI U69 Anthro 3306 Introduction to Forensic Anthropology This course is an introduction to the field of forensic anthropology, which involves the analysis of human skeletal remains within the context of a legal investigation. We will explore how forensic anthropologists use their knowledge of human osteology, dentition, skeletal variation, and pathology to identify human remains. Specifically students will learn how to attribute sex, age, ancestry, and stature to skeletal material as well as how to establish the forensic context, estimate time since death, crime scene investigation, trauma identification, and recovery scene methods. A number of invited guest speakers will expose students to the multidisciplinary nature of this field. We will also discuss the application of forensic anthropology to human rights issues. This course will involve both lecture and hands-on labs during which students will be working with skeletal materials. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3308 Race Matters! How Race and Racism Affect Health and Medicine This course grapples with the relationships among race, racism, health, and medicine, both in the United States and abroad. It examines the historical roots of medical racism, the role of medical and genetic research in constructing and deconstructing race as a biological concept, and the ways that systemic racism harms health. This course will also consider how race operates with other intersecting social and political identities (e.g., ethnicity, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability) to influence health outcomes. Although anthropological and critical race theories will frame our learning, we will read broadly across other disciplines, including (but not limited to) sociology, the history of medicine, law, public health, and science and technology studies. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLI U69 Anthro 333 Culture and Health A survey of cultural dimension in health, disease, wellness, illness, healing, curing, as seen in selected alternative medical traditions.

Lectures, video case studies, approximately eight textbooks. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 3381 Media, Politics and Religion What are media and mass media? How are we to understand mass media in relation to politics and religion? With the emergence of mass media, political and religious movements have been consolidated among increasingly diverse and larger populations. This course will address the origins and development of these media, movements, and populations in both local and global contexts. Specifically, we will investigate how information technologies -- from books and newspapers to radio, television and the internet -- engage with democracy, 92Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) nationalism, and a wide range of political and religious movements around the world. We will discuss the current dynamics of these phenomena as well as what to expect in the coming years. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3421 Becoming Human Paleolithic cave paintings, elaborate burials, engravings, and figurines have long been celebrated by scholars and the public alike as some of the earliest evidence of human artistic expression. This course will survey the evolution of Paleolithic art and symbolic behaviors among Homo sapiens and closely related species such as the Neanderthals. We will explore explanations for the origin(s) of symbolic expression and spend some time situating the evidence within its appropriate archaeological contexts. We will then investigate the many possible meanings and functions of Paleolithic symbolic objects (e.g., personal ornaments, figurines, rock art, burial goods), and we will explore the range of technologies and actions involved in creative expression. Some topics covered include \"shamanic\" interpretations of Paleolithic art, the so-called \"Venus\" figurines, the origins and elaboration of human burial, rites of passage, and the diversity of Paleolithic rock art. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the symbolic underpinnings that make us human through a mixture of hands-on activities, projects, and discussion. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3422 American Indian Art, Symbol and Meaning An introduction to the arts among a broad range of native peoples who inhabited North, Middle, and South America. Course begins with basic concepts of art and anthropology. Emphasis is on the iconography found in various art styles, particularly the prehistoric rock carvings and paintings left by Native Americans throughout the New World. Oral traditions and myths found in the ethnographic record provide fascinating associations and interpretations. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 3423 Body Art/Body Modification Across Cultures All cultures practice one form or another of body modification. It can be in the form of face or body painting, piercing, tattooing, scarring, or re-shaping. Body modification is usually done to indicate social position, family, marital status, identity with a particular ethnic, age, or gender group, perform a rite of passage such as puberty, ward off or invoke the spirits, or send a message. This course explores body art and body modification in several world cultures -- including our own. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 3471 Archaeology of the St. Louis Region This course introduces students to archaeology of the St. Louis region and explores the cultures of its early inhabitants, from 12,000 years ago through the 19th century. We study a number of very important archaeological sites in the region, including Mastodon State Park, where artifacts of human manufacture were found in direct association with extinct mastodons dating to about 12,000 years ago, and Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site (a World Heritage Site) in Illinois, dating to the Mississippian period AD 1050-1350. We also examine methods and theories used by archaeologists to understand archaeological remains. Credit 3 units.U69 Anthro 3476 Archeologies of Graffiti from Antiquity to the Present The modern story of graffiti \u2014 revolving around social, economic, and political contexts such as bathroom stalls, subways and alleys steeped with urine and trash, decrepit buildings and train cars situated in less reputable areas of cities and towns \u2014 leads people to associate it with antisocial behaviors, dissent, and the vandalism of public and private property. However, some people consider graffiti as a legitimate form of art, communication, and a somewhat anonymous expression of current social climates. The disparity between these two perspectives has provided a great deal to study for social scientists. However, a consideration of graffiti's simple definition \u2014 words or drawings etched or painted on some surface in a public place \u2014 leads us to recognize that feats of graffiti originate way before the inner-city movements of the 1970s. In this class we will draw upon a range of studies from archaeology, anthropology, sociology, art, and history to broadly explore the creation and meaning of graffiti from antiquity to the present. Our goal is to learn how to examine the form, function, and context of graffiti across cultures and through time, with regard to the circumstances of its creation. In doing so, we aspire to better understand what lies behind the human urge to leave a mark. Prerequisite: Introduction to Archaeology. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3531 Love, Courtship, and Marriage in Africa: The Anthropologies of Intimacy and Conjugality This course is an exploration of past and present anthropological inquiry into love, courtship, and marriage across the African continent. The course explores the various reasons that love on the continent has been of great interest to social scientists in certain historical moments while completely ignored in others. Other key questions in this course revolve around making connections between love and political economies, kinship, gender, health, labor migration, colonialism, and the law, among other key topics. The course will begin by introducing students to earlier anthropological assumptions, which presumed that intimacies in African contexts were tied to urbanization or development theory. Early anthropological works often ignored long histories of companionate relationships and love, setting them at odds with kinship involvement. Only since the 1990s has anthropological inquiry begun to consider intimacy and affect in Africa more fully. The bulk of the semester will be spent exploring these recent contributions. Course goals include tracing the history of scholarship on love in Africa, exploring contemporary ethnographies in local and global context, and thinking critically through anthropological inquiry and methodologies. Course materials will include a mix of ethnography, scholarly journal articles, and popular news clips as well as films and novels by African scholars and artists. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 361 Culture and Environment An introduction to the ecology of human culture, especially how \"traditional\" cultural ecosystems are organized and how they change with population density.

A&S (01/15/21) U69 Anthro 3621 Anthropology of Human Birth This course will examine the interaction between human biology and culture in relation to childbirth. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the cultural challenges posed by the physiology of human reproduction, the ways various cultures have attempted to meet those challenges, and the resultant consequences that this has had for women's lives. The course will draw on material from human anatomy and embryology, paleoanthropology, clinical obstetrics, public health, social anthropology, the history of medicine, and contemporary bioethics. Same as L48 Anthro Female Life Cycle in Cross-Cultural Perspective This course will examine the biology of the female reproductive cycle \u2014 menarche, menstruation, and the menopause \u2014 and its cultural interpretation around the world. Topics covered will include the embryology of human sexual differentiation, the biology of the menstrual cycle and how it influences or is influenced by various disease states, contraception, infertility, cultural taboos and beliefs about menstruation and menopause, etc. The course will utilize materials drawn from human biology, clinical gynecology, ethnography, social anthropology, and the history of medicine and will examine the interplay between female reproductive biology and culture around the world. Same as L48 Anthro 3625 Animal Behavior at the St. Louis Zoo This course is an introduction to methods for the collection of behavioral data in studies of animal behavior. Students will be trained in the design of research projects and the analysis and interpretation of behavioral data. Students will learn how different methods are used to answer specific questions in animal behavior research. Research will be conducted at the St. Louis Zoo. Credit 3 units.

U69 Anthro 3691 Kill Assessment: An Investigation into Death, Genocide, and Other Forms of Violence This course analyzes violence as an integral component of culture and social relations, rather than as random acts which are marginal to society. We consider different types of violence \u2014 physical, intersubjective, structural and symbolic, and focus on its complex cultural, social, and structural manifestations. We study specific examples which span different historical time periods, regions of the world, scales of experience and disciplinary paradigms. Examples include state violence and genocide in Guatemala, torture in Chile and Argentina, structural and economic violence in Latin America, murder and the alienated work of serial killers in the U.S., violence and black humor, hip-hop aesthetics in Brazil, violence in new Brazilian cinema, and violence and care in neoliberal Chile. We also explore how violence becomes an aesthetic object, a commodity, and a valued resource for cultural production and consumption. This multifaceted approach helps us to evaluate particular anthropological contributions to our understandings of violence.Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 3775 Ancient Eurasia & The New Silk Roads This course will explore the rise of civilization in the broad region of Eurasia, spanning from the eastern edges of Europe to the western edges of China. The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250). In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries. Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more. This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse. Same as L48 Anthro 3775 Credit 3 units. 3777 Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) is an 8-week educational program designed to help students cultivate compassion, strengthen their resilience, feel more connected to others, and improve their overall sense of well-being. CCT is a distillation from Tibetan Mahyana Buddhist practices for developing compassion, adapted to a secular setting. Initially developed by Stanford University scholars with support from the Dalai Lama, CCT combines traditional contemplative practices with contemporary psychology and scientific research. The program involves instruction in a series of meditation practices starting with mindfulness-based meditation. The curriculum uses modern concepts of psychology and neuroscience to understand and enhance our ability to be compassionate. Credit 1 unit. U69 Anthro 3795 Anthropology and Climate Change: Past, Present, and Future This course provides an overview for interplay between humanity and global climate change that encompasses three-field anthropological subjects. Course material includes the role of climate change in shaping human evolution, human solutions to climatic challenges through time, the impact of human activities on the climate, and modern sociocultural examinations of how climate change is affecting the lives of people around the world. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLI U69 Anthro 3796 Ecocide and Climate Change: The Collapse of Societies How can we use the past to help solve modern issues of climate change? In the face of modern climate change and environmental degradation, many have turned to examining how past societies successfully or unsuccessfully responded to environmental change. This seminar-style course will survey how academic and public discourse use historical and archaeological examples of past human response to environmental change to evaluate our best options to thrive in a globally warmer environment. By reading public intellectual works by anthropologists, economists, and geographers, we will 94Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) first examine current theoretical understandings of why societies collapse and the impacts that future climate change may have on our modern societies. We will then turn our attention to past societies and study how past people responded to past challenges of environmental change. By evaluating discourse between the past and the present, we will examine which methods and theories are the most helpful when using the past to inform future strategies addressing modern issues of environmental degradation and climate change. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 387 Medical Anthropology This overview of the field of medical anthropology provides a perspective on health, medical systems, disease, and culture. We examine beliefs about illness, healing, and the body across cultures. We learn to distinguish physical \"disease\" from cultural understandings of \"illness\" and explore the ways that cultural conceptions shape the experience of illness. We look at the interaction of biology and culture as it affects health and medical systems. Throughout the course, we compare other beliefs and health systems with our own culture's management of health and illness. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD U69 Anthro 3876 Darwin and Doctors: Evolutionary Medicine and Health Back pain, diabetes, obesity, colds, even morning sickness. These are all common human health problems.

Art: NSM BU: SCI U69 Anthro 3880 Multispecies World: Animals, Global Health, and Environment Amid escalating global environmental and health crises that impact all forms of life, this course critically considers the diverse relationships of humans with other forms of life and varied ecological systems. Although the discipline has long studied humans' use of and impact on environments, anthropologists have begun to increasingly pay attention to human-animal cohabitations, engagements, and shared cultures and worlds. This seminar looks at how diverse contemporary contexts -- such as zoos, farms, forests, and laboratories -- involve fascinating human-animal relationships and contentious implications for ethics, health, and ecology. In investigating how animals are central to scientific knowledge production, debates about animal welfare, environmental sustainability issues, companionship and pets, entertainment and sports, and zoonic disease, we will explore the possibility for more richly understanding the world by fully appreciating species diversity and interconnectivity.

Topics covered include: The U.S. crisis in historical and international perspective; corporate finance of firms and banks in closed and open economy; monetary and fiscal policy intervention; the open economy dimension of the financial crisis; the European Sovereign Debt crisis. 104Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) Same Economy Macroeconomics This course will begin with a review of international trade theory, of the balance of payment accounts and their relationship to international borrowing and lending. We will then study the asset approach to exchange rates determination, exchange rate behavior in the short and in the long run, and the relationship of exchange rates with prices and output. The course will also explore monetary and fiscal policy under both fixed and floating exchange rates, macroeconomic policy coordination and optimum currency areas, international debt problems of developing countries and their relation to stabilization program. Prerequisite: Econ 4021. Same as Economics The economic function of the city and the role of the city in the national economy are discussed.

Prerequisite: Econ 4011. Same as This course provides a more in depth look into quantitative methods used in contemporary macroeconomic analysis. We will cover numerical methods used in dynamic optimization. In practice, we will apply these methods to solve two major models used in macroeconomic analysis, using both Excel and Matlab. The Neoclassical Growth Model and its variants are used to study aggregate trends and aggregate effects of government policy. The lifecycle model is used to examine questions involving decision-making over the lifecycle. We will learn how to use empirical observations for the purpose of calibrating model parameters and how to conduct policy evaluation in the context of calibrated models. Our policy evaluation will focus on fiscal policy (taxes) and social security issues. Prerequisites: 4011 and 4021. Same as units. A&S IQ: SSC EN: S English Because it speaks to our imagination, literature allows us to approach the moral, ethical, social and political dilemmas of the human situation in an integrated way. The beautiful and the well- argued, the felt and the reasoned, the actual and the possible, the message and the medium: students of literature do not treat these spheres as distinct aspects of human existence, rather \u2014 especially in our department \u2014 they bring these disparate ideas together. The result is that an English degree is recognized as a strong foundation for careers in communications, business, law, social work, the fine arts and teaching.Course work introduces students to important literary texts, to the development of the English language, and to the origins of Western literature and culture. Students develop reading and writing skills, rigorous critical thinking skills, and the ability to communicate complex ideas persuasively, all while obtaining a broad liberal education.

U65 ELit 3131 Seamus Heaney By the time Seamus Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995, he had already built a reputation as one of the foremost poets of his generation, a leading figure in 20th- and early 21st-century verse, widely seen as the true successor to W.B. Yeats as the national bard of Ireland. This course examines the arc of his literary career, working our way chronologically through the poetry, exploring texts in conjunction with their contexts, seeking a deeper understanding of form and meaning through close reading and scholarly engagement with a full range of his writing.

Students will study how the Romantics adopted and adapted the satanic as a counterforce to rationalism and political repression. Often defining by negation, the devil in these books will expose us to core concepts in Western thought including servitude and freedom, cosmic evil and redemption, discipline and justice, possession and liberation. Authors will include Goethe, Blake, Byron, Shelley, Lewis, and Hoffmann.

Literary greats like Emily Dickinson, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Gertrude Stein, and other moderns will be paired with contemporary voices such as Lyn Hejinian, Claudia Rankine, and Thomas Sayers Ellis. Poets often excluded from the canon, such as Patti Smith, Saul Williams, and Taylor Mali, will be considered in connection to a poetry thriving outside the \"ivory tower.\" Rejecting monolithic conceptions of dissent, we shall consider the term \"rebel\" beyond its immediate connotations to include matters of experimentation with voice and form.

As the course title suggests, we will devote most of our time to the career of modernism in the United States, a place imagined as both the modernist nation par excellence and the desert modernism escaped to be born. Three groups of primary texts \u2014 early modernist experiments, 1920s modernist landmarks, and Great Depression revisions \u2014 will illuminate the grand ambitions of eccentric literary forms and sequestered avant-garde movements; the public disputes and buried alliances between \"high\" expatriate and Harlem Renaissance modernisms; and the influential Depression-era reinterpretation of modernism as reactionary self-indulgence. The syllabus will feature fiction, poetry, and drama by old and new literary celebrities: Djuna Barnes, John Dos Passos, T.S. Eliot, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mike Gold, Ernest Hemingway, Nella Larsen, Meridel LeSueur, Claude McKay, Clifford Odets, Tillie Olsen, Ezra Pound, Jean Toomer, and Richard Wright.

UColl: OLH History Meditating on the history of the American South, novelist William Faulkner famously proclaimed, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" Learning about the relationship of the past to the present is what history is all about. The past is indeed not past: it shapes, in complex and powerful ways, the world we live in now. Yet the past can be radically different from the present. Studying history allows us to grasp the immense variety of human experience across time, place and culture; to develop insight into the ways that people understand themselves in relation to the societies in which they live; and to engage critically with contemporary issues. Students who major in history at Washington University are encouraged to cultivate a broad understanding of global themes while also having the flexibility to focus on areas of special interest. Our instructors emphasize the development of analytic skills that are useful not only in history courses but also in a range of occupations and professions, including law, business, communications, education and public policy. These skills include organizing and interpreting data, developing logical and convincing arguments, doing research and sifting the significant from the insignificant, reading with comprehension, and writing with precision and clarity. Whether students pursue a major or a minor or instead simply sample our courses, studying history will help them to develop the knowledge and critical skills that are essential for life in an increasingly complex and contentious in History Required courses: 27 units 117Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) All University College undergraduate students must satisfy the same general-education requirements (p. 87). Requirements specific to this major include the following: Introductory courses (6 units): One introductory course chosen from this list: Code Title Units Hist 101 Western Civilization 3 Hist 102 Western Civilization II: 1650 to the Present3 Hist 163 Introduction to the History of the U.S. 3 Hist 164 Introduction to World History: China and the Silk Road: Then and Now3 Hist 209 America to the Civil War 3 Hist 210 U.S. History Since 1865 3 One additional introductory course (any 100- or 200-level History course) Advanced-level courses (18 units): At least 18 units of 300- or 400-level courses, including the following: One course designated \"premodern\" and one course designated \"modern\" One course each from three of the following geographical areas: Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, or the United States or transregional history* *If a student chooses to count a transregional course toward the geographical requirement, at least one of the two other geographical areas must cover a region that is not included in the transregional course. For example, a student who has completed courses in U.S. and Latin American history could not count toward this requirement a transregional course that examines the comparative history of the United States and Latin America. Capstone experience (3 units): A capstone experience, consisting of either one specifically designated Research Seminar or an Honors Research Project, must be completed. The Honors Research Project is reserved for students admitted to the University College Undergraduate Honors Program. Research Seminars are upper-level, limited-enrollment courses that emphasize engagement with primary sources. Course assignments will feature texts and images from a variety of published and manuscript materials, and students will research and write a substantial paper over the course of the semester from independently selected and analyzed primary sources. All research seminars will be so designated.The Honors Research Project requires enrollment in U16 Hist 399 during both the fall and spring semesters (3 credits per semester). As a result, for students admitted to the University College Undergraduate Honors Program, the history major will consist of a minimum of 30 units. It is highly recommended that, before undertaking the Research Project, students enroll in one or more Research Seminars (which would, in this case, count toward the required 18 units of advanced-level courses).

U16 Hist 101 Western Civilization This course is an introduction to history as a discipline, and an analysis of Western civilization from its prehistoric origins to the 17th century. We will begin with an examination of the three historical cultures from which this civilization was to draw many of its traditions: the Near East, Greece, and Rome. The course will go on to discuss the adoption of these traditions by the Celtic and Germanic peoples; the formation of kingdoms which would prefigure contemporary European nations; and the development of the culture of Latin Christendom. We will examine external interaction between Latin Christendom and its Slavic, Byzantine and Islamic neighbors, the resurgence of interest in classical culture, the effects of famine and pandemic, and challenges to secular and religious authority. Students in these fields will become more aware of how human values, ideas of justice, and methods of interpretation influenced and have been influenced by time, culture and personal perspective.

Particular attention will be paid to the evolving relationship between the individual and the state during their period. Credit 3 units. U16 Hist 102D Barbarity and Civilization in Modern Europe The history of modern Europe is one of both barbarity and civilization. While Europeans staged revolutions to fight for democracy and argued for universal human rights, they also trafficked in slaves and practiced genocide. This course is a survey of modern European history, from Columbus' arrival in the New World through the twentieth century. While major historical events like the French and Russian Revolutions, or the World Wars, will certainly be covered in detail, we will also focus our attention on longer-term developments like the rise of nationalism, the changing status of women, and the importance of race and religion in defining what it has meant to be European. Lastly this course will serve as an introduction to the practice of history and will familiarize students with a variety of different approaches: political, cultural, economic, global, comparative, social, and intellectual. As such, our readings will range from philosophical treatises and popular novels to academic articles and manifestos. Introductory course to the major and minor.

It introduces students to the critical, analytical skills required for historical scholarship and should be regarded as a prerequisite for courses of a higher number in American History. As a survey, this course strives to introduce students comprehensively to current knowledge about the American past, but some degree of special focus is always necessary. In this case, we will aim to understand the historical background to contemporary American politics, broadly speaking: We will study the social, economic, and cultural affairs that helped to create division and conflict as well as alliance and consensus among groups of Americans. We will also study the development of political doctrines, electoral procedures, constitutional standards, public policy, and the status of American society and government in the world.

UColl: OLI U16 Hist 164 Introduction to World History: China and the Silk Road: Then and Now The ancient \"Silk Roads\" that connected China with Europe (130 BCE-1453 CE) also included trade routes through Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Silk and other goods, arts, religion, cultures, ideas, and technology were transferred on these routes and later on interconnected water routes during the Age of Discovery (1453-1660 CE). In the 21st century, the Silk Road is the basis for new global trade routes, tourism, cultural exchange, and even the growth of new cities. Credit 3 units.

Topics include Southern plantation life, the Civil War, Jim Crow, Southern music, and the Civil Rights Movement. Using film, photography, and other media, the course also considers representations of the South in popular culture. Particular attention is paid to how images and stereotypes of the South have evolved-and to how the region's history has influenced the nation as a whole. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLI U16 Hist 217 The Italian Family from the Renaissance to Today The Italian family, which is the basic building block of the Italian society and state, has been extremely resilient yet continually evolving. This course focuses on the institution as well as the roles of women, men, children, and servants from the Renaissance (15th century) until today. We will discuss the historical roles of mothers vs. fathers, shared family time and resources, family-run workshops, and how couples planned, named and educated their offspring. We will examine how the family can be experienced in a variety of ways, including the form of the papal famiglia and all-male households headed by cardinals. Finally, we will see how divorce legislation (1970) destroyed the notion of eternal family solidarity. The family is still being shaped as Italians recently legalized same-sex civil unions (2016), forcing them to define what a family is and what rights its members should enjoy. We will consider Pope Francis' role in discussions of Italian and global family life in a nation that hosts thousands of migrant families, too. Credit 3 units. U16 Hist 2216 Books and Bodies Books and Bodies is a five-week course held in the Special Collections department of the Bernard Becker Medical Library. The course explores how changes in medical knowledge and print technology have influenced depictions of the human body from the 15th through the 19th centuries. Each week students will explore an aspect of print and medical history by examining the library's rare materials and carrying out exercises that require them to make use of the library's resources. The course will not only provide students with an overview of the development of anatomical illustration, but will also provide them with an understanding of special collections research.

UColl: HSM, HUS, OLI U16 Hist 3031 Wining and Dining in the Classical World: Food Culture in Classical Antiquity The focus of this course will be food culture in Greek and Roman societies from the Archaic to the late Roman period. However, foodways from adjacent contemporary cultures will also be briefly examined. Sources will include textual evidence, as well as ethnographic studies of ancient people, iconographic and archaeological evidence, specifically osteological and botanical remains from archaeological sites. Experimental studies will be conducted in class to augment the learning experience of students. Same as U02 Classics 3031 Credit 3 units. U16 Hist 3068 An Inconvenient Truth: The Human History of Climate Change Although global warming is unprecedented in its origin and potential consequences for human beings, climate change itself is actually nothing new. For thousands of years, entirely natural influences have altered Earth's climate in ways that shaped human history. Eighteenth-century advisors to the king of France were warning that deforestation would have an adverse effect on rainfall. The Little Ice Age that began in the 16th century altered settlement patterns, forced new trade networks, and encouraged innovations in agriculture. In this course, we will examine the longer history of climate change and how it has been addressed as a scientific, political, and environmental issue. We will look at such climate phenomena as the discovery of the Green House Effect, El Ni\u00f1o events in the late-19th century, and glacial melting in the 20th century. This course will also introduce students to the field of environmental history 120Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) and explore how the methods of this field of inquiry challenge traditional historical categories. We will consider the following questions: What happens when time is no longer bounded by the written word and is understood in geological terms? How does history play out when the actors driving the action of the story are non-human?How might historians geographically frame their narratives when the subject matter is rarely bounded by the political borders of human communities? Credit 3 units. UColl: HSM, HTR U16 Hist 3077 Civil Liberties in Wartime This course will examine the history of American civil liberties in times of war and international tension. The class will begin by examining how English political traditions, Enlightenment philosophies, and the experience of the American Revolution helped to forge American principles of civil liberty as defined in the Bill of Rights. Students will explore how the experience of war and international conflict places these principles under stress, focusing in particular on the following episodes: the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts; the Civil War; the American governance of the Philippines; the two World Wars; the Cold War; and the response to terrorism.

It will identify the region's Christian and Islamic inheritances. It will investigate the history of great power tensions over Syria. It will explore New Silk Road economic development corridors. It will assess Russia's historic interests in the region. Finally, it will debate the implications of an emerging Kurdish homeland in Northern Syria and beyond. Topics include: Kurdish question, Sykes-Picot Agreement, New Cold War, Silk Road infrastructure corridors. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, HME U16 Hist 3165 The Classic Dynasties of China This course takes as its focus the period in Chinese history when cultural and political patterns were established. After a brief survey of the earliest periods of Chinese history, the course moves from the T'ang Dynasty through the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. Extensive primary sources from each dynastywill be supplemented by a set of historical works that we will read and discuss. The sources and books will address social and cultural development along with diverse aspects of daily life. The class concludes with an examination of the elements of decline evident during the late Qing Dynasty and an exploration of the major themes of Chinese history that we have discovered in our semester study. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, HEA, HSP U16 Hist 3167 China and Japan 1800 to 1949 This course focuses on China and Japan's encounters with the West in the 19th century and how that contact helped shape both nations' destinies in the first half of the 20th century. To resist Western intrusion, China and Japan ultimately had to transform themselves while attempting to preserve their cultural identity. China struggled for much of this time to find the correct formula for resistance, while Japan became a superpower only to plunge itself and China into the cataclysm of World War II. In this course, we examine why each followed the path it chose, the profound consequences of those decisions, and the personalities and events associated with the road through modernization and Westernization and to World War II. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, HEA, HSM U16 Hist 3168 The Creation of Modern Japan, 1568-1945 This course will explore the development of modern Japan from the Tokugawa Shogunate through the Meiji Restoration and culminate in Japan's role in World War II. Alongside the history of this period, we will explore cultural expressions of the time occurring in Japan in the areas of gender, ethnicity and class. The course readings will consist of Japanese fiction, drama and poetry in translation. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, HEA, HSM, HSP U16 Hist 3193 Roman History: The Dominate If we mark the beginning of Roman history by the foundation of the city on the Tiber and continue that narrative until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, we see a grand political experiment without parallel in world history. Persian historians would have been hard pressed to match these boasts. This course focuses on one segment of that history: the Later Roman Empire, beginning with the accession of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, to the outbreak of a calamitous war between rival superpowers Rome and Persia in the early seventh century of the Christian era. That conflict destroyed the classical world of the Eastern Mediterranean basin, and it paved the way for the rise of Islam in the region and beyond. Same as U02 Classics 3193 Credit 3 units. Later Medieval Ages: 1100-1500 This course is an introduction to history as a discipline, and in particular the study of medieval history. Students will demonstrate understanding of church reform; new forms of spirituality and the challenge of heresy; new forms of schools and learning; the origins of national monarchies; the crusades; chivalry; courtly love and the role of women; the rise of towns; church and state relations; the Black Death and its effects into the 15th century. Credit 3 units. UColl: HEU, HSP Women and Conquering Men: Gender Stereotypes and the Atlantic World We give a lot of thought to gender and power today-who makes more money, who occupies leadership roles, who gets interrupted. But challenges to the idea that physical anatomy and one's position in the world are permanently linked are much older. Rather, when Portuguese and Spanish sailors began exploring the Atlantic Ocean in the 1400s, they discovered different visions of what it meant to be male and female. This course looks at the results of this exchange, assessing how European encounters with new ideas of gender and sexuality in Africa and the early Americas, 1400 to 1800, created new opportunities and entrenched expectations for both colonizers and colonized. Credit U16 Hist 3304 Race in the Age of Exploration We talk a lot about racial identity in the 21st century, but discussions about differences perceived from skin tone, ethnic ancestry, and birthplace are nothing new to the modern world. This course explores an important segment of early conversations on race, focusing on the impact of European ventures to the Asian, African and American continents between the 12th and 18th centuries and their intermingling with the diverse peoples they encountered therein. Students particularly will explore the ways that struggles for control in this global age shifted historical concepts of difference from fluid cultural to entrenched biological, with lingering effects still felt today. Credit 3 units. UColl: HSP, HTR U16 Hist 3323 Jews and Christians in Nazi Germany This course examines how religion, culture, and ideology shaped the lives of Jews and Christians living in Germany during the Third Reich. We will examine the reactions of German Protestants and Catholics to the Nazi regime's oppression of Germany's Jewish population and attempt to annihilate European Jewry. We also focus on the experiences and reflections of German Jews living in these desperate times. Credit 3 units. UColl: HEU, HSM U16 Hist 3325 The 20th Century: The Age of Genocide This course will explore some of the darkest and most difficult to understand topics in recent human history: the Holocaust and other genocide events of the 20th century. From World War II to Rwanda, humans in the 20th century have demonstrated a terrifying capacity to inflict violence upon specific groups of people. The global occurrence of these events indicates that they are limited to no single region, religion, political system, or ideology. This course will explore the complex historical factors that produced genocides. Particular cases examined will vary from year to year, but will include, for example, Armenia, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, and the Nazi genocide of the Jews, Sinti, and Roma. Themes addressed may include gender and genocide, genocide prevention and intervention, justice and genocide, and memory and memorialization. We will also examine the stories of those who fought repressive regimes and spoke out against genocidal leaders, seeking to understand how confronting these issues in the past may help us to confront human cruelty in the present. Credit 3 units. UColl: CD, HEU, HSM, OLIU16 Hist 3473 The American Wars in Asia and the Pacific, 1898-1975 This course will examine the causes, conduct, and consequences of four wars that the United States has fought in Asia since 1898: the Philippine-American War; the Pacific theater in World War II; the Korean War; and the Vietnam War. We will focus on the political, diplomatic, and military aspects of these conflicts and explore how these wars shaped the history of Asia and the United States. The course provides an opportunity for students to conduct their own research and to hone their analytical and writing skills. Credit 3 units. UColl: HSM, HUS U16 Hist 3510 The History of the Civil Rights Movement: Jamestown to Ferguson This course examines the origins, evolution, and impact of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement beginning with the North American slave trade in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619, through civil disobedience and race riots in the mid-20th century, to the response, locally and nationwide, to Michael Brown's violent death in Ferguson.

But scholars are only beginning to address the scope and character of its impact on world history. This course treats the American Civil War as a global event. It places the war to preserve the Union and end slavery in the wider context of the long 19th century, one that encompasses various histories of slavery, antislavery, capitalism, nationalism, state-building, and empire as they collectively gave birth to the modern world. As Union and Confederate troops collided, parallel contests over democracy and the rights of labor gripped Europe. Credit 3 units. UColl: HSM, HSR, HTR U16 Hist 3610 Women and Gender in Renaissance Italy This course allows students to gain a solid knowledge of and appreciation for the experience of women who lived in early modern or \"Renaissance\" Italy. We will explore what is distinctive about the Renaissance era for women, underline the unique contributions that women made to early modern Italian society and culture, and discuss how their roles and participation in their world differed from those of the men with whom they interacted. Credit 3 units. UColl: HEU, HSM, Hist 3620 Research Seminar: Liberals and Conservatives in Recent American History This course explores the interplay of modern American liberalism and conservatism, the two ideologies/political worldviews that have defined U.S. politics since the 1930s. It is impossible fully to understand one without also studying the other. Modern liberalism became a political force during the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, while modern conservatism emerged as a viable movement during the early Cold War years and came of age during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Looking at political thought, grassroots activism, and electoral politics, the course will trace the evolution of both political perspectives, along with their frequent intersections, from the New Deal years up to the present. Students will engage primary sources and recent scholarship, and special time will be dedicated to putting the current political moment (including the 2020 election) in context. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACS, HSM, HSR, HUS U16 Hist 3633 Creating a National Memory, 1790-1840 In this course, we will analyze the differences between history as the best evidence suggests it occurred and the culturally constructed version of the past. We will explore the forgotten, sometimes bizzare \u2014 and, in retrospect, often humorous \u2014 \"bodily turn\" in American memory culture from 1790 through 1840, when patriotic Americans collected historical artifacts, including bodily relics, of their country's dying Revolutionary war heroes. Topics include African-American Revolutionary War veteran's memories; the popular science of memory in the early republic; influential theologies of memory; the pedagogy of memory; of politics to memory; and traveling \"freak shows.\" The instructor will email registered students with instructions.

How has the very meaning of \"forgiveness\" evolved in American history, and why? Historically, how have personal experiences of forgiveness and unforgiveness been part and parcel of mass movements toward or away from acts of forgiveness in, or of, the nation? Can understanding the history of forgiveness in American culture usefully inform present efforts at forgiveness and reconciliation in American culture? Credit 3 units. UColl: HSM, HUS, OLI U16 Hist 3638 Debating U.S. History: Museums, Monuments and Public Memory We are constantly surrounded by history: in our museums, public spaces, books, televisions, politics, and on the web. The past colors the decisions we make in the present, but we rarely think about the processes by which it is researched, organized, and presented to us. This course introduces students to some of the key theories and practices of public history, while asking them to think critically about the ways historical persons, places, and events are represented in their communities. It assesses the opportunities and limitations of different types of historical places; the roles of audience, technology, and business strategy in presenting the past; and the influence of modern interests in antiquing, film, genealogy, heritage tourism, and architecturalpreservation/gentrification in our local and national historical conversations. Working through practical exercises that push students to think like public historians, students assess some of the most influential ways that the history-around-them shapes us and how it might still be improved.

After a brief overview of 19th-century western concepts of liberalism and progress, we will consider the disruption and violence of two world wars in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Africa. In addition, we will consider the course and consequences of civil war and revolution, famine and disease, rising and falling empires, worldwide economic instability, new nation states and population resettlements, and emerging rival political ideologies. Among other things, we will challenge the suitability of the label \"interwar period\" for the years from 1918 to units. UColl: HSM, HTR U16 3641 A Social History of World War I: Reconsidering the Great War in Global Context World War I changed the course of world history. It brought about the disintegration of four vast empires and seriously undermined the stability of two others. At the same time, World War I confirmed the arrival of the United States onto the world stage and re-drew the political and territorial frontiers of central and southeast Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Pacific.

This course offers such perspective by exploring the political worldviews that have defined U.S. politics since the 1930s, along with the presidential administrations that have shaped their development. Modern liberalism became a force during the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Modern conservatism came of age with the election of Ronald Reagan. By tracing the evolution of liberalism and conservatism, this course offers a chance to compare the Obama presidency with past administrations and to put the unfolding presidential campaign in context.

During the semester, Whitman will serve as our case study, and students will be asked to read his poetry and prose. However, our ultimate aim is more wide-reaching. This course approaches a broad question -- What is American identity now? -- from a specific point of reference: the afterlives of figures from the past who are increasingly important to our modern national identity. During the semester, each student will undertake their own research project centered on a figure from the past whose presence in American life looms large today, such as Audre Lorde, Che Guevara, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James Baldwin, or Alexander Hamilton, among others. Same as U89 AMCS 442 Credit Hist 4921 Decoding the City Does the space between a house and the sidewalk tell you something about class? Does a vacant lot on a dead-end street record the forced relocation of thousands of black residents? Can street names narrate the relationship between the growth of the city and national narratives of immigrant assimilation, continental expansion and world wars? The answer to these questions is yes, but it is far from obvious. The built environment of an American city like St. Louis can seem opaque and silent, when actually it is laden with social, economic, political, gender and racial meanings. This course unpacks St. Louis' built environment by drawing broad historic and theoretical readings on urban space to specific local sites. Readings will assist students in the interrogation of actual places in St. Louis through field visits, so that the streets become unquiet and the embedded meanings in plain sight. This is a hybrid course, with an online discussion component and weekly field work sessions. Attendance at these field work sessions is mandatory.

Comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics of other countries. Comparative political study is important because domestic politics shapes what goes on within a given country and shapes how that country's citizens and leaders interact with other countries. Comparative study is challenging because it requires both factual and theoretical knowledge about the world's political systems and how and why they function. Without a strong background in the factual information and the theoretical frameworks around which we can begin to explain and predict political decisions, we cannot understand the world. This lack of understanding impedes effective decision making at the local, regional, national and international scales. In this course, we will study the dominant structures within which politics occurs and examine how those structures shape political choices. Same as U25 PolSci 102 Credit 3 units.

Because in America we follow a Western trajectory of thought, many of the courses herein are Western. However, the goal of our work together is to compare and contrast how different cultures have theorized and created works with/about/concerning: birth, death, religion, self-image, the cosmos, ethics, love, etc., in various forms including but not limited to: drama, poetry, epics, folklore, and various mythoi, in such a way that we must consider printing, translation, court behavior, local (and aesthetic) boundaries, visual documents, etc.; in short, we will frame our look at various cultures' oral and written works so as to form an idea of how and why literature has worked and is capable of working. Our work together will result in all of us becoming better readers, more alert to variations on themes, vital differences, intuitive comparisons, the limits of logic (and of poorly deployed rhetoric), and the vitally important specifics of works that make them all but impenetrable.

We will discuss the historical roles of mothers vs. fathers, shared family time and resources, family-run workshops, and how couples planned, named and educated their offspring. We will examine how the family can be experienced in a variety of ways, including the form of the papal famiglia and all-male households headed by cardinals. Finally, we will see how divorce legislation (1970) destroyed the notion of eternal family solidarity. The family is still being shaped as Italians recently legalized same-sex civil unions (2016), forcing them to define what a family is and what rights its members should enjoy. We will consider Pope Francis' role in discussions of Italian and global family life in a nation that hosts thousands of migrant families, too. Same as U16 Hist 217 Credit 3 units.

UColl: PSI U43 IS 306 The Modern Mediterranean: Facts and Fictions The countries and cultures around the entire Mediterranean basin have provided, and have been the scene of, much of the world's recorded history. In the 20th century, however, writers set out to explore, either by actual travel or else in their imagination alone, many of its lesser known corners: forgotten imperial ruins in Tunisia; remote and semi-primitive mountain villages of Crete; dusty and disease ridden towns in the Sahara; the secretive souks of Alexandria. In doing so, they often found many fascinating, if previously hidden places, peoples, behaviors and customs, or sometimes instead, simple symbolic fodder for an oftentimes implied critique of their own native lands and social mores. In this course, we shall consider examples of the former in works like Andre Gide's Immoralist , Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Sheltering Sky and Lawrence Durrell's Justine. As for the latter, our attention will turn to even more contemporary works, such as Derek Walcott's Omeros, which is partially based on the Homeric tale of Ulysses' wanderings around the Mediterranean, but which aims primarily at questioning the history of colonialism and cultural memory of his own Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. While students will pay attention to the stylistic features of these works, to understand better the role rhetoric plays in such fiction, they will also study closely the various important sociopolitical, economic, religious and philosophical concerns raised by their authors. Some excerpts of film adaptations will also be used. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 3061 Advanced Modern Irish VI Same as U47 IRISH 306 Credit 3 units. U43 IS 307 Latin American Migrations Latin America has been, historically, a region defined by its migrations. Throughout its history, Latin America has received waves of immigrants from around the world and has been the site both of internal migrations (country to city and country to country) and a considerable diaspora that has created new communities in the United States and Europe. Through the reading of scholarship, fiction, film, art, and memoirs, this class seeks to study the cultural impact that different waves of migration have had both on the establishment of political and imaginary borders and in the constitution of new national, regional and transnational identities. The class will approach case studies that encompass the effect of internal migrations in the region (such as the racial politics of Andean immigration to Argentina), the social redefinitions of Latin American countries due to new waves of immigrants (such as the increasing Asian immigration to Panama), the articulation of a Latin America in exile and the construction of new \"Latino\" identities in the UnitedStates and Europe. Through these case studies, students will not only get snapshots of different \"Latin American Crossings.\" The class will also tackle the question of new, fluid notions of Latin American culture and identity, as well as changing notions of race, ethnicity, class and gender, as they are being redefined in the contemporary world. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 309 U.S.-Latin American Relations: Culture and Politics This class is an exploration of the relations between the United States and Latin America in the contemporary world. The class will begin with a brief discussion of the history of relations between North and South America. Secondly, we will discuss some central issues of current multilateral continental relations: immigration, the drug trade, economic development, the \"new left\", etc. Finally, the last part of the semester will be dedicated to the cultural exchanges between both regions.

U43 IS 310 Modern and Contemporary Irish Drama This course surveys Irish drama from the early-20th-century founding of the Abbey Theatre under William Butler Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory to selected contemporary playwrights. Yeats' claim that a new Irish drama would show that \"Ireland is not the home of buffoonery and easy sentiment...but the home of an ancient idealism\" was quickly put to the test when Synge's classic \"Playboy of the Western World\" occasioned riots during its 1907 performances. Issues have persisted: Celtic myth vs. Dublin reality; celebration of warriors vs. the aesthetics of loss and defeat; saintly Irish mothers vs. pirate queens and Medeas; and Anglo-Irish playwrights as embodiments of the transition to the postcolonial. Playwrights studied will include Augusta Gregory, G.B. Shaw, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brian Friel, Anne Devlin, Christina Reid, Martin McDonagh, Conor McPherson, and Marina Carr.

This course proposes a reading of the main topics of Latin American culture (colonialism, nationalism, race, cultural mixture, globalization, migration and others) through the lens of food history and social practices. With a particular focus on Mexico, and additional case studies from Peru, Brazil and other countries, students will explore topics such as the idea of intangible patrimonies, cultural heritage, the rise of the celebrity chef and the conflict between tradition and innovation. Students will engage with the subject through the reading of food history, recipe books, historical documents and academic scholarship, along with documentaries, fiction films and television shows capturing culinary culture, as well as discussions on the presence of Latin American food in St. Louis.

UColl: CD U43 IS 314 Reading Culture: Exploring Dystopias In this course we will explore why the conditions in Russia during the 19th and 20th centuries paved the way for the first dystopian novel and why, perhaps, the U.S. was only a close second in this regard. We begin with such authors as Fyodor Dostoevsky and Yevgeny Zamyatin, and then move on to examine the ways in which later authors, such as Ray Bradbury and George Orwell, interpreted the pressing current events of their times \u2014 the Cold War, the rise of technology and bio-technology, and the ecological crisis \u2014 through the dystopian lens, with an emphasis on the role that Russia and Russian literature played in the development of this particular mindset. We will extend our exploration to include recent dystopian ideas prevalent in China and Latin America, as well as to address the popularity of such multimillion dollar media franchises as The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner . We conclude with a discussion of current dystopian discourse in such areas as politics, technology, and trauma narratives. The course is discussion based. All readings are in English. Credit 3 units.

We will begin with an overview of Chinese migration, exploring historical patterns of Chinese migration, the latest waves of Chinese immigrants, and their migration, settlement and integration among various others in worldwide communities over different historical periods. The readings and discussions in this course will cover a range of topics and issues in diaspora and ethnic studies, particularly in overseas Chinese studies, from cultural assimilation and integration, identity and ethnicity, to gender, intergenerational relationships of immigrant families, ethnic enclaves, citizenship, transnationalism, Chinatown, and China and the overseas Chinese. The major goals in our survey of overseas Chinese are (1) to question and reconsider the concept of \"Chineseness\" and Chinese identity, paying special attention to how personal and community identity is constructed and reconstructed by negotiations, conflicts and transformations among diasporic Chinese, and (2) to comprehend the dynamics, diversity and heterogeneity among various Chinese communities in a transregional and transnational perspective, while deconstructing the category of \"Chinese\" as one complete cultural unity. The course is designed 139Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) to help the students develop a theoretical basis in migration/ diaspora and ethnic studies based on the studies of overseas Chinese.

U43 IS 3170 Seamus Heaney By the time Seamus Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995, he had already built a reputation as one of the foremost poets of his generation, a leading figure in 20th- and early 21st-century verse, widely seen as the true successor to W.B. Yeats as the national bard of Ireland. This course examines the arc of his literary career, working our way chronologically through the poetry, exploring texts in conjunction with their contexts, seeking a deeper understanding of form and meaning through close reading and scholarly engagement with a full range of his writing.

In this course we will approach 19th-century Russian literature as a lens through which we can explore current events and cultural trends both in Russia and in our own lives, here in the U.S. We will read short stories and novellas by all the major 19th-century Russian authors \u2014 Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and more \u2014 and will study the issues that concerned them most. Topics will include: gender and identity, social inequality, and the meaning of life and death. We will consider the writers and their works within the context of their times, while simultaneously exploring the most pressing issues that face us today. All readings will be in English. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 319 Digitizing Development International development is increasingly being seen through the eyes of technology. Paradigms of ICT4D (information and communication technology for development) have become more and more pervasive. Many policy officials say that data is the fuel of the future, which can \"leapfrog development.\" They are turning to digital tools like big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, body sensors, facial recognition, and social media platforms for their programs. These resources are promised as solutions for poverty alleviation, education delivery, unemployment reduction, and humanitarian crisis response. This course will critically assess such frameworks by asking what they have achieved, what they have not, and what ethical questions must be considered. Should we use \"dumpster diving robots\" to sort recycling waste? Can machine learning help with the translation of the internet into local languages? Should asylum seekers in refugee camps be subject to biometric scanning in order to receive aid? What role do technology giants like Facebook have in the ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Rohingya in Myanmar? Are encrypted communication technologies enabling citizens in authoritarian contexts to organize for their human rights? We will consider implications for ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality, and we will focus on many regions of the global south. Through readings, films, and guest speakers, we will hear directly from scholars, officials, and nongovernmental organizations.Credit 3 units. UColl: ML U43 IS 320 Islam and the West This course will study the historical and contemporary international interactions between Islam and the West from medieval times to the modern world. The course will shed a light on the birth, rise and the decline of Islam, and its impact on foreign relations with the West. The main focus of the course, however, will be Islam and the West interactions in the Modern era. For centuries, Islam and the West have been neighbors and cultural contestants with a history of conflict and coexistence, but terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, have aggravated discussions regarding the \"clash of civilizations.\" Globalization, on the other hand, has created an interdependency that requires greater cooperation, understanding, and dialogue.

UColl: CD U43 IS 3252 Benefits and Challenges of Globalization This class focuses on the benefits and challenges of globalization to the most influential issues of world politics such as human rights, terrorism and weapons proliferation, climate change, global trade, migration, global crime, and pandemics. Some view globalization as a means for promoting democracy, improving social conditions, and protecting the environment. In contrast, its critics focus on how cultural globalization imposes Western values on others and destroys their traditions, religious beliefs, and identities, and how it enables terrorists to move easily from one country to another. The class will explore these issues and evaluate their weight and validity. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 326 The Doctor Is In: Anton Chekhov and Narrative Medicine This course bridges the world of literature and the world of medicine by focusing on both Anton Chekhov, a practicing doctor and one of the greatest Russian writers of the 19th century, and the newly emerging field of Narrative Medicine. In this course we will explore how Chekhov was able to integrate and express cultural attitudes towards illness, suffering, and healing in his writing and medical practice, as we simultaneously explore how doctors and other health care practitioners apply such topics in their professional work today. We will supplement Chekhov readings with foundational Narrative Medicine texts and the works of such contemporary doctor-writers as Atul Gawande, Sayantani DasGupta, and Paul Kalanithi. Class will include self-reflective writing workshops with Sarah Stanage, MD. The course is discussion-based and appropriate for students of literature, culture, and medicine at all levels.

They encounter the specter of acquisition and use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and their respective means of delivery not only by sovereign states but also by terrorists and other non-state actors. They examine and assess the viability ofstates' current individual and collective anti-WMD policies and strategies. In that light they seek comprehensive answers to the following questions: Is nuclear deterrence obsolete? How much nuclear-weapons modernization is enough? Will the nuclear nonproliferation regime survive? If so, under what conditions? Is the Iran Nuclear Deal viable? How can North Korea's WMD threat be diminished? Is nuclear security attainable? How can chemical and biological weapons threats be successfully addressed? Why are counterproliferation strategies necessary complements to nonproliferation strategies? Why is ballistic- missile defense a prime counterproliferation strategy? What cyberchallenges must be addressed in the anti-WMD/WMD nonproliferation realm? In light of the responses to the foregoing questions, what is the future for global WMD control/elimination? Credit 3 units.

UColl: CDU43 IS 3840 Modern European Art in Context, c. 1850-1950 When displayed against pristine white gallery walls, modern art may seem detached from everyday reality. However, modern artists responded strongly to the drastic technological, social, economic, political and cultural changes that transformed Europe from 1850-1950. The period between the revolutions of c. 1848 and the end of World War II, therefore, witnessed the rapid development of new artistic styles and movements. This course considers movements ranging from Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism to the Bauhaus.

U43 IS 3842 Latin American Art & Architecture, 1910-2010 This course surveys major movements in art and architecture in Latin America, from the early 20th-century avant-gardes to the most recent developments in contemporary art. With the understanding that the term \"Latin America\" is a geopolitical construct that has been applied to a region of tremendous ethnic, historical, economic, and linguistic diversity, this class will focus on a selection of significant artistic movements and historical figures in and of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, as well as major architectural projects in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. Artistic and architectural discourses have often played an important role in processes of modern state formation in the region, and we will be especially attentive to cases in which artists and architects worked (at least initially) in the service of governmental regimes \u2014 as in Mexican muralism in the 1920s and the construction of Bras\u00edlia, a new national capital for Brazil, in the 1950s \u2014 as well as those cases in which artworks and artistic networks offered a means of challenging or subverting official repression in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Mexico. Beyond politics, we will focus on the tensions \u2014 indigenous vs. cosmopolitan, urban vs. rural, rich vs. poor \u2014 and transnational dialogues that have informed the production and reception of art and architecture in Latin America.

U43 IS 4201 International Relations of Latin America This course examines Latin American foreign relations in the world from the 1820s to the present with a primary emphasis on the period since 1945. Focusing on inter-state and transnational relations, it seeks to historically contextualize and analyze long term patterns and trends between Latin American states and between Latin America and the United States, Europe, and the global South. Given Latin America's shared experience with imperialism and more recently with neo-imperialism, special attention will be paid to the ways Latin America has sought to manage and/or resist foreign domination, especially U.S. hegemonic pretensions. To this end it will analyze patterns of inter-American conflict and cooperation. When, why, and under what conditions Latin America articulated an independent foreign policy, forged anti-imperialist blocs, embraced U.S. sponsored diplomatic efforts and military alliances, and pursued Latin American unity and solidarity will be closely examined. To better understand the continuities, discontinuities, contradictions, and complexities of Latin American foreign policy, this course will also assess the influence of changing regional and national political cultures from both a theoretical and a historical perspective. In doing so, it explores how elite culture, the balance of domestic social forces, ideological and economic development, and shared cultural identities and meanings informed national political cultures and how these in turn shaped Latin American foreign policies. Same as L97 IAS 4201 Credit IS 427 Economic Systems in Theory and Practice Theory and practice of mercantilism, capitalism, and socialism.

We will discuss how these kinds of cross-border practices are regulated through local, national, and international bodies. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 458 Gender and Globalization This course is an examination of how gender is integral to contemporary political economies. We'll look at how the meaning of family is changing, with a retreat from marriage in some places (why can a person get a temporary divorce in Iran?) and an expansion of marriage in other places (the granting of marriage to lesbians and gays in South Africa; the ability of American men to buy a bride from the Philippines on the internet). We'll look at health and economy: How are women central to food production worldwide, yet the most typical victims of food scarcity? Alternatively, we'll see advances in women's leadership worldwide, and ask why Rwanda tops the list of countries with the greatest share of women in parliamentary bodies. We'll see women at the forefront of social change. How were several hundred women activists able to thwart Exxon Corporation in Nigeria? Why did Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Matthai see planting trees as an act of feminist, environmental and political activism? Credit 3 units.

A&S S U43 IS 4662 Central American Geographies of Violence This course provides an in-depth examination of the geographies of violence in Central America. As a region frequently characterized as endemically prone to violence, it is vital to analyze and contextualize the violence. Approaching violence in Central America from a geographic perspective involves not only locating and \"placing\" the violence but also thinking relationally about the multiple overlapping scales of activity, both within and beyond the region. The course is divided into three parts. In the first section of the course, we begin with an overview of the foundations for understanding violence in Central America. In addition to covering the physical and human geography of the region, we also delve into various ways of defining violence, with a particular emphasis on how geographers conceptualize violence. In the second section, we delve into various theoretical approaches for understanding the nature of multiple types of violence and draw from historical and contemporary events in Central America. In the third section of the course, we take a closer look at specific case studies in the region, covering topics such as genocide, alcoholism, immigration, gangs, and drug trafficking.

Political Science The Department of Political Science offers students the opportunity to study all aspects of politics using cutting-edge technical and theoretical tools. Our courses are animated by long-standing problems related to the use of power, its rightful exercise by governments and individual actors, and the institutions that affect how that power is exercised. Reflecting the breadth of the discipline, we offer a range of classes, including courses on elections and electoral politics, international political economy, justice and the state, and comparative analyses of political institutions across states. A major in political science thus exposes students to the primary themes of the discipline: American politics, comparative politics, international politics, political methodology and political theory. A political science major offers students the opportunity to study political life as part of a broad liberal education, and it is a useful step toward law or business school. Other political science students pursue careers or further education in public administration, urban planning, journalism, education and social work or in federal, state or local government.

U25 PolSci 101 American Politics This course provides an overview of the politics of American government. The topics covered are the historical developments of American politics, federalism, political participation (e.g., voting), institutions (e.g., Congress), and public opinion. That political actors are strategic in their pursuit of objectives is a theme underlying our examination of these topics. Accordingly, we explore the many ways in which strategic political behavior impacts institutions and the interactions between political actors in the U.S. Credit 3 units. U25 PolSci 102 Comparative Politics This course introduces the student to the fundamentals of cross- national research, study, and understanding. Comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics of other countries. Comparative political study is important because domestic politics shapes what goes on within a given country and shapes how that country's citizens and leaders interact with other 148Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) countries. Comparative study is challenging because it requires both factual and theoretical knowledge about the world's political systems and how and why they function. Without a strong background in the factual information and the theoretical frameworks around which we can begin to explain and predict political decisions, we cannot understand the world. This lack of understanding impedes effective decision making at the local, regional, national and international scales. In this course, we will study the dominant structures within which politics occurs and examine how those structures shape political choices. Credit 3 units.

Same as L32 U25 PolSci 4080 Voting Rights and Election Law This course will study legal concepts of voting rights and election law that impact the ability of citizens participate in the democratic process. What is the nature of the right to vote? Who gets to participate and on what terms? This question has been an ongoing source of debate and controversy since the founding of our nation, and remains so today, as the vote is symbolic of voice, presence and power in a democracy. As debates of race, class, citizenship, power and the role of government play out in how we exercise our political voice, this course will look at the timely and dynamic debates on voting and the underlying legal, historic, policy and political movements surrounding them. Many find it hard to believe that there is no explicit \"right to vote\" in the U.S. Constitution - part of a compromise inextricably tied to the history of race in America. Yet there are more constitutional amendments governing the right to vote than any other, prohibiting the abridgment of voting based on race, gender, property ownership, age and other qualifications. Legislative enactments have also established rights with respect to voting. Each extension of voting rights has been a product of and brought about, social and political change. Today there are more laws conditioning access to the ballot than at any other time since the post-reconstruction era, and many states will be facing new rules heading into upcoming mid-term elections and in anticipation of redistricting following the 2020 census. This course will examine the interplay of law and politics, history and political movements in the right to vote. The course will begin with a historical look at the development of voting rights from the founding of our country to the present. What factors have caused us to redefine who gets to participate in the electoral process and how? We will then apply these principles to current controversies in voting rights, through examination of current litigation and policy debates, and by assessing proposed solutions for voting rights going forward. The course involves study of fundamental court cases, interactive discussion of contemporary debates, and review of current litigation and legislative proposals. The course will be supplemented by occasional media and guest visits by election officials, lawyers, lawmakers, advocates or others. Credit 3 units.

UColl: OLI U19 SUST 3068 An Inconvenient Truth: The Human History of Climate Change Although global warming is unprecedented in its origin and potential consequences for human beings, climate change itself is actually nothing new. For thousands of years, entirely natural influences have altered Earth's climate in ways that shaped human history. Eighteenth-century advisors to the king of France were warning that deforestation would have an adverse effect on rainfall. The Little Ice Age that began in the 16th century altered settlement patterns, forced new trade networks, and encouraged innovations in agriculture. In this course, we will examine the longer history of climate change and how it has been addressed as a scientific, political, and environmental issue. We will look at such climate phenomena as the discoveryof the Green House Effect, El Ni\u00f1o events in the late-19th century, and glacial melting in the 20th century. This course will also introduce students to the field of environmental history and explore how the methods of this field of inquiry challenge traditional historical categories. We will consider the following questions: What happens when time is no longer bounded by the written word and is understood in geological terms? How does history play out when the actors driving the action of the story are non-human?How might historians geographically frame their narratives when the subject matter is rarely bounded by the political borders of human communities? Same as HTR U19 SUST 315 Introduction to Historic Preservation This course explores the history and practice of historic preservation with an emphasis on regional urban issues and the way in which historic preservation contributes toward the development of sustainable communities.

Each student will take five 3-credit, advanced-level (300 or higher) courses, including three courses devoted to mastering the craft of writing in the chosen specialty genre, one course primarily in the reading and analysis of the literature in that genre, and one course in a second genre. The student's final course in the program will be taken for 4 credits rather than the usual 3, and it will include a 1-credit meta- commentary assignment. This assignment requires students to step back from the particular course and describe (in 1500 words) what they have learned about the differences between and similarities among the genres investigated and how these have affected their choice of genre. Students should look at the strategies they have chosen in their writing and explain why they chose them for a particular purpose. The goals of this assignment are for students to demonstrate the skills that they have learned during the course of their certificate studies as they think about the genres they have examined and to show how these skills govern their approach to creative writing. Students with little previous experience in creative writing are encouraged to begin with a 200-level writing course or workshop as a foundation for the more advanced courses that will count toward the certificate.

Students may choose from the options below, and, as they browse the semester's course listings (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/ucollege/ ), they can also search under \"8-Week\" courses and \"Weekend Only.\" 179Bulletin 2020-21 University College - Undergraduate (01/15/21) Accelerated Program The Accelerated Master's Degree Program (https:// ucollege.wustl.edu/programs/accelerated/masters-degree/ ) allows Arts & Sciences day students to count their graduate-level course work (completed as an undergraduate) toward a master's degree. With careful planning, some of this course work can be incorporated into a student's undergraduate course of study, be covered by their regular undergraduate tuition, and lead to an AB earned in normal time with an accompanying master's in an additional one or two extra semesters of study. Only current Arts & Sciences undergraduates who are earning an AB are eligible for this Accelerated Master's Degree program. The accelerated master's program option applies to the following master's degree programs: Culture Studies (https://ucollege.wustl.edu/ ACTRAC Students wanting to advance more quickly toward their degree can do so with the Accelerated Track program (ACTRAC) (https://ucollege.wustl.edu/programs/accelerated/actrac/ ). Eligible University College students can enroll in courses that carry the ACTRAC option (noted in the course listings (https:// acadinfo.wustl.edu/ucollege/ )). By completing additional course work prescribed by the instructor, students earn 4 credits for each ACTRAC course rather than the usual 3 credits. By taking ACTRAC courses, students can reduce the total number of courses they must take before they graduate. Eligible students must meet the following qualifications:Be admitted to a University College undergraduate degree program Have successfully completed at least 12 credits Have completed a college-level English composition course with a grade of B or better Have a 3.0 minimum grade-point average Have written approval from a University College adviser Once approved, students register and pay for 4 credits for each ACTRAC course. The ACTRAC option must be chosen at the beginning of the semester, and it is not available to Washington University day students. The \"extra credit\" work is determined by the instructor and will normally include extra reading, writing and research. Combined Bachelor's & Master's Degree The Combined Bachelor's & Master's Degree Program (https:// ucollege.wustl.edu/programs/accelerated/combined-bachelors- masters/) in University College is designed for students who wish to pursue rigorous and accelerated study that will lead to both a Bachelor of Science and either a Master of Arts or Master of Science in areas of study for which there are degree programs in University College.

If any changes are made to degree, major or other program requirements prior to June 29, 2020, and noted on the University College website, students who have been admitted to a program of study prior to these changes being made may retain the requirements associated with the original program as printed in the Bulletin or, with University College authorization, may make appropriate changes to their original program of study in order to adapt to newer requirements. Students admitted to a program of study after program changes are made are required to meet the new requirements and not the original requirements as posted in the Bulletin. If a student has been away from University College for 10 or more years and the original degree or major is no longer offered, the student must select a new, currently offered major and program of study. If a student has been away from University College for 10 or more years and the original degree or major is currently offered but has changed, University College will first review the requirements associated with the original program and, in consultation with the student and relevant academic departments, select degree and major requirements, including appropriate course substitutions from either the original or current program. Courses and Credits The number of units assigned to each course is noted in the semester Course Schedule. Courses numbered 100(0)-399(9) carry credit toward an undergraduate degree. Courses numbered 400(0)-499(9) normally carry undergraduate or graduate credit. Graduate-level courses numbered 500(0) and above are open only to students admitted to a graduate program or by permission of the instructor and the program director. Grades University College's grading system is based on a rated 4.0 scale. The scale and grade points per unit of academic credit for each letter grade are as follows: Grade Points per Unit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3C 2.0 C- 1.7 D+ 1.3 D 1.0 D- 0.7 F 0.0 CR Credit awarded, but work was not subjected to more precise evaluation NCR No credit/student's work was not satisfactory N No grade received by the Registrar's Office by the grading deadline I Incomplete/semester's work not finished, including failure to complete final exam W Withdrawal/student withdrew from course prior to completion R Repeat/course has been retaken S Satisfactory, used almost exclusively for semester hours earned for research L Audit/student satisfactorily audited the course throughout the semester Z Audit/student did not satisfactorily audit the course These grading policies apply to all University College courses. Only courses taken for a letter grade may be applied toward a graduate program of study. Courses taken as Pass/Fail or Audit will not count toward a graduate program of study. Grades below C- will not count toward a graduate program of study. Students are responsible for knowing the specific grading criteria and course requirements set by individual instructors. Grades are posted online at the end of the semester. No grades are given by telephone or orally in the office. Students usually may choose among four grading options at the time of registration: a letter grade, Credit/No Credit (also referred to as Pass/Fail), Audit, or Special Audit. Changes from one option to another must be made by the dates indicated in the calendar printed each semester in the University College Course Schedule and our online academic calendar (http:// ucollege.wustl.edu/events/academic-calendar/). Students must select a grade option at the time of registration, and any changes must be made according to the dates published in the semester Course Schedule. Grade option changes are not permitted after a semester is over. The Credit/No Credit option, which is available for certain courses, allows students to enroll in courses on a pass/fail basis. Under this option, students receive credit for courses satisfactorily completed, but a grade is not assigned or calculated in the student's cumulative grade-point average. The standards for receiving credit are at the discretion of each individual instructor. Undergraduate degree candidates may take no more than 10% of credits at Washington University under this option. Courses intended to satisfy the basic and 187Bulletin 2020-21 Academic Policies (01/15/21) advanced writing requirements for the Associate in Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, courses in the major and minor, and courses specific to a graduate degree or any certificate are excluded from the Credit/No Credit option. Graduate schools and current employers may require specific letter grades rather than Credit/No Credit only. A specific grade may also be required as a prerequisite for more advanced course work in that subject area. A few courses particularly designated by departments may require enrollment on a Credit/No Credit basis, in which case the course would not be included in the 10% limit. The Audit grade may be chosen if a student wishes to have the registration and grade for a course recorded on an official transcript but does not seek academic credit for the course. Students must meet the requirements established by the instructor to successfully audit a course. As an auditor, normally the student is required to attend and participate in the course but not required to complete all written assignments and examinations. The Special Audit is offered only for a select number of University College courses. Courses taken as Special Audit will not appear on a Washington University transcript, and a grade report is not issued. Courses taken on a Special Audit basis do not carry academic credit and do not apply to degree requirements in a University College program of study. Special auditors attend lectures and discussions but are not required to complete written work. A grade of I (Incomplete) indicates that the instructor has agreed to withhold a final grade pending the completion of a small portion of required work normally due at the end of a semester. Students experiencing a medical or personal problem that makes the timely completion of course work difficult or unlikely may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor prior to the end of the semester. If the instructor consents, an Incomplete Agreement form must be completed. Sixty days after the end of a semester, a grade of Incomplete without an Incomplete Agreement form will be converted to an F. For undergraduate students, if the work is not completed within a period of one calendar year, the grade of I will be changed to F. For graduate students, if the work is not completed within a period of one calendar year, the grade of I will remain a permanent grade. Future enrollment may be withheld for University College students who have accumulated more than 9 units of incomplete work within the previous two years. A grade of N indicates that no grade has been received by the Registrar's Office by the grading deadline. Sixty days after the end of a semester, a grade of N will be converted to an F. Continuing master's research is the only exception to the above policy, in which case the permanent grade is N.Transfer Credit University College will accept undergraduate transfer credits from other accredited institutions for courses that are comparable to those offered at Washington University. Transfer credit may satisfy the distribution requirements of University College and may fulfill a portion of major requirements. A maximum of 84 units may be transferred for the Bachelor of Science degree; a maximum of 66 units will be accepted from a junior or community college. A maximum of 24 units may be transferred for the Associate in Arts degree. No more than 6 units may be transferred into a graduate degree program in University College. Transfer credit will not be given for internships and independent studies or for grades below C- received at other institutions. The combined total number of units accepted in transfer credit for College-Level Examination Program, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate may not exceed 30. Transfer credit for study abroad must be preapproved by University College and the Office for International Students and Scholars. Students who receive a grade of C- or lower in EComp 111 Analytical Writing taken at University College must repeat the course. Students who receive a grade of C- or lower in EComp 203 Critical and Researched Writing taken at University College must, in consultation with the Department of English and University College, choose between two options to satisfy the requirement: (1) repeat the course; or (2) complete a 3- unit composition tutorial with a grade of C or higher. Students who have completed English composition courses at another college or university should be well prepared for the required writing courses at University College, and transfer credit will be awarded for this work according to our regular transfer credit policies. However, new students will begin with EComp 111 in University College. Students who feel they have a strong writing background may petition to take a placement test to demonstrate the skills needed to begin with EComp 203 instead. All students will complete EComp 203 and a 300- level writing course at University College. If a student has any questions about the writing evaluation process or requirements, they should contact their adviser (https://ucollege.wustl.edu/ resources/advising/ ). To receive transfer credit, a student must be admitted to a University College degree or certificate program and submit official transcripts from all institutions previously attended. All records must be in English. International records must be evaluated for transfer credit by an accredited transcript evaluation agency. Advisers will evaluate transcripts to determine transfer credit and remaining course requirements toward a University College degree or certificate. Advanced Courses Students must complete a minimum of 30 units of advanced (300- and 400-level) courses at Washington University in order to receive the Bachelor of Science degree. 188Bulletin 2020-21 Academic Policies (01/15/21) Overlap Policy If a student has two majors, each major's upper-level units of credit must be independent of the other. Prerequisite courses at the 100 and 200 levels may count for both majors. Should the same upper-level course satisfy a requirement in more than one of a student's major programs, a departmentally sanctioned upper-level elective must be chosen to replace the course in one of the programs. If a student has a major and a minor, overlap is allowed provided there are at least 9 unique units in the minor. Major or minor course work may be applied to distribution requirements for general education. If a student is pursuing a bachelor's degree and a certificate, overlap is allowed between the major and the certificate provided there are at least 9 unique units in the certificate. (The exception to this restriction on certificates applies to sequential programs of the same name, in which case all certificate courses may apply to the next-level program.) A single course can count toward any two of the following categories without restriction: (1) major requirements; (2) basic requirements for numerical applications or non-Western culture; or (3) distribution requirements. Residency Requirement The final 36 units of course work toward the Associate in Arts degree or the Bachelor of Science degree must be completed at Washington University. At least half of the credits for the concentration (Associate in Arts) or major (Bachelor of Science) must be completed at Washington University. Students with a gap in their studies at University College of more than 10 years are required to meet the 36-unit residency requirement upon their return. Fully online and blended online courses taught at Washington University will count toward the residency requirement of University College. Repeating a Course Students may repeat a course in which a grade of D or F was received (including 100- and 200-level courses, with University College authorization), in which case only the most recent grade will be included when calculating the student's GPA. Departmental permission is required. All enrollments will appear on the student's transcript, but the symbol \"R\" will replace the earlier grade for a repeated course if the grade in the second enrollment is equal to or higher than the grade in the first enrollment. A course may be repeated only once for credit. Satisfactory Academic Progress, Academic Probation and Suspension To remain in good academic standing, an undergraduate student must maintain a 2.0 GPA, a graduate student must maintain a 3.0 GPA, a graduate certificate student must maintain a 3.0 GPA, and a post-baccalaureate pre-medical certificate student must maintain a 3.2 GPA. In addition, when considering good academic standing, University College may take into account theextent to which a student's educational and professional goals are consistent with the aims of the program to which the student is admitted. A student whose previous semester's work is unsatisfactory, whose cumulative record is unsatisfactory, or who has a history of failure to complete course work without adequate reason may be placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation are not in good academic standing. Probationary status serves to warn a student who is not making satisfactory progress. Unless the quality of work improves during the next semester, a student may be suspended or dismissed from the program, and future enrollment may not be allowed. University College reserves the right to cancel the registration of students who have been placed on academic suspension or dismissed. Subsequent readmission will be determined on an individual basis. Intent to Graduate and Commencement All degree and certificate candidates must complete the Intent to Graduate form before their last semester. Candidates may file online or on paper. Forms and instructions with deadline dates are available on the University College Website (https:// ucollege.wustl.edu/resources/forms/ ) or in the University College office. Students are responsible for meeting the deadline for filing the Intent to Graduate. All graduates are invited to Commencement and recognition ceremonies in May, when degrees are conferred and certificates presented. Independent Study, Directed Research and Internships Through independent study or directed research, students may pursue topics of special interest under the supervision of a member of the faculty. Internships offer opportunities to apply classroom theory and concepts to practical work situations and to explore possible career directions. Students must submit a completed Independent Study form or Internship Learning Agreement to the University College office before registering. A maximum of 6 units of credit in independent work, including internships and study abroad, may count toward the Associate in Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees for students who complete 60 units or less at Washington University; students who earn more than 60 units at Washington University may do up to 9 units of independent work. No more than 6 units of independent study, including internships and study abroad, may be applied toward the major, and no more than 6 units of independent study may be attempted in a single semester. 189Bulletin 2020-21 Academic Policies (01/15/21) No more than 6 units of independent study may be applied toward a Master of Arts, Master of Science, or Doctor of Liberal Arts. No more than 6 credits of independent study may be applied toward a certificate program that requires 19 units of credit or more. No more than 3 credits of independent study may be applied toward a certificate program that requires 18 units of credit or less. ACTRAC Accelerated Option ACTRAC, the accelerated study option in University College, is available in most undergraduate majors and selected other courses for qualified students. Students choosing ACTRAC may receive one additional credit in a designated 300- or 400- level course by arranging with the instructor to do additional reading, research and writing. ACTRAC requirements include admission to a University College undergraduate degree program, successful completion of at least 12 credits, completion of a college-level English composition course with a grade of B or better, a 3.0 minimum GPA, and University College verification and authorization. Students are charged tuition for 4 credits for an ACTRAC course. Minor A minor in University College consists of a minimum of 15 units of authorized course work in select academic disciplines or interdisciplinary programs in University College. The course requirements for a minor are determined by each department or program. At least 9 units must be advanced course work (300 level or above), and at least 6 of the 9 units in advanced course work must be completed at University College.

Student Academic Records A permanent record of courses, grades and credit for each student is maintained in the Office of Student Records, which will issue official transcripts upon written authorization by the student. Transcript requests must include the student's name, student number, date of birth and approximate dates of attendance. Student records may be reviewed online on WebSTAC (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu ).

Academic Integrity All University College students are governed by the University Student Conduct Code to \"foster an environment conducive to learning and inquiry.\" Among the forms of misconduct covered in the University Student Conduct Code is academic misconduct \"including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of data or records, unpermitted collaboration on assignments, misrepresentation of student status, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 falsification, or otherwise violating the Academic Integrity Policy. Knowingly making false allegations of academic misconduct against any student will itself be considered a form of academic misconduct.\" All University College undergraduate students \u2014 part-time, full-time, degree-seeking and non-degree \u2014 are governed by the Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy and the University College Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy. If a student subject to the Washington University Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, the case will generally be reviewed by the school or college in which the course is listed and taught and not by the school in which the student is enrolled, although all violations and sanctions will also be reported to the student's college of enrollment. Violations of the Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity 190Bulletin 2020-21 Academic Policies (01/15/21) Policy include plagiarism, cheating on an examination, copying or collaborating on assignments without permission, fabrication or falsification of data or records, and other forms of deceit, dishonesty, and inappropriate conduct. Please refer to the detailed Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy (https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/ undergraduate-student-academic-integrity-policy/ ) at Washington University for definitions and examples of each of these categories. All University College graduate students are subject to the Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students and the University College Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy. If a student enrolled in a graduate program administered through University College takes a course through University College and is accused of an academic integrity violation in that course, the student will be subject to the University College Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy. Note that those students enrolled in another graduate or professional school at Washington University will be subject to the academic and professional integrity policies and procedures applicable to the respective school. For example, if a student enrolled in the Graduate School also takes a course through University College and is accused of an academic integrity violation in the Graduate School course, the student will be subject to the Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students. Violations of the Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy include plagiarism and other misappropriation of the work of another, cheating, copying or collaborating on assignments without permission, fabrication or falsification of data or records, research misconduct, obstruction of the academic activities of another, abuse of confidentiality, and other forms of deceit, dishonesty, and inappropriate conduct. Professional integrity violations consist of behavior that is inconsistent with ethical standards in the professional roles for which the student is being trained that are not covered by policies governing academic integrity. Please refer to the detailed Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students (https://graduateschool.wustl.edu/ policies-procedures/) for definitions and examples of each of these categories. All violations of academic integrity will be reported to and investigated by the academic integrity officer in University College. If it is determined that a student has acted dishonestly or if a student has admitted the charges prior to a formal investigation or hearing, an appropriate sanction will be imposed; this may include but is not limited to automatic failure of the assignment or course or, in the case of serious or repeat violations, suspension or expulsion from the university. Withdrawing from a course will not prevent the dean from imposing or recommending sanctions.Academic Advising and Academic Support Services University College recognizes the rich array of backgrounds and experiences adult learners bring to the classroom, and it is aware that adults entering or returning to higher education may need academic counseling, guidance and special services.
