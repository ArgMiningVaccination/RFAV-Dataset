So the start of vaccine trials turns into a critical moment towards the development of an effective tool against the current Ebola outbreak in Uganda. Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) & Ebola Virus Sudan The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if untreated. EVD first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, DRC. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.Within the genus Ebolavirus, six species have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Ta? Forest, Reston and Bombali. Unlike the Zaire ebolavirus which has sparked most of the recent outbreaks, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for the Sudan ebolavirus.
