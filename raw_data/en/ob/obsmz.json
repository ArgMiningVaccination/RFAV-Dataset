BACK IN LINE FALL 2014 2 Body Maintenance A note from Dr. CJ I often get aske d... \"How frequently should I get an adjustment or tune -up at Back In Line?\" What seems simple is actually a loaded question, and I wish I had the perfect correct answer for each person that asks me. Truth be told, it really depends on the patient, and what the ir goals are for their individual body. Often times people don't view their body as a wonderful machine. That \"machine\" sweats when it's hot, shivers when it's cold. When it gets a cut, it has the ability to heal itself. Every day the body comes in contact with hundreds of bacteria and viruses and has the ability to fight them off. Many times, the reason you get a fever is because your body is fighting an infection. Too often patients are tempted and encouraged to prevent or reduce a fever before the body has a chance to do its job. A fever is something the body goes through to heal itself, yet many inhibit this vital process.* The body is an amazing machine! I often find myself telling people \"...the more miles, wear -and-tear you put on your body, the more maintenance and body work you are going to require.\" Endurance athletes and AAU athletes alike go non - stop and require more visits to the chiropractor for adjustments and soft tissue work. The same goes for peop le who sit at a computer desk all day, and fail to create proper mobility in their spine and extremities. These desk dwellers are more likely to suffer from aches, pains, gut disturbances, and more! While most of our patients enjoy the luxuries of insuranc e covering their chiropractic services when pain is present, keep in mind there is no harm in being treated in the absence of pain. Granted, your insurance ONLY covers care when you are in pain, but there is great value in preventative care. Studies and pa tient testimony suggest regular treatment visits prior to experiencing pain can reduce long -term out -of-pocket expenses, while also improving immune function and promoting spinal mobility. It's not JUST regular \"tune -ups\" that help prevent ailments and di sease, but regular exercise and proper nutrition, spiritual well -being, financial security, social support, and purpose. These all play a pivotal role in how the potential for the body to work optimally. ( check out our calendar -of-events to come to FREE ev ents focused on tackling many areas of health and wellness ) The better nutrition as well as balance of proper movement and rest (I cannot emphasize rest enough!) that you give your body, the more your body will reward you for your maintenance schedule. The se benefits will appear well into your golden years and beyond! Remember, its about quality of life. *in some cases, sustained body temperature for 103+ degrees F for over 4 hours can be dangerous. However, most childhood fevers never peak over 103 degree s and break within 15 minutes. Please seek medical attention if a fever of this quality does not reduce after 60 minutes. **This article is not intended to diagnose or treat, but to share educational tidbits ONLY. BACK IN LINE FALL 2014 3 Your in -season SUPERfood: Pumpkin made dairy with some minor substitutions. 1 cup of cooked pumpkin has 200% of your daily Vitamin A intake. This seems like a lot, but luckily Vitamin A cannot be toxic when it comes fro m a plant, only when it comes from an animal source. So no need to hold back! Vitamin A is essential for eye protection and sight. Pumpkin is a great source of fiber and can help keep you full on fewer calories. Pumpkins contain the antioxidant beta -carot ene, which helps fight cellular stress and damage. A cup of pumpkin contains more potassium than a banana, making it an ideal food for an energy boost during the day or refueling after a workout. Pumpkin seeds contain phytosterols that can be helpful by improving cholesterol levels. Pumpkin Soup Olive Oil 1 Brown onion (peeled and diced) 4 Large garlic cloves (peeled and minced) 2 stalks of celery (cut into 1cm slices) 1 kg Pumpkin (seeds removed, peeled, and cut into chunks) 1 large white potato (peeled and chopped) 1 liter free range chicken (or veggie) stock Spices: heaped tablespoons sour cream (optional ) Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, deep pot. Add onion & saut\u00e9 for 3 -4 min over medium heat. Add the minced garlic & continue to cook together for 4 -5 min, stirring often & taking care to not let the garlic burn. Add celery & cook for 2 -3 min then add in the potatoes, pumpkin & stock. Season well with salt and pepper then bring to boil over high heat, & simmer over medium heat until pumpkin & potato are cooked through. Transfer the entire contents to a blender and whizz until full smooth (you m ay have to do this in one or two batches depending on the size of your blender). Add the blended soup back into the same pot then add the spices and 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream. Stir all together and season again if you think it needs it. Simmer th e soup over low -medium heat for 20 minutes to infu se flavo rs then serve piping hot in bowls with an extra dollop of sour cream. Recipe and photo courtesy of www.whatkatieate.com Pumpkin bread, pumpkin pie, and pumpkin beer all taste great, but they don't necessarily carry the nutritional benefits of pumpkin. Soup on the other hand, is an easy way to get the goods and perks that come with fall vegetables.

However, due to their convenience, babies are often buckled in for not only the car ride, but daycare, walks, and naps as well. No matter how plush or deluxe the device (yes, even the escalades of the baby world), infants should not be spending their entire day in the car seat. Too much car seat time can lead to... Flat head syndrome (aka Plagiocephaly) o This skull misshaping occurs from constant pressure on the baby's head from lying in the same position for long periods of time. It can interfere with development if not treated. Cervical spine subluxation o Many babies wh o spend large amounts of time in strollers or car seats constantly tilt their head to a particular side. This is a good indication that their cervical spine is out of alignment (they need adjusted!), which can lead to all kinds of signs and symptoms. Hip problems o Babies' hips need kicking, wiggling, pushing, and crawling in order to develop correctly. It's hard for proper movement to happen when the body is always in a reclined position. Malformed posture o An adult's spine is shaped like an \"S\" when viewed from the side, but we're not born like that! Our spinal curves develop from a \"C\" shape we hold as babies, into an \"S\" shape to helps us maintain flexibility and absorb stressors like walking, running, and jumping. o The proper curves develop as the baby be gins to hold his or her head up during \"tummy time\", pushing off of things, and crawling. Staying in the seat can interfere with spinal curve development, and therefore the future posture of your child. Depriving baby of touch and stimulation o When not in a seat, infants are likely held in someone's lap, talked to, played with, walked around, or put on the floor with toys. These are all better options that promote attachment to others and neurological development. o Laying the infant alone on their back (unless they're asleep!), can actually be emotionally stressful and developmentally inhibiting to some infants. So next time... When you travel with your infant, buckle them up safely! THEN take them out and carry them to the next destination, and give them plenty of play time on the floor where they are free to move. References: Schon, R. (2007).

Events Calendar BACK IN LINE FALL 2014 6 Trigger Point Dry Needling For almost a year now Drs. Nate & CJ have been offering trigger point dry needling as a service to help reduce pain. On top of their acupuncture training, trigger point dry needling is a nice alternative to pain relief that is drug free, fast, and effecti ve. Few providers in the area are offering this service. Tired of foam rolling? Try a round of trigger point dry needling (TPDN). TPDN is an effective therapy to treat muscular tension and spasm that commonly accompanies conditions such as arthritis, ner ve irritation, muscular strain, ligament strains and herniated discs. It is called \"dry\" needling because there is no solution injected as with a hypodermic needle during a flu shot. With Dry Needling, the needle itself and the effects it produces within the tissue is the treatment. Studies have even indicated that dry needling is more effective than lidacaine pain injections. At the end of October Dr. Nate will head to Boulder, CO and will be taking additional training in the dry needling arena and le arning more specific protocols for Pain Management and Sports Medicine. Give TPDN a try today! Be sure to ask the doctors or ca ll and schedule for a treatment today! Back in Line strives to offer innovative ways to you solutions to live a better qualit y of life.
