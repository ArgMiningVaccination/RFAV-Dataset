Everyone deserves to live their Best Life. Seeking solutions for my life circumstances put me on the path of Shamanism. My healing journey inspires me to provide others with the support & guidance they need so that they too, may bring transformation & self-empowerment into their lives. My Services: My purpose is to help clients form a deeper connection to their own spiritual source. As a Shamanic Educator and Artist, I offer Art-Meditation workshops illustrating the Shamanic world view & how Shamanism empowers and transforms lives. I offer Shamanic energy healing sessions featuring complementary modalities that are transformative and empowering. My Intuitive Spiritual Readings offer clients insights & guidance for living their Best Life. I'd like to announce my private practice has now resumed post pandemic. I'm offering intuitive readings as well as remote healing. It feels good to get back into my healing work. I'm here for you if you need me. With "}
