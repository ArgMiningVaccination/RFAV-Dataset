Anita Bermann, MS, RDN, CD Ideal Feast Nutrition Counseling 206-913-8715 Idealfeastnutrition.com Intuitive Eating Intuitive eating is an approach that teaches how to create a healthy relationship with your food, where you ultimately become the expert of your own body. You learn how to distinguish between physical and emotional feelings, and gain a sense of body wisdom. It's also a process of making peace with food. If you have had a history of chronic dieting or rigid \"heal thy\" rules about eating it can be challenging to begin to trust your body with food. Below is a summary of the 10 principles of Intuitive Eating, from the book, Intuitive Eating, by Evelyn Tribole, MS, RD and Elyse Resch, MS, RD. 1. Reject the Diet Mentality: Throw out the diet books that offer you false hope of losing weight quickly and easily. A new and better diet is not lurking around the corner, and this hope will prevent you from rediscovering Intuitive Eating. 2. Honor Your Hu nger: Keep your body biologically fed with adequate energy. Otherwise you can trigger a primal drive to overeat. Learning to honor this first biological signal sets the stage for re - building trust with yourself and food. 3. Make Peace with Food: Give your self unconditional permission to eat. If you tell yourself that you can't or shouldn't have a particular food, it can lead to intense feelings of deprivation that build into uncontrollable cravings and binging. When you finally \"give -in\" to your forbidden food, eating can lead to overwhelming guilt. 4. Challenge the Food Police: The Food Police monitor the unreasonable rules that dieting has created. The police station is housed deep in your psyche, and its loud speaker shouts negative barbs, hopeless phra ses, and guilt -provoking indictments. 5. Respect Your Fullness: Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry. Observe the signs that show that you're comfortably full. Pause in the middle of a meal or food and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what is your current fullness level? 6. Discover the Satisfaction Factor: We often overlook one of the most basic gifts of existence: the pleasure and satisfaction that can be found in the eating experience. When you eat what you reall y want, in an environment that is inviting and conductive, the pleasure you derive will be a powerful force in helping you feel satisfied and content. 7. Honor Your Feelings Without Using Food: Find ways to comfort, nurture, and accept your issues without using food. Anxiety, loneliness, boredom, and anger are emotions we all experience throughout life. Each has its own trigger, and each has its own appeasement. Food won't fix any of these feelings. It may comfort for the short term, distract from the pai n, or even numb you into a food hangover. But food won't solve the problem. Anita Bermann, MS, RDN, CD Ideal Feast Nutrition Counseling 206-913-8715 Idealfeastnutrition.com 8. Respect Your Body: Accept your genetic blueprint. Just as a person with a shoe size of eight would not expect to realistically squeeze into a size six, it is equally as futile (and uncomfortable) to have the same expectation with body size. Respect your body so you can feel better about who you are. 9. Exercise: Feel the Difference: Shift your focus to how it feels to move your body, rather than the calorie burning effect of exercise. If you focus on how you feel from working out, it can make the difference between rolling out of bed for a brisk morning walk or hitting the snooze ala rm. 10. Honor Your Health: Make food choices that honor your health and taste buds while making you feel well. Remember that you don't have to eat a perfect diet to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a nutrient deficiency or gain weight from one snack, one meal, or one day of eating. It's what you eat consistently over time that matters.
