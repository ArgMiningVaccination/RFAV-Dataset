The F-TYPE Coup\u00e9 model line-up is headlined by the F-TYPE R Coup\u00e9, its 5.0-litre V8 supercharged engine enabling acceleration from 0-60mph in 4.0 seconds, and a top speed of 186mph (electronically limited). F-TYPE S Coup\u00e9 and F-TYPE Coup\u00e9 the 3.0-litre V6 supercharged engine. The F-TYPE Coup\u00e9 range complements 2013 \"World Car Design of the Year\" award-winning F-TYPE Convertible model line-up of V8 S. The F-TYPE Coup\u00e9 embodies the uncompromised design vision of the stunning Jaguar C-X16 concept sports coup\u00e9 that debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, its dramatic cabin-rearward stance being defined by three heartlines. The first two heartlines - shared with F-TYPE Convertible - form the muscular front and rear wings, the third heartline being the sweeping coup\u00e9 roof profile which provides an unbroken silhouette while emphasising the visual drama of the tapered cabin sitting between powerful rear haunches.

Its torsional rigidity provides the basis for excellent dynamic attributes. The F-TYPE Coup\u00e9's body side is made from a single piece aluminium pressing, probably the most extreme cold-formed aluminium body side in the automotive industry, eliminating the requirement for multiple panels and cosmetic joints. As well as the motor show debut, the F-TYPE Coup\u00e9 made a dramatic appearance on TV with a new TV commercial, entitled \"Rendezvous\", directed by Oscar-winner Tom Hooper and starring Sir Ben Kingsley, Tom Hiddleston and Mark Strong.

The Company received the award in recognition of its significant investment in UK research, jobs and facilities, improving its overall environmental performance and increasing the skills and education opportunities for young people and existing employees. Jaguar Land Rover's approach to environmental and social responsibility is at the forefront of the Company's thinking. Focusing on environmental and social impacts, from products and manufacturing to our whole supply chain, ensures that we grow our business responsibly while responding to global trends, stakeholder needs and ensuring positive relationships with local communities. We call this Environmental Innovation and it reflects a holistic approach to Responsible Business at Jaguar Land Rover. We have set ambitious targets for 2020 and to help us achieve these, the Company's 2020 Roadmap sets out the path we need to follow guided by \"Our commitment to environment and society policy\" which embeds responsible business principles at all levels of our business. Our key 2020 Environmental Innovation targets include: External recognition as a leading, global responsible brand. Transformation in business thinking to leverage long-term value in sustainability. Sustainable products - innovating to reduce environmental impacts, including CO 2 emissions, over the product life cycle. Leadership in sustainable business operations, targeting zero waste to landfill and carbon neutral manufacturing operations. Global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - using our global reach, resources and partnerships to create opportunities for 12 million people.RECOGNISING OUR EFFORTS Our continued focus on Environmental Innovation has been recognised externally and awarded. Having received the Platinum Big Tick Award for outstanding responsible business approach by Business in the Community (BITC) in April 2013, Jaguar Land Rover then progressed to the highly acclaimed \"Responsible Business of the Year\" award in July. The development of Jaguar Land Rover's vehicle manufacturing sites has also been acknowledged with the \"Excellence in Environmental Management\" award. This was given for the various environmental improvements put in place, with a particular focus on Solihull's production operations. The \"Inspiring Tomorrow's Engineers\" programme won BITC's national Education Award 2013 in recognition of the positive impact its long-term school partnerships are having on increasing employability skills and promoting engineering careers to young people. It is this recognition that shows Jaguar Land Rover is taking significant strides to create a company that is not just recognised for its world-class production of vehicles but for its commitment and willingness to operate as a responsible business. WHOLE-LIFE PLANNING From the moment we develop a vehicle concept, we consider all the product and manufacturing attributes that help us reduce the overall environmental impact, plan to use less natural resources and create less waste. We are reducing the environmental and social impacts of our vehicles at every stage, from product design to the end of the vehicle's life. The greatest opportunity for us to influence the overall impact is at the design stage, and it is here we concentrate on finding ways to reduce emissions as well as use more sustainable materials. Up to 70% of emissions in our vehicles' life cycle occur during use by our customers and we focus on reducing these emissions through a process of vehicle lightweighting, powertrain efficiencies, aerodynamics and technology innovations like intelligent stop/start.Jaguar Land Rover's approach to environmental and social responsibility is at the forefront of the Company's thinking.

We are on track to meet that target, having achieved 24% by the end of 2013. We design vehicles that use resources efficiently and can be disposed of and recycled at the end of their life. We are also exploring hybrid and electric vehicle technologies that could dramatically reduce vehicles emissions in the future. We use Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental impact of raw material use, production and manufacturing, the customer's vehicle use, and its disposal at end of life. Once calculated the impact is stated in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e), so that the different impacts can be easily compared and analysed. We have in-house capacity to complete full LCAs for all new vehicles. We follow the international standards ISO 14040, 14044 and 14062 and we gained third-party certification from the Vehicle Certification Agency for full vehicle LCAs. We have completed life cycle assessments for six vehicles including the Jaguar XJ, Range Rover Evoque and the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. Our aim is to educate our customers in the impact of cars throughout their life cycle. This will become increasingly important as the significance of each life cycle stage changes with the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicle technologies.Reduction in fleet average tailpipe CO 2 emissions since 2007 24% The assembly line at Solihull is an example of Jaguar Land Rover's highly efficient manufacturing process JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 54 Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology Responsible business Management report | Governance | Financials OPERATIONAL REDUCTIONS (ENERGY, WASTE AND WATER) Our operations form an important part of our products' life cycle and minimising the impact from our operations is a key element of our Environmental Innovation strategy. This is especially important as we increase manufacturing capacity globally to meet growing demand. In 2009, we set an ambitious goal to reduce the environmental footprint from our manufacturing operations, focusing on CO 2 emissions, waste to landfill and water use. We made significant achievements by driving though a number of initiatives including investment in renewable technologies, continued lean manufacturing solutions and employee engagement. For every vehicle produced up to March 2014, against the Environmental Innovation baseline year of 2007, we have achieved the following reductions: 30% (from 21% the previous year) in operational CO 2 despite significant project work to expand our facilities. 29% (from 17% the previous year) in water consumption. 75% (per previous year) in waste sent to landfill. Our 2020 Environmental Innovation target is leadership in sustainable business operations.This focuses on driving carbon neutrality within our manufacturing operation, zero waste and treating waste as a resource as well as closed loop recycling processes. For example, our advanced new engine manufacturing facility in Wolverhampton has been designed with sustainability embedded throughout, and we have at design stage achieved an \"excellent\" rating from the BREEAM assessment for sustainable buildings. The building has been designed to minimise energy demand through the use of insulated cladding, to maximise daylight through the roof design, and to harness natural ventilation through the use of automatic louvres. CARBON OFFSET PROGRAMME Some emissions are unavoidable. Therefore, while low carbon technology is still developing, we are committed to offsetting these CO 2 emissions by investing in sustainable development projects to deliver benefits in other ways. We offset 100% of our UK manufacturing assembly emissions and customers can also choose to offset their own vehicle emissions, via our programme partner ClimateCare.For manufacturing this equates to over 1.5 million tonnes of CO 2 since 2007 and we have invested in carbon reduction/sustainable development projects, in 18 countries, from renewable energy to clean water provision. As part of our 2020 Environmental Innovation targets, offset funding will be directed to large-scale, high-impact \"carbon for development\" projects like the award-winning \"carbon-for-water\" LifeStraw project. These projects have multiple benefits for people and the environment. LifeStraw uses the distribution of water filters in the Busia region of western Kenya to replace the use of firewood to boil water. These units provide clean and safe water, reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases, creating opportunities for recipients to attend school or pursue commercial interests. Not using firewood reduces local deforestation rates, reduces smoke inhalation and provides a saving in household expenditure. Projects like LifeStraw are key to our target of creating opportunities for 12 million people by 2020. Reduction in operational CO2 30% Jaguar Land Rover supports the distribution of Lifestraw clean water filters in Kenya, through the purchase of voluntary carbon offsets; creating opportunities for over one million people and offsetting 600,000 tonnes of manufacturing assembly CO 2 emissions JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 56 Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology Responsible business Management report | Governance | Financials Social responsibility initiatives integral to our reputation Jaguar Land Rover makes a positive impact on society by building excellent community relations and supporting local initiatives. aguar Land Rover believes that being a responsible business is fundamental to preserving the strong reputation of our brands, securing our licence to operate, delivering profitable growth, and retaining the trust of our stakeholders.

Employees with disabilities are supported through occupational health and accessibility measures at all sites. We have been awarded the \"Two Ticks\" symbol by the UK Government's Jobcentre Plus organisation, which recognises employers that have made commitments to employ, keep and develop the abilities of disabled staff. Jaguar Land Rover is a member of \"Opportunity Now\", an organisation driving the focus on gender equality in the workplace. Improving gender balance is a priority as the automotive industry has traditionally attracted more men than women and women represent just 10% of the Company's workforce. The proportion of women in the business increased by 1% in FY14 and we remain focused on attracting more women into engineering roles, with women making up around 24% of the graduate intake, 8% of apprentices and 22% of undergraduate placements in FY14. We also offer a personal development programme specifically for women, with 250 women participating since its launch in 2009. The Engineering Network for Women, connects women who work for Jaguar Land Rover with female engineering students interested in pursuing a career in the automotive sector. Jaguar Land Rover's Women in Engineering Sponsorship Scheme gives financial and practical support to female undergraduates interested in engineering careers, as well as work experience with the Company through 3, 6 or 15 month placements and we have increased our target for placements from 10 to 17 in FY14, with each participant assigned a mentor and a bursary of \u00a31,500. Jaguar Land Rover is committed to safety and well-being, striving to continuously improve working conditions and promote safe working practices to WCaring for a diverse workforce An inclusive approach that respects and welcomes all employees. ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and the wider community. We are focused on assuring the safety of everything we design, construct, operate and maintain, ensuring the right tools, systems and support are in place. Everyone involved with our business is expected to take a lead in demonstrating this responsibility. Jaguar Land Rover holds external accreditation to OHSAS18001 and was reaccredited at the end of FY13 after a set of successful surveillance audits and zero major non-compliance. 2013 saw the launch of Destination Zero - A Journey to Zero Harm. This is underpinned by everyone understanding and taking a responsibility for their own and their fellow workers' safety and well-being. We continue to support this with the management health and safety training workshops and saw a further 437 management graded employees attending this workshop this year. Safety and well-being is relevant to all aspects of our business, and is included in the commitments and objectives of every department. Health promotion activities take place at all Jaguar Land Rover locations with almost 70 events taking place in FY14 covering topics such as Diabetes Awareness, Heart Disease and Smoking Health. Occupational Health is supported and delivered by on-site health facilities, including cognitive behaviour therapy and physiotherapy, coupled with the introduction of Well-being Centres at a number of the sites. The continued active use of \"WellPoint Kiosks\" - which are designed to encourage preventative health improvement - has seen over 8,000 new users registered in FY14. Safety and well-being are key as we grow internationally and are delivered via a safety management system that provides a framework for all operations. With over 35 million working hours recorded across the business, our manufacturing operations at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood achieved 39, 41 and 46 weeks zero lost time accidents respectively. We also support in areas such as international assignment and travel health for our employees.

The growth in retail sales has been supported by new products. Land Rover has grown by 12%, primarily driven by the introduction of the Range Rover Sport, a full year of the Range Rover, and continued strong growth of the Range Rover Evoque. Jaguar was up 37% buoyed by the introduction of the critically acclaimed new Jaguar F-TYPE and with strong demand for XJ and XF models on the back of Sportbrake, all-wheel drive and smaller engine derivatives. The Company maintains a balanced sales profile, with all markets contributing to the growth. Notably, China and North America volumes have increased 34% and 20% year-on-year respectively. The UK and Europe were up 6% and 2%, and Asia Pacific and Rest of the World were up 28% and 15% respectively. Complementing the strong volumes the Company has also benefited from a favourable model and market mix to generate a record EBITDA of \u00a33.4 billion (17.5% margin) for the year ended 31 March 2014, up \u00a31.1 billion, or 2.7ppt of EBITDA margin from prior year. EBITDA performance does also include currency effects, notably underlying losses versus the strengthening Pound Sterling, offset by realised hedging gains which are now included in EBITDA together with revaluation of current assets and liabilities. The increase in profit before tax to \u00a32.5 billion captures depreciation and amortisation costs as well as net financial expense. Depreciation and amortisation in FY14 was \u00a3875 million up from \u00a3622 million in FY13, in line with the growth in capital spending. Net finance expense was \u00a3154 million up \u00a3158 million from FY13, primarily reflecting the reversal of the mark-to-market of the embedded derivative option associated with the \u00a3750 million of debt callable in May 2014. This debt was tendered for and redeemed in the quarter ended 31 March 2014, and associated costs are also reflected in PBT. Finally, PBT includes \u00a3137 million of gains in relation to the mark-to-market of foreign currency denominated long-term debt and unmatured FX option and commodity hedges, this compares to a \u00a347 million loss in FY13. The profit after tax of \u00a31.9 billion reflects an effective tax rate of 25%. Free cash flow of \u00a31.2 billion (up \u00a3555 million) reflects the strong EBITDA, less \u00a32.7 billion of total investment (up \u00a3632 million), plus positive working capital of \u00a3393 million. The free cash flow is before net repayment of debt (\u00a379 million after refinancing \u00a3750 million of debt tendered and redeemed), net finance expense (\u00a3269 million including the tender and debt redemption fees) and a \u00a3150 million dividend paid in June 2013. JLR has declared another \u00a3150 million dividend paid in June 2014. The 31 March 2014 cash position was a very healthy \u00a33.5 billion, and total liquidity was \u00a34.8 billion. This includes \u00a31.3 billion of undrawn committed credit facilities (of which \u00a3322 million will mature in July 2016 and \u00a3968 million in July 2018). Net cash is \u00a31.5 billion, including total debt of \u00a32.0 billion. The debt balance includes the successful issuance in the year of a US$700 million 5 year bond at 4.125% and \u00a3400 million 8 year bond at 5%. The proceeds of these issuances were used to refinance \u00a3750 million of debt callable in May 2014, but tendered for and repaid to the facility agent in the quarter ended 31 March 2014. The strong performance in FY14 as well as the strong balance sheet and liquidity, with proven access to funding from capital markets and banks, supports the Company's plans to increase total investment to, in the region of, \u00a33.5 billion to \u00a33.7 billion in FY15.

The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors, a part of the Tata Group, a global enterprise headquartered in India, with revenues of around $97 billion in FY13, comprising over 100 operating companies, in more than 100 countries and in seven business sectors: communications and information technology, engineering, materials, services, energy, consumer products and chemicals. Tata Motors Limited is India's largest automobile company. It is the leader in commercial vehicles in each segment, and among the top four in passenger vehicles. GENERAL TRENDS IN PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE Strong volume growth The Company has had a successful year of continued growth in all markets with overall volumes up 16%, reflecting continued product successes including the launch of the Range Rover Sport and Jaguar F-TYPE, and a full year of sales of the Range Rover. More established models have also been performing well, in particular derivatives such as the XF Sportbrake, all-wheel drive, and smaller engine options across the range. Retail volumes have grown across all markets, led by China region up 34% from last year, to record retail sales of 103,077 units. North America and Asia Pacific regions also performed strongly, up 20% and 28% to 75,671 and 22,795 units respectively, while the UK and Europe were up 6% and 2% to 76,721 and 82,854 units respectively. Wholesale volumes for FY14 were 429,861 units, an increase of 16% on FY13. At a brand level, wholesale volumes were 79,307 units for Jaguar and 350,554 units for Land Rover, representing growth of 37% and 12% respectively.TIn line with the volume growth, and supported by favourable market and product mix, FY14 saw record revenues, up 23% to \u00a319,386 million. EBITDA growth Consolidated EBITDA for FY14 was a record \u00a33,393 million, an increase of 45% compared toFY13. The EBITDA improvement resulted from increased sales volumes and revenues, as well as favourable product and market mix, as higher margin products were sold in higher margin destinations. Also the Company has been able to keep costs in check, through cost discipline and various efficiencies and improvement initiatives. Material and Other cost of sales for the year were \u00a311,904 million, equivalent to 61.4% of revenue. This represents an improvement of 1.3% from FY13 in part due to decreases in raw material prices. Employee costs for FY14 were up \u00a3320 million (24%) to \u00a31,654 million as the Company has increased permanent and agency headcount, particularly in product development and manufacturing, to support the Company's growth agenda. Other expenses, including those relating to manufacturing, launch, freight and distribution, warranty, product development expense, selling and fixed marketing, were \u00a33,717 million in the year, an increase of \u00a3642 million (21%) versus FY13. From FY14 onwards EBITDA now includes mark-to-market of current assets and liabilities and realised gains on matured FX and commodity hedges for the full year. This is described more fully on page 82. Of the \u00a31,266 million total product development spend, \u00a31,030 million was capitalised in line with policy under IFRS accounting. Net income Profit before tax (PBT) for FY14 was \u00a32,501 million, an increase of \u00a3827 million (49%) compared to FY13. PBT performance reflects the higher EBITDA plus gains of \u00a3137 million arising from mark-to-market of unrealised FX options and commodity hedges and revaluation of foreign currency loans. This compares to a \u00a347 million loss in FY13. PBT also captures depreciation and amortisation charges, up \u00a3253 million to \u00a3875 million for FY14 given increased product development and facilities investment. Higher net finance expense of \u00a3154 million includes circa \u00a362 million of one-off costs incurred in the redemption of the higher coupon \u00a3500 million and $410 million 2018 notes (at 8.125% and 7.75% coupon respectively) and a \u00a347 million reversal of gain on related bond call options. The bond redemption was pre-financed by the successful issuances of $700 million 4.125% 2018 notes and \u00a3400 million 5% 2022 notes. This served to reduce the Company's overall cost of debt in line with the improving credit and market conditions. Profit after tax was \u00a31,879 million, an effective tax rate of 25%. ECONOMIC COMMENT AND PERFORMANCE IN KEY GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS The global operating environment improved considerably in FY14, as economic activity strengthened and spending in most economies began to recover. The advanced economies, particularly the US and UK, led the rebound, as growth became broader and more entrenched. Europe also saw the first tentative signs of recovery after a long and painful slowdown. Emerging market economies slowed and future growth forecasts were revised down. In the UK, the recovery turned out stronger than expected. UK labour market conditions improved as employment increased and the numbers out of work fell. Rising consumer and business confidence helped to underpin stronger retail sales and investment spending, while the recovery in house prices helped shore up household wealth. Against this backdrop, total vehicle sales improved 12.5% compared to the previous year. Jaguar Land Rover sales climbed 6.2% on the year, supported by a strong performance from Jaguar (10.7% growth) and the launch of the F-TYPE convertible. The 5% annual growth in Land Rover sales reflects the strong market position in the UK for SUVs. The US economy continued to recover although perhaps less strongly than anticipated. Industrial activity picked up pace throughout the year, supporting continued employment growth. Bad weather between December and March, and the Federal Government shutdown in October disrupted consumers' normal spending patterns but did not knock the recovery off course. In the year to March, total passenger car sales expanded by 6.2% with Jaguar Land Rover outperforming the market to deliver sales growth of 19.2%, or 20.2% including Canada. In Europe, there emerged the first signs of recovery after recession. Following several quarters of contraction, GDP in the Eurozone bottomed out and started to pick up. Led by Germany, consumer and business confidence began to return, industrial activity started to recover, and the deterioration in labour market conditions came to a halt. Admittedly, there is still a long way to go: deflation risks remain, the sovereign and banking crisis is not fully resolved, and there is a considerable gulf in performance between the core and the periphery. Nonetheless, the automotive market is making a nascent recovery. In Germany, Jaguar Land Rover sales grew 6.5%, against 0.2% for total passenger cars. In Italy, Jaguar Land Rover sales edged up 1.1%, driven by Land Rover, against a total market contraction of 1.6%. Although in France sales fell across the board. The most encouraging performance came from Spain where, after three years of double-digit contraction, the market rebounded by 11.7%, and Jaguar Land Rover sales rose 14.7%. China's economy slowed slightly in 2013 as authorities sought to rein in excessive credit growth and advance their reform agenda. Potential growth has decreased as the economy has expanded in size, but also as a desirable by-product of more balanced growth. Passenger car sales outpaced the broader economy, reaching a new peak of almost 18.4 million units in the year to March, growing faster than either of the previous two years. Total Jaguar Land Rover sales in the China region reached 103,077, up from 77,075 in FY13. Jaguar volumes more than doubled to 19,891 while Land Rover sales reached 83,186. Elsewhere, many emerging markets experienced a more challenging economic environment.

This compares to operating cash flow of \u00a32,429 million in FY13. The Company invested significantly in the year, up \u00a3527 million to \u00a32,444 million. This demonstrates the Company's commitment to product development and also capacity increases, including facilities in China and UK. Net cash used in financing activities was \u00a3498 million in FY14 compared to \u00a3178 million in FY13. In FY14 financing activities included early redemption of circa \u00a3750 million equivalent of higher coupon long-term bonds through tender/exercise of call option in Q4 pre-financed by the issuance of $700 million bond in December 2013 and \u00a3400 million bond in January 2014. Financing activities also included a dividend paid to Tata Motors of \u00a3150 million, \u00a379 million of debt repayments, and interest and fees of \u00a3269 million.CAPITAL STRUCTURE BACKGROUND Liquidity and capital resources As at 31 March 2014, on a consolidated level, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32,260 million and short-term deposits of between 3-12 months' duration of \u00a31,199 million (totalling \u00a33,459 million). In addition, the Company had available undrawn long-term committed facilities of \u00a31,290 million (\u00a3323 million maturing in July 2016 and \u00a3967 million maturing in July 2018). Subject to regulation the Company pools cash through inter-company loans from each of its subsidiaries to Jaguar Land Rover, UK, and maintains an annual dividend distribution. The total amount of cash and cash equivalents includes \u00a3536 million held by subsidiaries in jurisdictions outside the UK. The cash in some of these juridictions is subject to restriction on pooling cash to the UK through inter-company loans or interim dividends although annual dividends are generally permitted. The Company finances its capital requirements through cash generated from operations and external debt, including long-term debt, and revolving credit, factoring and working capital facilities. At 31 March Borrowings and description of indebtedness The Company has continued to enjoy good access to the debt market to raise long-term finance. Most recently the Company successfully pre-financed the redemption of callable high coupon debt with the issuance of two new bonds: (i) $700 million 4.125% due 2018, issued December 2013 and (ii) \u00a3400m 5% due 2022, issued January 2014. As with previous Bonds these issuances were on a senior unsecured basis, and were not subject to the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The notes have semi-annual interest payments and are subject to certain customary covenants and events of default.

Countries with large current account and fiscal deficits were worst affected. In Brazil, rising interest rates and falling consumer confidence left total new vehicle registrations down 4.5% year-on-year. Despite this backdrop, Jaguar Land Rover expanded its sales by 21.1% to over 11,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, in India and Russia the total vehicle markets also contracted (by 6.2% and 6.0% respectively), but Jaguar Land Rover grew its sales by 8.6% and 14.7%. In South Africa the economic situation dragged Company sales down 9.9% on the previous year. The Asia Pacific sales region (including Australia, S. Korea and Japan) saw the fastest rate of growth after China. Total Company sales increased by 27.7% year-on-year to 22,795. In particular, South Korea experienced the fastest expansion, growing 51.8% on the back of economic growth following the slowdown in 2012. In Japan, advanced purchases of vehicles to beat the increase in the consumption tax in April 2014 more than offset the deterioration in consumer sentiment. Total Company sales increased by 33.2% against growth in the total passenger car market of 9.0% in the year to March. In Australia, the unwinding of the mining boom and growing slack in the economy were compounded by dwindling consumer confidence and rising unemployment. Total new car sales growth was 1.3% after over 8% the year before. Company sales were buoyant though, and managed to grow by 15.3%.2014, the Company had \u00a32,010 million of debt, consisting of \u00a31,843 million equivalent of long-term unsecured debt and \u00a3167 million working capital debt facilities. This is detailed in the table below. In the ordinary course of business, the Company also enters into, and maintains, letters of credit, cash pooling and cash management facilities, performance bonds and guarantees and other similar facilities. * The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors Jaguar Land Rover Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Holdings Limited, Land Rover Exports Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Nominee Company Limited and Jaguar Land Rover North America LLC. ** The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors Jaguar Land Rover Limited and Jaguar Land Rover Holdings Limited.Looking ahead, global economic activity is expected to improve further in FY15, driven by continued expansion in the US and UK, and recovery in Europe. In emerging markets challenges remain particularly as global credit conditions will tighten further. Nonetheless, the prospects for most of these markets remain good.

Jaguar Land Rover Holdings Limited (formerly called Land Rover), Jaguar Land Rover Limited, Land Rover Exports Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Nominee Company Limited (formerly Jaguar Land Rover Exports Limited) and Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, are the guarantors. In July 2013, the Company amended and restated the facility to \u00a31,250 million at better pricing and terms and conditions. This has since been upsized to \u00a31,290 million. As at March 2014, the facility is fully undrawn. The facility has two tranches, a three-year tranche of \u00a3323 million (maturing in 2016) and a five-year tranche of \u00a3967 million (maturing in 2018). Jaguar Land Rover is subject to certain customary financial and other covenants under this facility. Various Sterling bilateral term loan facilities supported by CNY deposits: During the course of FY14 the Company repaid the amounts outstanding under the various short-term loan facilities, previously secured by restricted cash on deposit from Jaguar Land Rover China (the Company's national sales company, NSC), and guaranteed by Land Rover (now Jaguar Land Rover Holdings Limited). Receivables factoring facilities Jaguar Land Rover Limited has maintained invoice discounting facilities with one or more banks.

BUSINESS REVIEW Business background The Company designs, develops, manufactures and sells Jaguar premium performance cars and Land Rover premium all-terrain vehicles, as well as related parts and accessories. The Company has a long tradition as a manufacturer of premium passenger vehicles with internationally recognised brands, an exclusive product portfolio of award-winning vehicles, a global distribution network and strong research and development (R&D) capabilities. The Company currently operates three major production facilities and two advanced design and engineering facilities all in the United Kingdom. At 31 March 2014, the Company employed circa 29,000 employees globally. The Company operates a global sales and distribution network designed to support worldwide sales and facilitate growth across 170 countries. Legal structure The process of consolidating legal entities under the Company continued with the transfer of the assets and liabilities of Jaguar Land Rover Exports Limited to Jaguar Land Rover Limited, the primary operating company in the Group. The simplified legal structure is represented below.Product design, development and technology The Company is committed to a programme of regular enhancements in product design, and each of its vehicles is designed and developed by award-winning design teams based in two design and development centres, each equipped with computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering tools, and configured for competitive product development cycle time and efficient data management. The Company has refreshed the entire Jaguar range under a unified concept and design language epitomised in the new Jaguar F-TYPE and the new smaller Jaguar XE sedan planned for launch in 2015. The Company has also continued to enhance the design of Land Rover's range of all-terrain vehicles with the new Discovery family of vehicles, the first of which being the Discovery Sport on sale in calendar year 2015. The Company endeavours to implement the best technologies into its product range to meet the requirements of a globally competitive market, and continues to commit significant investment into research and development. The Company also strives for efficiencies through sharing premium technologies, powertrain designs and vehicle architecture across its products. For example, the aluminium body architecture, first used in the Jaguar XJ and XK, is now being extended across the fleet, most recently in the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. It is anticipated that this will be a significant contributor to further efficiencies in manufacturing and engineering, as well as to the reduction of CO 2 emissions and the improvement of fuel economy. Furthermore, significant investment is made in alternative fuel and hybrid technology as well as other development programmes aimed at further improving the environmental performance of its vehicles. In September 2013, the Company announced investment in the National Automotive Innovation Campus at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom to complement existing product development centres.This Campus is planned to open in 2016 and will focus on advanced technology, innovation and research and will feature engineering workshops and laboratories, advanced powertrain facilities and advanced design, visualisation and rapid prototyping. In November 2013, the Company announced plans to work with Intel to establish a technology research centre in Oregon in the United States to develop the next generation in vehicle technologies, helping to enhance future vehicle infotainment systems. Facilities The Company operates three automotive manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom. At Solihull, the Company produces the Land Rover Defender, Discovery, Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models. Solihull has recently benefited from investment in a new assembly hall which, in FY15, will produce the new Jaguar XE sedan and Range Rover Sport. In addition, Castle Bromwich produces the Jaguar XK, XJ, XF and new F-TYPE models, and Halewood, produces the Freelander and the Range Rover Evoque. Outside the UK, the Company has committed to a 50:50 Joint Venture (JV) with Chery Automotive to build a factory in Changshu, China to supply the local market from FY15. The JV is expected to invest a total of CNY10.9 billion into the manufacturing plant, R&D centre and engine production facility. The Company is committed to invest CNY3.5 billion of equity capital in the JV Company, representing 50% of the share capital and voting rights of the JV Company. In December 2013, the Company signed an agreement to invest \u00a3240 million into a production facility in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Construction of the premium vehicle manufacturing facility will commence in 2014. The first vehicles are expected to come off the assembly line in 2016, subject to the final approval of the plans from the Brazilian Federal Government under its Inovar Auto Programme. The new plant will have a capacity to build 24,000 vehicles annually for the local market. In December 2012, the Company signed a Letter of Intent with the National Industrial Clusters Development Program (NICDP) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to undertake a detailed feasibility study anticipating Saudi Arabia as a possible future location for a Jaguar Land Rover automotive facility. Discussions with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are still at a preliminary stage. In FY15 the Company will also start full production at its Engine Manufacturing Centre at Wolverhampton, UK. The world-class plant will manufacture a family of premium, technologically advanced engines, \"Ingenium\". These will be entirely designed and built in-house for exclusive use. The Jaguar XE, debuting in 2015, will be the first vehicle equipped with these four-cylinder engines. Complementing its flexible manufacturing footprint the Company has two design and engineering facilities at Gaydon and Whitley, both in the United Kingdom, and its global headquarters is also located at the Whitley site. Sales and distribution The Company's products are sold in over 170 countries, through a global network of 18 national sales companies (NSCs), 84 importers, 53 export partners and 2,518 franchise sales dealers, of which 784 are joint Jaguar and Land Rover dealers. The Company has established robust business processes and systems to ensure that its production plans meet anticipated retail sales demand and to enable the active management of its inventory of finished vehicles and dealer inventory throughout its network. The Company has arrangements in place for the provision of dealer and consumer financial services products with third-party providers, including: Black Horse (part of the Lloyds Bank Group) in the UK, FGA Capital (a joint venture between Fiat Auto and Credit Agricole) in Europe, Chase Auto Finance in the USA and other local auto financial services providers in other key markets.Tata Motors Limited (India) TML Holdings PTE Limited (Singapore) Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc Jaguar Land Rover Holdings Limited Jaguar Land Rover Limited Jaguar Land Rover North America LLC and Jaguar Land Rover Exports LtdNational Sales Companies100% 100% 100% 100% 100%Simplified corporatestructure 25%100% Jaguar Land Rover China (NSC) Chery Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Co.

Complementing this, the Company invests in manufacturing capacity in the United Kingdom and internationally to meet customer demand. Grow the business through new products and market expansion The Company offers products in the premium performance car and all-terrain vehicle segments, and intends to grow the business by diversifying the product range within these segments. For instance, the Range Rover Evoque defined the market segment for smaller, lighter and more \"urban\" off-road vehicles, complementing the more mature Range Rover, Freelander and Discovery markets. Similarly for Jaguar, the 2.2L Diesel XF caters well for a wide customer base, notably including the corporate market segment, and the XF Sportbrake adds a premium estate model to the portfolio. The XJ luxury saloon continues to perform well, and of course the Jaguar F-TYPE, available in both soft top and now coup\u00e9, provides a vivid representation of the confidence and ambition of the brand. As well as the core product family, various options, such as long wheel base, smaller engine and all-wheel drive derivatives, help to strengthen our overall product offering. The Company also has ambitious but robust plans to continue to develop the product range. First will be the Land Rover Discovery Sport available for sale in 2015 and to be the first in a new family of Discovery. Jaguar will follow with the launch of the XE, the eagerly anticipated mid-sized sedan, and in due course a crossover based on the C-X17 concept. The Company will also develop hybrid and long wheelbase derivatives of existing models. Complementing the new products the Company intends to expand its global footprint. First, it will increase its marketing and dealer network in emerging markets. For example, a National Sales Company has been established in China (in 2010) and the network of sales dealerships has been grown to 170 dealerships as at 31 March 2014. Second, the Company is progressing new manufacturing facilities, assembly points and suppliers in selected markets. This includes a manufacturing and assembly joint venture in China with Chery Automobile Company Limited; an assembly facility in India operated by Tata Motors; and a manufacturing facility in Brazil. We also continue to explore further broadening our manufacturing base, including opportunities in Saudi Arabia. The Company also benefits from the relationship with Tata Motors and the synergies achieved in the areas of research and product development, supply sourcing, manufacturing and assembly and other operations.Invest in manufacturing In line with other premium automotive manufacturers the Company maintains a capital spending target of 10-12% of revenue. However, in the near and medium term higher capital spending is anticipated to take advantage of the growth opportunities presented. For the fiscal year ending March 2015 capital spending is expected to be in the region of \u00a33.5-\u00a33.7 billion (split approximately 40% for R&D and 60% for expenditure on tangible fixed assets such as facilities, tools and equipment as well as investment in our China joint venture). Capital spend is primarily funded from operating cash flow, supported by the Company's strong balance sheet and liquidity, and proven access to funding from capital markets and banks. At 31 March 2014, free cash flow after investment was \u00a31,150 million, and total liquidity was \u00a34,796 million, including \u00a31,290 million of long-term undrawn credit facilities (of which \u00a3967 million maturing in July 2018 and \u00a3323 million maturing in July 2016). Invest in R&D, technology and people The Company's strategy is to maintain and improve its competitive position by developing technologically advanced vehicles, particularly with regard to economy and emissions aspects. To this end the Company has enhanced its technological strengths through extensive in-house R&D activities, particularly through two advanced engineering and design centres, which centralise capabilities in product design and engineering. Furthermore, the Company is involved in a number of advanced research consortia that bring together leading manufacturers, suppliers and academic specialists in the UK, supported by funding from the Government's Technology Strategy Board. In September 2013, the Company announced the investment in the National Automotive Innovation Campus at the University of Warwick, UK. This will focus on advanced technology, innovation and research and feature engineering workshops and laboratories, advanced powertrain facilities and advanced design, visualisation and rapid prototyping capabilities. In November 2013, the Company also announced plans to work with Intel to establish a technology research centre in Oregon in the United States to develop next generation vehicle technologies, helping to enhance future vehicle infotainment systems. The Company has also invested in an engine design and manufacturing facility in Wolverhampton, UK with the first of a new family of \"Ingenium\" engines to be launched in 2015. This will play a significant role in powertrain downsizing and increased efficiencies and reduced emissions. Finally, to mention Jaguar's pioneering use of aluminium body architecture, already extended to the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, and a key aspect of future models, combined with the move to common architectures to support the growing product family.North America Rest of the World Asia Pacific China Region24%Europe 19%UK 18% 17%17% 5%170 Dealerships across China JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 82 Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business Management report Governance | Financials in Autumn); holiday periods, including shutdowns (in particular winter and summer holidays in Western Europe); and specific events such as the biannual (March and September) change in registration plates of vehicles in the United Kingdom. The resulting sales profile influences operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The automotive industry also experiences longer-term cyclicality. To mitigate the risk from an industry downturn the Company maintains strong liquidity with significant cash balances and committed financing facilities, it also has a rigorous inventory management process, including pipeline and dealer stock, to ensure changes in the environment are managed quickly and effectively. The Company also manages refinancing risk by operating a robust funding plan. Industry competition The global automotive industry, including the premium passenger car segment, is highly competitive and competition is likely to further intensify in view of the continuing globalisation and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. There is a strong trend among market participants in the premium automotive industry to retain positions in established markets and to develop presence in more profitable and fast-growing emerging markets, such as China, India, Russia, Brazil and other parts of Asia. Such a strategy is typically underpinned by a full product offering, including such factors as: quality and features of vehicles; pricing; reliability; safety; fuel economy; environmental impact and perception thereof, customer service and financing terms. There is a risk that the Company is unable to compete given its relatively small product portfolio, and focus on premium performance cars and SUVs. However, the Company does have a robust business plan in place to deliver its strategy and ambition to develop additional models, each well received by the market. As well as the internal effort to maintain a quality range of products, the Company places emphasis on monitoring markets and competitors to be able to understand and pre-empt external dynamics and remain competitive. Environmental regulations Across its operations, the Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies covering environmental interests such as greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy. Stringent regulation is adopted by the European Union, which passed legislation in April 2009 to regulate vehicle carbon dioxide emissions to fleet average of 130 grams CO 2 per kilometre by 2012 and 95 grams CO2 per kilometre by 2020. Similarly, the European Parliament has adopted standards for emissions of other air pollutants, such as oxides of nitrogen, to be phased in from September 2014 and September 2017, according to regulations Euro 6b and 6c. As comparison, the United States regulates estimated combined average emissions level of 250 grams of BUSINESS RISKS AND MITIGATING FACTORS MACRO AND INDUSTRY RISKS Global economic environment The Company is focused on the premium end of the automotive industry, and can be heavily influenced by general economic conditions around the world. The demand for its vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including, among other things, the growth rate of the global economy, availability of credit, disposable income of consumers, interest rates, environmental policies, tax policies, safety regulations, freight rates and fuel prices. Recent performance has been buoyed by the continued economic recovery in western markets and ongoing expansion of car ownership in emerging markets, particularly China. The Company does however remain vigilant to economic and political developments, notably risks posed by the tapering of monetary stimuli, unexpected fiscal policy changes, and the sustainability of Chinese growth. Accordingly, the Company continues to monitor economic indicators within key markets as well as retail volume trends in order to manage production and vehicle distribution. The Company's product development programme is aimed at ensuring it has the right vehicles available for the right markets at the right price, reflecting different priorities and uses across the globe. Impact of political instability, wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel shortages/prices, epidemics, labour strikes and other risks As the Company increases its global presence, particularly to emerging markets, so too does it increase the associated risk. With a broad geographical footprint it is conceivable that the Company's operations may be subject to political instability, wars and conflicts, terrorism, natural disasters, fuel shortages, epidemics and labour strikes. Also, and particularly in emerging markets, the Company is exposed to general uncertainty in terms of changes, inconsistency and ambiguity in economic and government policies, laws and regulations, including taxation systems, as well as commercial and employment practices and procedures. Any significant or prolonged disruptions or delays in the Company's operations related to these risks could adversely impact its results of operations.The Company is able to mitigate the impact of isolated risks through geographic diversification of sales, and by managing such risks through close monitoring of developments in each country. Seasonality and cyclicality Sales volumes in particular are influenced by the cyclicality and seasonality of demand for these products. Seasonality arises from such factors as: the introduction of new model year vehicles (typically Key to success are the workforce, and the Company continues to be successful in drawing talent from many sources, as well as engaging in a number of collaborations. Transform the business structure to deliver sustainable returns The Company undertakes a variety of internal and external benchmarking exercises, market testing and internal comparative analysis across its own vehicles, which help to identify cost improvement opportunities for components, systems and sub-systems. This includes sharing components across platforms in order to reduce engineering costs and gain economies of scale, particularly as the Company looks to enhance global sourcing and to take advantage of lower-cost bases in countries such as India and China. Continuing quality improvement and customer first The Company recognises the importance of superior vehicle quality and has implemented programmes, both internally and at suppliers' operations, focused on improving the quality of its products, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing future warranty costs. Robust procedures are also in place for ensuring quality control of outsourced components. Products purchased from approved sources undergo a supplier quality improvement process. Assurance of quality is further driven by the design team, which interacts with downstream functions like process planning, manufacturing and supplier management to ensure quality in design processes and manufacturing. Furthermore the extensive sales and service network enables quality and timely customer service. Through close coordination supported by IT systems, it is possible to monitor quality performance in the field and implement corrections on an ongoing basis to minimise any inconvenience to customers. These policies have generated positive results, and in 2011 and 2012 respectively Land Rover and Jaguar were ranked the most improved brands. In the J.D. Power and Associates APEAL Study ranking of nameplates in the United States and the Range Rover scored the highest model score in the 2013 survey.

Previously all elements of foreign exchange gains/(losses) including realised and unrealised foreign exchange hedging and gains/(losses) were excluded from EBITDA and both realised and unrealised commodity gains/(losses) were included within EBITDA.Explanation of Change in EBITDA Methodology JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 84 Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business Management report Governance | Financials CO2 per mile for model years 2012 through 2016, and 243 grams per mile for 2017 to 2025 (equivalent to 151 and 101 grams of CO2 per kilometre respectively), as well as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\"CAFE\") standards for passenger cars of at least 6.75L/100km by 2020. Additionally, California and \"Green States\" Advanced Clean Cars Program promulgate the Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation (driving down state greenhouse gas emissions by the deployment of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle and Battery Electric Vehicle technologies) and the Low Emission Vehicle Regulation 3 (addressing smog and air quality concerns by reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons to the lowest regulated level in the world by 2025). In China, Stage III fuel consumption Regulation drives a national average fuel consumption of 6.9L/100km by 2015 and Stage IV drives a national average Fuel Consumption of 5.0L/100km by 2020. In response to the severe air quality issues seen in Beijing and many major cities, Beijing also intend to adopt the \"most stringent\" emissions standards in the world from 2016, based on either Euro 6 or California LEV3 standards. To comply with current and future environmental norms, the Company may incur additional capital and R&D expenditure to upgrade products and manufacturing facilities, as well as increased running costs related to more sophisticated manufacturing operations. These cost pressures may be compounded by price pressures as various states adopt fuel consumption or CO 2 -based vehicle taxation systems, as well as the threat of falling behind the competition. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to develop commercially viable technologies within the time frames set by the new standards, the Company could face significant civil penalties or be forced to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. To address this risk, the Company is committed to innovation, including substantial investment in: 1) lightweighting - such as the pioneering use of all aluminium construction; 2) powertrain downsizing and efficiency - with the announcement of the all new \"Ingenium\" engine design and manufacturing capability; and 3) electrification technologies with stop/start technology already deployed, hybrid models due out this year, and future plans for plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. Furthermore, the Company has been successful in securing a derogation in EU, permitted given sales volumes, of a 25% reduction from 2007 levels by 2015 and by 45% by 2020, equivalent to 179.8 grams and 132 grams of CO 2 per kilometre respectively. These derogations are based upon the combined Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors fleet. Based on these investments the Company has been able to develop a vehicle cycle plan compliant with all known current and expected future environmental regulations. Exchange and interest rate fluctuations The Company runs significant foreign currency exposures versus the Pound Sterling as its reporting currency. Exposures arise in relation to the Company's sales distribution (notably US Dollar and Chinese Yuan and to a lesser extent Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Russian Rouble, Brazilian Real, South African Rand, and South Korean Won) and also its cost base, with significant sourcing from Euro suppliers. Currency risk can be considered in terms of short term, operating risks, i.e. transaction risk where there may be impact to the income statement from adverse currency movements. In particular, the Company is exposed to a strengthening Pound Sterling since this would diminish the sterling value of overseas sales. This transaction risk is managed at a cash flow level through use of forward and option hedging instruments over a short - to medium-term time horizon, adhering to treasury policy approved by the board. Currency risk can also be considered in terms of longer-term, strategic risks, termed translation and economic risks. In this case the Company may have a structural misalignment in the denomination of costs and revenues which make it subject to longer-term foreign exchange trends, beyond the hedging period. These longer-term risks also present a competitive disadvantage compared to other automotive manufacturers that enjoy a more favourable currency mix. To reduce these longer-term exposures the Company is diversifying its cost base and better aligning with its sales profiles, such as manufacturing in China and Brazil. Furthermore the Company has issued US Dollar debt which serves as a natural hedge to US Dollar denominated sales. The Company is also exposed to changes in interest rates given variable interest bearing assets and liabilities. The Company does issue US Dollar and Pound Sterling denominated fixed coupon debt, held to maturity and reported at historic cost. To better understand and manage both currency and interest rate risk the Company monitors short and longer term economic trends and conducts regular sensitivity analysis to assess potential material impacts on the business. Input prices Prices of commodities used in manufacturing automobiles, including steel, aluminium, copper, rubber, platinum, palladium and rhodium, can be volatile. Further, with the global economy coming out of recession and increasing consumption in the emerging markets, prices of these commodities are likely to be volatile and may rise significantly.In addition, an increased price and supply risk could arise from the supply of rare and frequently sought raw materials for which demand is high, especially those used in vehicle electronics such as rare earths, which are predominantly found in China. In the past, China has limited the export of rare earths from time Quality standards An increasingly sophisticated customer also has high-quality standards. Not only could this lead to higher costs to meet expectations, but also the reputational risk from any perceived or actual reduction in quality which in turn could materially affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. As a premium manufacturer the Company is committed to exacting quality standards and the Company's product design and development process is organised, and coordinated with manufacturing and sales activities, to proactively address any potential risks to achieving a high-quality product. Key markets The Company derives a significant proportion of its revenues from the United Kingdom, Chinese, North American and continental European markets, and accordingly is exposed to any decline in demand in these markets. This risk is mitigated by avoiding an over-reliance on any one market, and the Company has achieved a balanced portfolio of circa 20% revenue from each of China, UK, US and EU markets, and the balance from rest of world. A diversified portfolio will also be maintained going forwards as the Company continues its international expansion, with an increased contribution from high-growth markets such as India, Brazil and Russia. The Company recognises and factors into its planning the risks inherent with increased international operations including cultural differences, resourcing availability, political and legal risks (such as obtaining permits and approvals), as well as financial risks such as tax, exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds. Distribution channels/dealer performance The Company's products are sold and serviced through a network of authorised dealers and service centres across its domestic market, and a network of distributors and local dealers in international markets. Any underperformance by dealers, distributors or service centres could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. The Company monitors the performance of its dealers and distributors and provides them with support to assist them to perform to its expectations. The Company has also launched a customer first initiative in conjunction with the distribution channels. Consumer finance and used car valuations Automotive sales are supported by various financial services groups, who provide dealer and consumer finance. Any reduction in the availability of such finance could impact the affordability of vehicles and therefore impact demand volumes, or price as the Company may have to offer certain incentives to support sales. Further, the Company offers residual value guarantees on the purchase of certain leases in some markets. The value of these guarantees is to time. If the Company is unable to find substitutes for such raw materials or pass price increases on to customers by raising prices, or to safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials, its vehicle production, business and results from operations could be affected. The Company continues to pursue cost reduction, value engineering and such other initiatives to mitigate the risk of increasing input costs and supplements these efforts through the use of fixed price supply contracts with tenors of up to 12 months for energy and commodities wherever possible. To manage commodity price risk, the Company uses fixed price and/or derivative contracts where appropriate. COMPANY SPECIFIC RISKS Strategy and customer demand Over the past few years, the global market for automobiles, particularly in established markets, has been characterised by increasing demand for more environmentally friendly and technologically advanced vehicles. Evolving consumer preferences not only warrant increased costs of marketing, research and development, but fundamentally threaten sales ambition to the extent that the Company's products may no longer be desirable. While this risk is compounded by the Company's relatively niche positioning in premium performance car and all-terrain vehicle segments, it will be mitigated as it realises its growth ambitions and broadens its portfolio with a series of new product launches. Core to the Company's strategy is innovation and investment to develop new products in new and existing segments with new powertrains and technologies to meet customer aspirations and regulatory requirements. The Company considers technological leadership to be a key factor in its success, and continues to devote significant resources to upgrading its capabilities, particularly through its advanced engineering and design centres. The Company is involved in a number of advanced research consortia that bring together leading manufacturers, suppliers and academic specialists in the United Kingdom, supported by funding from the Government's Technology Strategy Board. An example of the development capabilities is Jaguar's aluminium body architecture, which has been extended for use in Land Rover models such as the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. The Company has also made significant investment in aerodynamics and powertrain technologies, including an engine design and manufacturing centre in Wolverhampton, UK, which will produce the first of the \"Ingenium\" family of engines this year. Finally, the Company has recently announced its first hybrid vehicle and also is investing in electric vehicles. Overall the Company is confident that it will continue to offer attractive, competitive products that satisfy regulatory requirements.

Consequently, the Company may be adversely affected by movements in used car valuations. The Company has robust arrangements in place with: Black Horse (part of the Lloyds Bank Group) in the UK, FGA Capital (a joint venture between Fiat Auto and Credit Agricole) in Europe and Chase Auto Finance in the USA for the provision of dealer and consumer financial services products. Jaguar Land Rover has similar arrangements with local auto financial services providers in other key markets. Supply chain The Company relies on third parties for sourcing raw materials, parts and components used in the manufacture of its products. The Company's ability to procure supplies in a cost effective and timely manner or at all is subject to various factors, some of which are not within its control. While the Company manages its supply chain as part of its supplier management process, any significant problems with suppliers or shortages of essential raw materials in the future could have an impact on its operations.Risks of disruption due to man-made or natural disasters, could impact the supply chain. A natural disaster could cause suppliers to halt, delay or reduce production, which could reduce or disrupt the supply of such raw materials, pre-products and vehicle parts and/or an increase in their cost. Any significant interruption in the supply of key inputs could adversely affect the Company's ability to maintain its current and expected levels of production and therefore negatively affect its revenues. In managing a complex supply chain the Company has developed close relationships with both direct and indirect suppliers, and continues to develop long-term strategic relationships with suppliers to support the development of parts, technology and production facilities. The introduction of in-house engine manufacture will enable greater flexibility in demand planning and reduce the reliance upon a single supplier. Manufacturing and engineering The Company could experience disruption to its manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities for a variety of reasons including, extreme weather, fire, theft, system failures, natural calamities, mechanical or equipment failures and similar risks. Any significant disruptions could adversely affect the Company's ability to design, manufacture and sell its products and, if any of those events were to occur, it cannot be certain that it would be able to shift its design, engineering and manufacturing operations to alternative sites in a timely manner or at all. Any such disruption could therefore materially affect business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, there is the risk that manufacturing capacity does not meet, or exceeds, sales demand thereby compromising business performance and without any near term remedy given the time frames and investments required for any change. The Company currently has three manufacturing facilities and two design and engineering centres, all of which are located in the United Kingdom. The Solihull site currently manufactures Land Rover and Range Rover products, except the Freelander and Range Rover Evoque, which are produced in Halewood. The Castle Bromwich site, is used to produce all Jaguar models. It is expected that these sites will become more cross-branded to provide flexibility in line with the adoption of a suite of common architectures across the various products. For example the Solihull site, which has been extended with a new bodyshop and assembly hall, will be able to accommodate multiple models off the all-new aluminium architecture. Also in the UK, the Company is investing in a new engine plant in Wolverhampton in order to develop and build a family of energy-efficient advanced \"Ingenium\" engines. As well as manufacturing flexibility the Company also strives to diversify its manufacturing locations. It currently benefits from third-party facilities overseas that build a number of its vehicles from Complete Knock Down (CKD) kits, such as in India, where the Freelander and XF vehicle kits are assembled by Tata Motors in its Pune facility. Beyond this the Company has invested in a joint venture with Chery, located in China, to manufacture products for the domestic market during FY15. Additionally, the Company has announced that it will build a manufacturing facility in Brazil with production intended in FY17. Finally, a Letter of Intent has been signed with the National Industrial Clusters Development Program (NICDP) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with respect to the set-up of an automotive facility. Risks inherent in these new ventures is being managed from the outset, particularly to ensure strategic alignment with partners, and that robust and appropriate governance and procedure is established. Regulation of production facilities The Company's production facilities are subject to a wide range of environmental emulations, a number of which require a permit or licence to operate. Such regulations address for example emissions to atmosphere, energy use, the consumption and subsequent discharge of water, the handling and disposal of waste, management of refrigerants and the storage and use of fuels. The regulation of emissions associated with energy use has seen some of the most recent environmental regulatory changes. To that end the Company has a Climate Change Agreement covering the production operations, permits under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and is registered as a participant under the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme in the UK.appropriate actions to remedy issues across the fleet, and to manage recalls and minimise warranty claims. The Company also develops dealer technical updates to provide awareness of known vehicle faults, which is in line with general industry practices. Operational risks, including information technology Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This includes, among other things, losses that are caused by a lack of controls within internal procedures, violation of internal policies by employees, disruption or malfunction of IT systems, computer networks and telecommunications systems, mechanical or equipment failures, human error, natural disasters or malicious acts by third parties. Like any other business with complex manufacturing, research, procurement, sales and marketing and financing operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of operational risks and, if the protection measures put in place prove insufficient, results of operations and financial conditions can be materially affected. To mitigate these operating risks the Company has implemented a robust control framework, including policy, process and system controls, delegation of authorities, governance and assurance. A comprehensive disaster recovery plan is in place, including back-up systems. The control environment is monitored by the Company's Internal Audit function and is Sarbanes Oxley (S-Ox) compliant. Patent protection and intellectual property Although the Company does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, its inability to protect this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some or a large group of its intellectual property rights, would have a materially adverse effect on operations, business and/or financial condition. The Company owns or otherwise has rights in respect of a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products that it manufactures, which have been obtained over a period of years. In connection with the design and engineering of new vehicles and the enhancement of existing models, the Company seeks to regularly develop new technical designs for use in its vehicles. It also uses technical designs which are the intellectual property of third parties with such third parties' consent. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of the Company's business and may continue to be in the future. The Company may be affected by restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights held by third-parties' and so may be held legally liable for the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in its products. Some of the Jaguar Land Rover sites are in locations subject to former industrial activity. Where contaminants are identified that require treatment strategies are developed to manage the issue. The Company may take financial responsibility for the improvements necessary even where the contamination was as a result of operations prior to its occupation. More stringent and wider reaching environmental regulation can result in increased costs to: (i) operate and maintain production facilities, (ii) install new emission controls, (iii) trade or purchase allowances associated with emissions from energy use, (iv) administer and manage greenhouse gas emissions operations. The Company may also be exposed to risk and cost of non-compliance. To mitigate the risk the Company is committed to maintaining the highest operating standards to ensure compliance with current and future environmental regulation. The Company also keeps abreast of regulatory developments so as to manage proactively. This is evidenced in the continued certification to the international standard for environmental management systems ISO 14001. Additionally, in 2013 the Company was awarded the prestigious Business in the Community (BITC) Responsible Business of the Year. Recognising, among others, the Company's investments in environmental performance of cars, facilities and logistics, Jaguar Land Rover is the UK's first-ever manufacturing Company to win the UK's most highly regarded CSR award. Product liability, warranties and recalls The Company is subject to risks and costs associated with product liability, warranties and recalls in connection with performance, compliance or safety-related issues affecting its products. In addition, product recalls can cause the Company's consumers to question the safety or reliability of its vehicles and harm reputation and hence impact demand. Furthermore, the Company may also be subject to class actions or other large-scale product liability or other lawsuits. The use of shared components in vehicle production increases this risk because individual components are deployed in a number of different models across the Company's brands. Any costs incurred or lost sales caused by product liability, warranties and recalls could materially adversely affect business. To mitigate this risk the Company does not compromise high-quality standards. It also monitors its warranty performance very closely and ensures that any issues that do arise are fully and timely addressed, including appropriate actions to manage faults and recalls. The Company constantly monitors vehicles in service through regular data feeds from dealerships globally in order to identify trends and customer satisfaction. This helps the Company to put in place JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business Management report Governance | Financials88 Credit and liquidity risks The Company's main sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and external debt, including term debt, committed revolving credit facilities, and various other factoring and working capital facilities. Historically the Company has also received financial support in the form of loans and preference shares from the Company's parent, Tata Motors Ltd. Adverse changes in the global economic and financial environment may result in lower consumer demand for vehicles, and prevailing conditions in credit markets may adversely affect both consumer demand and the cost and availability of finance for the Company's business and operations. If the global economy goes back into recession and consumer demand drops, at the same time as the supply of external financing becomes limited, the Company may again face significant liquidity risks. As at 31 March 2014, on a consolidated level, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32,260 million and short-term deposits of between 3-12 months' duration of \u00a31,199 million as well as undrawn committed facilities of \u00a31,337 million. The Company generally pools cash from its subsidiaries to Jaguar Land Rover Limited, the primary operating Company in the Group, until such time as the cash is used for dividends. Good progress has been made to reduce local cash balances, which as at 31 March 2014 amount to \u00a3536 million. All cash is invested according to strict credit criteria and actively monitored by Group Treasury. Labour relations The Company employed an average of 27,953 staff across its operations. There is the risk that the Company may face labour unrest, at its own facilities or those of its suppliers, which may delay or disrupt operations in the affected regions, including the sourcing of raw materials and parts, the manufacture, sales and distribution of vehicles and the provision of services. If work stoppages or lock-outs at the Company's facilities or at the facilities of major suppliers occur or continue for a long period of time, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected. To reduce the likelihood of any such action, the Company manages union relations with proactive consultation and maintains good labour relations with its employees. Key personnel The Company believes that its growth and future success depend in large part on the skills of its workforce, including executives and officers, designers and engineers. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could impair the Company's ability to continue to implement its business strategy. The Company's success also depends, in part, on its continued ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees, particularly qualified engineers with expertise in automotive design and production. The competition for such employees is intense, and the Company's inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate employees could adversely affect its business and plans to invest in the development of new designs and products. The Company's Human Resources function has developed policies and procedures to ensure that it remains competitive in the labour market, both in terms of attracting and retaining key personnel, and also to ensure that the business growth ambition can be effectively resourced across all its facilities. Pension obligations The Company provides post-retirement and pension benefits to employees, some of which are defined benefit plans. The Company's pension liabilities are generally funded and the defined benefit pension plans' assets are particularly significant. As part of the Company's Strategic Business Review process, the Company closed the Jaguar and Land Rover defined benefit pension plans to new joiners from 19 April 2010. All new employees since that date have joined a new defined contribution pension plan. Under the arrangements with the trustees of the defined benefit pension schemes, an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the schemes is undertaken every three years. The most recent valuation, as at April 2012 and completed in 2013, indicated a shortfall in the assets of the schemes as at April 2012, versus the actuarially determined liabilities as at April 2012, of \u00a3702 million. As part of the valuation process the Company agreed a schedule of contributions which, together with the expected investment performance of the assets of the schemes, is expected to eliminate the deficit by 2022. This included an incremental deficit contribution of \u00a3100 million made in March 2013. The Company also reached agreement with the trustees to cancel security arrangements in favour of the pension fund trustees agreed in prior valuation as of April 2009. This security was released in March 2013. In March 2014 an advanced payment of \u00a3100 million was made to the defined benefit pension arrangements. The next actuarial valuation will be as at April 2015 and would be expected to be completed during 2016. The Company monitors the asset allocation of the plans and considers investment performance against expectations regularly. The trustee employs a reputable investment consultant to advise them on the plans' asset allocation with a view to meeting their return objectives with the minimum level of risk. The Company proactively develops approaches, in tandem with the Trustee, to manage the asset-liability risks it faces although lower returns on pension fund assets, changes in market conditions, changes in interest rates, changes in inflation rates and adverse changes in other critical actuarial assumptions, may impact the Company's pension liabilities or assets and consequently increase funding requirements, which in future could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage The Company maintains insurance coverage for people, property and assets, including construction and general, auto and product liability, in accordance with treasury policy. Nevertheless there is the risk that claims made under any policy may not be satisfied fully or timely. There is also the risk that insurance coverage could be insufficient to fully reimburse the Company for all losses arising for any particular incident or that insurance premiums could increase substantially. To reduce the risk of adverse financial impact the Company only places insurance with counterparties of good standing and credit, and ensures competitive pricing through periodic competitive tendering/negotiation. The Company also periodically conducts risk assessment and asset valuation exercises. Corporate governance and public disclosure The Company is affected by the corporate governance and disclosure requirements of the Company's own listing on the Euro MTF market and also of its parent, Tata Motors Limited, which is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India and the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\"). Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC regulations, Securities and Exchange Board of India (the \"SEBI\") regulations, the NYSE listing rules and Indian stock market listing regulations, have increased the compliance complexity for the parent company and, indirectly, for the Company. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. However, the efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses. In addition, there is the risk of non-compliance and the penalties that may ensue. Ownership structure The Company is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited through TML Holdings PTE. Limited (Singapore) and accordingly is under the ultimate control and influence of its parent, as per the delegation of authorities and including the election of Directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and the parent Company's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.

In December 2012 the Company name was changed from Jaguar Land Rover plc to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc. The Company is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and has its registered office at Whitley, Coventry, England. The Company is a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited, India (\"TATA Motors\") and acts as an intermediate holding Company for the Jaguar Land Rover business. The principal activity during the year was the design, development, manufacture and marketing of high-performance luxury saloons, specialist sports cars and four wheel drive off-road vehicles. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in GBP and rounded to the nearest million GBP (\u00a3 million) unless otherwise stated. Results for the year ending and as at 31 March 2012 have been disclosed solely for the information of the users. 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (referred to as \"IFRS\") as adopted by the European Union. There is no difference between these accounts and the accounts for the Group prepared under IFRS as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). The Company has applied s.408 of the Companies Act 2006 and therefore the separate financial statements of the Company do not include the income statement or the statement of comprehensive income of the Company on a stand-alone basis.BASIS OF PREPARATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. GOING CONCERN The Directors have considered the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2014 (net assets of \u00a35,864 million (2013: \u00a33,539 million, 2012: \u00a32,924 million)) and the projected cash flows and financial performance of the Group for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements as well as planned cost and cash improvement actions, and believe that the plan for sustained profitability remains on course. The Directors have taken actions to ensure that appropriate long-term cash resources are in place at the date of signing the accounts to fund Group operations. The Directors have reviewed the financial covenants linked to the borrowings in place and believe these will not be breached at any point and that all debt repayments will be met. Therefore the Directors consider, after making appropriate enquiries and taking into consideration the risks and uncertainties facing the Group, that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for the foreseeable future and is able to meet its financial covenants linked to the borrowings in place. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION SubsidiariesThe consolidated financial statements include Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has power over the investee, is exposed or has rights to variable Notes to the consolidated financial statements return from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. All subsidiaries of the Company given in note 39 are included in the consolidated financial statements. Inter-Company transactions and balances including unrealised profits are eliminated in full on consolidation. Associates and joint ventures (equity accounted investees) Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee and is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for decisions about the relevant activities of the entity, being those activities that significantly affect the entity's returns. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Group's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the income and expenses, other comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. When the Group transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in its associate or joint venture.USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of accounting policies and thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets andliabilities at the date of these consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements inapplying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in theconsolidated financial statements are included in the following notes: (i) Note 15 - Property, plant and equipment - the Group applies judgement in determining the estimate useful life of assets. (ii) Note 16 - Intangible assets - management applies significant judgement in establishing the applicable criteria for capitalisation of appropriate product development costs and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets. The key inputs to this assessment include the determination of Cash Generating Units, value of cash flows and appropriateness of discount rates. (iii) Note 18 - Deferred tax - management applies judgement in establishing the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to historic losses and assessing its recoverability and estimating taxes ultimately payable on remittance of overseas earnings.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 110 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (iv) Note 25 - Provision for product warranty - it is necessary for the Group to assess the provision for anticipated lifetime warranty and campaign costs. The valuation of warranty and campaign provisions requires a significant amount of judgement and the requirement to form appropriate assumptions around expected future costs. (v) Note 30 - Retirement benefit obligation - it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, including discount and mortality rates and the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets. The Group engages a qualified actuary to assist with determining the assumptions to be made when evaluating these liabilities. (vi) Note 33 - Financial instruments - the Group enters into complex financial instruments and therefore appropriate accounting for these requires judgement around the valuations. Embedded derivatives relating to prepayment options on senior notes are not considered as closely related and are separately accounted unless the exercise price of these options is approximately equal on each exercise date to the amortised cost of the senior notes. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is measured at fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sale of products The Group recognises revenues on the sale of products, net of discounts, sales incentives, customer bonuses and rebates granted, when products are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when title and risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. Sale of products is presented net of excise duty where applicable and other indirect taxes. Revenues are recognised when collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. If the sale of products includes a determinable amount for subsequent services (multiple - component contracts), the related revenues are deferred and recognised as income over the relevant service period. Amounts are normally recognised as income by reference to pattern of related expenditure. COST RECOGNITION Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and are classified according to their nature. Expenditures are capitalised where appropriate in accordance with the policy for internally generatedintangible assets and represent employee costs, stores and other manufacturing supplies, and other expenses incurred for product development undertaken by the Group. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments withan original maturity of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash andwhich are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. PROVISIONS A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructiveobligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Provisions are held for product warranties, legal and product liabilities, residual risks and environmental risks as detailed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. The most significant is product warranty. PRODUCT WARRANTY The Group offers warranty cover in respect of manufacturing defects, which become apparent within one to five years after purchase, dependent on the market in which the purchase occurred. The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidences based on actions on product failures. The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability, such as inflation, are included in the base calculation. The timing of outflows will vary as and when a warranty claim will arise, being typically up to five years. FOREIGN CURRENCY The Company has a functional currency of GBP. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is GBP. The functional currency of the UK and non- UK selling operations is GBP being the primary economic environment that influences these operations. This is on the basis that management control is in the UK and that GBP is the currency that primarily determines sales prices and is the main currency for the retention of operating income. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement except, when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective taxable income of each taxable entity and tax rules applicable for respective tax jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporarydifferences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, andunutilised business loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity and for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of raw materials andconsumables are ascertained on a first-in first-out basis. Costs, including fixed and variable productionoverheads, are allocated to work-in-progress and finished goods determined on a full absorption costbasis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of completion and selling expenses.Class of property, plant and equipmentEstimated useful life (years) Buildings 20-40 Plant and equipment 3-30 Computers 3-6 Vehicles 3-10 Furniture and fixtures 3-20Inventories include vehicles sold subject to repurchase arrangements. These vehicles are carried at cost to the Group and are amortised in changes in stocks and work in progress to their residual values (i.e. estimated second hand sale value) over the term of the arrangement. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulateddepreciation less accumulated impairment, if any. Freehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated. Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. Interest cost incurred for constructed assets is capitalised up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease. Depreciation is not recorded on assets under construction until construction and installation is complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Assets under construction includes capital prepayments. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Acquired intangible assetsIntangible assets purchased including those acquired in business combination, are measured at cost or fair value as of the date of acquisition, where applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite-life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 112 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) For intangible assets with definite lives, amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets as per details below: Class of intangible assetEstimated amortisation period (years) Patents and technological know-how2-12 Customer related - dealer network20 Software 2-8 Intellectual property rights and other intangiblesIndefinite life The amortisation for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at each year-end.Changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Capital-work-in-progress includes capital advances. Customer-related intangibles acquired in a business combination consist of order backlogs and dealer networks. Intellectual property rights and other intangibles consists of brand names, which are considered to have indefinite lives due to the longevity of the brands. Internally generated intangible assets Research costs are charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Product development costs incurred on new vehicle platforms, engines, transmission and new products are recognised as intangible assets, when feasibility has been established, the Group has committed technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and it is probable that asset will generate probable future economic benefits. The costs capitalised include the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overhead expenditure incurred up to the date the asset is available for use. Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all otherborrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset. Product development cost is amortised over a period of between 2 and 10 years. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss.IMPAIRMENT Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assetsAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be impaired. If any such impairment indicator exists the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or earlier, if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Equity accounted investees: joint ventures and associates The requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are applied todetermine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Group'sinvestment in an associate or joint venture. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases. GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND INCENTIVES Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the relevant conditions and the grant will be received. Government grants are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis when the Group recognises, as expenses, the related costs that the grants are intended to compensate. Government grants related to assets are deducted from the cost of the asset and amortised over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure and Government grants which are awarded as incentives with no ongoing performance obligations to the Group are recognised as other income in the period the grant is received. Sales tax incentives received from Governments are recognised in the income statement at the reduced tax rate and revenue is reported net of these sales tax incentives. LEASES At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement. Assets taken on finance lease A finance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each year during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets taken on operating lease Leases other than finance leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension plansThe Group operates several defined benefit pension plans, which are contracted out of the second statepension scheme. The assets of the plans are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The plansprovide for monthly pension after retirement as per salary drawn and service year as set out in the rulesof each plan. Contributions to the plans by the Group take into consideration the results of actuarial valuations. Theplans with a surplus position at the balance sheet date have been limited to the maximum economicbenefit available from unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future contributions. Where the subsidiary Group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting value of the liabilities, an onerous obligation is recognised. The UK defined benefit schemes were closed to new joiners in April 2010. A separate defined contribution plan is available to new employees of JLR. Costs in respect of this plan are charged to the income statement as incurred. For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past service cost, including curtailment gains and losses, is generally recognised in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements; net interest cost; and remeasurement. The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs within Employee costs in its consolidated income statement (see note 5). Net interest cost is recognised within finance costs (see note 10). Post-retirement Medicare scheme Under this unfunded scheme, employees of some subsidiaries receive medical benefits subject to certain limits of amount, periods after retirement and types of benefits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Group as part of an Early Separation Scheme on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The applicable subsidiaries account for the liability for the post-retirement medical scheme based on an annual actuarial valuation. Actuarial gains and losses Actuarial gains and losses relating to retirement benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses relating to long-term employee benefits are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they arise. Measurement date The measurement date of retirement plans is 31 March.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 114 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) The Group operates an LTIP arrangement for certain employees. The scheme provides a cash payment to the employee based on a specific number of phantom shares at grant date and the share price of Tata Motors Limited at the vesting date, subject to profitability and employment conditions. These are accounted for as cash settled arrangements, whereby a liability is recognised at fair value at the date of grant, using a Black Scholes model. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Classification, initial recognition and measurementA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets are classified into categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities. Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Initially, a financial instrument is recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract, unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied, are classified into this category. Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement. Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed ordeterminable payments that are not quoted in an active market and which are not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or financial assets available for sale. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. These include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, finance receivables and other financial assets. Available-for-sale financial assets : Available- for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such upon initial recognition or are not classified in any of the other financial assets categories. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income taxes. The Group does not hold any available-for-sale financial assets. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, are measured at cost. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Group afterdeducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceedsreceived, net of direct issue costs. Other financial liabilities These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Determination of fair value Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method and other valuation models. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilitiesThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is when the obligation isdischarged, cancelled or has expired. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement. Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financialasset, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, or a Group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. Loans and receivables : Objective evidence of impairment includes default in payments with respect to amounts receivable from customers. Impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Such impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent year, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Equity investments : Impairment loss on equity investments carried at cost is recognised in theconsolidated income statement and is not reversed. Hedge accounting The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Group designates these forward contracts and options in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. These forward contracts and options are stated at fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fairvalue of these forward contracts and options that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income (net of tax), and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs. For options, the time value is not considered part of the hedge, and this is treated as an ineffective hedge portion and recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement for the year. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In the current year, the Group adopted/early adopted the following standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements was amended in June 2011 to revise the way othercomprehensive income is presented. In particular, it requires entities to Group items presented in othercomprehensive income based on whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently and requires tax associated with items presented before tax to be shown separately for each of the two Groups of other comprehensive income items. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012, with early adoption permitted. The amendments have been applied retrospectively and hence the presentation of items of other comprehensive income has been modified to reflect the changes. Other than the above-mentioned presentation changes, the application of the amendments to IAS 1 did not result in any impact on profit or loss, other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income. IAS 19 Employee benefits (2011) was amended in June 2011 to include revised requirements forpensions and other post-retirement benefits, termination benefits and other changes. The keyamendments include: requiring the recognition of changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset)including immediate recognition of defined benefit cost, disaggregation of defined benefit cost intocomponents, recognition of remeasurements in other comprehensive income, plan amendments,curtailments and settlements (eliminating the \"corridor approach\" permitted by the existing IAS 19); introducing enhanced disclosures about defined benefit plans; modifying accounting for termination benefits, including distinguishing benefits provided in exchange for service and benefits provided in exchange for the termination of employment and affect the recognition and measurement of termination benefits; clarifying various miscellaneous issues, including the classification of employee benefits, current estimates of mortality rates, tax and administration costs and risk-sharing and conditional indexation features; Incorporating other matters submitted to the IFRS Interpretations Committee. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early application permitted.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 116 An amendment to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) was issued in May 2011. This now only deals with the requirements for separate financial statements, which have been carried over largely unchanged from IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements . Requirements for consolidated financial statements are now contained in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The standard requires that when an entity prepares separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associates, and jointly controlled entities are accounted for either at cost, or in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments . The standard also deals with the recognition of dividends, certain Group reorganisations and includes a number of disclosure requirements. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early application permitted. IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) was issued in May 2011. This standard supersedes IAS 28 Investments in Associates and prescribes the accounting for investments in associates and sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. The standard defines \"significant influence\" and provides guidance on how the equity method of accounting is to be applied (including exemptions from applying the equity method in some cases). It also prescribes how investments in associates and joint ventures should be tested for impairment. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets was amended in May 2013 to reduce the circumstances in which therecoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is required to be disclosed, clarify the disclosures required, and to introduce an explicit requirement to disclose the discount rate used in determining impairment (or reversals) where recoverable amount (based on fair value less costs of disposal) is determined using a present value technique. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 7 Financial Instruments : Disclosures was amended in December 2011 to require information about all recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to be disclosed. The amendments also require disclosure of information about recognised financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements even if they are not set off under IAS 32. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early application permitted. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. Under IFRS 10, control is the single basis for consolidation, irrespective of the nature of the investee; this standard therefore eliminates the risks-and-rewards approach that was used for certain special purpose entities. IFRS 10 identifies the three elements of control as power over the investee, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. An investor must possess all three elements to conclude that it controls an investee. The assessment of control is based on all facts and circumstances, and the conclusion is reassessed if there are changes to at least one of the three elements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Group has reviewed its control assessments for its investees in accordance with IFRS 10 and determined that the adoption of IFRS 10 did not result in any change in the consolidation status of any of its subsidiaries and investees held during the period or comparative periods covered by these financial statements. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements , issued in May 2011 and amended in June 2012 for transition guidance, classifies joint arrangements as either joint operations (combining the existing concepts of jointly controlled assets and jointly controlled operations) or joint ventures (equivalent to the existing concept of a jointly controlled entity). A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. IFRS 11 requires the use of the equity method of accounting for interests in joint ventures thereby eliminating the proportionate consolidation method. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities applies to entities that have an interest in a subsidiary, a joint arrangement, an associate or an unconsolidated structured entity. The standard, issued in May 2011 and amended in June 2012 for transition guidance, requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities; and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines \"fair value\" and sets out in a single standard a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) As at 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2013 2012 Impact on the consolidated income statement Increase in employee cost (1) (28) Decrease in income tax expense - 7 Decrease in profit for the year (1) (21) Impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeDecrease in remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 1 28 Decrease in income tax related to items that will not be reclassified - (7) Increase in total other comprehensive income net of tax 1 21It seeks to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures through a fair value hierarchy. IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is applicable prospectively from the beginning of the annual period in which the standard is adopted. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. In addition, as part of the IASB's Annual Improvements, a number of minor amendments have been made to standards in the 2009-2011 cycle. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early application permitted. Of the above standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations, only the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011) has had an impact on the results of the Group. However, this does not impact the net assets or total comprehensive income of the Group in any period. The adjustment is for an element of the defined benefit cost being transferred between other comprehensive income and profit or loss. The comparatives included in these financial statements have been restated on a retrospective basis for the impact of the adoption of the revised IAS 19. The impact of the retrospective restatement for IAS 19 on the components of total comprehensive income is as follows: In addition to the above restatement, the adoption of IAS 1, IAS 19, IFRS 7, IFRS 12 and IFRS 13 has resulted in changes to the presentation and disclosure included in the financial statements. The adoption of the other standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations in the current year has not had any impact on the financial statements. The following pronouncements, issued by the IASB, are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Group. The Group is evaluating the impact of these pronouncements on the consolidated financial statements: In October 2012, amendments were made to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, IFRS 10Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities to: provide\"investment entities\" an exemption from the consolidation of particular subsidiaries and instead require that an investment entity measure the investment in each eligible subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments or IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement; require additional disclosure about why the entity is considered an investment entity, details of the entity's unconsolidated subsidiaries, and the nature of relationship and certain transactions between the investment entity and its subsidiaries; and require an investment entity to account for its investment in a relevant subsidiary in the same way in its consolidated and separate financial statements. These amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation was amended in December 2011 to clarify certain aspects because of diversity in application of the requirements on offsetting. The amendments focused on four main areas: the meaning of \"currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off\"; the application of simultaneous realisation and settlement; the offsetting of collateral amounts; and the unit of account for applying the offsetting requirements. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement was amended in June 2013 to make it clear that there is no need to discontinue hedge accounting if a hedging derivative is novated, provided certain criteria are met. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers was issued in May 2014. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. It supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with early adoption permitted.

IAS 38 introduces a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortising intangible assets. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. IFRS11 Joint Arrangements addresses how a joint operator should account for the interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. The following pronouncements, issued by the IASB, have not yet been endorsed by the EU, are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Company. The Company is evaluating the impact of these pronouncements on the consolidated financial statements: In November 2013, IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended to clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, in that contributions can, but are not required, to be recognised as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009) was issued by IASB in November 2009 as the first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety. This new standard introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets, requiring certain debt instruments to be measured at amortised cost, allowing certain equity instruments to be designated as fair value through other comprehensive income and requiring all other instruments to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. In October 2010, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) was issued, incorporating revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities, and carrying over the existing derecognition requirements from IAS 39. In November 2013, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Hedge Accounting and amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39) (2013) was issued. This revised standard introduces a new chapter on hedge accounting and permits any entity to apply only the requirements introduced in IFRS 9 (2010) for the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss without applying the other requirements of IFRS 9. It also removes the mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 (2013), IFRS 9 (2010) and IFRS 9 (2009), leaving the effective date open pending the finalisation of the impairment and classification and measurement requirements. Notwithstanding the removal of an effective date, each standard remains available for application. At its November 2013 meeting, the IASB tentatively decided that the mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 will be no earlier than annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRIC 21 Levies was issued in May 2013 to provide guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government, both for levies that are accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and those where the timing and amount of the levy is certain. The interpretation identifies the obligating event for the recognition of a liability as the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. In addition, as part of the IASB's Annual Improvements, a number of minor amendments have been made to standards in the 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 cycles. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, with early application permitted.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 120 8 OTHER EXPENSES 9 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT During the year legislation was enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) on qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013, instead of the existing super-deduction rules. As a result of this election \u00a345 million of the RDEC, the proportion relating to capitalised product development expenditure, has been of fset against the cost of the respective assets. The remaining \u00a318 million of the RDEC has been recognised as other income.Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Stores, spare parts and tools 114 81 57 Freight cost 610 437 342 Works, operations and other costs 1,538 1,303 1,075 Repairs 17 11 11 Power and fuel 62 57 49 Rent, rates and other taxes 41 33 27 Insurance 19 16 19 Warranty 541 462 372 Publicity 775 675 577 Total other expenses 3,717 3,075 2,529 Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Total research and development costs incurred 1,266 1,058 900 Research and development expensed (236) (198) (149) Development costs capitalised 1,030 860 751 Interest capitalised 102 110 74 Research and development expenditure credit (45) - - Total internally developed intangible additions 1,087 970 825 10 FINANCE INCOME AND EXPENSE Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Finance income 38 34 16 Total finance income 38 34 16 Total interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (257) (176) (166) Unwind of discount on provisions 6 1 7 Interest capitalised 113 110 74 Total interest expense (138) (65) (85) Embedded derivative value (47) 47 - Total finance expense (net) (185) (18) (85) The capitalisation rate used to calculate borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 7.2% (2013: 8.0%, 2012: 7.9%). During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group repaid two tranches of debt (see note 23) and as a result a redemption premium of \u00a356 million was incurred and the fair value of the embedded derivatives was expensed in full. 6 DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS 7 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)Year ended 31 2014 2013 2012 Directors' emoluments 3,059,210 2,097,405 7,875,898 The aggregate of emoluments and amounts receivable under the long-term incentive plan (L TIP) of the highest paid Director was \u00a32,433,578 (2013: \u00a31,905,298, 2012: \u00a32,739,517). In addition, for the pension benefits of \u00a3524,000 (2013: \u00a3836,000, 2012: \u00a3836,000) have been accrued and cumulatively are subject to remuneration committee approval. During the year , the highest paid director did not receive any LTIP awards. No Directors received any LTIP cash payments during the years ended 31 March 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Group operates a LTIP arrangement for certain employees. The scheme provides a cash payment to the employee based on a specific number of phantom shares at grant date and the share price of Tata Motors Limited at the vesting date. The cash payment is dependent on the achievement of internal profitability targets over the three-year vesting period and continued employment at the end of the vesting period. The cash payment has no exercise price and therefore the weighted average exercise price in all cases is \u00a3nil. During the year ended 31 March 2012, following the granting and vesting of the awards in the table above, Tata Motors Limited performed a 5:1 share split. The actual number of phantom stock awards outstanding at 31 March 2012 was therefore 2,934,435. The weighted average share price of the 778,599 phantom stock awards vesting in the year was \u00a34.45 (2013: \u00a34.18, 2012: \u00a312.75). The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding awards is 1.3 years (2013: 1.5 years, 2012: 1.6 years).The amount charged in the year in relation to the long term incentive plan was \u00a31 1 million (2013: \u00a35 million, 2012: \u00a34 million). The fair value of the balance sheet liability in respect of phantom stock awards outstanding at the year end was \u00a317 million (2013: \u00a310 million, 2012: \u00a36 million). The fair value of the awards was calculated using a Black Scholes model at the grant date.

The intellectual property rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life on the basis of the expected longevity of the brand names. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has been calculated with reference to its value in use. The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below: The growth rates used in the value in use calculation reflect those inherent within the Board' s business plan which is primarily a function of the Group's cycle plan assumptions, past performance and management's expectation of future market developments, approved by the Board through to 2018/9. The cash flows are then extrapolated into perpetuity assuming a zero growth rate. No reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount calculated above to be less than the carrying value of the assets of the cash-generating unit.As at 31 March 2014 2013 2012 Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years 5 years 4 years Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 0% 0% 0% Pre-tax discount rate 10.9% 10.2% 10.8% 17 OTHER ASSETS As at 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Current Recoverable VAT 237 378 409 Prepaid expenses 70 56 48 Other 48 - - Total current other assets 355 434 457 Non-current Prepaid expenses 31 5 9 Other 2 3 2 Total non-current other assets 33 8 1116 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (\u00a3 millions) Software Patents & technological know-howCustomer relatedIntellectual property rights & other intangiblesProduct development in progressCapitalised product developmentTotal Cost Balance at 1 April 2011 121 147 89 618 947 499 2,421 Other additions - externally purchased 63 - - - - - 63 Other additions - internally developed - - - - 825 - 825 Capitalised product development - internally developed - - - - (480) 480 - Disposals (1) - - - - - (1) Balance at 31 March 2012 183 147 89 618 1,292 979 3,308 Other additions - externally purchased 99 - - - - - 99 Other additions - internally developed - - - - 970 - 970 Capitalised product development - internally developed - - - - (999) 999 - Disposals (35) - - - - - (35) Balance at 31 March 2013 247 147 89 618 1,263 1,978 4,342 Other additions - externally purchased 127 - - - - - 127 Other additions - internally developed - - - - 1,087 - 1,087 Capitalised product development - internally developed - - - - (583) 583 - Disposals (3) - - - - (146) (149) Reclassification to tangible assets (8) - - - - - (8) Balance at 31 March 2014 363 147 89 618 1,767 2,415 5,399 Amortisation and impairment Balance at 1 April 2011 43 42 37 - - 155 277 Amortisation for the year 33 12 3 - - 183 231 Disposals (1) - - - - - (1) Balance at 31 March 2012 75 54 40 - - 338 507 Amortisation for the year 33 16 3 - - 296 348 Disposals (35) - - - - - (35) Balance at 31 March 2013 73 70 43 - - 634 820 Amortisation for the year 26 15 3 - - 445 489 Disposals (3) - - - - (146) (149) Reclassification to tangible assets (1) - - - - - (1) Balance at 31 March 2014 95 85 46 - - 933 1,159 Net book value At 31 March 2012 108 93 49 618 1,292 641 2,801 At 31 March 2013 174 77 46 618 1,263 1,344 3,522 At 31 March 2014 268 62 43 618 1,767 1,482 4,240Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 130 Significant components of deferred tax asset and liability for the year ended 31 March 2013 are as follows: * Included within \u00a321 million is a reversal of \u00a339 million relating to withholding tax incurred on inter-company dividends paid in the year . ** For balance sheet presentation purposes, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are of fset to the extent they relate to the same taxation authority and are expected to be settled on a net basis.

The provision primarily relates to motor accident claims, consumer complaints, dealer terminations, employment cases and personal injury claims. RESIDUAL RISK PROVISION In certain markets, the Group is responsible for the residual risk arising on vehicles sold by dealers on a leasing arrangement. The provision is based on the latest available market expectations of future residual value trends that may change over time. The timing of the outflows will be at the end of the lease arrangements - being typically up to three years. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PROVISION This provision relates to various environmental remediation costs such as asbestos removal and land clean up. The timing of when these costs will be incurred is not known with certainty.25 PROVISIONS Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Current Product warranty 343 317 261 Legal and product liability 49 16 16 Provisions for residual risk 2 2 2 Other employee benefits obligations 1 - - Total current provisions 395 335 279 Non-current Other employee benefits obligations 10 7 2 Product warranty 538 426 308 Provision for residual risk 13 13 14 Provision for environmental liability 21 22 20 Total non-current provisions 582 468 344 Product warranty Opening balance 743 569 503 Provision made during the year 541 462 372 Provision used during the year (397) (284) (298) Impact of discounting (6) (1) (7) Foreign currency translation - (3) (1) Closing balance 881 743 569 Legal and product liability Opening balance 16 16 19 Provision made during the year 41 6 17 Provision used during the year (5) (7) (20) Foreign currency translation (3) 1 - Closing balance 49 16 16 Residual risk Opening balance 15 16 7 Provision made during the year 2 - 9 Provision used during the year - (1) - Foreign currency translation (2) - - Closing balance 15 15 16 Environmental liability Opening balance 22 20 18 Provision made during the year - 3 3 Provision used during the year (1) (1) (1) Closing balance 21 22 20 PRODUCT WARRANTY PROVISION The Group offers warranty cover in respect of manufacturing defects, which become apparent within one to five years after purchase, dependent on the market in which the purchase occurred. The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidences based on actions on product failures. The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability, such as inflation, are included in the base calculation. The timing of outflows will vary as and when a warranty claim will arise, being typically up to five years.Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 138 29 DIVIDENDS 30 EMPLOYEE BENEFITSYear ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Dividend proposed for the previous year paid during the year of \u00a30.10 (2013: \u00a3nil, 2012: \u00a3nil) per ordinary share 150 - - Dividend for the year paid during the year of \u00a3nil (2013: \u00a30.10, 2012: \u00a3nil) per ordinary share - 150 - Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders during the year 150 150 - Proposed dividend for the year of \u00a30.10 (2013: \u00a30.10, 2012: \u00a3nil) per ordinary share 150 150 - The proposed dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 was paid in full in June 2014.

The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of certain of its subsidiaries. The defined benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company . The trustees of the pension schemes are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the schemes and all other governance matters. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the plan's regulations. Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to post-retirement benefits based on their length of service and salary . Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform these corporate bonds, this will create a deficit. The defined benefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. As the plans mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Group's long-term strategy to manage the plans efficiently. Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments. Inflation risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against extreme inflation). The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging instruments and also assets which are more loosely correlated with inflation. However an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit to some degree. Life expectancy The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.28 OTHER RESERVES The movement of other reserves is as follows: (\u00a3 millions) Translation reserve Hedging reserve Retained earnings Total reserves Balance at 1 April 2013 (383) (196) 2,450 1,871 Profit for the year - - 1,879 1,879 Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation - - (135) (135) Gain on effective cash flow hedges - 1,041 - 1,041 Income tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income - (220) (4) (224) Cash flow hedges reclassified to foreign exchange in profit or loss - (112) - (112) Income tax related to items reclassified to profit or loss - 26 - 26 Dividend paid - - (150) (150) Balance at 31 March 2014 (383) 539 4,040 4,196 Balance at 1 April 2012 (383) (20) 1,659 1,256 Profit for the year (restated) - - 1,214 1,214 Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation - - (346) (346) Loss on effective cash flow hedges - (288) - (288) Income tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income - 66 73 139 Cash flow hedges reclassified to foreign exchange in profit or loss - 59 - 59 Income tax related to items reclassified to profit or loss - (13) - (13) Dividend paid - - (150) (150) Balance at 31 March 2013 (383) (196) 2,450 1,871 Balance at 1 April 2011 (383) 22 169 (192) Profit for the year (restated) - - 1,460 1,460 Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation - - (122) (122) Loss on effective cash flow hedges - (36) - (36) Income tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income - 9 152 161 Cash flow hedges reclassified to foreign exchange in profit or loss - (20) - (20) Income tax related to items reclassified to profit or loss - 5 - 5 Balance at 31 March 2012 (383) (20) 1,659 1,256Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 140 Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of: The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit liability were carried out at 31 March 2014 by a qualified independent actuary. The present value of the defined benefit liability, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used in accounting for the pension plans are set out below: For the valuation at 31 March 2014 and 2013, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S1NxA tables and the Light table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. A scaling factor in both 2014 and 2013 of 115% has been used for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 110% for the Land Rover Pension Scheme, and 105% for males and 90% for females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. There is an allowance for future improvements in line with the CMI (2013) projections (2013: CMI (2012) projections) and an allowance for long-term improvements of 1.25% per annum. For the valuation at 31 March 2012, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S1PMA for males, S1PFA for females and the Light table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension Plan, with a scaling factor of 90% for males and 1 15% for females for all members. There was an allowance for future improvements in line with the CMI (2011) projections and an allowance for long-term improvements of 1.25% per annum.Amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 (restated)2012 (restated) Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from: Changes in demographic assumptions (39) (115) 33 Changes in financial assumptions (243) 951 259 Experience adjustments 8 15 75 Remeasurement loss/(gain) on the return of plan assets,excluding amounts included in interest income 407 (384) (190) Change in restriction of pension asset recognised (as per IFRIC 14) 2 (27) (6) Change in onerous obligation, excluding amounts included in interest expense - (94) (49) Remeasurement of defined benefit obligation 135 346 122 As at 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligations (1) (1) (1) Present value of funded defined benefit obligations (6,052) (6,020) (4,915) Fair value of plan assets 5,382 5,365 4,707 Restriction of pension asset recognised (as per IFRIC 14) (3) (1) (28) Onerous obligation - - (88) Net retirement benefit obligation (674) (657) (325) Presented as non-current asset - - 2 Presented as non-current liability (674) (657) (327) Year ended 31 March (%) 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.6 4.4 5.1 Expected rate of increase in compensation level of covered employees 3.9 3.9 3.8 Inflation increase 3.4 3.4 3.330 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED) The following tables set out the disclosures pertaining to the retirement benefit amounts recognised in the financial statements: Change in present value of defined benefit obligation Change in fair value of plan assetsYear ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 (restated)2012 (restated) Defined benefit obligation at beginning of year 6,021 4,916 4,300 Current service cost 176 123 108 Interest expense 262 247 234 Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from: Changes in demographic assumptions (39) (115) 33 Changes in financial assumptions (243) 951 259 Experience adjustments 8 15 75 Past service cost 6 6 15 Exchange differences on foreign schemes (2) 1 (1) Member contributions 1 7 7 Benefits paid (137) (129) (114) Other adjustments - (1) - Defined benefit obligation at end of year 6,053 6,021 4,916 Year ended 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 (restated)2012 (restated) Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 5,365 4,707 4,172 Interest income 237 238 230 Remeasurement (loss)/gain on the return of plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest income (407) 384 190 Administrative expenses (8) (10) (9) Exchange differences on foreign schemes (2) 1 - Employer contributions 333 168 231 Member contributions 1 7 7 Benefits paid (137) (129) (114) Other adjustments - (1) - Fair value of plan assets at end of year 5,382 5,365 4,707 The actual return on plan assets for the year was \u00a3(170) million (2013: \u00a3622 million, 2012: \u00a3420 million).

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to previous periods. *Quoted prices for indentical assets or liabilities in active markets. The split of level 1 assets is 79% (2013: 1%, 2012 1%). Equity instruments and majority of debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets (level 1). Corporate bonds (non-investment grade), derivatives, property and other assets are classed as level 2 instruments. Private market holdings are classified as level 3 instruments. The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan funding deficit over the next eight years. Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and the current agreed contribution rate is 22.3% of pensionable salaries in the UK. The next triennial valuation is due to be carried out as at 5 April 2015 and completed by 5 June 2016. The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly . The average duration of the benefit obligation at 31 March 2014 is 22.5 years (2013: 22.5 years, 2012: 19.4 years). The expected net periodic pension cost for the year ended 31 March 2015 is \u00a3206 million. The Group expects to contribute \u00a3113 million to its plans in the year ended 31 March 2015.

The Group assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel wherever necessary . The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Group provides disclosure in the financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable. Such potential losses may be of an uncertain timing and/or amount. The following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. Management believes that none of the contingencies described below, either individually or in aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. LITIGATION The Group is involved in legal proceedings, both as plaintiff and as defendant and there are claims as at 31 March 2014 of \u00a327 million (2013: \u00a316 million, 2012: \u00a310 million) against the Group which management have not recognised as they are not considered probable. The majority of these claims pertain to motor accident claims and consumer complaints. Some of the cases also relate to replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the services by the Group or its dealers.

The Group's policy is to borrow primarily through capital market issues supported by committed borrowing facilities to meet anticipated funding requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Group also maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash in subsidiaries is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security , liquidity and yield requirements. The capital structure is governed according to Group policies approved by the Board and is monitored by various metrics, such as debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest ratios, as per the debt covenants and rating agency guidance. Funding requirements are reviewed periodically with any debt issuances and capital distributions approved by the Board.This section gives an overview of the significance of financial instruments for the Group and provides additional information on balance sheet items that contain financial instruments. The details of significant accounting policies, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.As at 31 March (\u00a3 millions) 2014 2013 2012 Short-term debt 172 333 495 debt 4,918 (A) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2014: Financial assets Financial liabilities(\u00a3 millions) Cash, loans and receivablesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Cash and cash equivalents 2,260 - - 2,260 2,260 Short-term deposits 1,199 831 - - 831 831 Other financial assets - current 31 349 12 392 392 Other financial assets - non-current 37 415 21 473 473 Total financial assets 4,358 764 33 5,155 5,155 (\u00a3 millions) Other financial liabilitiesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Accounts payable 4,787 - - 4,787 4,787 Short-term debt 167 - - 167 167 Long-term debt 1,843 - - 1,843 1,982 Other financial liabilities - current 212 54 11 277 277 Other financial liabilities - non-current 14 37 18 69 69 Total financial liabilities 7,023 91 29 7,143 7,282The following table summarises the capital of the Group: *Total debt includes finance lease obligations of \u00a318 million (2013: \u00a323 million, 2012: \u00a320 million).Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 146 33 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2013: The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2012:Financial assets Financial assetsFinancial liabilities Financial liabilities(\u00a3 millions) Cash, loans and receivablesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Cash and cash equivalents 2,072 - - 2,072 2,072 Short-term deposits 775 - - 775 775 Trade receivables 927 - - 927 927 Other financial assets - current 145 30 1 176 176 Other financial assets - non current 73 51 71 195 195 Total financial assets 3,992 81 72 4,145 4,145 (\u00a3 millions) Cash, loans and receivablesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Cash and cash equivalents 2,430 - - 2,430 2,430 Trade receivables 662 - - 662 662 Other financial assets - current 135 47 1 183 183 Other financial assets - non current 84 23 - 107 107 Total financial assets 3,311 70 1 3,382 3,382(\u00a3 millions) Other financial liabilitiesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Accounts payable 4,227 - - 4,227 4,227 Short-term debt 328 - - 328 328 Long-term debt 1,839 - - 1,839 2,058 Other financial liabilities - current 227 179 27 433 433 Other financial liabilities - non current 19 156 52 227 227 Total financial liabilities 6,640 335 79 7,054 7,273 (\u00a3 millions) Other financial liabilitiesDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationshipFair value through profit and lossTotal carrying valueTotal fair value Accounts payable 3,285 - - 3,285 3,285 Short-term debt 490 - - 490 490 Long-term debt 1,484 - - 1,484 1,534 Other financial liabilities - current 205 85 23 313 313 Other financial liabilities - non current 40 11 22 73 73 Total financial liabilities 5,504 96 45 5,645 5,695OFFSETTING Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to offsetting where there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and the Group intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category mainly includes quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments. Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are forward currency contracts, commodity contracts and embedded derivatives. All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that observable. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. Fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing market interest rate curves from Reuters. The long-term unsecured listed bonds are held at amortised cost. Its fair value (disclosed above) is determined using Level 1 valuation techniques, based on the closing price at 31 March 2014 on the Euro MTF market. There has been no change in the valuation techniques adopted or any transfers between fair value levels. Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, short-term debt, other financial assets and liabilities, current and non-current (excluding derivatives) are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturing of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant. Fair value of prepayment options of \u00a3nil (2013: \u00a347 million, 2012: \u00a3nil) relates to the GBP 500 million and USD 410 million senior notes due 2018 which were bifurcated but have been repaid early in the year ended 31 March 2014. The fair value represents the difference in the traded market price of the bonds and the expected price the bonds would trade at if they did not contain any prepayment features. The expected price is based on market inputs including credit spreads and interest rates.Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However , there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Group could have realised in a sales transaction as of respective dates. The estimated fair value amounts as of 31 March 2014, 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 have been measured as of the respective dates. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be dif ferent than the amounts reported at each year-end. (B) CASH FLOW HEDGING The Group risk management policy allows the use of currency and interest derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. To the extent possible under IAS 39, these instruments are designated in hedging relationships if they meet the requirements outlined in the standard. As of 31 March 2014, the Group has taken out a number of cash flow hedging instruments. The Group uses USD/GBP forward and option contracts, USD/Euro forward contracts and other currency options to hedge future cash flows from sales and purchases. Cash flow hedges are expected to be recognised in profit or loss during the years ending 31 March 2015 to 2018. The Group also has a number of USD/Euro options which are entered into as an economic hedge of the financial risks of the Group. These contracts do not meet the hedge accounting criteria of IAS 39, so the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. The time value of options is considered ineffective in the hedge relationship and thus the change in time value is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge its risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The fair value of such contracts as of 31 March 2014 was a net asset of \u00a3673 million (2013: net liability of \u00a3254 million, 2012: net liability of \u00a326 million).Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts to the extent determined to be an ef fective hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognised in income statement. Accordingly, the fair value change of net gain of \u00a31,041 million (2013: loss of \u00a3288 million, 2012: loss of \u00a336 million) was recognised in other comprehensive income.The ineffective portion that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to a gain of \u00a35 million (2013: loss of \u00a31 million, 2012: loss of \u00a31 million) which has been recognised in foreign exchange gain/(loss) in the consolidated income statement. The gain on derivative contracts not eligible for hedging was \u00a357 million (2013: loss of \u00a311 million, 2012: loss of \u00a359 million) which has been recognised in foreign gain/(loss) in the consolidated income statement. The total loss on commodities of \u00a318 million (2013: \u00a310 million, 2012: \u00a312 million) has been recognised in other income in the consolidated income statement. A 10% depreciation/appreciation of the foreign currency underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximate additional gain/(loss) of million/(\u00a39) million) in the consolidated income statement. (C) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers the foreign exchange risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to: Create a stable business planning environment - by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate fluctuations to the Company' s business plan. Achieve greater predictability to earnings - by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance. (D) MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in any of the risks outlined in (C) above or other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy . Each of the sensitivity analyses presented in the following sections (E) to (H) assumes that all other variables remain constant and are based on reasonably possible changes in each of the market risks presented. (E) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in US Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen and Euro against the functional currency of the Group. The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the Group's cost of imports and cost of borrowings. The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as of 31 March 2013: A 10% appreciation/depreciation of the USD, Chinese Yuan, Euro and Yen would result in an increase/decrease in the Group's net profit before tax and net assets by approximately \u00a393 million, \u00a31 million, \u00a385 milion and \u00a35 million respectively for the year ended 31 March 2013.

The Group is presently funded with long-term fixed interest rate bonds. The Group is subject to variable interest rates on certain other debt obligations.The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves.This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The year-end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year . As of 31 March 2014, net financial liabilities of \u00a3167 million (2013: \u00a3220 million, 2012: \u00a3336 million) were subject to the variable interest rate. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact of \u00a32 million (2013: \u00a32 million, 2012: \u00a33 million) in the consolidated income statement. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk with regard to the reported fair value of the prepayment options. At 31 March 2014, had interest rates been 25 basis points higher/lower with all other variables constant, consolidated profit for the year would be \u00a3nil lower/\u00a3nil higher (2013: \u00a39 million lower/\u00a39 million higher, lower/\u00a3nil higher), mainly as a result of higher/lower finance expense. (G) LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.The Group's policy on liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities to meet the Group's operating requirements with an appropriate level of headroom. As at 31 March 2013 (\u00a3 millions) Carrying amount Contractual cash flows 1 year or less 1 to <2 years 2 to <5 years 5 years and over Financial liabilities Long-term debt 1,839 2,868 143 143 430 2,152 Short-term borrowings 328 331 331 - - - Finance lease obligations 23 28 6 6 14 2 Other financial liabilities 223 243 231 8 4 - Accounts payable 4,227 4,227 4,227 - - - Derivative financial instruments 414 414 206 119 89 - Total contractual maturities 7,054 8,111 5,144 276 537 2,154 As at 31 March 2012 (\u00a3 millions) Carrying amount Contractual cash flows 1 year or less 1 to <2 years 2 to <5 years 5 years and over Financial liabilitiesLong-term debt 1,641 2,692 134 134 401 2,023 Short-term borrowings 333 340 340 - - - Finance lease obligations 20 23 5 6 12 - Other financial liabilities 224 224 200 24 - - Accounts payable 3,285 3,285 3,285 - - - Derivative financial instruments 141 141 108 24 9 - Total contractual maturities 5,644 6,705 4,072 188 422 2,023Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 152 Included within trade receivables is \u00a3167 million (2013: \u00a3242 million, 2012: \u00a3143 million) of receivables which are part of a debt factoring arrangement. These assets do not qualify for derecognition due to the recourse arrangements in place. The related liability of \u00a3167 million (2013: \u00a3242 million, 2012: \u00a3143 million) is in short-term borrowings. Both asset and associated liability are stated at fair value. (H) CREDIT RISK The majority of the Group's credit risk pertains to the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks. In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Group is exposed to the impact of volatility with its own credit risk with regard to the fair value of prepayment options. At 31 March 2014, had credit spreads been 25 basis points lower/higher with all other variables constant, consolidated profit for the year would be \u00a3nil higher/\u00a3nil lower higher/lower), mainly as a result of lower/higher finance expense. Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of investments classified as loans and receivables and trade receivables. None of the financial instruments of the Group result in material concentrations of credit risks. For trade receivables, the Group considers counterparty creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process and its country risk. In this context, the historic financial performance and other relevant information on the counterparty such as payment history are used and assessed. Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Financial assets None of the Group's cash equivalents, including time deposits with banks, are past due or impaired. Regarding other financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired, there were no indications as at 31 March 2014 (2013, 2012: no indications) that defaults in payment obligations will occur.

The Company's policy is to borrow centrally through capital market issues supported by committed borrowing facilities to meet anticipated funding requirements. The Company also maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security, liquidity and yield requirements. The capital structure is governed according to Company policies approved by the Board and is monitored by various metrics, such as debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest ratios, as per the debt covenants and rating agency guidance. Funding requirements are reviewed periodically with any debt issuances and capital distributions approved by the Board.

(A) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as of 31 March 2014: The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as of 31 March 2013:50 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets Financial assetsFinancial liabilities Financial liabilitiesOverview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 164 (\u00a3 millions) Cash, loans and receivables Total carrying value Total fair value Cash and cash equivalents 1 1 1 Other financial assets - current 1,710 1,710 1,710 Total financial assets 1,711 1,711 1,711 (\u00a3 millions) Other financial liabilities Total carrying value Total fair value Preference shares 157 157 157 Short-term debt 48 48 48 Long-term debt 1,484 1,484 1,534 Total financial liabilities 1,689 1,689 1,739 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Financial instruments held at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels. Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category mainly includes quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments. Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are forward currency contracts, commodity contracts and embedded derivatives. All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. Derivatives are marked to market using market observable rates and published prices together with forecast cash flow information where applicable. The long-term unsecured listed bonds are held at amortised cost. Its fair value (disclosed above) is determined using Level 1 valuation techniques, based on the closing price at 31 March 2014 on the Euro MTF market. There has been no change in the valuation techniques adopted or any transfers between fair value levels. Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, short-term debt, other financial assets and liabilities, current and non-current (excluding derivatives) are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short-term maturing of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant. Fair value of prepayment options of \u00a3nil (2013: \u00a347 million, 2012: \u00a3nil) relates to the GBP 500 million and USD 410 million senior notes due 2018 which were bifurcated but have been repaid early in the year ended 31 March 2014. The fair value represents the difference in the traded market price of the bonds and the expected price the bonds would trade at if they did not contain any prepayment features. The expected price is based on market inputs including credit spreads and interest rates.The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities as of 31 March 2012: 50 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However , there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Group could have realised in a sales transaction as of respective dates. The estimated fair value amounts as of 31 March 2014, 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 have been measured as of the respective dates. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be dif ferent than the amounts reported at each year-end. (B) CASH FLOW HEDGING As at 31 March 2014, 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, there are no designated cash flow hedges. (C) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT In the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity price, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also the risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to: Create a stable business planning environment - by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate fluctuations to the Company' s business plan. Achieve greater predictability to earnings - by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance. (D) MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in any of the risks outlined in (C) above or other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy . Each of the sensitivity analyses presented below assume that all other variables remain constant and are based on reasonably possible changes in each of the market risks presented. (E) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement, equity , where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company . The Company's operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in the GBP:US Dollar rate as the Company has USD assets and liabilities and a GBP functional currency. The following analysis has been worked out based on the gross exposure as of the Balance Sheet date which could af fect the income statement. The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at 31 March 2014: (\u00a3 millions) US Dollar Financial assets 1,078 Financial liabilities (1,066) Net exposure asset 12 A 10% appreciation/depreciation of the USD would result in an increase/decrease in the Company's net profit before tax and net assets by approximately \u00a31 million. A 10% appreciation/depreciation of the USD would result in an increase/decrease in the Company's net profit before tax and net assets by approximately \u00a3nil.Financial assets Financial liabilities (\u00a3 millions) US Dollar Financial assets 891 Financial liabilities (888) Net exposure asset 3The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at 31 March 2013:Overview | Brands | Manufacturing | Technology | Responsible business | Management report | Governance Financials JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013-14 166 50 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) (F) INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. The Company is presently funded with long-term fixed interest rate bonds.The Company is subject to variable interest rates on certain other debt obligations. The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year . As of 31 March 2014 net financial assets of \u00a325 million (2013: \u00a318 million, 2012: \u00a318 million) were subject to the variable interest rate. Increase/ decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact of \u00a3nil (2013: \u00a3nil, 2012: \u00a3nil). (G) LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
