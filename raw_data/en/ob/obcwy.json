These award-winning studies are summarized below. Acupuncture is an ancient traditional Chinese therapy relying on the concept of stimulation by needling of the \"meridians\" (or pathways) in the body in order to treat conditions such as pain and nausea. A sensation called \"chi\" is produced by acupuncture. In China, acupuncture has been used to provide perioperative analgesia. Schools of acupuncture in the United States, some of which are accredited, currently provide training to practitioners wishing to use this modality. The NIH consensus report of 1998 suggested that \"acupuncture may be useful as an adjunct treatment or an acceptable alternative or included in a comprehensive management program for many medical conditions.\"[ [30](javascript:void(0);)] More specifically, a recent meta-analysis evaluating the injection of the P6 acupoint in adults suggested efficacy in reducing the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).[ [21](javascript:void(0);)] Vomiting in children undergoing surgery for strabismus was also significantly reduced by acupuncture.[ [31](javascript:void(0);)] These data provided the basis of an investigation assessing the use of the P6 acupoint to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting in children.[ [32](javascript:void(0);)] Method. Subjects were children ages 7-16 whose parents were contacted by telephone 1-2 weeks prior to their children's surgery. This double-blind, sham-placebo-controlled study randomized subjects (IV saline and bilateral sham, non-P6 point injections); or P6 sham-point therapy (IV saline and bilateral sham P6 point injections). The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV in the postanesthesia care unit during the first 24 hours postoperatively. All treatments were administered in response to reported symptoms. Data were obtained on 187 participants; 50 received acupoint treatment, 49 were treated with droperidol, and 43 and 45, respectively, were assigned to the 2 sham-point control groups. Results. Groups were similar in characteristics of age, sex, type of surgery, and incidence of PONV. Results showed that the incidence of postoperative nausea within 24 hours was significantly lower in the P6 acupoint group (group 1), compared with the sham-point group (32% vs 56%, P = .029) (group 3) and the P6 sham-group (32% vs 64%. P = .002) (group 4). However, compared with the droperidol group (group 2), no significant difference in postoperative nausea was found (32% vs 46%). Similarly, when used for treatment of vomiting, subjects in the P6 acupoint group (group 1) had a significantly lower incidence compared with group 3 (12% vs 33%, P = .026) and group 4 (12% vs 31%, P = .029), but not the droperidol group (group 2) (12% vs 18%, P = nonsignificant). In addition, a significantly smaller number of subjects in the acupoint group required rescue therapy with IV [ondansetron](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/zofran-zuplenz-ondansetron-342052) (P = .024) compared with those in all other groups. Conclusion. In children, P6 acupoint injections are as effective as droperidol in preventing early postoperative nausea and, probably, vomiting. This result supports previous studies conducted with adults. The physiologic mechanism of P6 acupoint injections for control of nausea and vomiting is as yet not understood. In this study, subjects experiencing vomiting were small in number. Future larger studies powered to detect differences in the control of vomiting will be helpful. In addition, studies of basic science mechanism will help elucidate specific pathways for the action of acupoint injection, and may lead to other therapeutic interventions. Extracts from the resin of the Commiphora mukul (guggul) tree have been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat hypercholesterolemia, particularly in India, where reports of efficacy have been published.[ [33](javascript:void(0);), [34](javascript:void(0);)]Gugulipid contains 2.5% guggulsterones and is available as a dietary supplement in the United States. To date, no studies have been conducted among Western populations to examine the efficacy of this supplement. Szapary[ [35](javascript:void(0);)] tested the hypothesis that Gugulipid can reduce cholesterol, in particular low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in individuals with elevated LDL. Method. A total of 103 healthy subjects with [LDL cholesterol](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087735-overview) levels ranging from 118 to 223 mg/dL (mean LDL = 159 mg/dL) were stratified according to LDL level (greater or less than 160 mg/dL) to 1 of the following 3 groups: 1000 mg Gugulipid 3 times/day (standard-treatment group, n = 36); 2000 mg Gugulipid 3 times/day (high-dose-treatment group, n = 29); or matching placebo tablets (n = 30). All treatment was continued for 8 weeks. Each 1000-mg Gugulipid capsule contained at least 20 mg of E and Z guggulsterones, as measured by independent standardized high-performance liquid chromatography. Results. Subjects were healthy adults without clinical evidence of [atherosclerosis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/463147-overview) or [ischemic heart disease](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/349040-overview), with moderately elevated cholesterol as described above. After 2 months of therapy, directly measured LDL cholesterol dropped 3% (P = .2 vs baseline) in the placebo group and increased by 4.5% (P = .031 vs placebo) in the standard-treatment group. LDL levels increased by 6.5% in the high-dose treatment group compared with placebo (P = .0065). There was no difference in percentage of change between the standard-dose group and the high-dose group LDL levels (P = .52). Conclusion. The investigator concluded that in Western hypercholesterolemic patients, treatment with Gugulipid did not reduce serum cholesterol, and may actually increase LDL. He also noted an unexpectedly high incidence of clinically significant skin rash (akin to Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in 5 subjects in the treatment groups. This side effect has not been reported in previous studies of Gugulipid -- previously considered a safe herbal, non-FDA-approved supplement. The finding of lack of efficacy of [guggul](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/commiphora-mukul-gugulipid-guggul-344487) extract for moderately elevated cholesterol directly contradicted the results from previous studies, suggesting that clinicians need to exercise caution before accepting this supplement as an adjunct or treatment for hypercholesterolemia. There is a suggestion that guggul extract may in fact have the opposite effect of elevating cholesterol. This finding deserves confirmation in a larger study. [Stroke](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916852-overview) is 4 times more prevalent among patients with [type 2 diabetes](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117853-overview) mellitus (DM) compared with individuals without DM.[ [36](javascript:void(0);)] The primary mechanism for this is believed to be mediated by increased platelet sensitivity leading to blood clot formation.[ [37](javascript:void(0);)] Kudolo[ [38](javascript:void(0);)] evaluated [Ginkgo biloba](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/eun-haeng-fossil-tree-ginkgo-biloba-344537) extract, a plant herbal supplement used for indications ranging from dementia to improvement of cognitive function and [stroke prevention](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/323662-overview). Although the mechanism of action of the supplement is not well understood, it is widely marketed as \"improving circulation to the brain.\" He hypothesized that Ginkgo biloba may reduce the risk of stroke in individuals with DM by reducing platelet-collagen interaction, thus reducing the risk of blood clots. This investigator had previously studied the effect of Ginkgo biloba on pancreatic cell function in DM and non-DM subjects.[ [39](javascript:void(0);), [40](javascript:void(0);)] Method. Venous blood was drawn from 20 individuals with DM (mean age, 53 years). The blood sample was then converted to platelet-rich plasma prepared by centrifugation. Platelet aggregation was then induced by adding collagen to the sample. After addition of collagen, platelet aggregation was measured by optical transmission. Aggregation was measured either alone or after the addition of an aqueous solution of Ginkgo biloba (240, 480, or 960 mcg/mL) for 1 minute. The reaction was terminated after 5 minutes using [indomethacin](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/indocin-tivorbex-indomethacin-343290). Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was compared between the 3 sample groups. Results. There was a dose-dependent collagen-induced increase of the maximal platelet aggregation at 5 minutes, with no significant differences between the 3 groups tested. Preincubation with Ginkgo biloba before challenging with collagen produced a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation. There was also a highly between inhibition of platelet aggregation and platelet thromboxane (TXB2) production (P < .001). Conclusion. This in vitro study supported a possible mechanism for the postulated clinical effect of Ginkgo biloba: \"thinning\" the blood. Preincubation of hypersensitive [platelets](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/platelets-999506) with DM with Ginkgo biloba reduced platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen. Thus, this study suggests a physiologic mechanism for an observed effect of Ginkgo biloba on stroke prevention in patients with DM. However, further larger, long-term, randomized clinical trials of efficacy will be needed before clinicians recommend this supplement for the specific indication of stroke prevention. Recent surveys of CAM use have focused on adults, but little information had been known about the use of CAM therapies by children and adolescents.[ [5](javascript:void(0);), [6](javascript:void(0);)] Yussman and colleagues[ [41](javascript:void(0);)] obtained data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative household sample, and performed a secondary analyses of CAM use reported by parents. Method. Data from 7371 individuals younger than 22 years of age, were collected. Parents or heads of households were asked if their children had visited a CAM provider \"for health reasons.\" Prevalence of CAM use was defined by visits to CAM providers compared with conventional providers. CAM therapies included acupuncture, massage, biofeedback, homeopathy, meditation, hypnosis, Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, spiritual healing, and other modalities. Use of self-prescribed therapies such as prayer, herbs, and dietary or vitamin supplements were not considered CAM therapy in this study. Results. The overall prevalence of CAM use was low: 2%. The distribution of use varied by Prevalence of use by ethnicity also varied; 51% for whites, 16% for blacks, 29% for Hispanics, and 4% for \"others.\" Predictors of CAM use included: both parents being users of CAM (odds ratio [OR] = 47.2); mother only using CAM (OR = 8.8); 6 or more visits to a conventional provider per year (OR = 4.4); lower satisfaction with conventional provider (OR = 2.8); older age (18-21 years) (OR = 3.2); and female sex (OR = 1.6). Conclusion: This is the first nationally representative study of CAM use in the pediatric and adolescent population without a self-selection bias. It included individuals in all socioeconomic levels. However, it was a phone survey restricted to English-speaking respondents. It was done as a head-of-household report, and included a limited number of modalities. Therefore, it is likely to have underestimated CAM use in the age groups studied. Future studies will be aimed at questioning adolescents directly, addressing non-English-speaking populations, and expanding the range of modalities assessed. The incidence of diabetes in the United States varies from 10% in the general population to over 20% in high-risk groups such as Native Americans and Latinos. This study attempted to characterize the use of CAM therapies among individuals with DM, when used as specific treatment for this condition.[ [42](javascript:void(0);)] Method. Using data from a nationally conducted telephone survey, 4.6% of all respondents were identified as having a DM diagnosis. The mean respondent age for the sample with DM was 57 years. Among those identified with DM, 91% were diagnosed after age 25 and 30% required [insulin](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2089224-overview). Results. Thirty-five percent reported use of CAM therapies specifically for DM in the past year, including prayer and spiritual practices (28%), commercial diets (6%), herbal remedies (7%), and folk remedies (3%). Of respondents identifying as CAM users, 61% found CAM therapies to be \"very helpful.\" However, when prayer was excluded from the analysis, only 20% of respondents reported condition-specific use of CAM therapies. Conclusion. This was a low rate of CAM use, compared with previously established rates of 64% use by individuals with back and neck pain, 55% with anxiety/ [depression](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286759-overview), and 42% overall use among US adults.[ [5](javascript:void(0);)] The investigator estimated that 6 million people with DM use CAM therapies in the United States, but that prevalence of use was lower for DM than for other conditions. Several reasons could account for this pattern of relatively low usage. For example, patients with DM may perceive conventional medical treatment alone to be efficacious. This might reflect confidence in DM prescription medications and physician management. Or, perhaps patients with DM are treating only \"troublesome\" symptoms (such as infections or polyuria) with CAM modalities, rather than treating the condition of DM itself. Qualitative studies examining patient perceptions of DM as a condition or disease should yield clinically useful information in this area. The investigator suggested that additional studies be conducted to characterize CAM use in DM.
