Evaluate HCWs' varicella immune status The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), with support from the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), recommends that health care institutions ensure that all HCWs have evidence of immunity to varicella. Evidence of immunity includes any of the following: Documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease; or Documentation of a diagnosis or veri fied history of varicella (chickenpox) or zoster (shingles) from a health care provider. Note: Birth before 1980 is not considered evidence of immunity for HCWs. Routine testing for varicella immunity after two doses of varicella vaccine is not recommended as commercial assays lack sensitivity to detect vaccine -induced immunity in all instances. Institutions may elect to test all unvaccinated HCWs regardless of disease history because a small proportion of persons with a positive history of disease might be susceptible. Vaccination recommendation for HCWs Based on current ACIP recommendations, MDH encourages two doses of varicella vaccine for HCWs without evidence of immunity. Priority should be based on risk of non- transient, face -to- face contact with vari cella cases (e.g., outpatient clinics, emergency departments) and patient population served (e.g., obstetrics and immune compromised patients). Age may also be a factor in prioritization (Serologic studies have shown that nearly all U.S. -born adults born before 1977 have been infected with VZV). Additional precautionary steps when exposed to varicella If a HCW is exposed to varicella, they should consult with the facility's occupational health department. Even if the HCW received two doses of varicella vaccine, they should be monitored daily for 8 -21 days post -exposure. They should report any symptoms to the occupational health department without delay. This is particularly important if the exposed HCW is going to care for immunocompromised individuals. Recommendation for unvaccinated HCWs without evidence of immunity who are exposed to varicella Unvaccinated HCWs without evidence of immunity or vaccination history are potentially infectious from days 8 -21 post -exposure. They should be furloughe d during this period; post - exposure vaccination is recommended within 3 -5 days of exposure since it may lessen the ENS UR I NG I M MU NI TY TO V AR IC ELLA I N H EA LTH C ARE W OR KER S severity of t he disease i f infection occurs.
