Live [viral](https://www.rxlist.com/viral/definition.htm) [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) are biological products that provide [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) against certain viral infections. Live viral vaccines stimulate the body's [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to produce antibodies against specific types of [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm) and protect a person from diseases caused by these viruses. Live viral vaccines are weakened ( [attenuated](https://www.rxlist.com/attenuated/definition.htm)) forms of [disease](https://www.rxlist.com/disease/definition.htm)-causing viruses. Live viral vaccines produce a strong and often life-long immunity similar to that [acquired](https://www.rxlist.com/acquired/definition.htm) from a natural [infection](https://www.rxlist.com/infection/definition.htm), but without subjecting the person to the disease and its complications, because they only contain a small amount of the weakened viruses. Live viral vaccines are derived by weakening the disease-causing viruses [in](https://www.rxlist.com/in/definition.htm) laboratories, usually with repeated culturing. Live viral vaccines must be stored and handled with care because they are fragile and can be damaged by heat and light. Live viral vaccines may not be safe for individuals with compromised immunity. People with weakened [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) systems should consult with their [health](https://www.rxlist.com/health/definition.htm) care providers before receiving live viral vaccines, because they may cause severe infections that their weakened immune systems may not be able to [control](https://www.rxlist.com/control_research/definition.htm). Live viral vaccines approved by the [FDA](https://www.rxlist.com/fda/definition.htm) provide immunity against the following viral diseases: [Febrile](https://www.rxlist.com/febrile/definition.htm) [acute respiratory disease](https://www.rxlist.com/acute_respiratory_disease/definition.htm), caused by [adenovirus](https://www.rxlist.com/adenovirus-drug.htm)type 7 [Dengue](https://www.rxlist.com/dengue/definition.htm)disease, caused by dengue [virus](https://www.rxlist.com/virus/definition.htm)serotypes 1,2,3 and 4, spread by mosquitoes - infection [Influenza A](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_audenz/drugs-condition.htm)and B infection [Measles](https://www.rxlist.com/measles/definition.htm), [mumps](https://www.rxlist.com/mumps/definition.htm), [Chickenpox](https://www.rxlist.com/chickenpox/definition.htm), caused by the [varicella](https://www.rxlist.com/varicella_chickenpox/definition.htm)-zoster virus [Gastroenteritis](https://www.rxlist.com/gastroenteritis/definition.htm)caused by several strains of [rotavirus](https://www.rxlist.com/rotavirus/definition.htm) [Smallpox](https://www.rxlist.com/smallpox/definition.htm), which has been eradicated worldwide [Monkeypox](https://www.rxlist.com/monkeypox/definition.htm), a disease caused by the monkeypox virus which is related to the smallpox virus [Yellow fever](https://www.rxlist.com/yellow_fever/definition.htm), a disease spread by mosquitoes, affects the [liver](https://www.rxlist.com/liver/definition.htm) How are live viral vaccines used? Live viral vaccines are administered as single or a series of one-time doses, except in the case of the [influenza virus vaccine](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_flublok/drugs-condition.htm) which is administered annually before the [flu](https://www.rxlist.com/flu/definition.htm) season.
