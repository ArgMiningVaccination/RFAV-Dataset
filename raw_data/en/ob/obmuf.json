Some factors are beyond a person's control. However, there are manageable elements that can also influence hormone levels. The endocrine system circulates hormones, which perform various functions throughout the day. Even small changes in hormone levels can result in adverse effects, including extra [stress](/articles/145855.php) on the body. Symptoms can grow worse over time, and a hormonal imbalance can lead to chronic issues. For some people, making simple lifestyle changes can help restore proper levels of hormones. The following strategies may help: Sleep may be among the most important factors for hormonal balance. Levels of some hormones may rise and fall throughout the day in response to issues such as the quality of sleep. According to a [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377487/) Regularly getting a full, undisturbed night's rest may help the body regulate hormone levels. Exposure to blue light, such as from cell phones or computer screens, can disrupt the sleep cycle. The body responds to this light as if it were daylight and adjusts hormones in response. A [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26375320/) Avoiding artificial lights may help regulate hormones and restore a natural circadian rhythm. A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579396/) Stress leads to an increase in adrenaline and cortisol. If levels of these hormones are too high, it can disrupt the overall balance and contribute to factors such as obesity, changes in mood, and even cardiovascular issues. For this reason, it is important to find ways to reduce stress. A [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26142566/) The hormonal effects of regular exercise may a [2015 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4822166/) This suggests that eliminating sugar from the diet may help keep levels of hormones, including [insulin](/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php), in check. Some people avoid specific sugars. However, [2015 research](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/145/10/2265/4590115) Healthy fats may help maintain a balance of hormones involved in appetite, metabolism, and feeling full. A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946258/) Meanwhile, a [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26178726/) Separate [research from 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26429068/) Fiber may play an important role in gut health, and it may also help regulate hormones such as insulin. A [2014 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20754) The high levels of fats in some fish can contribute to heart and digestive health and may also benefit the brain and [central nervous system](/articles/307076.php). A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087749/) [depression](/articles/8933) and [anxiety](/articles/323454). In some cases, adding oily fish to the diet may contribute to treating the disorders. The omega-3s in fatty fish may play a particularly significant role in balancing mood, though fully understanding the link will require further research. Regularly overeating may lead to metabolic issues in the long term, but a [2013 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20508) The researchers also pointed to an increase in ceramides, which are fat cells in the skin, noting that a significant increase may promote insulin resistance. They called for further research into this area. [Green tea](/articles/269538.php) is a generally healthy beverage containing [antioxidants](/articles/301506.php) and compounds that boost metabolic health. A [2013 review](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/98/2/340/4577179) The antioxidants in the tea may also help manage oxidative stress. Tobacco smoke may disrupt levels of several hormones. For example, according to a [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973437/) The following tips may help balance hormones in females: Be wary of dairy products Dairy is an important source of nutrients for many people. However, females concerned about levels of reproductive hormones may wish to use caution, especially before consuming cream or yogurt. A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5265695/) In addition, the authors point to an association between eating cream and yogurt and missing [ovulation](/articles/150870.php). The link is unclear, and the researchers call for further studies. Consider supplements and alternative medicines There is some evidence that alternative therapies or supplements may address some hormonal issues. For instance, a [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25637159/) [infertility](/articles/165748.php) when compared to Western, drug-based treatment. A [2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884222/) [estrogen](/articles/277177.php) levels in an animal model. If studies in humans confirm these findings, the supplement may be beneficial for people going through [menopause](/articles/155651.php). The following tip may benefit males: Consider eliminating alcohol While most doctors consider drinking small amounts to be consistent with a healthy diet, a [2014 study](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/9/e005462) of 1,221 Danish men aged 18-28 years old found that even modest alcohol consumption may disrupt hormone levels in young men. The researchers noted a connection between regular alcohol consumption and reduced sperm quality, as well as changes in [testosterone](/articles/276013.php) levels. For males with concerns about hormone levels, it may be best to limit or eliminate alcohol consumption. The following may benefit children, in particular: Cut back on processed carbohydrates Sugars are not the only dietary culprit when it comes to insulin resistance. Processed [carbohydrates](/articles/161547.php), such as white bread products and baked goods, may also contribute to insulin resistance. A [2014 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248360/) Hormones affect a wide range of bodily functions, and even small imbalances can have significant consequences. For some people, making dietary and lifestyle changes can restore a healthy balance. The strategies in this article may help, but anyone concerned about their hormone levels should consult a physician. "}
