Schedule an appointment at MyTurn.ca.gov or call the CA COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255 . At your retail pharmacy.Is the vaccine safe? Yes, the vaccines are highly effective at preventing infection and illness, and even more effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death. Is COVID-19 still a threat? Yes. Viruses constantly change through mutation resulting in variants. As expected, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented in the United States and globally throughout this pandemic. The COVID-19 vaccine is our best tool in stopping the development of new variants and ending the pandemic. What about the risk of unknown long-term side effects? The nation's immunization experts study and analyze all reports of any possible serious side effects following a COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, no vaccine has ever been so closely monitored for safety and side effects. A specialized committee of the CDC meets frequently to examine vaccine safety issues. In their most recent meeting, on July 22, the group maintained its strong encouragement that everyone ages 12 and older get vaccinated against COVID-19, finding that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any harm.Does the vaccine impact fertility and is it safe for pregnant women? No loss of fertility was reported in the clinical trials or in the hundreds of millions of women who have since received the vaccines. Yes. Pregnant people are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19. Pregnant and lactating people may receive any of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines to protect themselves. How does the vaccine work? Scientists have made the COVID-19 vaccines by using part of the virus's genetic code, either a messenger RNA (mRNA) or DNA, depending on the type of vaccine. Once inside the cell, this piece of the genetic code gives instructions to make a small, harmless piece of the COVID-19 virus called the spike protein. Our body notices the spike protein, and the immune system makes antibodies to destroy the spike proteins. This process teaches your body how to recognize and fight against the virus. If you are exposed to the virus in the future, even currently circulating variants of the virus, your immune system will quickly recognize the virus and have the antibodies and T-cells ready to fight infection.
