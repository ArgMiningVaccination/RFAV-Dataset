We've made it easy for you with the ultimate body cleansing diet recommended by Dr. Group, DC! GLOBAL HEALING The Body Cleansing Diet \"I want to share with you my general dietary recommendations for what I believe is the healthiest diet for the average person to keep their body healthy and clean. The reason I called it The Body Cleansing Diet is because a clean body is a healthy body.\" Dr. Edward F. Group III, DC, NP What Is My Diet? Those who have followed me over the years know that my diet is an ongoing experiment. I constantly try new food combinations as well as fasting, detox, and cleansing programs. I am a former meat-eater and became a vegetarian in 2000. In my enthusiasm, I tried to go cold turkey. Of course, my body could not handle the shock and I became sick. I learned the importance of giving the body time to adapt to dietary changes. I changed my approach and, over a period of two years, slowly replaced cooked food, meat, dairy, wheat, and other gluten-containing grains with live, raw food. This allowed my body to adapt to a mostly raw vegetarian lifestyle. My current diet consists of seasonal, organic fruit, raw nuts and seeds, a variety of fresh vegetables, fresh green juice, fresh herbs, sprouts, raw goat and sheep cheese, and salads. I do not consume wheat (gluten), grains, egg, pasta, meat, or toxic, processed food. My diet is 95 percent vegan and 75 percent raw. Occasionally, such as when traveling, I will have steamed or lightly cooked vegetables, soup, or anything else I want. I don't claim to be perfect; I'm human just like you! I do not focus on restrictions. In fact, I believe focusing on restrictions is the main reason why most diets fail. You shouldn't restrict your diet, you should add healthier options to your diet. I've personally seen and experienced the benefits of a raw, vegan, or vegetarian diet and encourage others to consider their own dietary choices. Choosing the Right Foods I designed the body cleansing diet based on the body's natural biorhythms. Understanding and following these principles are critical for first improving and then maintaining your health and vitality. Although this diet may seem tough at first, I would not be helping you if I failed to tell you what your body wants and needs to function properly. Aim for a diet of organic or locally grown foods. This will help ensure that their purity and nutritional content haven't been compromised by toxins such as [pesticides](https://explore.globalhealing.com/natural-health/effects-of-pesticides/), antibiotics, hormones, refined sugars, MSG, artificial sweeteners, and other toxic compounds. Raw organic fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, grass juices, and sprouted grains provide the most nutrition to the body. Because they are not processed or treated (just gathered and cleaned), they provide the natural enzymes necessary for healthy digestion and cell function. If you were not raised on raw organic vegetables or foods, it may be difficult for you to make the transition from cooked, fried, and processed foods. Take it slowly and start by eating fresh fruit for breakfast every morning. After you've done that for a week or so, start replacing one toxic food with a healthy option every week until you have accomplished the goal of creating a healthy diet for yourself. This process might take you three to six months or longer, depending on how strict you are in following the plan. The Human Body's Natural Biorhythms A balanced diet, getting regular sleep and sufficient exercise, reducing your daily toxin threshold, cleansing your body regularly, and maintaining a positive state of mind are required to obtain maximum health. The first step in any diet plan is to understand how the body utilizes and processes the nutrients it needs. Let's start by looking at the biorhythms regulating our body's nutritional needs. All creatures on this planet, including human beings, are naturally attuned to three daily body cycles. These cycles have precise and established hours set by the laws of nature. BODY CYCLE #1: THE ELIMINATION CYCLE This cycle begins around 4:00 a.m. and ends around noon. During this cycle, the body naturally tries to purge itself of toxic waste materials and unnecessary salts, proteins, and acids. During this cycle, you should consume adequate amounts of fresh seasonal fruit (preferably organic or locally grown) to support the body's natural toxin elimination cycle. Not only does fruit supply the body with living matter to draw out unwanted substances, it also ensures the intestinal tract remains well hydrated and nourished. Fresh raw fruit provides the ideal ingredients for supporting the body's elimination cycle. BODY CYCLE #2: THE ENERGY CYCLE This cycle begins around noon and ends around 8:00 p.m. During the energy cycle, food and nutrients are processed and stored to provide you with energy for your day. The best way to support your body during the energy cycle is to eat plenty of fresh raw vegetables (such as a salad or juice), with a starch source to provide your body with the energy it needs to maintain its natural biochemical balance. BODY CYCLE #3: THE REGENERATION CYCLE This cycle begins around 8:00 p.m. and ends around 4:00 a.m. This is an opportunity for the body to take the time it needs to heal and regenerate. This is when the body should get quality sleep. During this cycle, the body assimilates all the foods that you consumed during the day and then processes the nutrients to regenerate itself cell by cell. If the sleep cycle is disrupted by irregular work patterns, night feeding of infants, travel across many time zones, or other factors, the body loses its ability to regenerate cells, which leads to their degeneration instead of regeneration. Why Most Diet Plans Don't Work One of the main reasons people have such a hard time losing weight and why we live in an obese society is that people are not eating their meals in a parasympathetic state. I have reviewed practically every diet book or plan ever written and not one person has ever mentioned how important this is or even linked this to a cause of weight gain. Sympathetic State Sympathetic state: Your sympathetic nervous system is what causes the \"flight or fight\" response that allows your body to adapt to stress or anxiety. In today's society, people are in a constant state of stress due to finances, raising a family, negative news stories, traffic, work pressures, and many other things. When your body is in a sympathetic state, it continuously releases adrenalin into the bloodstream to deal with the stressful situation. Once the stress reaction is gone, it leaves the body exhausted and hungry. When the body is in a sympathetic state, the digestive tract stops working and can even treat food as a toxin. Our bodies are not designed to eat when we are in a fight or flight situation. They are designed to run or get away from the stressful situation. When people eat in a sympathetic state, the digestive system shuts down and does not work properly, leading to a poorly digested and assimilated meal. The ability to break down, absorb, and process food is restricted and may cause weight gain, digestive upset, gas, degenerative conditions, and even bloating. Examples of eating in a sympathetic state: - Eating while in the car driving - Eating at your desk at work - Eating while working on the computer - Eating after a stressful work situation - Eating while talking on the phone - Eating while arguing with someone - Eating while depressed or anxious - Eating at a sporting event - Eating while watching TV - Eating in a loud fast-food restaurant - Eating while on stimulant prescription drugs - Eating too fast. Parasympathetic State Parasympathetic state: The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for relaxation, healing, repairing, and recharging your body. When you are in a relaxed state or parasympathetic state, your body is not dealing with stress and can break down, digest, and absorb the nutrients from your food. The fastest and easiest way to put your body in a parasympathetic relaxation response is through deep breathing. Research has shown that deep breathing can quickly calm the body and mind. It causes the muscles to relax, the lungs to expand, and the heart rate to drop. Eastern cultures have used this technique for thousands of years to reduce stress, prevent weight gain, and achieve physiological balance within the body. Deep breathing can be done anywhere and anytime before meals to activate and support your digestive process. It should also be practiced after every stressful situation you encounter. The 2-Minute Deep Breathing Relaxation Exercise To relax your body before meals or during a stressful situation, find a quiet area to sit, close your eyes, and take nine deep breaths starting from deep in your belly all the way up through your upper lungs. Breathe in through your nose slowly until your lungs are fully inflated and then breathe out through your mouth until you push all the air out. NOTE: Be aware that many people who have food allergies typically eat in a sympathetic state. This is because the body treats the food as a toxin, allergen, or threat and initiates an immune response toward the food. If you suffer from food allergies, start performing the deep breathing exercises before meals. You should start noticing better digestion and less allergic reactions within months. Common Dieting Questions There are tons of questions when it comes to dieting. Below are the most common questions I receive, plus some tips and tricks! What Should I Be Drinking With Meals? Drinking water or other beverages with meals dilutes the digestive juices, which slows down the digestion process. Try to drink water between meals. If this doesn't suit your lifestyle, limit your water intake during a meal to less than 8 ounces. Do not drink milk, tea, juice, [sodas](https://globalhealing.com/natural-health/soft-drinks-americas-other-drinking-problem/), [energy drinks](https://globalhealing.com/natural-health/the-health-dangers-of-energy-drinks/), or any other toxic beverage during meals. How Many Times a Day Should I Eat? The 2-Minute Deep Breathing Relaxation Exercise To relax your body before meals or during a stressful situation, find a quiet area to sit, close your eyes, and take nine deep breaths starting from deep in your belly all the way up through your upper lungs. Breathe in through your nose slowly until your lungs are fully inflated and then breathe out through your mouth until you push all the air out. NOTE: Be aware that many people who have food allergies typically eat in a sympathetic state. This is because the body treats the food as a toxin, allergen, or threat and initiates an immune response toward the food. If you suffer from food allergies, start performing the deep breathing exercises before meals. You should start noticing better digestion and less allergic reactions within months. The Importance of Chewing Your Food Always eat slowly and chew your food until it is a liquid-pulp before swallowing. This will allow your stomach to signal your brain, \"Hey, I'm full now,\" so you avoid taking in excessive calories. You produce up to 32 ounces of saliva every day. Chewing your food will help your body absorb vital nutrients more thoroughly and rapidly due to the enzymes secreted in your saliva. After food is liquefied in the mouth, the tongue will recognize the various flavors of each food and then send messages to the brain, which in turn, orders production of the corresponding digestive juices needed to break down that food. Chewing your food well leads to more effective digestion and is also one of the best-kept secrets for losing weight. Everything You Need to Know About Food Combining Consuming organic foods is a step in the right direction, but your body depends on the correct balance of food types. It's important to know how foods react with one another once they are inside the body. Many competing theories exist about the best food or diet combination to follow regularly. I will tell you what I have used, based on the biochemistry of the body, and based on what has worked for me in my practice and my personal life. Below, I will cover the most damaging combinations of food, then I will present suggestions for five balanced meals I'm sure you will enjoy. Avoid Eating Proteins & Starches in the Same Meal When animal proteins and starches are combined and metabolized, the end products are normally acidic. Your body should actually be slightly alkaline, not acidic. Your gastric juices contain three enzymes that act on proteins, fats, and milk; they are pepsin, [lipase](https://globalhealing.com/natural-health/lipase/), and rennin, respectively. Protein digestion requires an acid environment initiated by the secretion of pepsin into the stomach. Pepsin splits the protein molecule to form hydrochloric acid. As the stomach becomes more acidic while digesting protein, starch digestion comes to an end. We may say those conditions which are optimum for protein digestion, exclude starch digestion. Worse, the introduction of the starch almost neutralizes the stomach acid, thus deactivating the enzymes and creating the climate for putrefaction and fermentation. Non-starchy vegetables make for the best combinations with proteins. |For healthy meals, only combine proteins with non-starchy vegetables listed below.||Examples of unhealthy meals containing proteins and starches:| | | Starchy vegetables and grains (do not combine with protein): Bagels, beans, bread, corn, lentils, muffins, pasta, potatoes, tortillas, white rice, winter squash (butternut, acorn), yams. Non-starchy vegetables (best combined with protein): Alfalfa sprouts, artichokes, asparagus, bamboo shoots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, eggplant, green beans, leafy lettuce, leeks, mushrooms, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, rutabaga, sauerkraut, snow peas, spinach, summer squash, turnips, water chestnuts, zucchini. | | Breakfast: Eggs, bacon, milk, sausage, or cheese combined with bread (muffins, bagels, waffles, pancakes), potatoes, or tortillas. Lunch/Dinner: Red meat, sandwich meat, or chicken combined with a baked potato, French fries, pasta, or bread. Avoid Mixing Acid Foods With Starches in the Same Meal Unhealthy Example: Bread, Pasta, Rice, etc. + Any Acid Fruit or Fruit Juice The digestion of starches begins in the mouth with an enzyme called ptyalin (pronounced tie-uh-lun). Saliva, which is high in ptyalin, is secreted by the salivary glands and reduces starch to maltose, which in turn is reduced in the intestines to dextrose. Ptyalin will not activate in a mildly acidic or strong alkaline environment. The acid in regular vinegar, grapefruit, lemons, or other sour fruits will completely stop the action of ptyalin, resulting in a poorly digested meal. These meals will likely ferment, producing toxic byproducts as well as decreasing the nutritional value. Avoid Mixing Acid Foods With Proteins in the Same Meal Example: Meat + Any Acid Fruit or Fruit Juice Pepsin (an enzyme that digests protein) will act favorably in an acid environment. Therefore, you might think the addition of more acids, such as citrus fruits, might improve the digestive process. This is not so! The addition of citrus or other acids stops the secretion of the gastric juices necessary for protein digestion. Either the pepsin will not be secreted in the presence of an acid, or the acidic environment will destroy the pepsin. Any acid (say, vinegar or lemon) on a salad, when eaten with a protein meal, stops the production of hydrochloric acid since the pepsin interferes with protein digestion. An exception to this rule should be noted: Acids can be combined with nuts and seeds because the high-fat content of these foods will postpone gastric secretion until the acids have been assimilated into the body. Therefore, use raw nuts or seeds (not roasted or salted) with salads to neutralize the acids typically found in salad dressing. Avoid Mixing Meat, Cheese, or Milk in the Same Meal If two different types of high proteins are eaten together, the amount of digestive secretions for each might stop the action of the other. In other words, your body cannot modify the digestive process to accommodate each food. Suppose milk was eaten with meat, this would initiate a highly acidic reaction and upset the proportions of pepsin and lipase acting on the meat. Both proteins would not be fully digested, leading to the development of toxins. The Importance of Eating Alkaline Foods Alkaline-producing foods should be consumed 80 percent of the time. These foods aid in digestion, neutralize acids, and help restore the body's natural alkaline state. The following foods should always be consumed fresh, juiced, raw, or lightly steamed and should be locally or organically grown. Although some fruits are classified as acid fruits, once they are broken down in the body they convert the body fluids to an alkaline state. Highly alkaline-producing fruits and vegetables (sour), kale, plums, lemons, pomegranates, prunes, raisins, raspberries, romaine, and spinach. Other alkaline-producing fruits and vegetables: Alfalfa, apples, apricots, artichokes, bamboo shoots, beans (Snap, string, wax, navy), beet leaves, beets, berries (most), bok choy, broccoli, cabbage (red, white, savoy, Chinese), cantaloupe, celery, coconuts, horseradish, kelp, leeks, mangoes, nectarines, okra, onions, oranges, organic apple cider vinegar, papayas, parsnips, pears, pineapples, pumpkins, romaine lettuce, tangerines, tomatoes, turnips, and watermelon. Top 4 Healthy Oils to Include in Your Diet - Coconut Oil: Organic virgin coconut oil is one of the best choices of good fat you can add to your diet. Coconut oil contains 90 percent saturated fat and is made up of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which are easily digestible and can drastically improve your health. MCFAs are not stored as fat because they are immediately converted to energy once in the body. This oil is also very good to cook with because it remains stable even under high temperatures. Coconut oil contains lauric acid (a known immune stimulant), is rich in fiber, and contains essential vitamins and minerals. Organic raw, unrefined extra virgin coconut oil is the best to use and should be solid at room temperature. Benefits of consuming coconut oil include: Weight loss, immune system support, cardiovascular health, increased energy, thyroid support, healthy skin, hair and nails, improved cell regeneration, disables fungus, bacteria, and viruses, improves insulin secretions, and protection against free radicals. - Hemp Seed Oil: Hemp seed oil is derived from the seeds of the plant Cannabis sativa. It provides all the essential fatty acids (EFAs) and essential amino acids, structured in an easily digestible form to maintain human life. The oil is composed of 80 percent essential fatty acids, the highest in the plant kingdom. It contains Omega 3,6 and 9 fatty acids. No other plant oil has a perfect 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 EFAs. Hemp seed oil is also great for vegetarians because it provides them with healthy fatty acids without having to consume fish oil. Hempseed oil is also rich in vitamin E and is the only plant that provides a source of vitamin D. Benefits of consuming hemp seed oil include: Cardiovascular support, natural sunblock agent, helps high blood pressure, reduces PMS, lowers high cholesterol, reduces inflammation, calms arthritis, soothes eczema, assists the brain and nervous system, produces healthy cell membranes, healthy skin, nails, and hair, and can be used as skin moisturizer without clogging pores. - Flaxseed Oil: Flaxseed oil is extracted from the seeds of the flax plant. This oil contains 55 percent of omega-3 fatty acid by weight. Omega-3 refers to three types of fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Once consumed, the human body converts ALA to EPA and DHA. This oil is also high in fiber and potassium. Flaxseed oil requires special packaging because it is easily destroyed by oxygen, heat, and light. It is best to purchase organic flaxseed oil and keep it refrigerated to preserve freshness. Benefits of consuming flaxseed oil include: Helps Crohn's disease, colitis, soothes intestinal walls, natural laxative, reduces high cholesterol, promotes healthy hair, nails and skin, reduces symptoms of menopause and helps burn body fat. - Olive Oil: Olive oil has been used as a medicine and health aid since it was first cultivated around 5000 B.C. It is a monounsaturated fat and contains vital vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants. Olive oil has a large amount of vitamins A, D, and K, as well as vitamin E, which are key sources needed to prevent free radical damage. When purchasing, make sure the olive oil is organic, cold-pressed, and extra virgin. Benefits of consuming olive oil include: Promotes healthy digestion, protects against heart disease, eases symptoms of gastritis and ulcers, lowers gallstone formation, and reduces high cholesterol. Eating More Grain-Free Foods Some grains can be difficult for proper digestion, which is why I recommend making the switch to consuming foods that are grain-free and gluten-free. Common foods that are grains, or are made from grains: Rye, wheat, bran, Kamut, cornflour, corn, beer, cornmeal, spelt, oats, chicken, beef and vegetable stock. Avoid the following foods made from the list above: Biscuits, pizza, bagels, pasta, cakes, and bread crumbs. Common foods and flours that are grain-free: Arrowroot, almond starch, flour, tapioca, and cassava. Grain-free foods are always gluten-free. The Importance of a Gluten-Free Diet Wheat products contain the largest source of the protein Gluten. Gluten consists of two primary amino acids known as glutenin and gliadin. These amino acids contain four main proteins: prolamins, globulins, albumins, and glutelins. The most dangerous form to the body are glutelins, which cause gluten intolerance and allergic reactions. The human body does not produce the enzyme necessary to break down gluten, which means every single person who consumes it will have a negative immune reaction. The intake of gluten creates an autoimmune response whenever wheat or its proteins enter the body. An allergy to gluten may cause breathing difficulty, hives, headaches, fatigue, digestive problems, bloating, gas, or even celiac disease. Avoid the following foods that contain gluten: Cereal grains, wheat, rye, spelt, barley, white flour, durum wheat, Kamut, wheat germ, wheat bran, graham flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods. Replace with gluten-free alternatives. The Body Cleansing Diet Meal Plan Now that you've learned the basics about food mixing and optimal combinations, read on to find a ready-made diet plan that you can start today. This is no bland, uninspiring diet, either. The foods I've included (if prepared properly) are so loaded with energy and flavor, you won't ever want to return to eating the high-fat, processed foods we've become so accustomed. Eating five balanced meals at the recommended times each day can help restore the health of your body, and consequently restore and enhance your overall well-being. Meal #1: Breakfast (Fruit Meal) Have breakfast between 4 a.m. and 9 a.m. Eat organic fresh fruit or drink freshly squeezed fruit juice. Eat or drink only fruit. Try to mix up the fruits during the week. For example, do not eat bananas every morning. Try melons now and then, as they are one of the easiest foods to digest. Melons actually proceed directly to the intestines after being consumed. If they are held up in the stomach by other foods, they will decompose quickly and ferment. Melon is a great way to start the day. You can eat a variety of fruits throughout the whole morning, but never mix sweet fruits with acid fruits. It's okay to mix sweet with subacid or acid with subacid (see below). Eat as much as you want until you are full. Remember, we are supporting the body's elimination cycle in the morning. - Acid Fruits: Lemons, oranges, pineapples, strawberries, grapefruit, kumquats, tomatoes, tangerines, lime, sour grapes, and sour apples. (These fruits have the greatest body cleansing power). - Subacid Fruits: Apricots, apples, pears, nectarines, sweet plums, cherries, blackberries, blueberries, and cranberries. - Sweet Fruits: Bananas, papaya, dates, prunes, sweet grapes, cantaloupe, coconuts, mangos*, peaches, pears, watermelon, figs, pomegranates, honeydew melon, and persimmons. *Mangos are both sweet & subacidic. Meal #2: Mid-Morning Snack Should be eaten halfway between breakfast and lunch. For a nice brunch, choose option #1, #2, #3 or #4. (For example, you might eat #1 on Mondays, #2 on Tuesdays, #3 on Wednesdays, and so on.) Remember to chew your food well before swallowing. You can snack on one of the following items: - Raw Nuts or Seeds: My favorite! It's said that a handful of seeds will provide the body with 12 to 14 hours of energy. Many people have reported that after eating seeds for their mid-morning snack for three months, they noticed a 300 to 400 percent increase in their energy levels. Make sure your seeds or nuts are raw. Roasted seeds have lost their life force. For more flavor, you can mix in some hemp seed oil, garlic juice, balsamic vinegar, or organic apple cider vinegar. Choose from the following organic seeds & nuts: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, flax seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, pine nuts, pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, squash seeds, sunflower seeds, or walnuts. - Organic Super Green Food Supplement: Supplement with a high-quality organic green powder mix (wheatgrass, barley grass, spirulina, chlorella, etc.). Mix in a 16-ounce glass of room temperature purified water and add one teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar. This is fast and easy and provides your body with the nutritional value of five full salads! - Organic Goji Berries: If you're not familiar with the remarkable health benefits of organic goji berries, do yourself a favor and try them. They pack more nutritional value into each bite than just about any other food. Eat a couple handfuls to curb your appetite before your lunch meal. - Organic Avocado: Cut your avocado and sprinkle with fresh ground black or white pepper and squeeze fresh lime juice over it before eating. The pepper will help speed up your metabolism and the avocado contains the enzyme lipase. Foods containing lipase are the ones with naturally occurring \"good fat.\" New research from UCLA indicates organic avocados are the highest fruit source of lutein (a carotenoid that helps prevent eye disease) among the 20 most frequently eaten fruits. In addition, researchers found that avocados have nearly twice as much [vitamin E](https://globalhealing.com/natural-health/vitamin-e-foods/)as previously reported, making them the highest fruit source of this powerful antioxidant. Avocados also contain four times more beta-sitosterol than any other fruit. Some studies have found that the avocado's beta-sitosterol content, combined with its monounsaturated fat content, helps to lower cholesterol levels. Meal #3: Lunch (Vegetable + Starch Meal) Have lunch between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Choose two or three alkaline vegetables (no acidic ones) and combine with a salad of fresh spinach, mixed lettuce, and greens (such as arugula, beet greens, or kale). Organic salad dressing, a mixture of organic olive oil with balsamic vinegar or organic apple cider vinegar are excellent complements. Select only the red or dark-green leafy types of lettuce. Iceberg-type lettuces are usually hybrids and contain virtually zero nutritional value. Spinach (and baby spinach) is an excellent source of nutrients, and besides that, it tastes great in salads. You may also mix some raw seeds or nuts of your choice into the salad. Choose Two or Three Starchy Foods From Below To Accompany Your Salad: Potatoes (red, baked), beans, pumpkin, squash, gluten-free bread, gluten-free pasta, lentils, quinoa, sweet potatoes, rice (brown or wild), chickpeas, beets, or cauliflower. It's best to eat your food of choice raw, otherwise lightly steam, boil quickly, or bake. The more you cook food the less healthy it becomes. Meal #4: Mid-Afternoon Snack Should be eaten halfway between lunch and dinner. These options will be the same as your mid-morning snack (listed above). Choose options #1, #2, #3, or #4 (for example, you might eat #1 on Mondays, #2 on Tuesdays, #3 on Wednesdays, and so forth). Meal #5: Dinner (Vegetable + Fat + Protein Meal) It's best to have dinner between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. As with lunch, eat a large, fresh vegetable salad (with only alkaline vegetables) before anything else. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of organic flaxseed oil, cold-pressed olive oil, hemp seed oil, or coconut oil into your salad. This dressing will provide more flavor as well as the essential fatty acids your body needs. Although you need to pick one protein source for dinner, I strongly recommend you start slowly eliminating meat from your diet. The human body is an herbivore, not a carnivore. If you absolutely must have meat on occasion, limit it to one to two servings per week and make sure it's organic. Meat and dairy should come from range-fed animals raised without harmful antibiotics and hormones. Sources of protein: Legumes*, hemp milk, raw goat's milk, raw seeds, and raw nuts. *Legumes include beans and peas and can be a good source of protein if eaten with mixed vegetables (in a salad) or with a complete protein like nuts or seeds. On their own, legumes are incomplete proteins and contain only certain amino acids. If you want a little extra seasoning for your meal, Himalayan crystal salt is an excellent substitute for regular table salt and can perk up any dish! Make sure you don't overdo eating at dinner time. Let your appetite be your guide and (I'll say it again) chew your food thoroughly! The Body Cleansing Tips & Tricks - Do not eat fruits after meals. Fruit should always be consumed on an empty stomach. For example, if you eat a bagel and then some fruit, the fruit will be left in the stomach too long and cause the bagel to spoil, thereby creating an acid environment. - Always eat fruit before meals and wait 20 minutes for the fruit to move out of the stomach and into the small intestine before eating more food. When drinking fruit juice, make sure it is squeezed fresh and not from concentrate in a carton or can. If you drink the juice, hold it in your mouth for 10 seconds before swallowing to allow the enzymes in your mouth to work. According to Dr. Herbert Shelton, all fruit becomes alkaline in the body. If you eat fruit the right way, it keeps your body clean and increases your longevity. A quick and easy way to start body cleansing and look radiant is to do a three-day fruit fast. Eat and drink fresh organic fruit and fresh juices for three days. You will be amazed with the results. - Avoid drinking cold water with meals. The water will solidify the oils (fats) in the meal which will slow digestion. It's best to drink warm water during or after meals. Cold water will also cause the body to expend excess energy to warm the water to body temperature. - Don't eat wheat. According to cardiologist Dr. William Davis, the wheat people eat today is not the same as it was in the 1950s. The wheat people eat today is actually a genetically modified form that was developed in the 60s and 70s. This toxic wheat contains a protein called gliadin, which is an opiate that stimulate appetite and causes obesity. - Don't drink pasteurized cow's milk. Substitute with natural organic alternatives such as hemp milk, coconut milk, almond milk, or raw goat milk. - Avoid artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners are contained in diet sodas, other diet products, and listed in many ingredient panels. The most dangerous sugar substitutes approved for consumer use are: saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Sucralose and aspartame are the most damaging to your body. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as raw organic locally harvested honey, stevia, or coconut sugar. - Avoid refined sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Carbonated sodas are one of the most common sources of refined sugars in the American diet. \" [Energy drinks](https://globalhealing.com/natural-health/the-health-dangers-of-energy-drinks/)\" and commercial fruit juices are no better. Avoid the following label ingredients: Corn syrup, Molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose. - Avoid table salt: Table salt (sodium chloride) is dangerous to consume. It is refined and bleached and depleted of the vital minerals the body needs. It also contains additives that are harmful when ingested. Replace common table salt with Himalayan crystal salt, which is a healthier option. - Avoid white flour: White flour is made from stripping the bran from wheat, bleaching it to remove the yellow color, adding synthetic B vitamins, and increasing the amount of gluten the flour can produce. The synthetic vitamins that are added into the flour are toxic to the human body. Replace white flour with grain-free organic alternatives such as almond, buckwheat, or coconut flour. - Avoid soy products: Soybeans are high in phytic acid, which is damaging to the digestive tract and can block the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals like copper and calcium. Also, most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Fermented soy products, such as miso, tempeh, and natto, may be consumed and have been shown to prevent certain cancers and other diseases. - Avoid genetically modified foods. Called recombinant DNA technology, this technology changes the core genetic code of organisms. Scientists use this genetic manipulation to create any trait they wish, or suppress natural traits they don't want. GMO foods are extremely damaging to the body. The best way to avoid GMOs is to eat certified organic foods only. - Don't microwave your food. Using a microwave destroys and radiates all the nutrients in food and beverages. Use non-toxic cookware for preparing foods. - Avoid MSG (monosodium glutamate): A manufactured food additive, MSG is used to enhance the flavor in foods. MSG is injected into lab animals to induce obesity, so you can only imagine what it does to our bodies. Since the introduction of MSG, diabetes has doubled and the obesity rates have skyrocketed. MSG is hidden in many ingredients such as spices, corn oil, frozen and canned foods, infant formulas, foods labeled no added MSG, and cosmetics. See below for label ingredients to avoid. - Avoid the following label ingredients. Natural flavors, soy lecithin, titanium dioxide, autolyzed yeast, bouillon broth, calcium caseinate, hydrolyzed oat flour, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, malt extract, malt flavoring, plant protein extract, stock flavoring, textured protein and yeast extract, all yellow, red or blue dyes, carnauba wax, sodium citrate, anything hydrogenated, dextrin, gelatin, food starch-modified, artificial flavors, colorings and anything you do not know what it is.
