What Our Patients Are Saying: \"RIH should be your FIRST priority when seeking non-emergency medical care. Doctors at RIH have done things for me that my regular doctors said was impossible. I'm only using my PCP as a backup at this point. I believe 100% that you cannot be optimally well unless you are seeking holistic alternatives to synthetic drugs. Our bodies reject synthetic drugs and I suffered for YEARS before switching to a holistic \"drug\"! How much longer are you going to poison yourself? Join RIH and you won't regret it.\" Jay W. \"In 2016 I came to Robinhood after several friends had success there and my life has not been the same! I feel like I gained years back in energy levels, lost weight, and haven't had the stomach issues I previously battled at all. I'm incredibly grateful for their practice and their desire to heal instead of merely masking and treating issues. I cannot recommend them enough!\" Rhonda B. \"I started seeing Dr Wiggy several years ago and really like that his goal is to get to the root of problems rather than automatically writing prescriptions for meds. Big pharma seems to be dictating what doctors are allowed to do regardless of what's best for the patients. That is not the case at Robinhood Integrative. I love that they have a store with high quality supplements and the staff there are very helpful and knowledgeable about the products.\" Kim C. \"So very helpful and a wealth of knowledge. Very kind humans. So thankful for this place!\" Sherry B. \"Love everyone at this office. They go above and beyond to try and make your life easier. Always pleasant and kind. Very helpful and knowledgeable about their services and products. Definitely recommend!!\" Trisha \"Getting the whole view and real results is refreshing. Love the staff in the store!!\" Kevin H. \"I've been a patient here for nearly 10 years, after going through a gamut of a dozen specialists that couldn't figure out the root of my health problems. Dr L and his team are the most caring and knowledgeable folks! Docs that seek their wisdom from above and pray over their patients are truly special. The ladies in the RIH store are amazing, and super helpful every time! I can't recommend them enough!\" Amy D. \"Came to Robinhood in 2019 after 2 years of a chronic issue - after several tests and 2 weeks of following their advice, it was resolved and has stayed resolved. I have also been able to control my hypothyroidism that was constantly changing for almost 15 years. Very thankful for "}
