He is the founder and director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which offers educational information on Yoga philosophy, Ayurveda, and Vedic astrology. He works closely with the magazine Hinduism Today, where he is a frequent contributor.[1] He is associated with a number of Vedic organizations in several countries. He is a Vedic teacher (Vedacharya), Vaidya (Ayurvedic doctor), and a Jyotishi (Vedic astrologer). Excellent introduction to the science/art of Ayurveda. This was given to me as a birthday present by my best friend a couple of years ago and it really changed and improved my physical health. Critics and cynics will dismiss Ayurveda because it is an ancient science of health, body and spirit ranging from super practical advice to more \"woo woo\" stuff like astrological and past life considerations. However, after reading this book, figuring out my basic dosha set up, and then following some of the *very* basic guidelines Frawley sets forth, I was able to cut down dramatically on medication that beforehand I had to take every day, I lost excess weight, improved in memory and muscle tone, and most crucial to me, learned a host of ways to prevent minor health irritations before they start. For those who practice yoga, Ayurveda is a path that blends incredibly well (surprise, surprise) but the tips and techniques that Frawley recommends could be incorporated into anyone's lifestyle. It is not a book. It's a TEXTBOOK. Just like the one we had in our engineering days e.g. Theory of Machines, Engineering Design, etc My second book on Ayurveda. The subject continues to blow me away. It feels odd to read a book on ancient Indian text by an author who is not born in India. But Dr David has done full justice to the subject. Warning: Do not rush to finish it. It needs to be understood, gulped, maybe, implemented, and learnt. Too difficult a subject and I may also order a soft copy as I'm sure I'll keep on going back to this book for all my life. This is an in-depth overview of ayruvedic principles. It's a great read for anyone wanting to learn more. It discusses food intake, various ailments and how they would be treated, and touches on many other matters. "}
