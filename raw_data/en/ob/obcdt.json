Luckily, I was not, in fact, being hospitalized for a major health condition, but was instead undergoing a blood ozonation and oxygenation protocol in prep for the \"Full Body Stem Cell Makeover Protocol\" by my friends Dr. Harry Adelson and Dr. Amy Killen. Here's a brief description of how it works. First, my blood was \"cleaned\" with a process called ozone dialysis or EBO2 (extra-corporeal blood oxygenation and ozonation). A dialysis machine basically pumps blood out of one arm into a filter where ozone gas is pumped to \"hyper oxygenate\" the blood, and the blood then passes through ultraviolet light. This causes the blood to turn from dark red to light red in color, and that light red \"clean and filtered\" blood is injected back into my body. Now, this process is done before the Full Body Stem Cell Makeover in order to start the procedure with clean, purified blood. Next comes the full body stem cell procedure, which, after a bone marrow aspiration, includes \"orthopedic\" stem cell injections along the spine and in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, thumbs, hips, knees, ankles, and toes; \"cosmetic injections\" in the scalp, face, injections\" as well as [shockwave therapy](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/ben-recommends/other-products/gainswave/) for men. So, what's the point of this procedure and why would anyone even want to mess around with all these needles? Typically, Full Body Stem Cell Makeovers are used by either a) those who have full-body arthritis looking for relief, or b) \"biohackers\" that want to prevent any age-related complications in the future. I'm in the latter camp, and personally, after two of these procedures now ( [you can learn more about the first one here](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/anti-aging-podcasts/stem-cell-makeover/)), I've experienced an improvement in sleep, faster recovery post-workout, less pain and stiffness in my neck and joints, as well as improved sexual experience in terms of firmness of the erection, the orgasm, etc. It's basically like an oil change for the body, completely non-invasive, pain-free, and easy to do. All that to say, in today's podcast episode, I'm interviewing the doctors at [Docere Clinics](http://www.docereclinics.com/) behind this stem cell makeover, Dr. Harry Adelson and Dr. Amy Killen. About Harry Adelson MD: Dr. Adelson began his training in prolotherapy in 1998 while in his final year at [The National College of Naturopathic Medicine](https://nunm.edu/), in Portland, Oregon. During his residency program at the [Yale/Griffin Hospital](https://www.griffinhealth.org/Griffin-Hospital) in Derby, Connecticut, he volunteered after hours in a large homeless shelter in Bridgeport, Connecticut, providing regenerative injection therapies to the medically underserved while gaining valuable experience. He opened [Docere Clinics](http://www.docereclinics.com/) in Salt Lake City in 2002 and from day one, his practice has been 100% regenerative injection therapies for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions. In 2006, he incorporated platelet-rich plasma and ultrasound-guided injection into his armamentarium, in 2010, bone marrow aspirate concentrate and adipose-derived stem cells, and in 2013, fluoroscopic-guided injection (motion X-ray). Since February of 2010, Dr. Adelson has performed over 3,000 bone marrow and adipose-derived adult stem cell procedures, placing him among those most experienced in the world with the use of autologous stem cells for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions. About Dr. Amy Killen: A board-certified in Emergency Medicine with 10+ years of direct patient care, Dr. Amy Killen has been practicing anti-aging and regenerative medicine for more than five years. She is fellowship-trained through the [American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine](https://www.a4m.com/) and has done extensive additional training in aesthetics, platelet-rich plasma and stem cells, hair restoration, bio-identical hormones, nutrition, fitness, and sexual health. Dr. Killen is the Medical Director of [BioRestoration Medical](https://biorestoration.com/), a busy clinic with a comprehensive, integrative approach to health located in Draper, Utah. She also works at [Docere Medical](http://www.docereclinics.com/) in Park City, Utah with Dr. Harry Adelson, providing cutting-edge regenerative medical treatments for a host of different conditions. She has spoken internationally about PRP and stem cells, as well as sexual longevity and skin health. She also teaches physician training courses, outlining current best practices for using regenerative medicine in aesthetics and sexual optimization.
