They engaged in an ongoing battle for public opinion with medical and scientic elites, who responded with their own counterpropaganda. These ideological struggles reflected fear that scientic advances were being put to coercive uses and that institutions of the state and civil society were increasingly expanding into previously private realms of de- cision making, especially child rearing. This essay analyzes the motivations and tactics of antivaccination activists and situates their actions within the scientic and social climate of the Progressive Era and the 1920s. Their actions reveal how citizens of varied ideo- logical persuasions, activists and nonactivists alike, viewed scientic knowledge during a period of swift and unsettling change, when the application of biologic products seemed to hold peril as well as promise. In the summer of 1914, eleven-year-old Lewis Freeborn Loyster died three weeks after being vaccinated in the small town of Cazenovia, in central New York. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be infantile paralysis, and the boy's father, James, was convinced that vaccination was responsible. Spurred by grief, James Loyster began can- vassing the cities and towns in the region for stories of children who had been similarly harmed and soon reached two conclusions: that the deaths alleged to have been caused byvaccination far outnumbered those from smallpox itself, and that sentiment in the area ran strongly against the practice\u2014\"a feeling almost insurrectionary in its intensity,\" heclaimed. 1Loyster, who was active in Republican Party politics in the region, collected his ndings into an illustrated pamphlet, which he distributed to members of the state legis- lature in an effort, ultimately successful, to overhaul the state's compulsory vaccination law for students in public schools. * Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health, Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168th Street, Ninth Floor, New York, New York 10032.

In addition to questioning the value of orthodox medicine, their arguments were strongly inflected with libertarian, antigov-ernment views and emphasized the protection of children from state intervention. They scored numerous legislative and rhetorical victories, engaging their opponents\u2014public health ofcials, physicians, and scientists\u2014in an ongoing battle for public opinion. This essay examines the contested status of vaccination during the rst decades of the twentieth century, as developments in scientic medicine sparked debates about the roleelite knowledge should play in a rapidly changing democratic society. I describe the diverse voices that made up the antivaccination movement, the arguments they put forth, and the responses of public health and medical professionals. Opponents of vaccination brought about changes in law and policy around the country and in so doing left a legacy that hadprofound consequences for all vaccines that would be introduced in subsequent years.Their actions reveal how citizens of varied ideological persuasions, activists and nonac-tivists alike, viewed scientic knowledge during a period of swift and unsettling social change, when the application of biologic products seemed to hold peril as well as promise. VACCINATION, SAFETY, AND COMPULSION Opposition to vaccination, from its introduction at the beginning of the nineteenth century, was based on the linked claims that it was dangerous and that to compel it through law was an unacceptable invasion of personal liberty. Vaccination replaced inoculation, an older method of immunization in which smallpox material was transferred from the arm of a sick person to that of a healthy one to induce a milder form of the illness. Inoculation could inadvertently spread smallpox instead of preventing it and could transfer other blood-borne diseases as well. Vaccination, in contrast, involved the use of cowpox, a related disease that produced only mild illness in humans and provided cross-protection against its more dangerous cousin. After the use of vaccine made from glycerinated calf's lymph began to replace arm-to-arm transfer of disease material in the 1860s, the risk of acciden- tally spreading contagion declined. But poorly performed vaccinations and the use of 2This topic has only recently received attention from scholars. See Robert D.

But after the turn ofthe century, practitioners increasingly insisted that vaccine-related injury was a thing ofthe past. \"That tetanus, erysipelas and general infection have had their origin in the vac-cination abrasion or sore we cannot nor do we wish to deny,\" conceded a 1915 editorialin one medical journal, but such unfortunate incidents \"under the present federal super-vision can hardly occur again.\" One health department pamphlet assured the public that\"the chance of harm to-day from vaccination is very remote when the number of ill resultsis compared with the great number being vaccinated.\" When injuries occurred, healthofcials contended, it was because proper hygienic care had not been taken with thevaccination scab. \"Vaccination necessitates the production of an abrasion which is liableto the same infections to which wounds from other causes are subject,\" said one physician.\"Most of these infections occur in children in whom cleanliness and the subsequent careof the vaccination are but little regarded.\" 5 The improved safety of the vaccine coincided with a change in the epidemiology of smallpox. A milder form of the disease, variola minor, rst appeared in the United States in 1897 and over the following two decades became the dominant strain. Although thepustular rash that spread across the body was similar to that seen in classic smallpox(variola major ), the new form was less debilitating and left less scarring afterward. In contrast to the fatality rates of 20 to 30 percent that were typical of variola major, only rarely did a victim die from variola minor. 6As a result of this epidemiological shift, vaccination came to seem more dangerous and increasingly unjustied in the minds ofthose inclined to oppose it. A smallpox attack in a community no longer provoked theurgency that had led people to seek vaccination, and adverse events arising from the 3On inoculation in the colonial period see Elizabeth A.

Decades of court challenges to these exercises of authority culminated in 1905, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling afrming the constitutionality of com- pulsory vaccination laws in the case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts.8In the wake of the ruling judicial challenges declined, and activists increasingly turned to their legislatures to achieve what they were unable to win in the courts. But neither the epidemiological va- garies of smallpox nor the perceived or actual frequency of vaccine injuries fully accounts for the vehemence and persistence of the antivaccinationists' efforts during this era tochange laws and practices around the country. Antivaccinationism was a response to twobroad and interrelated trends in the new century: rst, the proliferation of biologic productsfor preventing and treating illness; and, second, reform efforts that expanded the reach of the state into previously private spheres. Together, these two developments fueled bitter debates about whether the government and civic institutions should use advances in sci-entic medicine to dictate the actions of individuals. THE STATUS OF SCIENCE AND THE REACH OF THE STATE The pharmaceutical industry grew rapidly during this period, and drug rms became morerigorously scientic, employing larger staffs with training in bacteriology and medicine.As techniques for research, production, and marketing all became more sophisticated, companies brought many new products to market and established close relationships with universities, pharmacists, and the medical community. Vaccines against several diseases,including cholera, plague, and typhoid, were developed, and by the 1910s the term \"vac-cine,\" which originally had meant only the preparation of cowpox that provided immunityagainst smallpox, began to be applied more broadly to any preparation designed to produce active immunity. \"The term vaccine,\" wrote the director of the U.S. Hygienic Laboratory in 1916, \"has become too widely used, in its extended sense, to attempt to limit it at present to the original application.\" The typhoid vaccine proved the most valuable of these prod-ucts because of its use in the military, where it had a substantial impact on troop mortality. Because the vaccine required a series of three shots over several months and conferred only short-term immunity, it was never widely used among civilians, though it was rec-ommended for people living or traveling in areas with poor sanitation. 9 7Dr. Hervey to Deputy Commissioner, 27 Dec. 1926, NYSDOH, Series 13855-84, Reel 11. 8John Duffy, \"School Vaccination: The Precursor to School Medical Inspection,\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, 1978, 33:344-355; and Jacobson v.

Press, 1995).JAMES COLGROVE 171 Scientic breakthroughs gained widespread attention in the press, as did the prospect that other diseases would yield to the principles of immunization that had brought smallpoxunder control. Newspaper and magazine articles expressed hope that prophylactic \"serums\"to combat tuberculosis, pneumonia, and cancer might soon be developed, and Americanslooked optimistically to the improvements in their quality of life that such innovationspromised. But these developments also provoked an antimodernist backlash against thepaternalistic and potentially coercive uses to which scientic advances might be put. An-tivaccination literature of the period reflected a pervasive fear that new vaccines and treat-ments\u2014with all of their unknown and untoward side effects\u2014would be made mandatory.The brief that Henning Jacobson, the plaintiff in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, led with the Supreme Court gave voice to this concern: The present tendency of medical science is toward the treatment of contagious diseases by the use of serums, and it is entirely possible that public authorities and physicians may be encour-aged to extend the vaccination scheme to all other contagious diseases and set up a generalcompulsory medical regime, which will subject a healthy community to attack by boards ofhealth under compulsory laws. If it be justiable to compel the inoculation of a citizen for onedisease, then by a parity of reasoning it is for the public interest that every citizen should be inoculated to render him immune against all possible contagions which may menace the com- munity. 10 Dovetailing with these scientic advances were broad social changes that altered the re- lationship between the citizen and the collective, as new institutions of the administrativestate and civil society expanded their purview over matters once reserved to the individual, the family, or the church. Agents of expertise and authority such as social workers, visiting nurses, and educators, employed in both the public and private sectors, represented a threatto autonomy over family decision making. In part because of the rise of workers' com-pensation programs, physical examination of employees became widespread in many in-dustries after 1910. Around the same time, major life insurance companies began requiring such exams for their policyholders. 11Whereas Americans in previous decades may have gone most of their lives without seeing a doctor, they increasingly came under the scrutinyof health professionals as part of the emerging practice of preventive medicine. In 1914 S. S. Goldwater, New York City's health commissioner, announced his support for a plan (which was never instituted) to conduct mandatory annual medical inspections of all cityresidents for their own good. \"I, for one, am not willing to cease short of a radical changein the manner of applying medical knowledge,\" Goldwater said. \"Preventive medicinecannot do its utmost good until physicians are regularly employed by the entire population, 10Jacobson v.

Elite knowledge formed the basis on which experts could claim to be better qualied than parents to judge the well-being of children, and it was the medical control of childrenthat fueled the most heated reactions from antivaccinationists. The periodic medical in-spection of children in public schools, which had originated in the nineteenth century for controlling acute infectious diseases, was expanded in the early twentieth century to in- clude screening for hidden or chronic conditions such as tonsillitis and vision defects. Such programs heightened anxiety that government bureaucrats were seeking to use bacteriology as a covert means of removing children from the control of their parents. \"Little by little,\" wrote one activist in 1920, \"an effort is being made to bring about the medical dominationof the schools and the children attending them.\" 13The federal Children's Bureau, estab- lished in 1912, distributed millions of health education pamphlets aimed at teaching sci- entically based methods of child rearing to mothers around the country.14Perhaps the most extreme example of the medical control of children was the tuberculosis \"preven- torium\" movement. These specially designed sanatoria were intended to provide a betterenvironment for \"pretubercular\" children\u2014those discovered through laboratory exami-nation to be infected with the tubercle bacillus but not yet exhibiting symptoms\u2014thanthey would experience at home. Separation from parents was a cornerstone of an overall plan to protect the children from unhealthy influences, and although the transfer of a child to a preventorium was ostensibly voluntary, there was sometimes implied coercion by thecharitable organizations and health ofcials toward the poor, often immigrant families whom illness had struck. 15 Closely related to concerns about the overreaching efforts of child welfare reformers were controversies over \"state medicine,\" a protean term that encompassed a range of government programs to provide for health care through mechanisms such as universal 12S.

Fund Quart., 1978, 56:403-425; and Davidovitch, \"Negotiating Dissent\" (cit. n. 2). 14Child welfare reforms during this period were multifaceted, of course, and included many realms beyond health, most notably the creation of new systems of juvenile justice and changes in child labor laws.

Press, Belknap, 1992), pp. 480-524; and Linda Gordon, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare, 1890 -1935 (New York: Free Press, 1994).

See also more recent evaluations such as Alan Dawley, Struggles for Justice: Social Responsibility and the Liberal State (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1991). 15The rst preventorium was founded by the New York City philanthropist and child welfare reformer Nathan Straus in 1909, and by the end of the next decade approximately fty had been established around the country.See Cynthia Connolly, \"Prevention through Detention: The Pediatric diss., Univ. Pennsylvania, 1999).JAMES COLGROVE 173 health insurance and publicly funded clinics. To proponents of such programs, state med- icine was a rational and economically efcient way of dealing with the vagaries of illnessin society; to opponents, it represented an insidious attempt to transform the country into a socialistic state. Legally mandated vaccination, provided at public expense by city-em- ployed doctors, was a paradigmatic example of the evils of state medicine. The campaign during the 1910s to establish a nationwide system of compulsory health insurance was atthe center of extensive public debates about state medicine. In the 1920s, the lightning rodfor criticism of expanding government involvement in health care was the enactment ofthe Sheppard-Towner Act, the culmination of years of efforts by Progressive reformers to devote federal monies toward the betterment of mothers and children. Enacted in 1921, Sheppard-Towner provided federal matching funds to help states set up programs to im-prove maternal and child health and required the establishment of a state-level bureaucracyto administer the work. 16To its opponents, Sheppard-Towner embodied the creeping ex- pansion of a distant, centralized government, a trend that was especially threatening amid the postwar backlash against socialism. The antistatist mood of the period was captured in 1921 in the words of a congressional representative who attacked \"Government super- vision of mothers; Government care and maintenance of infants; Government control ofeducation; Government control of training for vocations; Government regulation of em- ployment, the hours, holidays, wages, accident insurance and all.\" 17 While suspicion of science and orthodox medicine and an antistatist ideology hostile to government intrusion in personal behavior provided common ground for antivaccination- ists, this surface similarity masked important differences in background and outlook.Health ofcials of the day generally characterized antivaccination activism as a homoge-neous movement, referring dismissively to \"the anti's,\" and commentators in the popularpress echoed this simplistic assessment. But it is erroneous to view the opposition to vaccination that took place across the nation during this period as representing a single, unied phenomenon. Antivaccination activity in the early twentieth century comprised aheterogeneous assortment of individuals and organizations that differed in their beliefs, tactics, and goals. THE DIVERSITY OF ANTIVACCINATIONISM One of the most prominent groups was the Anti-Vaccination League of America, whichwas formed in Philadelphia in 1908 by two wealthy businessmen, John Pitcairn and CharlesM. Higgins. The group described itself as a \"national confederation\" of afliated societies in states around the country, and its members devoted themselves to opposing compulsory laws at the state and local levels. 18Pitcairn, the group's president, was born in Scotland in 1841 and immigrated as a teenager to western Pennsylvania, where he eventually made 16On the campaign to establish a nationwide system of comprehensive health insurance see Ronald Numbers, Almost Persuaded: American Physicians and Compulsory Health Insurance (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ.

He was a civic leader in the town of Bryn Athyn, near Pittsburgh, where he had an estate; he was also an active member in and majorbenefactor of the Swedenborgian Church. Pitcairn came to the antivaccination cause latein life, after he became engulfed in a controversy in 1906 among church members whoresisted the state's efforts to vaccinate them during a smallpox outbreak. Pitcairn's oppo-sition to vaccination was rooted partly in Swedenborgian teachings and in his devotion tohomeopathy, an alternative medical practice that many church members embraced. He wasalso influenced by the fact that, years earlier, his son Raymond had suffered an adverse reaction after being vaccinated as a child. Yet his position did not rest primarily on groundsof theology or medical practice but, rather, on a political basis: he believed it was wrong for government, no matter how worthy its intentions, to force people to act against their will. In a tract that cited, among other works, John Stuart Mill's classic defense of indi- vidual rights in the philosophical treatise On Liberty, Pitcairn asked rhetorically, \"We have repudiated religious tyranny; we have rejected political tyranny; shall we now submit to medical tyranny?\" 19(See Figure 1.) After determining that Pennsylvania's efforts to compel his fellow Swedenborgians to be vaccinated was unjust, Pitcairn became politically active, lobbying the state's generalassembly in Harrisburg for the repeal of the compulsory vaccination law, and in 1911 the governor appointed him to serve on a special commission to investigate the practice (after three years of study the panel recommended, over Pitcairn's minority objection, that thelaw be retained). 20In 1908, as part of his newfound interest in the topic, Pitcairn bankrolled a national conference of vaccination opponents, held in Philadelphia, that led to the found-ing of the Anti-Vaccination League of America. The league's cofounder, secretary, and most active member was Pitcairn's friend Charles M. Higgins of Brooklyn. Higgins had much in common with Pitcairn; he had emigratedfrom Ireland as a child and made his fortune as a manufacturer of a special type of ink heinvented. He was also active in civic affairs, donating money for the renovation of historicsites in Brooklyn and serving as a cofounder of the Kings County Historical Society. Higgins was the league's chief spokesman and pamphleteer, writing numerous polemical tracts such as Open Your Eyes Wide! (1912), The Crime against the School Child (1915), Vaccination and Lockjaw: The Assassins of the Blood (1916), and Horrors of Vaccination Exposed and Illustrated (1920), which regaled readers with graphic descriptions and pho- tographs of hapless victims who had been disgured, blinded, and killed by vaccination. 21 He made numerous attempts to overturn New York State's law mandating the practice forstudents in public schools. (See Figure 2.) Another influential group in this period was the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, founded in New York City in 1919.

Little is known about the life of H. B.

This 1912 broadside, published by the Anti-Vaccination League of America, was aimed at various constituencies that might be in a position to oppose compulsory laws in their communities. Anderson also published a monthly bulletin that he sent to supporters (and opponents) and used as a lobbying tool in his efforts to repeal compulsory laws. In addition to opposing vaccination, Anderson spoke out at public forums and meetings on a wide range of health policy issues, including the medical examination of schoolchil-dren, requirements for premarital syphilis tests, and government antidiphtheria efforts. In1922 he entered a formal protest with the New York City Board of Education in which heurged it to bar health department doctors from using the city's children as guinea pigs inthe experimental use of toxin-antitoxin to produce active immunity against diphtheria.\"The public schools should not be used for the exploitation of a medical procedure whichis of such a controversial character,\" Anderson claimed. He was convinced that the healthdepartment was taking the rst steps toward making diphtheria immunization compulsory, like smallpox vaccination. The common theme uniting these topics was the specter of\"state medicine,\" which Anderson attacked in a 1920 book as \"a state (or Federal) systemof administration of compulsory allopathic medicine . . . untrammeled in the exercise of authority, reaching down through the subdivisions of county and township to the people; ...i n daily touch with every nook and corner of the state or nation.\" 22(See Frontispiece.) 22H.

Anderson, Protest against Sending Nurses into Homes of School Children to Urge Medical Treatment, and against Using Public Schools to Promote the Schick Test, and Toxin -Antitoxin (New York: Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, 1922); and Anderson, State Medicine (cit. n. 12), p. 15.JAMES COLGROVE 177 The Citizens Medical Reference Bureau had a family tie to the Anti-Vaccination League of America: its work was supported by two of John Pitcairn's sons, Harold and Raymond.The extent of the Pitcairn brothers' substantive involvement in the work of the bureau isuncertain; they served as directors from the 1920s through the 1940s, and it is likely thattheir primary role was in providing the nancial support that made the organization's manypublications possible. Illustrating the extent to which libertarian ideology was a part ofsome antivaccinationists' worldview, both Harold and Raymond Pitcairn were also majornancial backers of Sentinels of the Republic, a right-wing political organization foundedin 1922 and devoted to opposing the concentration of government power, counteractingradicalism and Bolshevism, and \"checking the growth of Federal paternalism.\" For twodecades the group fought against a variety of social reforms it viewed as communistic,including laws aimed at limiting child labor, a proposal for a federal department of edu-cation, and Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal program. 23 Founded around the same time as the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, and similar in its outlook and mission, was the American Medical Liberty League, which foughtongoing battles during the 1920s against what it saw as the hegemony of allopathic prac-tice. The group's letterhead described it as \"a citizen's movement for medical liberty onthe same basis as religious liberty with the same constitutional guarantees.\" The league'ssecretary was Lora C. W. Little, who had an active and successful career as an antivac-cination agitator dating from the turn of the century. She was the editor and publisher forve years of the Liberator, a \"journal of health and freedom,\" in Minnesota, and she preached a message of freedom from medical tyranny during travels in England, Scotland,and Massachusetts before settling in Portland, Oregon, where from 1909 to 1918 she ledactivities against the state's compulsory vaccination law. As the Liberty League's secretaryand chief propagandist, Little published a monthly newsletter from the group's Chicagoheadquarters and sought to influence policy and law not only in Illinois but around thecountry; like Anderson, she conducted national letter-writing campaigns, engaging withhealth ofcials in Washington, D.C., and in state capitals. Like the Anti-VaccinationLeague, the Liberty League had afliated chapters across the country, although the extentof the membership in these local societies is difcult to determine. 24 The rhetoric of \"medical liberty\" groups emphasized the legal and political aspects of vaccination; it was compulsion they found most objectionable. Other groups, however,objected to the practice because it was antithetical to a vision of health, healing, and thebody. Perhaps the best known of these were Christian Scientists. Founded by Mary BakerEddy in Massachusetts in 1879, Christian Science was premised on a belief that illnesswas a mental rather than a material phenomenon and as such could be overcome throughprayer. Its adherents rejected allopathic medical interventions such as pharmaceutical treat-ments and surgery (though some did consult dentists and oculists). Christian Science grewrapidly around the turn of the century, counting roughly forty thousand followers by 1906, 23Norman Hapgood, ed., Professional Patriots (New York: Boni, 1927), pp. 170-172. On the Sentinels of the Republic see also Walter I. Trattner, Crusade for the Children: A History of the National Child Labor Committee and Child Labor Reform in America (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1970), pp. 166-167. The Pitcairn sons' commitment to the cause championed by their father recalls a similar legacy in Britain, where the work of one of the mostprominent antivaccinationists of the nineteenth century, William Tebb, was carried on by his son, W. Scott Tebb.See W. Scott Tebb, A Century of Vaccination and What It Teaches (London: Swan Sonnenschein, 1899), which the younger Tebb dedicated to his father. 24An excellent account of Little's life and career is provided in Johnston, Radical Middle Class (cit. n. 2), pp. 197-217, from which this biographical sketch is drawn. In 1922 the letterhead of the American Medical LibertyLeague listed afliates in thirty-six states and the District of Columbia.178 \"SCIENCE IN A DEMOCRACY\" and experienced a corresponding degree of public scrutiny and, often, hostility. Sensational cases of children dying, especially from diphtheria, while under the care of ChristianScientist parents and practitioners drew the wrath of the public, lawmakers, and ofcials,who increasingly brought charges of manslaughter and unlawful practice of medicine. Inthis hostile environment, the church adopted a stance that accommodation with the lawwherever possible might be the better part of valor. Eddy told her followers in an ofcialchurch publication in 1901, \"Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vac-cinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will dothe children no harm.\" Around the same time she enjoined church members from publish-ing materials \"uncharitable or impertinent towards religion, medicine, the courts, or thelaws of our land.\" 25Christian Scientists were thus not highly visible in spreading an an- tivaccination message in the early part of the century. Under frequent attack in the courts,they largely focused their advocacy efforts on changing the state laws that barred themfrom practicing medicine. Individual adherents of the religion, however, evaded compul-sory laws, either taking advantage of lax enforcement or homeschooling their childrenwhen necessary, and attempted to sway legislators who were considering bills related tovaccination. The Christian Science Monitor also reported on the activities of antivaccin- ation societies. 26 Another health movement that was antagonistic to vaccination, though less based in religion and spirituality, was physical culture. Founded and popularized by the tness guruBernarr Macfadden, physical culture entailed a spartan regimen of strenuous exercise, adiet of natural foods, and abundant exposure to fresh air and sunlight. Macfadden and hisfollowers urged periodic fasting and opposed the consumption of coffee, alcohol, andtobacco. The movement rejected the germ theory and contended that those who lived aclean, natural life were not susceptible to disease. Macfadden's persistent opposition tovaccination dated from early in his career. In 1901, the Physical Culture Publishing Com-pany issued the book Vaccination a Crime, which portrayed Edward Jenner's method as a dangerous delusion advanced to maintain the hegemony of allopathic medicine. 27 After establishing numerous exercise schools and sanatoria and the monthly tness magazine Physical Culture, Macfadden built a media empire publishing tabloid magazines such as True Story and True Detective Mysteries and the New York Evening Graphic, a 25Eddy is cited in Rennie B.

While Macfadden did not devote his energies to the antivaccination cause as single-mindedly as the prolic pam-phleteers Charles Higgins and H. B. Anderson, he was arguably more influential becausehe was able to reach a far wider audience: during the 1920s the total nationwide circulationof his media holdings was estimated at as many as forty million people. Both Physical Culture and the Graphic ran numerous articles opposing vaccination. In a 1922 article in Physical Culture, for example, Macfadden claimed that deaths from vaccination outnum- bered those from smallpox itself and that \"it is now admitted by many of the ablest phy-sicians and scientists that the constitutional taint produced by vaccination causes a tendencytowards all pus-forming diseases like catarrh, consumption, pneumonia, etc.\" The Graphic featured an article allegedly written by a physician entitled \"Vaccination Killed My TwoSisters\" (which Macfadden subsequently confessed was not written by a doctor at all) andran a series of photographs of people whose ghastly skin diseases had been caused byvaccination. Macfadden also used his magazine's mailing lists to urge readers to opposeNew York's compulsory law. This lobbying effort foreshadowed greater political involve-ment for Macfadden, who went on to run (unsuccessfully) for public ofce several times. 28 Ideals of bodily integrity also lay behind the opposition of another newly prominent form of healing: chiropractic. Founded in 1895, chiropractic stressed a holistic view ofhealth and the belief that illness stemmed from an imbalance of or interference with theflow of energy from the brain, usually produced by misalignment of the spine. Chiroprac-tors, embracing drugless healing and ghting disease through natural means such as skel-etal adjustments, rejected the interventionist view of disease prevention that vaccinationrepresented. Practitioners and their devotees advocated against the procedure through theirjournals and pamphlets, lobbied legislators and other public ofcials, and frequently madepublic protests out of their refusal to comply with compulsory vaccination laws. 29The opposition of chiropractors may in one sense be seen as the last salvos in the decades-longbattle between alternative and allopathic physicians for status and authority. The ghtbetween regular and sectarian practitioners such as chiropractors, homeopaths, and natu-ropaths, centering on issues such as licensing and medical education, was coming to anend in the Progressive Era, especially after the famous Flexner Report in 1910 dealt asymbolic if not actual deathblow to the legitimacy of alternative sects. Chiropractors werethe most active among sectarian practitioners in their opposition to vaccination; althougha vocal minority of homeopaths opposed the practice, many supported it. 30 28The 1922 article is cited in Grace Perkins, Chats with the Macfadden Family (New York: Copeland, 1929), p. 81.

On the end of the ght180 \"SCIENCE IN A DEMOCRACY\" Because smallpox vaccine was made from the lymph of calves deliberately infected with cowpox, vaccination also drew the wrath of antivivisection groups. Antivivisectionistsdid not necessarily believe that vaccination was ineffective; rather, they held that the suffering it imposed on animals made its use ethically unjustiable. Although animal rightsactivism lacked the explicit libertarianism that underpinned much antivaccination rhetoric,it expressed a similar belief that the scientic establishment could not be trusted to act in the best interests of the public, and the two movements had a long association dating from their origins in mid-nineteenth-century England. American antivivisectionists experienceda heyday at the turn of the twentieth century, when they enjoyed wide public recognitionand support. Their battles to end the use of animals in laboratory experimentation were largely unsuccessful, however, and the steady increase in the prestige of scientic inquiry eclipsed their efforts. 31 As these brief sketches have shown, the antivaccination camp encompassed a wide range of beliefs and activities, and it is difcult to generalize about the people who made up this heterogeneous movement. Most of the authors of antivaccination tracts and pamphlets were men (Lora Little being a notable exception), but the ofcers and directors listed on groups' letterheads and publications included a few women. Many women were Christian Scientist practitioners and teachers, and the majority of antivivisection activists were women. While some prominent antivaccinationists had considerable nancial resourcesand social standing, it is also clear that many of those who spurned the practice were of the middle class. 32One very signicant personal characteristic shared by prominent activ- ists was family tragedy: Henning Jacobson, John Pitcairn, James Loyster, and Lora Little all had children who had either died or suffered injury following vaccination. Activism and lobbying represented only part of the overall picture of public opposition, of course. Far greater were the numbers of ordinary citizens who opposed the practice not because of philosophical principles but because they objected to the discomfort and in- convenience\u2014the transient fever and swelling caused by vaccination often resulted in time missed from work\u2014in the absence of an imminent threat of disease. For example,the crusading spirit of Higgins, Little, and Anderson contrasted sharply with the pragmatic concerns of the more than one hundred residents of Van Buren, Arkansas, who in 1918 took the unusual step of petitioning President Woodrow Wilson to excuse them from the state's new compulsory vaccination law, citing both the $1.00 cost of the procedure and attendant economic losses: between regular and sectarian practitioners, and the ascendancy of the former, see Kenneth Ludmerer, Learning to Heal: The Development of American Medical Education (New York: Basic, 1985); and Paul Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine (New York: Basic, 1982). 31Susan Eyrich Lederer, 76:31-48; Lederer, \"Political Animals: The Shaping Research Literature in Twentieth-Century America,\" ibid., 1992, 83:61-79; and Lederer, \"The Controversy over Animal Experimentation in America, 1880-1914,\" in Vivisection in Historical Perspective, ed.

According to the Laws of this State, we are forced to send our children to School (which is right) But if we have our Children Vaccinated now, It will keep them out of the eld untill School begins, Then School, and after loosing as many boys as we have, who are in the Army, it will make it impossiable for us to harvest what crop wehave, and sow our Wheat and other Fall crops without a loss to one or the other. 33 The most familiar public face of the antivaccination movement emerged through its literature. The numerous tracts, pamphlets, and books emphasized the danger of the pro-cedure in rhetoric that tended to be highly polemical, designed to incite outrage and publicrevolt. Vaccination was \"barbarous medical child-slaughter,\" while its compulsory enforce-ment was \"based upon superstition, commercialism and paternalism.\" Vivid descriptions of the injuries and deaths attributed to vaccination gured prominently, and many pam- phlets used photographs showing the side effects allegedly caused by the procedure: deepabscesses, scarring, missing limbs and eyes. (Provaccination propaganda published by health departments often used photos to similar effect, showing the gruesome symptoms endured by smallpox victims.) 34The claim that the decline in smallpox over the previous century was due to sanitary reforms and improvements in standards of living rather thanto vaccination was a recurrent theme; so too was the charge that compulsory policies were a prot-making scheme in which doctors, health departments, and vaccine manufacturers colluded to enrich themselves by forcing the public, through the threat of civil or criminal penalties, to submit to the procedure. Lora Little's early tract Crimes of the Cowpox Ring, for example, characterized the practice as a conspiracy perpetrated by entrenched interests: \"The salaries of the public health ofcials in this countr y... reach the sum of $14,000,000 annually. One important function of the health boards is vaccination. Without smallpox scares their trade would languish. Thousands of doctors in private practice are also ben- eciaries in 'scare' times. And lastly the vaccine 'farmers' represent a capital of $20,000,000, invested in their foul business.\" 35 Though diverse, the groups opposed to vaccination were in regular contact with each other. They sometimes worked together in loose coalitions, as when Christian Scientists, chiropractors, and antivivisectionists joined in 1910 under the organizational umbrella of the National League for Medical Freedom to campaign against a federal-level department of health. The groups distributed each other's literature, lent rhetorical support to eachother's efforts, and shared ofcers and members. 36 33NARA, RG 90, Box 364 (spelling and punctuation as in the original). 34Higgins, Vaccination and Lockjaw (cit. n. 21), p. 11; and Anderson, State Medicine (cit. n. 12), p. 82.

Some pharmaceutical companies that manufactured vaccines did experience rapid growth in prots during this period; see Galambos with Sewell, Networks of Innovation (cit. n. 9), pp. 24-25. But people could typically obtain vaccination for free, and there is no evidence that the practicewas highly lucrative for either health departments or physicians. Nor was it the case that health boards wouldhave languished without vaccination programs, which constituted only a small part of their work during thisperiod; see, inter alia, John Duffy, The Sanitarians: A History of American Public Health (Urbana/Chicago: 1990), pp. 205-220 and passim. 36Manfred Waserman, \"The Quest for a National Health Department in the Progressive Era,\" Bull.

The American Medical Liberty League included182 \"SCIENCE IN A DEMOCRACY\" While antivaccinationists tended to espouse strongly libertarian views, their politics did not map neatly onto a Republican/Democrat dichotomy. John Pitcairn was a major donorto the Republican Party, while his friend and cofounder of the Anti-Vaccination LeagueCharles Higgins was a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson; Bernarr Macfadden backedFranklin Roosevelt's candidacy for president but later turned against the New Deal andsought public ofce as a Republican. Mentions of party afliations were virtually absentfrom antivaccination literature, and the most consistent thread in this political outlook washostility to state intervention in personal decisions. Charles Higgins, Lora Little, and Har-old and Raymond Pitcairn all campaigned against Prohibition, for example, with Higginsclaiming that \"religious freedom, medical freedom, and alimentary freedom are equallyunalienable rights of the American people and must be kept inviolate.\" 37 The politics of vaccination proponents also defy generalization. While health ofcials typically supported an activist role for the government, the political positions of publichealth and medical professionals varied because of the diversity within both professionsin terms of background, training, and occupational setting. Nor were the medical profes-sion's political interests always consistent with those of public health practitioners. AfterCongress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act, for example, the American Medical Associ-ation became increasingly concerned about incursions on its professional turf by govern-ment-run health clinics and began to attack the program. In so doing, ironically, the as-sociation found itself in common cause\u2014united against the specter of \"state medicine\"\u2014 with groups such as the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau and the American Medical Liberty League, which it bitterly denounced in other contexts. 38Such shifting alliances illustrate the difculty of pigeonholing the politics of either pro- or antivaccination activ-ists. \"SCIENCE IN A DEMOCRACY\" At the heart of the ideological battles over the legitimacy of vaccination were differingviews of the role elite knowledge and scientic expertise should play in a rapidly changingliberal democratic society. The U.S. Public Health Service, state and city health ofcials,state and local medical societies, and the American Medical Association all sought toconvince legislators and the citizenry that scientic elites should have broad latitude in copies of the newsletter of the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau in its mailings to legislators; see NARA, RG 90, Box 367. The letterhead of the American Medical Liberty League identied the group as \"endorsing theprinciples and aims of the anti-vivisection societies.\" H. B. Anderson of the Citizens Medical Reference Bureaualso spoke at antivivisection conferences. See \"Foes of Vivisection Hold Annual Meeting,\" New York Times, 18 May 1927, p. 28. Activists who belonged to more than one organization opposed to vaccination included DianaBelais, the president of the New York Anti-Vivisection Society, and Nellie Williams, a member of the society,both of whom served as directors of the American Medical Liberty League; Williams was also a vice presidentof the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau. Jesse Mercer Gehman, a doctor of naturopathy who worked as anassociate editor of Macfadden's Physical Culture magazine, became the secretary of the Citizens Medical Ref- erence Bureau in the 1930s and ultimately carried on the bureau's work after H. B. Anderson's death in 1953.See Donald R. McNeil, The Fight for Fluoridation (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1957), p. 121; and Hunt, Body Love (cit. n. 27), p. 109. 37Charles M.

The AMA kept a running le on medical \"dissidents,\" and Morris Fishbein, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, ridiculed many of them in his book The Medical Follies (1925).39A lay organization that took up the cause of scientic medicine was the American Association for Medical Progress, a group made up of prominent academics and civic leaders. Founded in Massachusetts in 1923, the AAMP was devoted to public advocacy on behalf of modern methods of inves-tigation\u2014especially animal experimentation\u2014to counteract what it saw as the forces of ignorance and superstition. Association representatives spoke before legislatures, com- munity groups, and educators on the importance of research and criticized the propaganda of antivivisection and antivaccination groups, which it termed \"chronic opponents The group's 1924 book Smallpox \u2014A Preventable Disease collected data from countries around the world in order to demonstrate the connection between the systematic application of vaccination and the control of smallpox. Eschewing the scornful tone that Fishbein took in his attacks on the medical profession's opponents, the book offered a more measured assessment of the apathy brought on by decades of steadilydeclining smallpox rates: In this complacent state of mind we become a ready prey to the propaganda of the many high- minded, but misinformed or prejudiced persons who hold that power for harm in smallpox does not exist .... Cults and societies have arisen to break down the barriers that years of scientic investigation and endeavor have set up against disease. We are told that our \"personal liberty\" is being impaired\u2014and we forget that there is no such thing as personal liberty apart from the liberty of the community in which we live ....W ea r e accused of being the dupes of \"state medicine\"\u2014and we do not trouble to look back and see for ourselves what our health ofcials have done for the people of this country.40 In his essay \"Science in a Democracy\" the group's managing director, Benjamin Gruen- berg, sought to reconcile liberal democratic values with the growing complexity of the modern world that technological advances were creating. \"Most people would not venture an opinion on the feasibility of producing transparent lead, or steel-hard aluminum, or synthetic proteins,\" Gruenberg wrote. \"Yet these same people insist upon the right to hold opinions (and to act according to these opinions) upon such highly technical questions as the efcacy of vaccination, the value of serums, or the causation of cancer.\" With such rhetoric, Gruenberg sought to move a contentious issue\u2014how to protect the self and thecommunity from disease\u2014out of the realm of popular knowledge and into the domain ofthe expert. The AAMP deplored the trend of \"placing the decision on scientic matters on a popular vote,\" noting that \"by specious arguments for personal liberty, by subtle appeals to tender emotions and kindly sentiments, many voters have been led to oppose wellfounded measures for the protection of the public health.\" 41 39The Medical Follies (cit. n. 28) attacked alternative healers such as chiropractors, homeopaths, and natu- ropaths, as well as popular tness such as physical culture. 40Benjamin C.

The ongoing debate between proponents and opponents of vaccinationcentered on a set of related empirical questions: To what extent was the practice truly responsible for the decline in smallpox that had been observed over the previous century?Could the decline be traced instead to improvements in sanitation and environmental con-ditions? Were the low rates of smallpox that were seen in some countries and in some regions of the United States due to the level of vaccination in the population? Were periodic outbreaks of smallpox attributable to the lack of vaccination? Activists such as Lora Littleand H. B. Anderson attempted to meet scientic experts on their own territory. Astute intheir use of statistics, they sought to persuade legislators and policy makers by the sametechnique the public health ofcials used: careful marshaling of epidemiological data. Both the American Medical Liberty League and the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau seized on reports of high levels of smallpox in the Philippine Islands, where vaccination was widespread, as evidence that the practice was ineffective. In the spring and summer of 1922 Little sent letters to Surgeon General Hugh Cumming and the health commissioners of several states declaring that the demonstrated failure of vaccination warranted the repealof any compulsory laws. 42 The U.S. Public Health Service, for its part, offered a contrary interpretation of the data: the Philippines epidemic was due to incomplete levels of immunity resulting from the lax enforcement of vaccination and from the fact that the vaccine itself, which had been stored for a long period without proper refrigeration, was insufciently potent. \"I would no morepermit the incident in the Philippine Islands to weaken my faith in the value of vaccinationthan I would lose faith in the principles of engineering because a great bridge in processof construction collapsed,\" one state health ofcer wrote in response to Little. Moreover, Public Health Service ofcials saw a clear correlation between compulsory laws and a low incidence of smallpox. A study by the service published in 1921 found that disease inci-dence was higher in central states with no laws (such as Utah, the Dakotas, and Colorado); lower on the Eastern Seaboard, where the most expansive requirements were in place; and increasing in western states such as California and Oregon, where antivaccination senti- ment was on the rise. \"In the absence of compulsory features in the law, or where there is no law at all, smallpox reaches a high rate,\" the study's authors concluded. Echoing Gruen-berg's concerns about the damage that the democratic process could do to public health,they declared, \"Smallpox in the United States is dependent on the popular vote.\" 43 Some scientists contributed contrarian views to the debate. Raymond Pearl, the eminent Johns Hopkins University biologist and statistician, claimed in a controversial 1922 book The Biology of Death that much of the work of public health ofcials over the previous decades had had no effect on patterns of sickness. Intended partly to warn his colleaguesagainst professional hubris, Pearl's work, though it did not specically discuss the corre- lation between the use of vaccination and the decline of smallpox, gave ammunition to those who claimed that there was no relationship between the two. Supporters of vacci-nation were dismayed.

In response to the brouhaha over the Philippines smallpox data, MetLife issued a press release claiming that antivaccination propaganda was responsible for continued outbreaks of smallpox and charging that children were its chief victims. 45The company's special concern for the well-being of the young reflected an important shift in public perception in this period: vaccination was increasingly seen as a procedure not for adults but for infants and schoolchildren. A legislative ght in New York State illustratesthe extent to which schools became the primary battleground for antivaccinationists. ADULTS, CHILDREN, AND THE SCOPE OF COMPULSION Charles Higgins and the Anti-Vaccination League of America made repeated attempts, allunsuccessful, to modify or repeal the law in New York State that required all children to undergo vaccination before enrolling in a public school. It would take the crusade of a savvy political insider\u2014and grieving parent\u2014to achieve that goal. James A. Loyster wasa lawyer active in state politics, serving as a delegate to the Republican state committeefrom his hometown of Cazenovia in central New York. He was not afliated with anyantivaccination society and claimed that earlier in life he had been a believer in the pro- cedure. But in 1914 his only son, Lewis, died after being vaccinated, and Loyster began a personal crusade to investigate what he saw as its dangers. He surveyed upstate residents in towns and villages, sending out hundreds of fliers and letters to nd other cases of vaccination-related injuries and deaths in the rural regions of the state. Over the nextseveral months he received reports from parents indicating that in 1914 at least fty chil-dren had been killed and countless more injured by vaccination\u2014a gure that dwarfedthe three deaths the state had recorded from smallpox itself during the year. Loyster col- lected the damning statistics and heart-rending personal testimony from grieving parentsinto a booklet he published at the beginning of 1915 and began lobbying members of theNew York legislature to modify the state's compulsory vaccination law. 46(See Figure 3.) Although Loyster favored a complete repeal of the law, the resulting bill was a political compromise, reducing the use of compulsion in the state's rural areas while expanding it in the largest cities. The existing law, which had been enacted in 1893, required that allpublic schools in the state exclude from enrollment any pupil who could not present proof of having been vaccinated. The Jones-Tallett amendment, named for the bill's two spon- sors, modied the law so that it applied only to cities with populations above fty thousand(of which there were ten in the state). In all other cities, towns, and villages the school 44Raymond Pearl, The Biology of Death (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1922) (see pp. 223-258 on the effects of public health efforts on mortality patterns); and Louis I.

At the same time, the bill expanded the scope of compulsion in the ten largest cities:under the new law, private and parochial schools, which had previously been exempt,would have to enforce the vaccination requirement. The state medical society and virtually all of the local societies lined up against the measure, believing that it would inevitably bring about a lower level of vaccination cov-JAMES COLGROVE 187 erage in many areas of the state and, consequently, higher rates of smallpox.47Abraham Jacobi, a prominent New York City physician and pioneer of pediatric medicine, spoke ofthe necessary function of compulsory laws. \"I have met in the bulk of our population with more indifference than farsighted public spirit,\" he testied to the legislature. \"It takes the collective thought and activity of a political center like the Legislature to instill a demo- cratic soul into the big political body.\" But state health commissioner Hermann Biggsstunned his colleagues by declining to oppose the bill. Biggs had been associated with compulsion during his tenure with the New York City health department; he was instru- mental in enacting laws requiring physicians to report cases of tuberculosis and venereal disease to the department and had enforced strict quarantine measures against recalcitrant tuberculosis patients who would not submit voluntarily to hospitalization. To Biggs's col-leagues, his accommodating stance toward the proposed change was an apostasy. But Biggs was more a pragmatist than an ideologue; he believed in using compulsion judiciously, when it could accomplish his goals. The existing law had never been systematically en- forced, he noted, and because of the decline in the incidence of smallpox it was engendering opposition that outweighed whatever value it might have. \"I would rather have the senti- ment of the community strongly supporting the health authorities without legislation thancompulsory legislation and an antagonistic public sentiment,\" Biggs testied to the statelegislature's public health committee. \"An attempt at the present time to enforce strictlythe present law will in many of the rural communities of the State result in my judgment in much harm to the public health without any equivalent return.\" 48 In part because of Biggs's support, the bill passed the legislature and was signed into law. But\u2014in an illustration of the extent to which the goals of activists could diverge\u2014 Charles Higgins of the Anti-Vaccination League of America bitterly attacked the Jones- Tallett amendment. In Higgins's view, the new law was a craven political capitulation, representing \"every evil against which we had been working steadily for years an d...a complete surrender to the advocates of medical compulsion.\"49The ten cities in which compulsion was expanded contained the majority of the state's population, Higgins pointed out. But the bill clearly accomplished Loyster's primary goal: it removed the burden of compulsion from the state's rural areas, where it was most resented. The change in New York's law was typical of activity in states around the country during this period, as attempts were made to narrow the scope of legally permissible compulsion. Utah and North Dakota both enacted laws expressly forbidding compulsory vaccination. Massachusetts, which had one of the most forceful laws in place, saw efforts to repeal it every year from 1915 to 1918. Much of the activity nationwide focused on school entry requirements. Washington State repealed its mandatory school vaccination law in 1919, and Wisconsin did the same the following year.50But not all efforts produced 47In February 1915, when the bill was introduced, Louis Neff, president of the Medical Society, wrote to U.S. Surgeon General Rupert Blue asking for any statistics on the efcacy of vaccination that might provide ammu-nition for the upcoming legislative ght.

In 1916 Oregon voters narrowly rejected a citizen initiative that would have made it a felony for schools, public agencies, or employers tomandate vaccination; a similar measure was defeated by a wide margin in 1920. The latter initiative was sponsored by a group called the Public School Protective League, which sought in the same year to abolish California's school entry law. The league espoused a libertarian philosophy and also opposed several other bills related to child health, includingone that would establish a bureau of child hygiene in the state government. Also on the California ballot were two other populist medical measures, one outlawing vivisection and one allowing chiropractors to practice in the state. All were defeated by substantial mar- gins. 51 Even states where general vaccination remained legally enforceable for children rarely saw concerted attempts to achieve the widespread protection of adults.52The eighteen months in which the United States was involved in World War I represented one of the last systematic and large-scale efforts to secure the vaccination of the adult civilian popu- lation. In this context, health ofcials reframed vaccination as a patriotic measure designedto protect the nation's wartime industrial capacity. 53Surgeon General Rupert Blue issued a general advisory to all state public health ofcials urging them to work with their localofcials to achieve universal vaccination, especially among workers in war-related indus- tries and in areas near military cantonments. But the campaign achieved little success. In Arizona, a state important to the war effort because of its copper mines, the health com-missioner complained to Blue that the compulsory vaccination law was a \"dead letter\"owing to widespread opposition and that his efforts to enforce the policy simply exacer-bated resistance. A plant manager at a steel company in Albion, Michigan, one of many in the state engaged in war production, noted that only some plants were enforcing the order and that in so doing they placed themselves at a competitive disadvantage: \"Somelaborers will refuse to be vaccinated, and will go to the other plants where vaccination isnot required.\" In Chicago, many employees in war industries refused not on philosophical grounds but \"because they are not paid for the time lost, which amounted to from one to ve days in some cases.\" 54 \"Legislative Aspects of Vaccination,\" Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, 1921, 185(11):307-310 (Massa- chusetts); C.

The California bills are discussed in Chester H. Rowell, \"Medical and Anti-Medical Legislation in California,\" American Journal of Public Health, 1921, 11:128-132. The vote on the antivaccination measure was 57 percent opposed and 43 percent in favor; see \"Defeat of Antivaccination and Antivivisection Measures Coast,\" Public Health Rep., 1920, 35:3040. 52About a dozen states at this time had laws authorizing the compulsory vaccination of the general population; most of these laws were permissive rather than mandatory\u2014that is, they allowed but did not require localitiesto enforce compulsory vaccination should ofcials deem it necessary. See William Fowler, \"Smallpox VaccinationLaws, Regulations, and Court Decisions,\" 60], pp. 1-21. 53The government's vigorous campaign against venereal disease during the war represented a similar push to frame the control of disease in terms of patriotic duty through elaborate war metaphors in which disease wasequated with the enemy.

On wartime labor unrest see David Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1980), pp. 258-270.JAMES COLGROVE 189 In the context of labor shortages and bitter struggles over union organizing brought on by the war, some in government felt that vaccination was not sufciently important to riskinflaming sensitive workplaces. The War Department recommended to Blue that \"this measure not be too aggressively advanced at this time or at least until the War LaborPolicies Board, has an opportunity to secure a better stabilization of labor matters. Nu-merous instances have been reported to this Branch of the loss of labor in large numbers due to the enforcement of inoculation and vaccination.\" Similarly, the U.S. Railroad Ad- ministration expressed concern that \"a very considerable number of employees wouldleave\" their jobs if a compulsory vaccination policy were enforced. The American Fed-eration of Labor also fought during the war against the compulsory physical examinationof munitions workers, illustrating the extent to which threats to bodily integrity were a flashpoint for factory unrest. 55 In this highly charged climate, several health ofcials sought to have antivaccination literature suppressed on the ground that it was impeding the war effort\u2014\"I can see no difference between this propaganda and any other anti-war pro-German propaganda,\" said Arizona's superintendent of public health\u2014though there is no evidence that these attempts were successful. Antivaccinationism also fell victim to the suppression of radicalism and dissent that marked the war effort. Lora Little was arrested in North Dakota in 1918 under the Espionage Act for attempting to cause insubordination and mutiny in the military after she distributed pamphlets attacking the compulsory vaccination of soldiers. She was even- tually freed after the state supreme court threw out the case against her.56 In the postwar years, rates of vaccination in the population dwindled steadily. A study of child health in 1930 found that in the average U.S. city only 13 percent of preschoolers had been vaccinated. Age ve was the most common time to have children protected against smallpox, reflecting the effect of school entry requirements around the country; it was during that year that almost 75 percent of vaccinating was done. There was littlevariation in the incidence of vaccination by income level, another reflection of the public settings in which the procedure was performed. In a survey asking physicians about patient attitudes toward vaccination, most reported that their patients were favorably disposed toward it\u2014suggesting a gap between what people may have believed about the practice and what they actually did. 57 Another survey conducted at around the same time found distinct differences between densely and sparsely populated regions: vaccination was much more common in large cities than in rural areas.58Regardless of where they lived, children tended to be vaccinated only once, most commonly at age ve, and almost no one underwent the procedure afterpuberty; very few adults heeded public health ofcials' recommendations about renewing 55For the War Department recommendation see Fred C.

The survey revealed the extent to which vaccination was coming to be perceived as a procedure for children, something that adultsrarely, if ever, considered undergoing themselves. THE WANING OF ANTIVACCINATIONISM Antivaccinationism in the United States declined dramatically in the 1930s. Few effortswere made to modify or repeal laws around the country after the mid 1920s, and courtchallenges to compulsory laws, which had numbered in the dozens during the late nine-teenth and early twentieth century, became rare. The question of whether mandates forvaccination prior to school attendance violated any constitutional rights\u2014a point that hadnot been directly addressed in Jacobson v. Massachusetts \u2014was settled in the U.S. Su- preme Court in 1922 in a case arising from Texas, where Rosalyn Zucht, age fteen, wasexpelled from Brackenridge High School in San Antonio after her parents refused to haveher vaccinated. In a unanimous decision relying primarily on the earlier opinion in Jacob- son, the court determined that no constitutional right was infringed by excluding unvac- cinated children from school. Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote the opinion, subsequentlyclaimed that the court should not have taken the case as it presented no new constitutionalissues. 59 The Anti-Vaccination League of America faded from prominence during the 1920s and vanished after the death of Charles Higgins in 1929; the American Medical Liberty Leagueunderwent a similar decline after Lora Little's death in 1931. The disappearance of theseorganizations revealed the extent to which the movement depended on the persistence ofa few dedicated leaders. The activist with the most longevity was H. B. Anderson, whocontinued to ght against vaccination and other \"socialistic\" medical programs during the1930s and 1940s. Although chiropractors and Christian Scientists remained signicantforces for alternative medicine, parents increasingly relied on the child-rearing advice of allopathic physicians who supported vaccination. 60 Disputes over vaccination returned to the public stage in the 1980s, with a highly visible controversy over the safety of the pertussis vaccine, and since then allegations of harmattributed to routine childhood immunization have drawn widespread and often sensational attention in the media and prompted a series of congressional hearings. The issue remainsemotionally charged in the United States and many other industrialized democracies, witha new generation of activists, as diverse as their historical predecessors, questioning the orthodox view of vaccination. 61Many of these debates have resonated with the chords that were struck in the Progressive Era.

But their views on vaccination, though in the minority in theearly decades of the century, were persuasive to considerable numbers of Americans, asevidenced by the extensive legislative activity of the period. Newspapers and magazinesthroughout the Progressive Era continued to present debates over the merits of vaccination,albeit with a distinct bias toward the view of vaccination as a mainstream and acceptedpractice. 62Antivaccinationists based their arguments in large measure on a careful reading of available data on the safety and efcacy of vaccination, and if they did so with strongbiases in favor of an a priori assumption, the same accusation could be made against the defenders of the practice. Their writings provide a unique lens through which to examinehow a diverse range of Americans viewed the place of scientic knowledge in civic life.To view the antivaccinationists as simply paranoid or reactionary obscures the signicanceof their ght within the broader social and political environment over questions central toliberal democracies: the relationship of the citizen to the state, the proper reach of gov-ernment into the lives of the people, the legitimacy of some forms of knowledge overothers, and the appropriate role of science in guiding decisions about health and the body. 62See, e.g., \"Both Sides of the Vaccination Question,\" a pair of columns pro and con that appeared in the May 1910 and June 1910 issues of the Ladies Home Journal (and were subsequently published as a pamphlet by the Anti-Vaccination League of "}
