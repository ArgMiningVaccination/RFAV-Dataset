On January 28, 2010, the Panel found that Dr. Wakefield's behavior involved \"serious professional mis- co-authors to publicly retract the part of the Lancet article Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.net The Open Vaccine Journal, 2013, 6,9-25 9 Panel) held hearings that lasted over 2 .5 years (July 2007 - conduct\" [2].On May 24, 2010, the Panel reported, * Address correspondence to this author at E-mail: SDepidemiologist@cox.net and unethical medical practices by Wakefield related to the published article [17].

Wakefield's On February 22, 2004, the first report in a series by investigative journalist Brian Deer was published in the claims in Wakefield's book as an example of similar erroneous claims being made within the anti-vaccination movement, contrasting these approaches to scientific foundations of vaccine risk and benefit. It is hoped that this review will be used by doctors and public health personnel to encourage parents hesitating to Wakefield as an authority and display in their writings and pronouncements similar examples of erro neus claims. The public health risks from decreased vaccination are significant. Based on the old adage \"trust but verify,\" readers should examine the references and, where possible (URLs to many documents are included), obtain and read the original papers10The Open Vaccine Journal, 2013 , Volume 6 Joel A. Harrison , PhD, MPH claims in general, given that many proponents often refer tohave their children vaccinated to question anti-vaccination rather than rely on the \"interpretations\" of others.In his endnotes [21] Wakefield refers to an article co- [22]. This article reports the findings of a 1987 Swedish study of a 2-dose schedule. Under \"Reports on Measles, Mumps, and Rubella, and on Adverse Events,\" the article states: \"In Sweden it is obligatory to report severe and unex- pected side effects of drugs and vaccinations to the adverse reactions advisory committee of the National Board of Health and Welfare. . . Most of the reported reactions were not serious, and in all but a few cases no symptoms remainedafter afollow -up period of at least one year. Case follow-up continued up to two years [my emphasis]\" [22]. Thus, in the very publication Wakefield cites to bolster his claim that no safety studies were performed, it is clear that case follow-up for safety not only was carried out; but up to two years.authored by Dr. Christenson in the British Medical JournalThe main theme of Wakefield's book is that the Fitnessto Practise Medicine hearings and decisions were politically motivated to silence his whistleblowing about the lax safety standards used for approval of vaccines and his fight to im- prove them. The book's two main topics are: 1) vaccine safety studies and the vaccine-approval process; and 2) an attempt to discredit both Brian Deer and the Panel hearings. The book refers to medical records, memos, and other documents, some that cannot be publicly verified. What can be verified and questioned is Wakefield's presentation and interpretation of vaccine safety studies and the vaccine ap- proval process. This paper reviews the verifiable, publicly available, evidence that Wakefield's presentation employed to question vaccine safety. The findings of the UK Panel are online, and the reader is encouraged to review the document measles, mumps [and] rubella vaccines carried out prior to the decision to introduce it into the UK national immunizationprogramme in 1988. [28]. They point out that the first combined vaccine was \"li- censed in the US in 1971 and in the UK in 1972\" [28]. One study vaccinated 30 children with an MMR vaccine in 1968 and obtained serum titers for virus-specific antibodies from 14 of the children 10 1/2 years later [29,30]. Finally, a 1988 article by Karin Fahlgren states: \"About 200 studies on mea- sles, mumps, and rubella vaccines against these diseases have 250 page review of safety studies seems to have missed ALL of the above. His book even leaves out theseven studies from his own published article.The table includes year published, study sample size, follow- up time and strain of mumps vaccine used. The studies in- clude those from Wakefield's 2000 article [10],those culled from Fahlgren's 1988 review article [31], and the 1994 Institute of Medicine report [27].

The Japanese study included a six -week follow-up [42]. A German study of 197 children found no major adverse reactions based on parents keeping a 30-day written record. In addition, the children were seen at a clinic six weeks after the vaccination [65].The Open Vaccine Journal, 2013 , Finnish prospective follow-up of MMR vacci- nations of 1.8 million individuals was launched in 1982 [106]. \"Thirty suspected cases of anaphylaxis were re- ported . . . in 15 of the 30 cases the physician ultimately diagnosed fainting.

A 1994 Institute of Medicine report [27] listed over 200 studies and Fahl- gren's 1988 paper [31] a similar number. Wakefield claims: In addition to our own work and that of others, my opinion is also based upon a comprehensive review of all safety studies performed on measles, MR and MMR vaccines and re-vaccination policies. This now runs into a report remains unpublished. How comprehensive could it be given the studies presented here? In addition, Wakefield's book omits seven studies he discussed in a previous article [10]. And, finally, his presentation and critique of the seven studies was wrong. Joel A.
