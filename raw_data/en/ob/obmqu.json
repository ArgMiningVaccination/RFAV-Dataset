While you are in yourplace, practise sensory attention to everything within the boundaries. Write aseries of ten meditations about your experience of place: for example, how thenatural and built environments intersect and collide; how the place appears toeach of your senses; how the place evolves through time; how climate changewill affect your place, and so forth. The nal meditation should reflect onwhether this experience of \"embedding in place\" has increased your sense ofbelonging and responsibility (from Lawrence Buell 2009, cited in Hubbell &Ryan, page 184) - Padlet Page & myCourses,due date:April 13th (11:59pm) 3)Stories of Climate Change - Research Activity: Research2 cultural products thatengage with climate change (excerpt from a novel/poetry collection; a clip froma lm; an art installation; a song etc.) and post them on your Padlet page. 6GERM357 Discussion post on myCourses: Briefly describe the cultural product and itscontribution to climate change discourse. due date:February 21st (11:59pm) 4)Visualising and Mapping Climate Change:Climate Atlas of Canada - Indigenous Knowledges: Watchone of theshort videos about Indigenous Knowledges and Climate Change inCanada.

You willhave 4 opportunities during the semester (1 per novel) to submit each of the threereading responses. For the rst reading response, I will provide you with a prompt.

For the in-class presentation,your group will outline the main characteristics of this perspective using images, clipsand textual references (15-minute presentation).
