There are very few data to inform modeling and adaptive management. If interventions are postponed until data are available, the vole could go extinct in the interim, making a more flexible modeling approach imperative. The voles face threats from environmental and demographic stochasticity, Allee effects, inbreeding, genetic drift, intense predation, and disease. The modeling approach used here is based on diffusion methods for time series of population size constrained by a carrying capacity, focusing on environmental stochasticity and the probability that the variance in population growth could allow the population to encounter the lower \"absorbing\" boundary and go extinct. We parameterized the model with Amargosa vole data that stand as Bayesian \"priors\" for carrying capacity, until more data can be obtained and allow us to refine a more accurate estimate. There are no multiple-year time series data or data for most demographic characteristics of the Amargosa vole, forcing us to look to California vole time series as a Bayesian prior. Our analysis indicated expected 20-24 years to extinction and 4-5% probability of extinction in one year due to environmental stochasticity: the real time could even be shorter if there is significant demographic stochasticity. Implementation of management based on best available modeling will be crucial to avert this risk. This modeling approach also has merit for other species in urgent need of management even in the face of early projects lacking mature data sets. Introduction The Amargosa vole ( Microtus californicus scirpensis Kellogg only near Tecopa, Inyo County, California [1]. Although the first reports were from a collection in 1891 from the \"Amargosa River (near the Nevada line), Inyo County\" [2], soon began reports of extinction, rediscovery, and extinction again, testimony that the vole has been rare throughout recent history. The vole is federally and State of California endangered under the Endangered Species Act [3]. Despite listing, there has been only sporadic research since 1997 [4]. A collaborative group of 2 || J. Foley & P. Foley | Assessment and Extinction Prediction using Stochastic Modeling of the Endangered Amargosa Vole. researchers undertook two pulses from 2012-2014 of mark-recapture efforts to estimate demographic characteristics [5,6]. Survival rate was only 0.347/month favoring larger males, much lower than the 0.83/month in the 1990s [6]. Densities range from 2-60 individuals/ha. Voles are restricted to small, isolated marshes surrounded by harsh alkali flats, totaling about 30 ha of suitable habitat with numbers from several hundreds to no more than a thousand individuals [7]. The most densely occupied patch was a marsh around an Artesian well accidentally dug in 1967 (Marsh 1). Less than half of available habitat is occupied, small patches have very low vole density, and wetlands in Marsh 1 recently collapsed from excessive water loss following landscape manipulation and drought. There is very limited gene flow among subpopulations, inbreeding, and genetic bottlenecking [8](Conroy, UC Berkeley unpub. data), and a significant threat of endemic, epidemic, or catastrophic disease is synergistic with genetic loss and anthropogenic habitat challenges [5,9]. V oles compete with sympatric native and non-native rodents and there may be apparent competition among rodents mediated by disease. Predation on Amargosa voles is intense from at least 27 species of birds, snakes, amphibians, and mammals (A. Roy, CDFW, unpub. data). Finally, some of the marshes are also adversely affected by invasive non-native plants such as Tamarisk sp. (Otahal, BLM, unpub. data). The already extremely small Amargosa vole population is highly fragmented and experiences wide fluctuations in size. Demographic and environmental stochasticity could cause its rapid extinction by means of any of the mechanisms described above. Future management could perhaps avert extinction if we understood the magnitude of the risk, for example by reducing disease or stabilizing habitat. Yet we lack even two full years of demographic data and have minimal knowledge of basic life history upon which to base population projections. Nevertheless, population viability analysis (PV A) is required for conservation management [10,11]. Commonly PV As are done using Leslie or Lefkovich matrices but such methods typically require extensive data and don't readily lend themselves to cyclicity, environmental and demographic stochasticity, and important biotic and abiotic forces (such as the unanticipated release of water from Marsh 1) that change population trajectories. Rather, here we apply a diffusion-based modeling approach to Amargosa vole data. Diffusion methods based on population size time series can capture population vulnerability due to environmental stochasticity and such methods (sometimes called \"diffusion approximation methods\") have strong theoretical foundations and tools for working with \"corrupted data\" have been produced [12] as well. The model is mathematically simple and equations can be solved to directly answer how Te depends on the data. If, as in the case of Amargosa voles, few census data are available, we can start the analysis using Bayesian priors for population growth rates from related species and then improve accuracy by incorporating target species data as they become available [13]. Our goals were to: 1) highlight key variables that would likely contribute to Amargosa vole extinction, 2) determine whether or not data were available for these variables or whether proxy data would serve, and 3) use diffusion analysis-based modeling to predict how long before the Amargosa vole population would likely go extinct without changes to environmental stochastic forces that impact it.Wildlife Biology in Practic e 2016, 12(1) || 3 Methods This study relies on results from diffusion analysis of lnNt [13] to predict persistence of the Amargosa vole population. Such analysis assumes that the basic relationship between N0 and Nt applies even when Nt is small and that the residuals are independently and identically distributed [14]. The set of Nt is a time-series of annual population sizes measured at their lowest point (this nadir can occur at a different time each year). Using lnNt eliminates some common variation in N which would violate assumptions of diffusion analysis. Density-dependence is imposed by a carrying capacity K. A local population is extinct when the pooled reproductive value of all females < 1. Following [15] Equation 18, expected time to extinction Te(n0) = 2n0(k-n0/2)/vr, where n0 is ln(N0) and k is ln(K). The few demographic data available for Amargosa voles show a 1:1 male:female sex ratio and provide an estimate of density at two marshes (Marshes 1 and 17) from which we calculated range-wide N by multiplying by the available 30 ha [5,6]. K is the total calculated number of voles during the time of year when there are the fewest voles. Variance in r (per capita growth rate), vr, is calculated from a time series of N. Environmental stochasticity causes vr but we correct vr to vre for temporal autocorrelation (). We assume that the expected value of r (rd) = 0, i.e. there is no secular trend in rates. We also assume initially that demographic stochasticity is far outweighed by environmental stochasticity [16]. Because there are no data on inter-annual variability in r for Amargosa voles, we cautiously used Bayesian prior estimates from California voles which have similar gestation periods of about 21 days, time to weaning in about 14 days, a post-partum estrus allowing for a litter to be conceived shortly after parturition, reproductive maturity in 3 weeks for females and 6 weeks for males, and a mean litter size of 4-5 [1,17,18]. California vole populations are regulated by an interplay of seasonally abundant resources promoting reproduction, predation, and then over-predation plus loss of food resources [19,20]. Spacing behavior and social interactions, sometimes mediated by pheromones, also influence vole demography [21]. We used time series from California voles on Brooks Island in the San Francisco Bay for 5 years (designated \"Brooks\") [20], two sites in Mendocino County for 21 years (\"Mendocino1\" and \"Mendocino2\") [22], and Richmond, Alameda County for 7 years (\"Richmond\") [23,24]. We also examined values from the western harvest mouse, Reithrodontomys megalotis which is marsh-dependent when in the Chihuahuan Desert (\"Chihuahua\") [25]. Results Initial recapture data of Amargosa voles in two marshes yielded estimated densities from 2-60 individuals/ha, which yields a range-wide N varying from as low as 50 to almost 2000 (Fig. 1). In the second pulse of trapping beginning in October 2013, there was dramatically higher N, characteristic of other vole \"boom and bust\" dynamics [23]. Winter temperatures are very harsh and bulrush quality is poor during that season. Thus the second year of data reflected considerably reduced numbers in fall into winter. In the first year of trapping, a ceiling was apparent at approximately 200 animals. In the second year, despite the intense transient increase in calculated N, the 4 || J. Foley & P. Foley | Assessment and Extinction Prediction using Stochastic Modeling of the Endangered Amargosa Vole. sharp downward turn suggests that the true ceiling is still very low, from 200-400 individuals. Figure 1: Time series of population size estimates for Amargosa voles during intensive trapping for demographic assessment. Data from June 2012-Sept. 2013 are interpolated as no trapping was conducted during that period. Characteristics of other rodent times series are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Among the studies of California voles excluding Amargosa voles, was negative for the Mendocino1, Richmond, and Chihuahua time series and positive for Mendocino2 and Brooks. Correcting vr for (temporal autocorrelation) yields values of vre from 0.72-1.52. The harvest mouse vre was lower than all voles and was not used in further analysis.

(temporal autocorrelation), vr (variance in population growth), and vre (vr corrected for temporal autocorrelation) are used in diffusion-based extinction analysis of Amargosa voles; estimates of carrying capacity (K) and expected value of the per capita growth rate (median rd) are provided for comparative purposes with Amargosa voles.

Full references are given in text. In order to understand how different inputs of vre and N0 would affect the estimates of Te, we plotted Te across the range of different N0 for a mid-value vre (1.3) observed in California vole time series and across the range of vre for a moderate N0 (100 females) observed for Amargosa voles (Figs. 3a and 3b). These plots reveal that there is a sharp decline in predicted extinction as population size increases at very low levels, and correspondingly, increasing variance in r, associated with environmental stochasticity, precipitously increases risk of extinction of Amargosa voles. We performed diffusion-based analyses of expected Amargosa vole persistence given population size and r estimates obtained from our data. These data ranged from the low N0 of 15 females seen in Marsh 1 to the more moderate sizes we anticipate rangewide with K of 150 females (with the initial simplistic assumption that habitat is fully saturated and N0 = K). We used vre across the full range reported in the literature for California voles (Table 2). In the worst case scenario of high vre in a small population, then Te = is as low as 5 years. At best with data available for voles, using the notably low vre seen by Garsd, the population could be expected to persist 35 years. Because Te is an exponential random variable with expected value = 5-35 years, then there is a 1/5-1/35, or 2.9-30% probability of going extinct in one year. Figure 3: A.

Foley | Assessment and Extinction Prediction using Stochastic Modeling of the Endangered Amargosa Vole. Discussion Viability analyses of populations are widely necessary for endangered species management. Microtine rodent biology would seem to lend itself straightforwardly to PV A, with high fecundity, short generation and life spans, ease of trapping (although studies in California voles show diminished trapping success during population growth phases [26]), and dependable seasonality. However, there are few or no data on Amargosa vole territoriality, dispersal, home range size, habitat and food constraints, among other factors. Amargosa vole population dynamics lack stationarity: intrinsic growth rate, monthly mortality rate, and dispersal capacity have changed over the last few decades [4,6,8]. PV A for such an endangered species must at least address environmental stochasticity, which is reportedly the most important contributor to extinction risk [16]. Amargosa voles are subject to spatially and temporally autocorrelated environmental stochasticity because of: their dependence on small habitat patches in one hydrogeomorphic basin, a drought across most of California from 2012-2015 likely exacerbated by climate change, water-seeking exotic Tamarix , water diversion, railroad construction and floods, fire, disease, road management, development, and human and pet dog access into marshes for recreation [3]. All California vole time series we examined showed boom and bust cycles, regionally correlated environmental stochasticity, and seasonality. Temporal autocorrelation across the series varied from positive to negative, so we are not confident that we have accurately captured for the present model and regard estimating actual values for Amargosa voles as an important priority. Inaccurate estimates of N could increase negative temporal autocorrelation and overestimate Te, which we addressed by using vre rather than vr. The relationship of Te and vr is such that, if for example Amargosa vole vr is actually twice as high as the values we used, then Te is actually half as long, but as for all Bayesian analyses, any additional data we obtain from Amargosa voles can be used to increase the precision of the estimates. Predicted Te is less sensitive to K than it is to vr because of the use of ln(K) and because it appears in the numerator. Use of some form of K is required to provide a reflecting boundary and impose density-dependence. However, our data show two very different dynamical regimes across fragments of two years, consistent with other microtines with swings over orders of magnitude in N seasonally, annually, super- annually, and irregularly. Seasonal and annual cycles occur in northern California voles because reproduction increases after a lag following rainfall and emergence of wet season vegetation [1]. Population cycling is thought to be due in part to predator recruitment following high vole numbers, overconsumption of voles, and Table 2: Expected time to extinction of a population of Amargosa voles across a range of population sizes using Bayesian prior estimates of vre from California voles in published studies. See text for details. Wildlife Biology in Practic e 2016, 12(1) || 7 vole population crashes [19]. We focused our model, and the estimation of extinction risk, on the lowest N which occurs at the most vulnerable time of the year. Irregular and superannual cycles induced by over-predation by specialist predators, lack of available food resources, depletion of micronutrients, chaos, disease, and others [27- 29] are poorly addressed by diffusion or matrix models. Of great concern is the likelihood that we are overestimating K because N is estimated from density at the best habitat patch and we added all isolated local subpopulations into one N, when in reality, small local patches have accelerated probabilities of extinction. Some literature suggests that the Amargosa vole population is a classical metapopulation [3,4,8,30,31] although we neither detected migration to confirm this nor found sufficient genetic structure to allow us to infer colonization (C. Conroy, UC Berkeley, pers. comm.). Since water began to recede at the end of the Pleistocene, patches have become smaller and more isolated [33], leaving only 25 marshes or marsh fragments, each from 0.1 to 19.5 ha, in the Tecopa area (A. Roy, CDFW, pers. comm.) with only half showing evidence of occupation by voles. Dispersal among patches is blocked by a railroad grade, roads, parks, and alkali flats. Flow of animals when it occurs is generally in the direction of spreading floodwater and smaller and more isolated patches serve as population \"sinks\". Anecdotes suggest that flooding is less common and the water table lower than a few decades ago. Moreover, all patches share a single hydrogeomorphic basin subject to regionally correlated stochasticity that would serve to nullify some of the possible benefits of a true Levins metapopulation [34]. Even in thriving California vole populations, there was regionally-correlated stochasticity, with both the Richmond and Tilden populations (separated by 10 km) undergoing crashes such that voles were no longer detected at the sites for months to years. Both nearby populations also had anomalously high N at year 5 [35]. Our model incorporates regional stochasticity but not metapopulation dynamics. Our analysis also did not include genetic drift [32], which may be warranted because Amargosa voles are already so deeply bottlenecked that drift now may be relatively low. Results suggest that it is important to develop more sensitive genetic markers structure, attempt to observe migration, manage habitat to increase connectivity, and apply metapopulation modeling if warranted. General theory predicts the greater influence of environmental relative to demographic stochasticity for most species [16]. However, demographic stochasticity is a serious threat to voles if by chance subpopulations overrepresent reproductively senescent voles, sex ratio becomes unproductively skewed, and other characteristic features of demographic stochasticity occur. Older voles are less fecund yet predominantly older individuals are being recaptured [6]. Moreover, the voles in some marshes are now almost certainly below Allee thresholds [36] which occurs in some California vole family groups that show behavioral avoidance of each other [1] and laboratory studies showing that sibling mating is inhibited [37]. Clearly, demographic stochasticity is a risk and the diffusion approach emphasizes environmental stochasticity. Because of this, the predicted Te should be interpreted as a maximum time before extinction might be expected. If indeed demographic stochasticity is found to play an important role, then there is even less time left to conserve this species. Benefits of matrix models are familiarity [38], emphasis on reproduction and mortality-driven impacts on population size, and the ability to incorporate 8 || J. Foley & P. Foley | Assessment and Extinction Prediction using Stochastic Modeling of the Endangered Amargosa Vole. stochasticity [39]. Matrix PV A models commonly assume stable age structure and although Amargosa vole age structure is skewed, we may assume it is stable. However, because matrix-based PV A obtains future population estimates by multiplying the dominant eigenvalue, i.e. the mean of the population growth rate, matrix-based PV As cope poorly with populations which are not stable around a mean growth rate, often because they are very small or highly variable, or have secular trends in or year-to-year correlation. Backwards analysis of the fit of matrix-based PVAs to real population outcomes reveals that short data sets considerably overestimate Te especially in variable environments [40]. Yet small, highly impacted, poorly studied, declining, and variable populations are often those most in need of PV A as indeed are Amargosa voles. In this study, we incorporated current population density estimates of Amargosa voles, evidence of \"boom and bust\" dynamics, population regulation, variance in population growth, and regional stochasticity into a diffusion analysis-based model to predict time to extinction, where some of the needed variables were estimated as Bayesian priors from time series of California vole populations. With high vre in a small population, then Te = is as low as 5 years and there is a 3-30% probability of Amargosa voles going extinct in one year. This model synthesizes our best knowledge as a baseline for understanding impacts of management on population sustainability. Many readers are accustomed to matrix approaches but such models have important limitations; most importantly, the needed extensive data for Amargosa vole modeling will not be available for years. The Amargosa vole population has a secular trend downwards but also high variability, and is challenged by demographic and regionally-correlated environmental stochasticity. The variability in this population is a hallmark for the exceedingly high risk it has for extinction. Implementation of management based on best available modeling [41] is crucial to avert this risk.
