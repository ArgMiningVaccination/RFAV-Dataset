The program promotes dedication to excellence in performance, with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and commitment to lifelong personal and professional development. THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROFESSION A physician assistant is a dependent practitioner of medicine who practices under the supervision of a licensed physician. The PA can practice in a multitude of settings and specialties of medicine. Common job responsibilities include taking patient histories, performing physical exams, ordering and interpreting laboratory tests and radiological studies, formulating diagnoses, and administering treatments. In the state of Minnesota, a physician assistant is registered with the Board of Medical Practice. In Minnesota, and most other states, the PA must be NCCPA (National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants) certified and hold a supervisory agreement with a licensed physician. Minnesota-registered PAs have prescriptive privileges under delegatory supervision with their physician. AUGSBURG'S PA GRADUATE PROGRAM The Physician Assistant Graduate Program at Augsburg College is 36 months long with studies beginning each year in the summer semester (May). The program accepts 28 students for each new class. The first 19-month period of study is didactic, or classroom work, including courses in human gross anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical medicine, pharmacotherap)~ history and physical exam skills, research, and ethics and legal medicine. The clinical phase is 17 months in length. Each student is required to successfully complete clinical rotations in family medicine, surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, ob/gyn, psychiatry, emergency medicine, and an elective rotation chosen from various specialties. The clinical phase will culminate with a 12-week preceptorship. The majority of established clinical rotation sites are in Minnesota in both rural and urban locations. Graduates will receive a Master of Science in physician assistant studies and a PA certificate. QUALIFIED APPLICANTS MUST COMPLETE A MINIMUM OF Bachelor's degree Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 QUALIFIED APPLICANTS MUST COMPLETE A MINIMUM OF 1 full course of general psychology 1 full course of developmental psychology I 1 full course of physiology* (human/vertebrate/organ) I 1 full course of microbiology* I 1 full course of biochemistry* I 1 full course of general statistics I 1 course of medical terminologyi* Applicants already holding a bachelor's degree must complete prerequisite courses by the end of December of the year they are applying. Applicants completing their first bachelor's degree must complete prerequisite coursework prior to the first day of the program. All course prerequisites must have been completed within the past 10 years. Course prerequisites must be passed with a grade of C (2.0) or higher to satisfy the requirement. Meeting minimum prerequisites does not guarantee admission into the PA Graduate Program. THE FOLLOWING ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED I Minimum science GPA of 3.0 I Courses in anatomy, genetics, immunology, other biology courses, organic chemistry Direct patient contact experience The Augsburg PA Graduate Program has a mission to educate generalist physician assistants oriented toward service to underserved populations both in rural settings and urban areas. Demonstration of a commitment to, and involvement with, underserved communities is strongly recommended, but not required. Although the program does not require a minimum number of hours, clinical health-care experience is strongly recommended. Direct patient contact is the best type of experience to hold in order to strengthen an application. Health-care experience may be full time or part time, paid or volunteer. Consideration of previous experience is taken when final selection occurs. The Graduate Record Exam ( GRE) is not required *Labs are recommended but not required. #The prerequisite requires a minimum of one tenn (course) of medical tenninology. This is the only prerequisite which may be completed at a technical college. THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS The PA Graduate Program has a two-step application process. The Augsburg PA Program participates in the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA), which is sponsored by the Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP). All applications to the PA Program for the entering class must be processed through CASPA, following all guidelines and regulations set forth by CASPA. Application forms with detailed instructions can be obtained online at <www.caspaonline.org>, or by contacting them at 240-497-1895. Applications should be submitted to CASPA the calendar year before the student plans to enter the PA Program. Since all incoming students begin the course of study in late May, the application is thus made approximately a year before matriculation. Once CASPA has collected all necessary application materials and forwarded applicant information to the Augsburg PA Program, the PA Program will evaluate the CASPA application to determine an applicant's eligibility to apply to the program. The results of the evaluation will be sent to the applicant, along with a supplemental application (if deemed eligible to apply). There is an application fee of $20 for all applicants who return supplemental application materials. For applicants who are uncertain of their prerequisite status and eligibility, the PA Program will evaluate applicants' transcripts before initiation of application to CASPA. In order to obtain a preliminary evaluation, send the PA Program one envelope containing the following: (1) cover letter stating name, address, social security number, and reason for desiring a preliminary evaluation; and (2) all transcripts to be evaluated (copies are acceptable). Once an applicant has determined he or she will apply, he or she must follow all guidelines and rules of the process, including submission of a CASPA application. A preliminary evaluation of transcripts may take two-three weeks, and its results are subject to re-evaluation based on the official documents and information received by CASPA. The PA Program will perform a preliminary evaluation of all transcripts received from May through August. The Physician Assistant program admissions process occurs once each year. Only those applicants who have sent all information required to complete application files on or before the respective deadlines will be allowed to proceed through the admissions process. Following the last deadline, application files are processed and sent as a group to the admissions committee for review. Selection of student candidates is made by mid February. ACCREDITATION The Augsburg College PA Graduate Program is fully accredited through 2008 by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). This accreditation status enables students to take the national certifying examination administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). The Augsburg PA Graduate Program is a member of the Association of Physician Assistant Programs, the national organization representing PA educational programs. The Minnesota Board of Medical Practice recognizes graduates of the Augsburg PA Graduate Program for registration in Minnesota. INFORMATION SESSIONS Group information sessions are held at the program from May through August. Applicants who have specific questions relating to the application process, who are interested in learning more about the program, or who want to sign up for a group information session are encouraged to contact the pro&ram office at 612-330-1399. 1 Anatomy Pathophysiology Research I YEAR 2 3 Clinical Medicine I Clinical Medicine I Lab Pharmacotherapy I History and Physical Exam Skills I Ethics and Legal Issues in Medicine Directed Study Clinical Experience Clinical Medicine III Clinical Rotations 6, 7, and 8 Clinical Medicine II Clinical Medicine II Lab Pharmacotherapy U History and Physical Exam Skills II Research II Clinical Rotations 1, 2, and 3 Preceptorship Capstone Course Professional Issues Clinical Rotation 4 and 5 ACADEMIC TRAINING FIRST 19 MONTHS (refer to curriculum table on page 5) PA 501 Human Anatomy This course takes a regional approach to the study of human anatomy.

The initial 12 months is designed much like a physician's internship. Each student is required to progress through seven required rotations in the following disciplines: family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. Each of these rotations is six weeks long. Additionally, each student will comlplete one six-week rotation of selected electives from disciplines such as orthopedics, ENT, dermatology, etc. The mission of the Physician Assistant Graduate Program at Augsburg College is to provide underserved populations and communities in Minnesota with generalist physician assistants providing them with much needed health care. The clinical phase of the program is designed to effectively train students for that type of practice by placing students in health care facilities outside the metropolitan area for a minimum of two to eight rotations. The clinical phase culminates with a 12-week preceptorship. This preceptorship is designed to solidify the student's primary care skills, and potentially place them in a setting that might be interested in recruiting a graduate PA. The preceptorship may be completed within the community that the student has been in for the required rotations, or may be elsewhere in the state. The clinical education is taught by physicians, and supplemented by physician assistants and other health care providers. Each student is evaluated by the physician preceptor for the designated rotation. Nine times during the clinical phase students will return to Augsburg for testing as well as didactic and clinical skill workshops. The following is a listing of clinical rotation sites that have been used in the past and/or are currently being used.
