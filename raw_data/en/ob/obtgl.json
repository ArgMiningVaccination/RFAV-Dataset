Here is the breakdown with my current level/gear stats: As a level 30 Argonian my character has 1216 health. I would have just a little more if I added another skill point to the right racial passive, but let's go with that and assume that by attribute allocation or gear group members of the same level would have between 1000 and 1400 health around this level. The basic Healing Ritual , based on its current rank and so on, offers 250 health to nearby allies and an extra 30% for me, a total of 325 for me. The Ritual of Rebirth morph offers an extra an extra 60% rather than 30% at Rank IV, so allies would still get 250 and I would get 400. But as an Argonian I can increase healing received by up to 6%, so that would make it 424 health for me. The Lingering Ritual morph, based on current skill and the like, currently gives an extra 60 points to allies after 8 seconds, for a total of 310. So right now: Ritual of Rebirth: Allies = 250, Me = 400+ Lingering Ritual: Allies = 310, Me = 325+ But I am curious how it scales. The base description has to leave out character level and skill ranking so that you get stuff like \"Heals nearby allies for [0 / 1 / 2 / 3]\". I am trying to figure out how (far) that scales. The percentage is easier, naturally. At the moment, with characters having 1000 to 1400 health, it is easy to go either way. Lingering Ritual makes for a slightly better group heal and Ritual of Rebirth makes for a somewhat better self heal. But at VR 1? VR 10+? Will the difference still be comparable? Or will one greatly outstrip the other? I haven't used any skill points since about level 24 or so, and I have 12 and counting stored up in case I want to respec from Lingering Ritual to Ritual of Rebirth. The downside to doing so is that this spell takes 2 seconds to cast, whereas the somewhat pricier Rushed Ceremony (which does give an unlisted self heal) is an instant cast. I've been using the latter as a basic self heal, trying to decide if I should just keep it for that purpose and supplement it with Forced Siphon from the healing staff when that is ready to unlock.
