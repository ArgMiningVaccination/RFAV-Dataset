Unfortunately, each year as many as 25 percent of Americans who travel abroad experience some type of illness during their trip. On a typical two-week trip, travelers can lose an average of three days because of illness. The Edward-Elmhurst Health travel medicine specialists can help you take proactive steps to stay healthy and make most of your experience. Contact our travel medicine specialists at least six weeks before your departure, and we'll customize a plan that prepares you for every place on your itinerary. What to expect at the travel medicine clinic When you visit our travel medicine clinic, you'll consult with one of our specialists about your trip. The discussion will cover: - All the places you're visiting, the purpose and timing of your travels, and how long you plan to stay - Activities you're planning on your trip, such as mountain climbing or mission work - Your vaccination and medical history, including allergies - Your current medications Travel medicine tailored to your needs Based on your consultation, we will recommend the appropriate vaccines and prescriptions for your trip. Recommendations will be customized to your unique needs. For example, you may need medication to limit altitude sickness during a climbing expedition. You'll also learn how to plan for water and food safety, protect yourself from disease-carrying mosquitoes, and deal with traveler's diarrhea and other common ailments.
