Some of them contain beneficial medicinal compounds that can help with mood, while others act on a sensory and energetic level. The sense of smell, in particular, is powerfully associated with these emotions. If you are in need of emotional and spiritual healing, consider working with one of these herbs: Chamomile [Chamomile](https://www.originalbotanica.com/chamomile-flowers/) is used to reduce stress and anxiety. The flowers have a light, fruity aroma, almost like apples, and they are considered a powerful emotional healer in aromatherapy. Some traditions consider it a solar herb, so it is also associated with positivity, optimism, and joy. Use this herb in washes, baths, teas, and sachets to soothe and heal the emotions, and attract happy feelings. Cinnamon [Cinnamon](https://www.originalbotanica.com/cinnamon-sticks/) has a sweet, warming aroma. It is said to increase spiritual energy by raising vibrations, brings in solar energy, and elevates mood. This herb is a wonderful addition to incenses or other preparations for healing creative blocks and increasing positive emotions. Be cautious using [cinnamon powder](https://www.originalbotanica.com/cinnamon-powder/) around open flames -- it can be very flammable. Eucalyptus [Eucalyptus](https://www.originalbotanica.com/eucalyptus-leaves/) is used in poppets and hung over sick beds for healing of all kinds. The leaves are also a wonderful addition to energy cleansing baths. The fragrance is strong, but refreshing, and helps clear the mind. It can assist with spiritual and emotional healing by removing negative energy, promoting balance, calming agitation, and helping with focus and insight. Fennel [Fennel seed](https://www.originalbotanica.com/fennel-seed/) is used in spells for protection from the law, but it also has a reputation as an emotionally healing herb. It is particularly useful for people who tend to work themselves to the bone for others. When prepared as an infusion, it provides encouragement and feelings of spiritual rest. Geranium Scented geraniums have an earthy floral scent that is used in aromatherapy to help fight against stress and anxiety. Magically, it is used as a love herb, which makes it useful in workings for self-love and compassion. A necklace of geranium flowers is also said to improve mental and emotional health. Use fragrant [geranium oil](https://www.originalbotanica.com/geranium-essential-oil/) in any working to help lift your spirits or reduce your emotional burdens.

It can help increase feelings of self-love, compassion, and forgiveness. This flower also helps you tap into your energetically sensitive nature, making you more perceptive to the spiritual happenings around you. Use this when you need to heal from self-doubt or shame. Lavender [Lavender](https://www.originalbotanica.com/lavender-flowers/) is one of the best-known spiritually and emotionally healing herbs, for good reason. The fragrance is relaxing and refreshing, and the herb itself cleanses negative energy, brings peaceful vibrations, and promotes love and harmony. If you are suffering from stress in your life, working with lavender can help you clear away negativity, increase your spiritual understanding, and rejuvenate yourself. Lemon Like lavender, lemon is one of the best-known healing plants.

It has a very refreshing, bright aroma that helps lift the vibrations of any room in which it is used. Some practitioners recommend keeping a whole or sliced raw lemon in your home.
