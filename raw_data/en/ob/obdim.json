It also would effectively scrap the unpopular requirement that people have insurance and eliminate tax penalties for those who go without. The requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to their full-time employees would also be eliminated. People who let their insurance coverage lapse, however, would face a significant penalty. (Pear and Kaplan, 3/6) [ Politico: Obamacare Repeal Bill Offers Tax Credits, Big Medicaid Changes ](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/obamacare-repeal-bill-medicaid-235751) The House plan calls for age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000, replacing the Affordable Care Act's income-based subsidies.

But there are several groups that stand to clearly gain \u2014 or lose \u2014 under the plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

And the bill can't be deemed to increase the federal deficit 10 years or more from now. Some of the bill's insurance market changes may have a tough time surviving those procedural tests. (Meyer, 3/6) [ CQ Roll Call: GOP Releases Legislative Text For Obamacare Overhaul ](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5054972?1&srcpage=news&srcsec=cqn) Monday's release is the first time a replacement plan with backing from House leaders has been prepared for a floor vote and put into legislative text, rather than merely a broad blueprint, in the seven years that Republicans have called for a repeal of President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. (Williams and Mershon, 3/6) [ The Hill: ObamaCare Repeal Bill Would Defund Planned Parenthood ](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/322614-obamacare-repeal-bill-will-defund-planned-parenthood) The ObamaCare repeal bill unveiled by the House Monday includes language that would defund Planned Parenthood for a year. It's the same language included in the 2015 repeal bill that passed Congress but was vetoed by President Obama. The language, if passed, would block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Defunding Planned Parenthood has long been a goal of Republicans because it provides abortions, even though they are already legally prohibited from using federal funds for the procedure.

As expected, the bill repeals a 3.8% tax on investment income and a 0.9% tax on wages. Both levies affect only the highest-earning households, those individuals making at least $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000. (Rubin, 3/7) [ Politico: Republicans' Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Cut Taxes On The Wealthy ](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/obamacare-tax-cut-repeal-235752) Though the legislation is focused on making good on Republican promises to repeal and replace the health program, it would likely also amount to the first big tax cut of the Trump administration, one that comes even before lawmakers tackle tax reform in earnest. The plan should make rewriting the tax code easier by moving the cost of some tax cuts into separate legislation.

The House bill, unveiled Monday evening, would allow ObamaCare's \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost health plans to take effect in 2025. The tax, which has been opposed by both Democrats and Republicans, had been slated to take effect in 2020 under current law.

The Ways and Means Committee's proposal would impose the tax but delay it until 2025. The Republican proposal wouldn't alter current federal tax provisions that exclude the amounts that workers pay for health insurance from federal income and payroll taxes. For decades, lawmakers have flirted with the idea of capping or eliminating that tax break.

Prepared for the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 170 House conservatives, the staff report called the refundable tax credits \"a Republican welfare entitlement.\" (House, 3/7) [ The Hill: Freedom Caucus Chair Questions If ObamaCare Replacement Will Lower Costs ](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/health-reform-implementation/322651-freedom-caucus-chair-will-obamacare) House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-S.C.) on Monday night wondered whether his party's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare would ultimately lower healthcare costs. \"The biggest concern I have is, will it lower healthcare costs?\" he asked on Fox News's \"Hannity.\" \"Until we get that answer we have to hold out judgment.\" Meadows added the GOP is nearing a viable ObamaCare replacement, but said the party's latest version falls short of its efforts in 2015.

Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said Monday that dealing with the Medicaid expansion in a repeal of former President Barack Obama's health care law must be a \"negotiated agreement.\" Toomey also said the sickest people, such as those with serious pre-existing conditions, should be covered through a high-risk pool that is subsidized by the government to make it affordable. Toomey's comments came during a stop at the studio of Philadelphia's KYW-TV, where he answered several questions submitted online.

House Republicans in Washington, D.C., called it a necessary fix. The bill, part of President Donald Trump's campaign promise to dump Obamacare, sparked fears from some that millions of Americans will lose health coverage. (Pugh, Daugherty, Buck and Caiola, 3/6) [ Republicans Walk Political Tightrope With Proposed Health Plan ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/republicans-walk-political-tightrope-with-proposed-health-plan/) The legislation would roll back provisions that have been objected to by the Republicans' base, but it will also cover fewer people. [ The Wall Street Journal: House GOP Releases Plan To Repeal, Replace Obamacare ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-gop-releases-plan-to-repeal-replace-health-law-1488842133) The bill is a political gamble for House Republican leaders. The party and President Donald Trump ran for office on promises to repeal and replace the health law. Republicans have said their plan is aimed at decreasing costs and boosting choice for consumers. But to do so, their proposals would likely provide coverage for far fewer people than the ACA, according to a number of research reports. \"Working together, this unified Republican government will deliver relief and peace of mind to the millions of Americans suffering under Obamacare,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Perceptions that Republicans and President Donald Trump are not moving ahead with a wholesale Obamacare repeal would anger large swaths of the party's base, while the possibility of millions of Americans losing coverage could emerge as a top liability for Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

The bill also faces attack from some Senate Republicans who are concerned about any plan that eliminates existing Medicaid coverage. The critiques from both left and right underscore the difficulty the GOP leadership faces in pushing the bill, despite the Republican majorities in both the House and Senate.

With Republicans now controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the bill would drive government policy down routes long advocated by conservatives. The course correction would take at least two years to get rolling, and probably longer to show definitive results. If it falls short, it would give rise to a fresh set of health care grievances.

The proposal would scrap the underpinnings of Obamacare, including its mandate to buy insurance and many of its taxes, and establish a new refundable, age-based tax credit to help people buy insurance. Leaders aim to get a final measure to Trump's desk by mid-April, which leaves little room for error.

[ Stat: What You Need To Know About The Big Obamacare Fight: Medicaid ](https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/06/medicaid-gop-bill/) Medicaid emerged Monday as perhaps the singular issue on which the Republican bid to overhaul the Affordable Care Act will live or die. House Republicans unveiled their official plan to repeal and replace much of the health care law, including dramatic changes to Medicaid, the insurance program that covers low-income Americans and that was expanded under Obamacare. Republicans want to convert the program from the open-ended entitlement it is now to a program with a hard spending limit.

The Montana Healthcare Foundation commissioned the study. It says that since Montana joined federal Medicaid expansion in 2015, more than 71,000 Montanans have signed on to Medicaid coverage. It says more than 30,000 Montana adults have used that coverage to access preventive care.

One reason is that it is already allowed -- and yet basically doesn't happen. States possess the authority to sanction sales across their borders, and to define the conditions for such sales. In addition to this generic state authority, Section 1333 of Obamacare authorizes \"health care choice compacts\" across states. As of last month, five states had passed legislation allowing insurance plans that cross state lines: Rhode Island, Wyoming, Georgia, Kentucky and Maine. Georgia's law has been in effect since 2011, yet no insurer has yet offered an out-of-state policy there -- or in any of the other four states.

[ Detroit Free Press: 'Double Down' In Fight Against Opioid Abuse ](http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/2017/03/06/trump-prescription-drugs-opioids-epidemic-mary-bono-column/98523396/) Over the course of his campaign, President Trump heard from many Americans whose lives have been devastated by our widespread opioid abuse epidemic. The stories they were telling \u2014 specifically the growing rates of opioid use, addiction and death \u2014 were heartbreaking. We've witnessed scenes splashed across the news media this past year of a child strapped in to the back seat of a car while the parents lay motionless and dying in the front; or the gut wrenching video of a crying toddler pulling at her overdosed mother on the floor, frantically pleading for her mother to wake up. Now, even deadlier drugs have been showing up on our streets courtesy of bad actors in China and Latin America.

How did they end up in a conversation about the impact of and possible solutions for drugs and heroin in our fair city? We began our Together Lexington-sponsored Courageous Conversation perusing postcards of random images designed to stimulate conversation. And they did. We introduced ourselves to our table by relating our chosen postcard to the impact of drugs on our city. We quickly found that most of us had a personal story of being impacted by addiction.

Temper That Giddy Feeling In Your Gut ](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/upshot/exciting-microbe-research-temper-that-giddy-feeling-in-your-gut.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fhealth&_r=0) While we have long known about the existence of microbes \u2014 the tiny bacteria, fungi and archaea that live all around, on and in us \u2014 our full relationship has become one of the hottest topics for research only in recent years. Scientists believe that every person contains as many independent microbial cells as human cells. This collection of life, known as the microbiome, provides useful functions for us. Indeed, some of the things we think our bodies do are actually the abilities and enzymes of life-forms living within us. They can help with digestion, vitamin synthesis and even immunological responses. (Aaron E. Carroll, 3/6) [ Arizona Republic: Want To Live Longer? It Involves A Lot More Than You Think ](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/03/06/community-health-pfister/98537344/) Access to health care matters, but not as much as we tend to think it does. Regardless of what happens regarding calls to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Act, we still need to face the significant effects our local policies, systems and environments produce. Local health providers and hospitals are crucial partners, but they are far from the sole guardians of our longevity - as the maps so clearly illustrate.

He asks them to imagine a deity coming forth to offer society a wondrous invention, one that would make everyday life more pleasant in almost every way. This invention comes with a cost, however. In exchange, the deity would choose 1,000 young men and women and strike them dead.

The ability to stop hemorrhaging taxpayer dollars from the Medicare FFS program exists, is in place and tested\u2014it's just barely being used. After seeing its success in the private sector, Congress mandated the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Program in 2009 to review post-payment Medicare FFS claims, identify improper payments and return misbilled funds back to the program. Since the RAC program began, more than $10 billion has been returned to the Medicare Trust Funds, all while auditing a mere 2% of a provider's "}
