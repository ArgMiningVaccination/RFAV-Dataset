Objective: This study aims to investigate Jordanian nurses 'perceptions, acceptance, and factors affecting their decisions toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional design. Data have been investigated between July 1, 2021 and August 30, 2021. Nurses at three private hospitals in Jordan were surveyed online. The online survey, created using Google Forms,was distributed to nurses via email and social media sites (e.g., WhatsApp and Facebook). Participants were eligible if they were a RN nurse and/or nursing assistance, and had access to the internet via computer and/or smartphone. Results: Out of 189 responses, 50.6% agreed to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 25.5% disagreed, and 23.9% were undecide to receive the vaccine. A large proportion (84.66%) of the respondents had a negative perception toward the vaccine, while only a small minority (15.34%) had a positive perception of it. The older nurses, those with more experience, and those with a higher level of education were more likely to accept the vaccine, with ac ceptance rates of 56.1%, 54.8%, and 63.9%, respectively. Conclusion: Of the nurses surveyed, 84.66% had a negative perception of the COVID-19 vaccine, and only 50.6% reported that they would be willing to get vaccinated. It is crucial to addres s the concerns and reduce apprehension among nurses about the vaccine. Efforts to increase awareness about the importance of va ccination in controlling the disease through workshops and online meetings are needed.

Consequently, due to the infection 's alarming rates of spread and severity, the World Health Organization (WHO)proclaimed COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to a wide variety of illnesses, from asymptomatic to lethal, frommild to severe (Richardson et al., 2020). Fever, exhaustion, a dry cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia, anosmia, and ageusia are typical COVID-19 clinical signs (Guan et al.,2020; Richardson et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020). Nations around the world have implemented different control measures, such as social distancing, partial andcomprehensive lockdowns, closing schools and businesses,and/or wearing face masks in public, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lessen its health effects. Areturn of COVID-19 has been recorded as societies and econ- omies have reopened, despite the fact that such efforts have helped to flatten the epidemic curve (Devi, 2020; Shimizu et al., 2020). Long-term preventive actions are therefore urgently needed. Herd immunity, which is described as a degree of immunity in a community that prevents epidemicsthrough natural infection, is something that few nations have 1Faculty of Medical Sciences, Nursing Department, University of Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2Faculty of Nursing, Applied Science Private University, Jordan Corresponding Author: Khulud Ahmad Rezq, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Nursing Department, University of Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

However, such a strategy has been regarded as unethical and impractical (Grif n, 2020; Orlowski and Goldsmith, 2020). Review of Literature Currently, coronaviruses are the leading cause of respiratory illness. Several single-stra nded RNA viruses may produce any- t h i n gf r o ma no r d i n a r yc o l dt ol i f e - t h r e a t e n i n gs y m p t o m s(Cascella et al., 2022). There has been increasing worldwide concern about the coronavirus o wing to its great transmission capacity, which may be linked to mortality and morbidity(Wang et al., 2021). Current prophylactic means are essential to rapidly inhibit the dramatic situ ation triggering high mortality rates (Kurtulus and CAN, 2021). DNA and RNA, viral vector, inactivated, live attenuated vira l, and recombinant protein vac- cines are some of the methods being investigated to enhance SARS-CoV-2 immunizations. In fluenza and other infectious dis- eases can be prevented through va ccinations (Liu et al., 2020). Healthcare professionals (HCP s) should be vaccinated against diseases that provide a larger risk of infection than the generalpopulation (Dini et al., 2018). Healthcare workers (HCWs) are given priority for early COVID-19 vaccination because they are at high risk for occupational SARS-CoV-2 exposure andtransmission. As a result, it 's critical to identify the extent of vaccine hesitancy among HCWs and state its underlying reasons in order to promote imm unization and support efforts to stop the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine ef cacy, safety, and the conceivably rushed pro- duction process are the common barriers toward vaccinationamong HCWs. Vaccine communications present various chal- lenges, which require understanding audiences to improve messages and help save lives. This concern is necessarybecause vaccine hesitancy in the US has been observed (Piltch-loeb and Diclemente, 2020). Even though immuniza- tion facilities are readily available, some people are still reluc-tant to be vaccinated (WHO, 2014). Public awareness is critical in the ght against the spread of highly contagious respiratory infections, especially in low- and middle-income countries where health services are only moderately equipped to deal with epidemics (Abdelha z et al., 2020). It is estimated that vaccine production will take months, and therefore the majorityof management of the crisis is dependent on people adhering to the suggested procedures. These measurements are in fluenced mainly by the public 's knowledge, attitude, and practices (Zhong et al., 2020). Learning from China 's SARS outbreak in 2003 suggests that panic emotion is associated with how knowledgeable and attuned people are to infectious diseasesamong people, which can further confuse efforts to counteract the disease spread (Abdelha z et al., 2020). Such uncommon s i t u a t i o n sa r em a d em o r ed i f cult by underestimating, stigma- tizing, panic emotions, false preventive measures, and stigma- tization. (Zhong et al., 2020). A variation reported in vaccine acceptance ranged from as low as 27.7% in CongoleseHCWs (Kabamba Nzaji et al., 2020) to as high as more than95% in a study involving HCWs from the Asia Paci c region. Several studies have evaluated vaccine attitudes inHCWs prior to the vaccine 's availability and uptake (Chew et al., 2021). Several Arab nations have reported more corona- virus infections and fatalities in recent months, bringing thetotals from the start of the pandemic to around 4.5 million and 76 thousand, respectively, until mid-March 2021. Qunaibi et al. (2021) reported a high rate of vaccine hesitancypostvaccine availability in Arab countries; according to Qattan et al. (2021) in Saudi Arabia, about 25% of tested sample was expected to have the vaccine once available, while in Egypt(Hussein et al., 2021) cited 46% of HCWs somewhat/totally agreed to receive the vaccine. A cross-sectional study found that among 385 Egyptian HCWs, 51% were undecided aboutreceiving COVID-19 vaccine, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. According to the study, the reasons for vaccine hes- itancy were a lack of clinical trials and apprehension about thevaccine 's side effects (Fares et al., 2021). Another study found that 70% of 5,237 Pakistani HCWs accepted COVID-19 vacci- nation, 24.5% wanted to wait until more data was available, and5.2% refused to be vaccinated. The reasons for rejections were vaccine effectiveness and vaccine side effect (Malik, Malik, and Ishaq 2021). In addition, 76.9% of French HCWs would accepta COVID-19 vaccine. Nurses and assistant nurses were less likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was linked to lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance(Gagneux-Brunon et al., 2021). Lack of information about the vaccine 's side effects and a lack of knowledge about the vaccine itself were the two biggest hurdles to COVID-19 vacci-nation among Egyptian medical students (Saied et al., 2021). Greater vaccination acceptability was mostly associated with attitudes toward vaccination 'sb e n e ts, perceived vaccine ef - cacy, social environment in fluence, patient protection, and medical professionals 'duties. Concerns about side effects and complications were the main reasons why nursing studentsrefused vaccinations(Krega r Velikonja et al., 2021). Unfortunately, there is no previous study that evaluates the per- ception and acceptance of Jordanian nursing of COVID-19vaccine, as nursing is part of the Jordanian society that is affected by myths and inform ation transmitted about the vaccine. Therefore, an update of the status of vaccine hesitancyamong HCWs in general, and among Arabic-speaking HCWs is highly required. This study will help to ll a knowledge gap about why some nurses refuse COVID-19 vaccination andwhat factors in fluence their perception and acceptance to be vaccinated, with the aim of investigating Jordanian nurses 'per- ceptions, acceptance, and factors affecting their decisionstowards the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Design Cross-sectional design was used in this study to capture a snapshot of the perceptions and acceptance of the2 SAGE Open NursingCOVID-19 vaccine among nurses in Jordan at a speci c point in time. The study aimed to provide an understandingof the current situation among nurses in Jordan regarding the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perception, rather than following them over a period of time. A cross-sectionaldesign allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about the study sample at a speci c point in time. Data Collection and Setting The study was conducted between July 1, 2021, and August 30, 2021. The online poll, which was created using Google Forms, was sent to a list of nurses via email and social media sites (e.g., Facebook and WhatsApp). The surv ey responses were collected anonymously. The sample for this study was obtained from three private hospit als in Amman, Jordan 's capital city. Each hospital has an average 200 beds and 120 nursing staffmembers, including RN nurses and assistant nurses. These private hospitals accept patie nts with private insurance and some with government insurance. Nursing handlesCOVID-19 cases before the diagnosis is known, and once the d i a g n o s i si sc o n r m e d ,t h e ya r et r a n s f e r r e dt oM i n i s t r yo f Health hospitals for f ollow-up and admission if necessary. Sample Convenience sampling was used in this study due to the restric- tions during the pandemic that limited the opportunity to reach the nurses and at the same time, the demands of the pandemic in the HCW preoccupied the nurses. However, convenience sam-pling can still provide valuable insights into the perceptions and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among nurses. An online survey was sent to all nurses working at the selected hospital inJordan. They received the online survey through emails and phone messages, which collaborators arranged in the internal communication channels at the nursing administrators in eachhospital. A total of 189 nurses who ful lled the inclusion crite- ria were included in this study. Inclusion criteria required par- ticipants to be RN nurse and/or nursing assistants and hadaccess to the internet via computer and/or smartphone, to apply the inclusion criteria, there was a question about the job title with two responses (RN or Nursing assistant, andothers); if the response was \"others,\" the participant was excluded from the study. Sample size applied for nurses working at the selected hospi- tal in Jordan was determined using Epi-info 7 formed on a 5% variance at 95% con dence with 0.80 power at a 0.5 signi cance level. The minimum required sample size was determined to be(N=164). Instruments Online questionnaires, adapted from previous studies (Fares et al., 2021, Fakonti et al., 2021, and Elhadi et al., 2021),were utilized in this study. To ensure content validity,nursing experts were consulted, including an Associate Professor in Medical Surgical Nursing, an AssociateProfessor in Community Health Nursing, and an Assistant Professor in Leadership and Management Nursing, who were selected from Tabuk and Cairo universities. To re ne the survey items for language and expressivity, a pilot sample of 20 participants was used. The nal questionnaire was estimated to take between 5 to 10 min to complete andwas initially written in English before being translated into Arabic. The online survey comprised two parts: Part 1 focused on sociodemographic characteristics and healthhistory, such as age, gender, education level, years of experi- ence, chronic illness, had COVID-19 infection, and had COVID-19 vaccine. Part 2 investigated the participants 'per- ceptions towards COVID-19 vaccines, which consisted of six statements with three response levels (agree, undecided, dis- agree). The items in this section had good reliability, with aCronbach 's alpha of 0.665. Participants were given one point for each agree response and zero for disagree or unde- cided responses. Scores below 60% were considered a nega-tive perception, while scores equal to or above 60% were considered a positive perception. The cutoff point was tested on a pilot sample of 20 participants, and 4 marks(60%) were chosen as the optimal cut-off point for a high likelihood ratio. Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was measured by the participants responses to a question if theyagreed to receive it. Responses were categorized as \"agree,\" \"undecided, \"or\"disagree. \"In this study, \"undecided \" as \"disagree \"to examine the associ- ation between demographic variables and nurses 'acceptance of the vaccine. The potential factors investigated as in fluences on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perception included age,gender, education level, years of nursing experience, history of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, presence of chronic illness, and history of COVID-19 infection. Ethical Considerations To ensure that this research adheres to ethical standards, it has received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board at Applied Science Private University (IRB NO:2020-2021-2-1), Amman, Jordan. P rior to starting the online questionnaire, a comprehensive in formation sheet was provided to participants to ensure informed consent. Con dentiality and privacy of the data were maintaine d by storing all personal infor- mation collected during the study in secure folders with restricted access only to the researchers, and measures were taken toprevent any unauthorized access. Statistical Analysis The data was collected, processe d, entered, and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Soci al Sciences (IBM -SPSS version 21). Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentagewere used to report demographic data. The strength andRezq and Al_zaghmouri 3direction of the linear relation ship between sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, experience, chronicillness, COVID-19 infectio n, and COVID-19 vaccine) and nurses 'perception of the COVID-19 vaccine were determined using Pearson correlation coef cients test, with a signi cant p-value <.05. The chi-square test was used to assess the associ- ation between sociodemographic factors and the with a signi cantp-value <.05. Uncompleted forms were excluded from the analysis. Results Respondent Demographics and Their Health History According to the analysis of data ( n=189), mean age of the participants was 30.2 \u00b13.7 years, ranging from 18 -50 years. Of the participants, 24.3% were males, 75.7% were females, 19.0% were Postgraduate, 73.5% were Bachelor, and 7.4%were Diploma. Participants 'working experience ranged from zero to more than 10 years, with a mean time of 27.2 \u00b149.2 years (Table 1). The rate of people who said they had a long-term illness was 19.6%. Although 81.0% of the participant reported that they had COVID-19 vaccine, the rate of nurses who Suffer from COVID-19 infection was42.3% (Table 2). Respondent Perception Towards Corona Vaccine Table 3 displays the perception of nurses toward coronavaccine. This table shows that 45.5% of the participants reported that the Coronavirus is man-made, whereas 38.6% disagree, 40.2% thought the Vaccines available in Jordanare considered safe. In comparison, 49.7% disagree, 56.6%agreed that COVID-19 Vaccines reduce the spread of disease, whereas 27.5% differ, 52.4% of the participantssaid they worried about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. In comparison, 21.7% were not worried about side effects. Moreover, 45.0% of nurses said they trust scienti c studies regarding the vaccine 's effectiveness and complica- tions, whereas 33.3% disagree. Besides, 9.5% of the studied sample said that vaccine complications are seriousand should not be taken. In comparison, 28.6% did not con- sider the vaccine complications to be serious and should be taken (Table 3). Furthermore, 84.66% (160) had a negativeperception toward the vaccine, while the remaining 15.34% (29) of the nurses had a positive perception toward it, as depicted in Figure 1. Additionally, Table 4 reveals a signi - cant negative correlation between age and nurses 'perception of the COVID-19 vaccine ( r=.148, p=.043). This sug- gests that as age increases, nurses may have a less positiveperception of the vaccine. Moreover, Table 4 demonstrates a negative correlation between the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine and nurses 'perception of it, although this correlation is marginally signi cant ( p=.054), which means that it is close to, but does not quite reach, statistical signicance at the 0.05 level. None of the other sociodemo- graphic variables were signi cantly associated with nurses ' perception of the vaccine, as their p-values were >.05. Respondent Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine Table 5 depicts the association b etween demographic parameters and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance level in the examined group. This table indicate d statistically signi cant discrepancies between allowable values for various age groups ( p<.032), the lowest acceptance level (29.2%) was obtained for participants aged 18:<30, while the highest acceptance level (56.1%) was obtained for participants aged 40 to <50 years old.Furthermore, there have been signi cant statistical variations in acceptable levels of various Experience years ( p=.007), with considerably lower acceptance levels acquired for 0:5 (30.8%)and greater acceptance level mean scores obtained for 10 yearsTable 1.

There were also statistically signi cant variations in acceptance of different levels of education ( p=.016*), with Diploma nurses having a much lower acceptance rate (28.6%) and Postgraduate nurses having a signi cantly higher acceptance rate (63.9%). Furthermore, there were statistically signi cant variations in acceptable levels of nurses who got the corona vaccine ( p=.001), with a considerably greater acceptance level for those who had the vaccine (49%) and a lower accep-tance level for those who did not get the vaccine (19.4%). Table 5 also indicates that there is no signi cant relationship between nurses 'gender, chronic illness, and the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, Figure 2 shows that 50.6% of nurses agree to receive COVID-19 vaccine compared to 25.5% disagree, and 23.9% of nurses they were undecidedabout COVID-19 vaccine. Discussion This study was conducted among Jordanian nurses to inves-tigate their perceptions, acceptance, and factors affectingtheir decisions toward the COVID-19 vaccines. It was found that 42.3% of the participants were infected with coro-navirus. Meanwhile, 81% of the participants received the COVID-19 vaccine (Table 2). This percentage is considered acceptable and high given the magnitude of the COVID-19pandemic. Moreover, this study revealed that more than half (50.6%) of the nurses agreed to receive the vaccine compared to less than one-third (25.5%) who disagreed(Figure 2). These ndings indicate that even though 81% of nurses received the COVID-19 vaccine, only 50.6% of them agreed to receive it, suggesting that some nurses mayhave been forced to receive the COVID-19 in accordance with hospital policies. This conclusion corroborates ndings from a Saudi Arabian investigation (Alhofaian et al., 2021),in which more than two-thirds of the health care provider is willing to receive the vaccine, and nurses have reported the highest acceptance level among healthcare providers. Additionally, it corroborates the ndings of French research (Gagneux-Brunon et al., 2021) which revealed that 76.9% ofthe healthcare provider accepted the Vaccine. Yet it is oddTable 3.

The present study found that 84.66% of the nurses had a negative perception of the vaccine, while 15.3% of them had a positive perception toward it (Figure 1). This nding suggests that the majority of the surveyed nurses have a neg- ative perception of the COVID-19 vaccine. Possible reasons for this negative perception could include concerns about thesafety or ef cacy of the vaccine, misinformation, or lack of information about the vaccine, or personal beliefs or values that con flict with vaccination. However, the result of this study showed that around 50% of participants expressed safety issues regarding the vaccination once it became acces- sible, as evidenced by their concern regarding potentialadverse effects. Additionally, fewer than half (45.5%) of individuals felt that the COVID humans created 19 viruses, almost half of them (49.7%) thought the vaccines availablein Jordan were considered not safe, more than half (56.6%) agreed that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the morbidity and mortality, and (52.4%) of the participants concerned aboutthe vaccine 's adverse effects and its complication. Besides, less than half (45.0%) of nurses were trusted by the scienti c studies regarding the vaccine 's effectiveness and complica- tions. In comparison, less than one-third of them (28.6%) considered the Vaccine complications severe and should not be taken. This nding corresponds with the results of(Elhadi et al., 2021) who reported that among 2452 health- care providers (37%) of the worries regarding vaccine-related serious consequences, (38.7%) considered COVID-19 to be man-made; (86%) felt vaccination might help reduce morbid-ity and death rates (Elhadi et al., 2021). Additionally, the new study 'sndings corroborate Pogue et al'conclusion that most participants (63%) in the United States of America expressed concern about the COVID-19 vaccine 's negative effects (Kregar Velikonja et al. 2021). Additionally, (Fakonti et al., 2021) found in his study thatthe primary reasons for nurses and midwives in Cyprus not obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine were worries about the vac- cine's rapidly fear and developing of side effects. Although (Fares et al., 2021) found that vaccine hesitation was due to a lack of clinical testing and concern about vaccine side effects, the primary factor that may boost vaccination accept-ability among healthcare professionals was access to suf - cient and correct information about available vaccinations. Another survey performed in Jordan discovered that (49%)of participants felt that most of the people would avoid taking the Vaccine owing to worries about the Vaccine 's adverse effects and that they simply don 't trust any informa- tion regarding the vaccine (El-Elimat et al., 2021).

Providing accurate information and transparency about vaccine safety and effec- tiveness is essential to building people 's trust, especially those uncertain about vaccines. For any future national vac- cination campaign to be successful, it is necessary to identify the sources of information most trusted by the public aboutCOVID-19 (El-Elimat et al., 2021). Thendings of this study showed that age is signi cantly negatively correlated with nurses 'perception of the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that as age increases, nurses may have a less positive perception of the vaccine. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the administra-tion of the COVID-19 vaccine and nurses 'perception of it was found in this study. However, this correlation was only marginally signi cant ( p=.054), meaning it was almost stat- istically signi cant but did not quite reach the level of signif- icance at (0.05). Additionally, this study found none of the other sociodemographic variables, including gender, educa-tion, experience, chronic illness, and history of COVID-19 infection, were signi cantly correlated with nurses 'percep- tion of the vaccine. This nding is consistent with a study conducted in China among HCWs, which found that older HCWs were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine than younger HCWs, likely due to their concerns about thevaccine 's safety and ef cacy (Wang et al., 2021). Similarly, another study conducted in the United States found that HCWs aged 50 and older were less likely toreport receiving the COVID-19 vaccine than younger HCWs, possibly due to their greater concerns about the vac- cine's safety and side effects (Painter et al., 2021). According to Hurley and Freund (2021), age is negatively correlated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, which suggests that older adults may have a less positive perception of thevaccine. Furthermore, Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, and Fergus (2021) found that HCWs who had not received the COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to have negative per-ceptions of the vaccine, including concerns about safety and ef cacy. Overall, these ndings underscore the need toconsider age and perceptions, when developing strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs. The present study revealed that the lowest acceptance level (29.2%) was among those aged 18 years to less than 30 years old, while the highest acceptance level (56.1%)was among those aged 40 years to less than 50 years old. This nding corroborates ndings from Libyan research (Elhadi et al., 2021) which reported that the highest accep-tance level was among age 31 to less than 50 years old of health care providers. In contrast to another study done in Jordan, (El-Elimat et al., 2021) suggested that older agegroups >35 years old have been less likely to receive COVID-19 immunizations than younger age groups. This discrepancy is thought to be attributable to the study 's meth- odology, as senior respondents are less likely to engage in online surveys. In addition, a lower acceptance level was among less than 5 years of experience (30.8%), whereasthe higher acceptance level was among more than 10 years (54.8%). This nding corresponds with the results of (Fakonti et al., 2021), who reported that nurses with moreyears of experience were intended to accept the vaccine in Cyprus. This conclusion is consistent with research done in Turkey; a correlation was discovered between years of exten-sive experience and vaccination acceptability among health- care providers (Yigit et al. 2021). There is a strong possibility that the COVID-19 vaccination will be approved in the olderage range, as they are more vulnerable and more likely to be interested in utilizing it. At the same time, more experienced nurses could see the positive effects of vaccination and there-fore be less reluctant. The current study revealed that Diploma nurses had a lower acceptance level (28.6%), while postgraduate nurses had a higher acceptance level(63.9%). These results correspond with a study conducted in Pakistan that revealed that HCWs who have a higher level of education reported higher levels of acceptance ofvaccines (Malik et al. 2021). Yet, this conclusion contrasts with the ndings of (Fares et al., 2021 & Fakonti et al., 2021), who found no statistically signi cant relationships between educational attainment and degree of acceptance among healthcare personnel. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the methodology and study settings. The current study 'sndings also showed that there was no signicant association between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and the gender of the nurse or theirchronic disease. This result was supported by Gagneux-Brunon et al. (2021) who found that chronic condi- tion was not a predictor of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccineamong HCWs. Yet, this conclusion odd with the results of Malik et al. (2021), who reported that female gender was a predictor for accepting or refusing the COVID-19 vaccineamong HCWs. Also, the results of Yigit et al. (2021), who revealed that male gender was a predictor for COVID-19 acceptability among healthcare practitioners. The study 's sample size is assumed to be responsible for this disparity. To manage a pandemic, the COVID-19 vaccine must be Figure 2. Percentage of the studied nurse 's acceptance regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ( n=189).Rezq and Al_zaghmouri 7available and effective. There must be trust and acceptance for health and policy decisions. As a result, both thegeneral public and HCPs have voiced their unhappiness. Vaccination refusal can be caused by hesitancy and post- ponement. To increase vaccination rates among nurses inJordan, it is essential to combine education and recommenda- tions. Herd immunity requires higher levels of compliance among nurses, according to our research. It is necessary toreduce anxiety and increase vaccination con dence. As a result, nurses should be informed about the vaccine advan- tages and the dangers of sickness for themselves, their fami-lies, and their patients. Strengths and Limitations Our study results are providing an initial and rst report about the perception and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine amongJordanian nurses as well as the factors that in fluence their acceptance. This will help the policymakers to plan a vacci- nation program and promote nurses according to the predic-tors of acceptance identi ed in this study. This can be viewed as the study 's strength. Even though our study sample was small, a limit factor in our study is the use of a nonrandomsampling technique which raises questions about its repre- sentativeness, which limits the generalizability of our nd- ings. Another one is that participation required access to acomputer, tablet, or smartphone, which could have led to bias in participant selection. In addition, at a time when COVID-19 vaccines are still being developed and tested,we noticed participants 'willingness to accept a vaccine. Therefore, people 's opinions on vaccination may change when more evidence about the safety and ef cacy of COVID-19 vaccines becomes available. In addition, a chi-square test was used in this study to identify the factors influence on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among Jordanian nurses. In fact, the chi-square test cannot be used to determine the direction and magnitude of the association. We suggested that future studies with a larger sample size usea multivariable regression analysis to identify the factors influence on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. As a result, the association 's adjusted effect sizes can be reported. Implications for Practice Thendings of this study indicate that a signi cant number of nurses have negative perception about COVID-19 vaccine and exhibit hesitancy toward taking it. To addressthis concern, healthcare policymakers should improve com- munication with nurses through various channels, involving them in online meetings and workshops to provide accurateinformation about the vaccine, and create a supportive envi- ronment to improve vaccination rates among HCWs. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into nurses 'perceptions and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, which can informstrategies to increase vaccination rates and achieve better disease control. Conclusion Thendings of the current study shed light on nurses 'per- ception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, as wellas the factors in fluencing their perception and acceptance. which showed that nurses 'perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were signi cantly associated with various factors, including age, years of experience, and edu- cational level. The majority of the nurses had a negative per- ception of the vaccine, and only half of them agreed to takethe vaccine. Additionally, many nurses had concerns about the safety and side effects of the vaccine and believed that the Coronavirus was man-made. The study results suggestthat efforts need to be made to address these concerns and increase nurses 'awareness of the importance of vaccination in disease control.
