Visa Free Travel for U.S. Citizen Tourists Currently, tourists with U.S. passports do not need visas for short-term visits (up to three months). Because travel regulations and restrictions are complex and are subject to change with little notice, the U.S. Embassy strongly urges any U.S. citizens considering travel to Japan to carefully review the information available from the Government of Japan. Travelers who are unsure of their eligibility to travel to Japan should contact the nearest Japanese embassy or consulate for additional information. Effective as of midnight April 29, 2023 (Japan time), all travelers arriving in Japan will no longer need to present proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test certificate.

The U.S. Embassy's ability to intervene on behalf of travelers denied boarding at their point of embarkation or denied entry upon arrival to Japan is extremely limited, and those travelers denied entry at Japanese ports of entry will likely be immediately reboarded on flights back to the United States. Please note travel and entry requirements are subject to frequent change. For more information and the most recent guidance, please reach out to Japanese embassy or consulate closest to your location: [https://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/over/index.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/over/index.html) Travelers entering Japan may use the Electronic Customs Declaration Gates (e-Gates) for customs clearance, which reduces human-to-human contact.

Know Before You Go: Prohibited Substances Many common medications and over-the-counter drugs in the United States are illegal in Japan, regardless of whether you have a valid U.S. prescription. If you bring it with you, you risk arrest and detention by Japanese authorities. It is your responsibility to ensure you understand what substances are prohibited. The U.S. Embassy and consulates in Japan do not maintain a comprehensive list of prohibited medications or substances. Comprehensive information is available only from the Japanese government and is subject to change without notice. Please check Japan's [Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) website](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html), including the [FAQ](https://uploads.mwp.mprod.getusinfo.com/uploads/sites/7/2023/07/qa2.pdf), or email [yakkan@mhlw.go.jp](mailto:yakkan@mhlw.go.jp) before traveling to Japan. Travelers who need to bring more than the MLHW's approved quantity of medication or medical devices should obtain a \"Yunyu Kakunin-sho\" (importation certificate) prior to traveling and present it with the prescription to a customs officer upon arrival in Japan. Certificate approval by the Japanese government may take several weeks to process and should be received before bringing the medication or medical devices to Japan. All travelers entering Japan with a prescription medication, including medication that is not restricted in Japan, should consider bringing a copy of their doctor's prescription as well as a letter stating the purpose of the drug. For more information about bringing medicines into Japan and how to obtain a \"Yunyu Kakunin-sho\" certificate, please visit [the website of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) and email [yakkan@mhlw.go.jp](mailto:yakkan@mhlw.go.jp).
