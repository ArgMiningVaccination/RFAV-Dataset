Little is known about the factors that determine preferential onset of fibrosis inparticular tissues. Here we show that plasma membrane (PM) overgrowth causes pericellularCollagen accumulation in Drosophila adipocytes. We found that loss of Dynamin and other endocytic components causes pericellular trapping of outgoing Collagen IV due to dramatic cortex expansion when endocytic removal of PM is prevented. Deposits also form in the absence of negative Tollimmune regulator Cactus, excess PM being caused in this case by increased secretion. Finally, weshow that trimeric Collagen accumulation, downstream of Toll or endocytic defects, activates a tissuedamage response. Our work indicates that traffic imbalances and PM topology may contribute tofibrosis. It also places fibrotic deposits both downstream and upstream of immune signaling,consistent with the chronic character of fibrotic diseases. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07187.001 Introduction Basement membranes are polymers of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that underlie epithelia and surround organs in all animals ( Yurchenco, 2011 ;Kelley et al., 2014 ). Their main constituent is Collagen IV, a helical trimer consisting of three chains, capable of forming polymeric networks that interact with other ECM proteins. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged in recent years as an excellent model to study production of Collagen and other ECM proteins thanks to evolutionaryconservation, powerful genetic tools and little genetic redundancy ( Denef et al., 2008 ;Martinek et al., 2008 ;Bunt et al., 2010 ;Haigo and Bilder, 2011 ;Drechsler et al., 2013 ;Lerner et al., 2013 ; Na et al., 2013 ;Devergne et al., 2014 ;McCall et al., 2014 ;Xiao et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2014 ). Two Collagen IV chains exist in Drosophila , encoded by Collagen at 25C (Cg25C ,1 chain) and viking (vkg,2 chain). Apart from Collagen IV, BMs include Laminin, Nidogen and Perlecan, which are conserved from flies to humans as well ( Hynes, 2012 ). In the larva, the main source of Collagen IV is the adipocytes of the fat body ( Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ), known for their role in lipid storage and metabolic regulation, but also as an active secretory tissue which produces serum proteins and clotting factors normally present in the hemolymph (insect blood). The fat body is also a key effectorof innate immunity, known to produce and secrete to the hemolymph large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in response to infections ( Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007 ). Secreted proteins like Collagen reach the extracellular space through a controlled series of membrane traffic events ensuring fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (PM). Besides its role in cargo transport, membrane trafficking is a well-recognized driver of changes in cell shape and PM amount during morphogenesis ( Lecuit and Pilot, 2003 ).

Zang et al during dorsal closure ( Mateus et al., 2011 widening of the lumen of tracheae ( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). The studied example of traffic-driven morphogenesis is perhaps blastoderm cellularization in the early Drosophila embryo. During blastoderm cellularization, fast directed PM growth results from membrane contributions from the secretory pathway ( Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000 al., ;Sokac Wieschaus, 2008 2013 ) PM elaborations ( Figard et al., 2013 ). While these examples highlight the potential of membrane traffic to elicit drastic changes in cell shape in the context of morphogenetic events, a role of in maintaining stable cortical morphology has not been addressed in detail and little is known on how cells normally regulate PMamount. Furthermore, the consequences for cell physiology of changes in this fundamental property are also unknown. Handling of Collagen entails several challenges to secreting cells. Because of its large size, secretory transport of Collagen molecules requires carriers larger than regular COPII vesicles ( Saito et al., 2009 ). Also, Collagen molecules undergo postranslational modification along the secretory pathway by numerous Collagen-modifying enzymes such as glycosidases, and and ). Prolyl-hydroxylation in particular is essential for trimer by the 2011 ). Unlike fibrilar Collagen I, which flies lack, Collagen IV is secreted in functional form and does not require extracellular cleavage of the N- and C-terminal propeptides ( Khoshnoodi et al., 2008 ). Therefore, and given its ability to form supramolecular assemblies, it is not known how Collagen IV avoids aggregation inside secreting cells or at their PM. Finally, because Collagen isresistant to most proteases, disposing of aggregates when they occur is highly problematic. Such is the case of fibrotic diseases, characterized by aberrant and excessive deposition of ECM due to persistent immune stim ulation following diverse types of injuries ( Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012 ). In a variety of tissues such as the liver, skin, kidney or fat tissue, fibrosis disr upts tissue organization and increases matrix stiffness, affect ing normal cell and tissue physiology ( Hoffman et al., 2011 ; Friedman et al., 2013 ).eLife digest In animals, so-called 'basement membranes' surround organs and help to both anchor certain tissue types together and control which molecules move between them. Thebasement membrane is made up of various proteins, and a large protein called Collagen IV is themost abundant component. Collagen IV is made inside cells and packaged into bubble-like compartments called vesicles. These vesicles then merge with the cell membrane, which releases the collagen into the spaceoutside the cell. Sometimes, after it has been released from the cell, Collagen IV forms harmful aggregates that the body finds difficult to break down. This condition is known as fibrosis, and can severely damage organs and tissues. Zang, Wan et al. have now studied how fat cells\u2014also known as adipocytes\u2014in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster release Collagen IV. This fly is widely used to study collagen production because it is relatively easy to perform genetic investigations on it, and it releases collagen from itscells in the same way as many other species. Unexpectedly, it was observed that proteins that controla process known as endocytosis\u2014which takes substances into the cell\u2014are also involved in releasingCollagen IV from the cell. Zang, Wan et al. found that this is because endocytosis removes part of the cell membrane: if endocytosis is blocked, then the excess cell membrane traps Collagen IV molecules after they have been released, causing aggregates like those seen during fibrosis. However,artificially decreasing the amount of cell membrane restored normal collagen release. Zang, Wan et al. next found that a pathway called Toll, which is important for protecting flies against infections, can also affect collagen release. When a protein that inactivates the Toll pathwayis absent, too much cell membrane grows and Collagen IV forms aggregates as well. In both cases,Toll activation or lack of endocytosis, the aggregates trigger a reaction that damages the adipocytes.Understanding this reaction in more detail could help to develop treatments for conditions that produce fibrosis. article Cell biology |ImmunologyIn this work, we conducted a screening for genes involved in Collagen IV secretion by the fat body adipocytes in Drosophila . We found that loss of shibire and other endocytic genes leads to excess PM growth, which traps Collagen IV in the pericellular space. Pericellular Collagen IV trapping alsoresults upon loss of loss of negative immune regulator cactus , which causes PM overgrowth through a Toll-dependent secretory burst. The accumulation of Collagen IV in the secreting adipocytes has two main consequences: Collagen IV deficit in the BMs of destination tissues and an immune responseagainst adipocytes due to the abnormal ECM accumulation. Results Endocytic defects cause Collagen IV accumulation in Drosophila adipocytes To gain new insights into Collagen biogenesis, we conducted a screening for genes affecting production of Collagen IV by fat body adipocytes, its main source in the Drosophila larva ( Figure ). We used BM-40-SPARC-GAL4 al., 2011 ) to drive expression in adipocytes of the RNAi transgenes in the TRiP collection (8459 lines targeting 6200 genes) ( Ni et al., 2008 ,2011 ) and analyzed the localization of Vkg-GFP, a functional GFP-trap fusion to the Collagen IV chain Vkg ( Morin et al., 2001 ). While a majority of hits produced intracellular Collagen IV accumulation (full results to be published later), a distinct phenotypical category consisted of 60 genes causing accumulation at ornear the PM ( Supplementary file 1 ). Among the strongest hits in this category were two different RNAi transgenes targeting shibire (shi), encoding fly Dynamin, a GTPase involved in excision of endocytic vesicles ( Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 ).shibire knock-down ( shi i), as well as expression of dominant negative Dynamin (ShiK44A)(Moline et al., 1999 ), caused Vkg accumulation 1B ). phenotype, confirmed Figure 1C ), attesting to the sensitivity of the antibody. Since Collagen IV is a heterotrimer combining the 2 chain Vkg with Cg25C 1 chains, we performed a staining with an anti-Cg25C antibody we generated for this study (seeFigure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). This staining revealed that Vkg, accumulates in shiiadipocytes ( Figure 1D ), thus confirming Collagen IV accumulation in these cells. The accumulation of Collagen IV occurs at the cell periphery, under a basement membrane surrounding the tissue in thewild type and which still forms in shi iadipocytes ( Figure 1D ; see also Figure 3B later). Further validating the requirement of shibire in normal Collagen IV distribution, shi1andshi2thermosensitive mutations ( Kim and Wu, 1990 ) also caused Vkg accumulation in adipocytes when larvae grew at restrictive temperature ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ). In addition to Dynamin, a number of hits showing a similar peripheral Collagen IV accumulation phenotype in the screening turned out to encode components of the endocytic machinery as well,such as Rab5 Hrs Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ), suggesting that defective endocytosis was indeed the cause for the phenotype. Concurrent with the accumulation of CollagenIV in the adipocytes producing it, we found that the amount of Collagen IV present in destination BMs (Figure 1G ) and in the hemolymph ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) was reduced in these conditions. In agreement with this, we observed elongation of the ventral nerve cord ( Figure 1H ), a deformation associated with Collagen IV reduction ( Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ). We therefore conclude from these data that loss of shibire and other endocytic genes causes accumulation of Collagen IV in the adipocytes that normally secrete it and set out next to ascertain the mechanism by which thisaccumulation occurs. Collagen accumulation in endocytosis-defective cells is pericellular and autonomous Accumulations of Collagen IV in shiiadipocytes were found in close proximity to the PM, as revealed by the membrane marker myr-mRFP (myristoylation domain of Src fused to and by phalloidin of the cell cortex ( Figure 2B ). To determine whether Collagen IV accumulations were intracellular or extracellular we FM4-64 ( Bolte et al., 2004 ) to label membrane directly in contact with the extracellular space (PM). Short incubation with FM4-64 showed that the accumulations were surrounded by PM ( Figure 2C ) and, thus, likely extracellular.

( E) Vkg accumulation in Figure 1. continued on Zang al . eLife |Immunologyaccumulations was equally observed when shiiadipocytes were fixed and stained with fluorescently- labeled fixable dextrans of molecular weights 70,000 ( Figure ) and 3000 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ). To confirm that the Collagen IV accumulations in shiiadipocytes were extracellular, we performed antibody stainings without permeabilizing the cells (no detergent in washing or blockingsolutions). As a control, we stained Tango1 iadipocytes, known to retain Collagen IV intracellularly (Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ), and found that intracellularly retained Collagen IV could not be stained without permeabilization ( Figure 2E ). In contrast to this lack of staining, accumulations of Collagen IV inshiiadipocytes were still labeled ( Figure 2E ), indicating that they were indeed extracellular. Altogether, these data show that Collagen IV accumulations in shiiadipocytes are pericellular accumulations located outside of the PM (see also electron micrographs in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ). In light of the accumulation of Collagen IV, we first hypothesized that Collagen was internalized from the hemolymph (blood) by wild type adipocytes, which could explain pericellular accumulationwhen endocytosis was prevented. Contradicting this hypothesis, however, we found in mosaic experiments that accumulation of Vkg-GFP was suppressed when Vkg-GFP expression was knocked- down in the same cell ( Figure 2F ). This result demonstrates that Collagen IV accumulated in a Dynamin-deficient adipocyte originates autonomously in that same cell. Supporting the autonomous origin of accumulated Collagen IV, mosaic expression of Cg25C-RFP (see Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 )i nshi iadipocytes caused autonomous Collagen IV accumulation as well ( Figure 2G ). These experiments indicate that Collagen IV pericellularly accumulating in a shiiadipocyte is not Collagen that failed to be endocytosed. Contrary to that, our data show that pericellularly accumulated Collagen IV, instead of ingressing into the cell, is outgoing Collagen secreted by thatsame cell and becoming extracellularly trapped in the cell cortex. Pericellular Collagen trapping in endocytosis-defective cells is due to PM overgrowth In order to ascertain how endocytic defects cause pericellular trapping of outgoing Collagen, we proceeded to characterize the locus of its accumulation. The endocytic marker TfR (Transferrin Receptor, hTfR-GFP [ Henthorn et al., 2011 ]) localized uniformly in the adipocyte PM and some intracellular vesicles ( Figure 2H ). Confirming that TfR is internalized and recycled back to the PM, knock-down of Rab11 , required for recycling endosome and 2004 ), caused TfR vesicles to fill the cytoplasm while no TfR was detected at the PM ( Figure 2J ). In Dynamin- deficient cells, in contrast, TfR concentrated heavily in deep PM pockets containing Collagen IV attheir center ( Figure 2I ), suggesting that Collagen is pericellularly accumulated in PM pockets formed as a consequence of failed endocytosis. To characterize in further detail the topology of the PM at the site of Collagen accumulation, we analyzed confocal and electron micrographs. Wild t ype adipocyte PM, which is flat during the first and second larval instars, becomes somew h a tc o n v o l u t e di nt h et h i r di n s t a r( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ), displaying multiple invaginations which often encircle surface lipid droplets ( Diaconeasa et al., 2013 ). Compared to this, examination of endocytosis-deficient adipocytes revealed a striking increase in PM amount with respect to the wild type ( Figure 3A,B ).

( B) Electron micrographs of adipocyte Figure 3. eLife amount and cortical morphology, suggesting that Collagen IV is trapped in an abnormally expanded cell cortex when endocytic removal of membrane from the PM is prevented. To confirm that an excessive amount of PM can act as a barrier to Collagen release after secretion, we aimed at artificially decreasing PM amount in adipocytes. To that end, we cultured flies in medium depleted of lipids through chloroform extraction ( Palm et al., 2012 ). In larvae thus grown, we found that the amount of adipocyte PM was greatly reduced ( Figure 3C,D ;Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ). Furthermore, lipid-depleted food suppressed both PM excess and pericellular Collagen accumulation in Dynamin-deficient adipocytes ( Figure 3C,D ), indicating that PM overgrowth was indeed responsible for pericellular Collagen trapping. These data, in all, show that PM excess resulting from lack of endocytic membrane removal leads to a hyperconvoluted PM, which in turn causes pericellular trapping of Collagen IV. Pericellular deposits in adipocytes are fibrotic We asked next whether other proteins besides Collagen IV were pericellularly trapped due to PMovergrowth. Apart from Collagen IV, the main components of basement membranes are Perlecan,Laminin and Nidogen ( Yurchenco, 2011 ). Whereas evidence exists of significant Laminin and Nidogen production outside the fat body ( Urbano et al., 2009 ;Zhu et al., 2012 ), production of Perlecan has not been studied. Through iYFPi (in vivo YFP interference, Figure 4A expression of Perlecan-YFP ( trol CPTI-002049[Rees et al., 2011 ]), a YFP-trap insertion predicted to label all Perlecan isoforms and found that Perlecan present in imaginal discs originated entirely in the fat body (Figure 4B ), same as Collagen IV. Also similar to Collagen IV, Trol-YFP was pericellularly accumulated in endocytosis-defective terribly reduced optic lobes ) depended on Collagen IV, as it was suppressed by Collagen IV knock-down ( Figure 5C ). Through antibody staining, accumulation ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and additionally observed accumulation of Nidogen, again in a Collagen-dependent manner (Figure 5D ), but not Laminin (anti-LanB1 staining, not shown). The fact that the aggregates contained basement membrane components Collagen IV, Perlecan and Nidogen suggested that they were in essence fibrotic ECM deposits. Indeed, Vkg accumulation was suppressed by knock of the Prolyl-4-hydroxylase PH4 EFB ( Figure 5E ), in the absence of which Collagen IV is still secreted to the blood as non-functional monomeric chains ( Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ). Additionally supporting the fibrotic nature of the deposits, the secretion marker secr- GFP (GFP coupled to a signal peptide [ Pfeiffer et al., 2002 ]) did not accumulate in the expanded cortex of shiiadipocytes ( Figure 5F ). We also examined two other non-ECM proteins secreted by the fat body, 26-29-protease and Ferritin 1HCH, and none of them accumulated pericellularly upon shi knock down ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ). These results demonstrate that not all proteins secreted by the fat body are pericellularly trapped as a result of PM overgrowth. On the contrary, ourdata support the notion that the aggregates consist of ECM proteins like trimeric Collagen IV, PerlecanFigure 3.

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07187.009 Figure supplement 2 . Schematic explanation of PM sinuosity and depth measurements performed Nidogen, and thus are fibrotic deposits. Furthermore, our results suggest that Collagen IV is the main protein in this deposits, asaccumulation of Perlecan and Nidogen depended on the presence of Collagen IV. Fibrotic deposits and PM overgrowth upon Toll activation Having established that extracellular deposits caused by PM overgrowth were not general protein aggregates but rather fibrotic ECMaggregates, we decided to investigate their wider biological effects. To do that, we first turned our attention to cactus , another PM accumulation hit in our screening ( Figure 6A ). cactus (cact) encodes a negative regulator of the Toll signaling pathway, a key mediator of innateimmunity ( Roth et al., 1991 ). We confirmed activation of Toll signaling in cact iadipocytes (Dorsal nuclear accumulation) and further vali-dated the observing pericellular Collagen accumulation in cact 4mutants ( Roth et al., 1991 )(Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ). Expression of the constitutively active mutant receptor Toll10Balso produced peri cellular Collagen accumulation ( Figure 6B cytes. Also similar to shiiadipocytes, PM over- growth upon Toll activation was suppressed by lipid-depleted food (graph in Figure 6E ). More- over, indicating accumulation of fibrotic material, same as in endocytosis- defective cells. Despite these similarities with endocytosis-defective cells, we could not find evidence of endocytosis/recycling defects when we examined TfR-GFP localization in cact iand Toll10Badipocytes (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ), suggesting that PM overgrowth upon Toll activation did not stem from reduced endocytosis. Toll activation, on the other hand, is known to potently induce production of secreted antimicrobial peptides like Metchnikowin ( Lemaitre et al., 1996 ), which led as to consider increased secretion of these Toll targets as an alternative explanation to PM overgrowth upon Toll activation. Consistent with this, knock-down of Dif, a transcription factor involved in expression of Toll target genes in the adult ( Rutschmann et al., 2000 ) and larval fat body (see Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ), suppressed PM overgrowth (graph in Figure 6E ) and pericellular Vkg-GFP trapping (not shown), suggesting that the transcriptional response to Toll activation contributed to Collagen IV accumulation in cactiandToll10Badipocytes. Also consistent with a burst in secretory activity causing the PM overgrowth, the cytoplasm of cacti,Toll10BandM. luteus - infected adipocytes ER-to-Golgi transport in the secretory Figure 4 .

In all, our analysis indicates that PM overgrowth and fibrotic deposits upon Toll activationresult from increased secretory activity. Immune response to fibrotic deposits Our experiments indicated that fibrotic aggregates could form downstream of Toll immune signaling. We therefore decided to characterize further the immune effects of these deposits. In our screening, 32 out of 70 hits producing pericellular Collagen IV accumulation showed clear signs of a fat body Figure 5 . Pericellular deposits in adipocytes are fibrotic.

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07187 including cact,shi,Rab5 andChc (Supplementary file 1 ). Melanization is an insect immune response characterized by blackening of the affected tissue, usually accompanied by hemocyte (blood cell) recruitment ( Minakhina and Steward, 2006 ). Because BM-40-SPARC-GAL4 andCg-GAL4 , the strong fat body drivers we had used so far, are also expressed in blood cells, we tested weaker fat body drivers ppl-GAL4 and r4-GAL4 , inactive in blood cells, and found that melanization still occurred ( Figure 7A,B ), ruling out that interfering with blood cell function caused the response. Furthermore, confirming the involvement of Collagen deposits in the response, boththe number of r4>shi ilarvae displaying melanization and the extent of it decreased when we additionally knocked down Collagen IV or PH4 EFB ( Figure 7C,D ). Reduction of reduced melanization of r4>Toll10Blarvae ( Figure 7D ) and completely rescued their pupal lethality. These results show that Collagen deposits either trigger or significantly contribute to fat body melanization in these conditions. Given that Toll activation is long known to cause melanization ( Gerttula et al., 1988 ), we examined Toll activity in shiiadipocytes, but found that shibire knock-down did not cause Toll pathway activation, as evidenced by lack of Drs-GFP induction and absence of nuclear Dorsal localization (not shown). In contrast, both shibire knockdown and Toll activation caused activation (JAK/STAT) pathways, known to act together in response to tissue damage in other fly tissues ( Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008 ;Buchon et al., 2009 7E-G ). As for JAK/STAT of the JAK/STAT reporter 10XSTAT-GFP ( Ekas et al., )(Figure of ). From these data, we conclude that fibrotic deposits caused by endocytic defects or Toll provoke tissue damage in adipocytes and stimulate an innate immune response, as evidenced by tissue melanization, blood cell recruitment, activation of JAK/STAT signalingand JNK ( Figure 8 ). Discussion Excess PM as a barrier to Collagen release after secretion In this study, we investigated the release of Collagen IV by the fat body adipocytes in Drosophila larvae. Through a genetic screening, we discovered that reducing endocytosis caused unexpectedCollagen IV accumulation in secreting cells ( Figure 1 ). In investigating the cause for such a paradoxical phenotype, our experiments revealed that Collagen IV was effectively secreted and reached the extracellular space, but it was then trapped in fibrotic deposits at the cell periphery ( Figure 2 ). Further experiments led us to conclude that endocytic membrane removal and recycling are critical to maintain normal PM amount and that excess of PM when endocytic membrane removal was prevented resulted in a hyperconvoluted cell cortex where Collagen IV became entrapped ( Figure 3 ).Figure 6.

Fibrotic deposits in the absence of negative Toll regulator Cactus were similarly caused by PM overgrowth as well ( Figure 6 ). In this instance, however, PM overgrowth resulted from increased membrane input from the secretory pathway, consistent with the ability of Toll to induce massive secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Supporting this, knock down of Rab1, required for ER-to-Golgi transport, was able to suppress Toll-induced PM overgrowth.Therefore, both recycling endosome-derived and ER-derived membrane inputs may contribute to total PM amount while constant endocytic membrane removal prevents PM overgrowth. Sudden surges or shifts in membrane traffic are well known drivers of cell shape changes during development ( Lecuit and Pilot, 2003 ). However, the extent to which maintenance of a stable cell shape is affected by the balance of membrane outputs and inputs to the PM has been less explored. Our experiments show that endocytosis is critical for preserving cortex morphology in Drosophila adipocytes and that preventing endocytosis can cause dramatic PM overgrowth. A factor that might determine high PM turnover in these cells, and thus a tendency to imbalances, is their elevated secretory activity. Apart from Collagen IV, fat body adipocytes secrete most other proteins present inthe hemolymph, including the very abundant larval serum proteins ( Guedes Sde et al., 2003 ; Vierstraete et al., 2003 ), which imposes a constant input of ER membrane to the PM. A need for control of PM amount, however, does not seem exclusive to adipocytes or highly secretory cells basedon reported effects in other cell types. For instance, in Garland cells, a filtering cell type with high endocytic activity, shibire loss causes deep PM tubulation ( Ikeda, the PM ( Satoh et al., 2005 ). In neurons, accumulation of membrane cisternae inFigure 1 >shii,>Tl10Band>cactiadipocytes. ( type, BM-40-SPARC >shiiand>Tl10Badipocytes assessed by real time RT-PCR.

Schematic representation summarizing the genesis of fibrotic deposits caused by PM excess and the ensuing reaction by the immune system. Defective endocytosis or excesssecretion induced by Toll activity cause PM overgrowth in fat body adipocytes, which leads to hyperconvoluted PMmorphology and pericellular trapping of Collagen IV and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the cell cortex. Fibrotic Collagen IV deposits trigger an immune response, as evidenced by tissue melanization and activation of the JAK/STAT and JNK pathways.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07187.017 The following figure supplement is available for figure 8: Figure supplement 1 . Knock-down of BM-40-SPARC (BM-40-SPARC >BM-40-SPARC upon Clathrin Dynamin photoinactivation ( et al., 2008 ; Kasprowicz et al., 2014 ), similar to the PM excess we found in adipocytes. Finally, Rab5 and other endocytic genes are required to maintain epithelial polarity ( Lu and Bilder, 2005 ;Zeigerer et al., 2012 ), suggesting that constant endocytosis actively keeps apical and baso-lateral PMs segregated. These examples, together with our findings, point to a requirement for endocytosis and recycling in maintaining stable cell shape wider than currently appreciated. In addition to the finding that membrane traffic controls adipocyte PM amount, our results have implications for the understanding of fibrotic deposits. We arrived at the study of membrane traffic in adipocytes through a Collagen IV accumulation phenotype. Collagen IV, however is not the onlyprotein in these deposits ( Figure 5 ). Also Perlecan, which we show originates in adipocytes as well (Figure 4 ), accumulates pericellularly. Except for Nidogen, a third basement membrane component, no other protein we tested accumulated, including Ferritin and Catalase, two of the most abundantproteins in the blood ( Handke et al., 2013 ). Even though a more complete view of the aggregates must await a proteomic analysis, our data suggest that Collagen IV, while not the only protein present in these deposits, it is the most important one, as knock down of Collagen IV suppressedaccumulation of Perlecan and Nidogen in shi icells. Because of its abundance and ability to self- interact, Collagen IV seems particularly prone in principle to nucleate aggregates in the conditions of limited diffusion provided by a hyperconvoluted PM. That Collagen IV self-interaction is critical intriggering pericellular aggregation is indeed supported by the fact that knock-down of PH4-EFB , required for trimer formation, suppresses aggregate formation. In contrast, our data showing that PM surrounding aggregates can be stained equally well with both low (3000) and high (70,000) molecularweight fixable dextrans ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) suggests that the size of the accumulated protein does not play a major role in the formation of the deposits. This is also supported by the finding that Perlecan, a large 400 kDa protein, does not accumulate by itself, but as a result ofCollagen IV accumulation ( Figure 5 ). Besides endocytic genes and cactus , our screening has found additional hits causing Collagen IV accumulation at the PM ( Supplementary file 1 ). Loss of BM-40-SPARC , one of these hits, was previously known to cause Collagen IV deposits on adipocytes ( Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ). Furthermore, similar to the fibrotic deposits in our study, other basement membrane components accumulate upon loss of BM-40-SPARC (Shahab et al., 2015 ). However, the PM is not overgrown in BM-40-SPARC iadipocytes ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ), suggesting that the way in which aggregates form in BM-40-SPARCiadipocytes is different from the way they arise in endocytosis- defective and Toll-activated adipocytes. We have also tested Toll pathway activation by examiningexpression of Toll target Drosomycin (Drs-GFP) in BM-40-SPARC iand all other PM accumulation hits, but found no Drosomycin-GFP induction in any of them. This suggests that, cactus aside, none of the hits causes Collagen IV deposits through ectopic Toll activation. Further characterization work,therefore, is needed to ascertain the particular mechanisms by which PM accumulation of Collagen IV occurs upon loss of these genes. Such work might offer additional insights for a better understanding of fibrosis. Adipocyte fibrosis Pericellular trapping of Collagen IV, apart from preventing its incorporation to destination tissues,induces a potent response in adipocytes. Aspects of this response include melanization and activationof the JAK/STAT and JNK pathways ). Concomitant activation of JNK and JAK/STAT signaling makes this response reminiscent of tissue damage responses in imaginal discs and gut tissues ( Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008 ;Buchon et al., 2009 ). In particular, predominance of upd3 among induced JAK/STAT cytokines is shared with the intestinal response to tissue damage ( Buchon et al., 2009 ). It has been suggested that basement membrane disruption could be a signal that intestinal cells sense when flies are fed tissue damage-inducing Dextran Sulfate Sodium ( Amcheslavsky et al., 2009 ). Absence of basement membrane, although unable by itself to elicit a response ( Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008 ), has been recently linked to melanization as a permissive factor ( Hauling et al., 2014 ; Kim and Choe, 2014 ). In the case of adipocyte fibrosis, however, our data indicate that it is the fibrotic deposits that cause the response rather than absence of a basement membrane, since Collagen IV knock down in shi icells suppressed the response instead of enhancing it. Also in Toll10B adipocytes, Collagen IV reduction partially suppressed melanization, showing that, even though Toll Zang et al . eLife 2015;4:e07187. DOI: melanization enzymes ( De Gregorio et al., 2002 ), Collagen deposits contribute to Toll-induced melanization. An interesting question deserving of further investigation is how the fly immune system can react to these fibrotic deposits. One possibility is that fibrotic deposits are directlydetected as altered self by the immune system, for instance through recognition of some specific molecular trait in them. A second possibility is that deposits somehow cause damage in adipocytes and this damage activates the response. In this latter case, the nature of the fibrosis-induced celldamage and the way that damage might be sensed are also worth deeper investigation. Adipocyte fibrosis in humans and mouse models is correlated with obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction ( Sun et al., 2013 ). Same as human adipocytes, Drosophila larval adipocytes are surrounded by a basement membrane containing Collagen IV ( Chun, 2012 ); also similar, human adipocytes display complex PM topology, with abundant caveolae forming higher-level rosettes (Fan et al., 1983 ). Our study, importantly, provides a model to study fibrosis in this tissue. Fibrosis, affecting adipocytes or otherwise, is thought to result in all cases from inflammatory stimulation of excess ECM deposition. Our results show that accumulation of trimeric Collagen IV can be triggered by Toll immune activation and that deposits in turn further stimulate other arms of the fly immunesystem different from the Toll-mediated immune response. This raises the possibility that fibrotic accumulations, once initiated, could be self-sustained, with inflammation and fibrosis feeding each other. Interestingly, the response to fibrosis includes induction of Collagen-degrading enzyme Matrixmetalloprotease 1, suggesting that the response is aimed in part at clearing the aggregates. Further research into how innate immunity is activated by these deposits may uncover therapeutically relevant mechanisms by which adipocytes and other tissues react to, and deal with, excessive matrixdeposition. Materials and methods Drosophila strains and culture Standard fly husbandry techniques and genetic methodologies, including balancers and dominant genetic markers, were used to assess segregation of mutations and transgenes in the progeny of crosses, construct intermediate fly lines and obtain flies of the required genotypes for each experiment ( Roote and Prokop, 2013 ). Flies were maintained at 25C unless otherwise stated. In the initial screening and most experiments afterwards, the GAL4-UAS binary expression system ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993 ) was used to drive expression of UAS transgenes in fat body adipocytes under temporal and spatial control of transgenic GAL4 drivers BM-40-SPARC-GAL4 (Venken et al., 2011 ) (a gift from Hugo Bellen), Cg-GAL4 (Asha et al., 2003 ) (BL7011), r4-GAL4 (Lee and Park, 2004 ) (a gift from Pierre Leopold) and ppl-GAL4 (Colombani et al., 2003 ) (a gift from Herve Agaisse). In flies bearing both types of transgenes (a GAL4 driver and a UAS responder), expression of theUAS-transgene is induced by the yeast transcription factor GAL4 according to the pattern of expression of GAL4 specific to the driver transgene. The strength of these >ppl-GAL4 cells, r4-GAL4 and ppl-GAL4 are not. UAS-Dcr2 was included in the screening strain for the purpose of enhancing RNAi-mediated knock-down by long dsRNA hairpins ). Dcr2 expression in adipocytes showed no visible effect by itself on Collagen IV localization(Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ). For generation of flip-out clones ( Ito et al., )(Figure containing L2 larvae were heat-shocked at 37C for 7 min. For lipid depletion experiments, lipids were extracted from medium by mixing ingredients with chloroform for 2 days, allowing chloroform toevaporate for at least two more days before food preparation ( Palm et al., 2012 ). Genotypes of animals in all experiments are detailed in Supplementary file 2 . Origin of mutants and transgenes used can be found in Supplementary file 3 . The following strains were GFP and YFP efficiently same as three above constructs; unlike those, it causes unspecific cell article and UAS-Cg25C-RFP transgenic lines To obtain UAS-Cg25C-GFP and UAS-Cg25C-RFP lines, the open reading frame (ORF) of Cg25C was cloned into vectors pTWG and pTWR (Drosophila Carnegie Vector collection) using Gateway recombination (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). To do this, att sites at the 5 and 3 termini of the ORF for subsequent Gateway cloning. The product of this reaction was purified by gel extraction with AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen, Union City, California) and recombined into vector pDONR221 (Life Technologies) withGateway BP Clonase Enzyme Mix (Life Technologies). The resulting plasmid (Entry clone), was transformed into Escherichia coli Trans5 competent miniprepped using Gateway LR ClonaseEnzyme Mix (Life Technologies). lines were obtained through standard P-element transgenesis ( Spradling and Rubin, 1982 ). Immunohistochemistry antibody, rabbits were immunized with epitope SVKHYNRNEPKFPIDDSY by AbMax Biotechnology (Beijing, China). The antibodies and dyes were used: rabbit al., 2009 ) et al., 2003 )( 1 : 200, DSHB, University of Iowa), mouse anti-Dorsal 503 (1:500, Life Technologies). Antibody stainings of whole fat body were performed following standard procedures used for imaginal discs. Briefly, larvae were pre-dissected in PBS by turning inside out withfine tip forceps after removing their posterior end. Carcasses with fat body still attached were fixed in PBS containing 4% PFA, washed in PBS (3 \u00d710 min), blocked in PBT-BSA (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X- 100 detergent, 1% BSA and 250 mM NaCl), incubated overnight with primary antibody in PBT-BSA,washed in PBT-BSA (3 \u00d720 min), incubated for 2 hr with secondary antibody in PBT-BSA and washed in PBT-BSA (3 \u00d720 min) and PBS (3 \u00d710 min). Fat body tissues were finally dissected on a slide with a drop of DAPI-Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Ca lifornia) and mounted in this same medium. FM4-64 staining of PM was performed by incubating fat body i n ice-cold PBS containing 5 mg/ml fixable FM4-64 (Life Technologies) for 1 min before fixing for 20 mi n in ice-cold PBS containing 4% PFA. Labeling with fixable 3,000 and MW Texas-Red-coupled dextran (0.1 mg/ml, Life Technologies) was performedby fixing fat body in 4% PFA for 5 min followed by thr ee quick washes, incubation with dextran in PBS, three quick washes and fixation again for 20 min. Resul t sw e r et h es a m ew h e nt h ef i r s tf i x a t i o nw a so m i t t e d . Imaging The screening was conducted in a were mounted DAPI- Vectashield (Vector Labs). Vkg-GFP intensity in basement membranes was quantified with ImageJsoftware as previously described ( Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011 ). PM depth and sinuosity measure- ments were performed in electron micrographs as indicated in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 . For measurements of both PM depth and sinuosity, images were analyzed with ImageJ using thesegmented line tool to calculate distances. Graphs were drawn and statistical analysis performed with GraphPad Prism. For sinuosity measurements, the distance separating the points where the PM intersects the edges of the micrograph was calculated, as well as the length of the PM joining thosetwo points. Islands of cytoplasm with no connection to the cell body were excluded from sinuosity analysis, but not for PM depth measurement. All fat body images in the manuscript correspond to mid-to-late third larval instar fat body dissected prior to the wandering larva stage, except for the firstand second larval Fibrotic aggregates can be observed at all times during the third larval instar, including the extremes of early third instar Zang |ImmunologyTransmission electron microscopy Ultrathin sections were obtained following standard procedures and imaged in a Hitachi H-7650B microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, larvae were turned inside-out and fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde, leaving fat body attached to carcasses to facilitate handling. Once fixed, fat body was postfixed in 1%osmium tetroxide before embedding. Sections were stained in 2% uranyl acetate/lead citrate. Fat body from at least three different specimens per genotype was imaged. Bacterial infection Gram +bacterium M. luteus was cultured in LB medium at 30C. Larvae were soaked in concentrated culture and pricked with a tungsten needle to allow infection. Real time RT-PCR RNA was isolated using TransZol Up (Transgen, Beijing, China). cDNA was synthesized from 1 go f RNA with the PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Analysis was performed in a CFX96 Touch system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) using SYBR Green Fast kit (Applied Biosystems,Waltham, Massachusetts). rp49 expression was used for normalization. Three experiments per genotype were averaged. A biological replicate was performed with same results.
