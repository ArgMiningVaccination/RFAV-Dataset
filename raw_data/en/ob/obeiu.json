Redesignating applicants: Provide a description, with supporting evidence, of the ongoing evaluation of the nursing professional practice model and how clinical nurses are involved. Ongoing Evaluation of the Nursing Professional Practice Model and How Clinical Nurses are Involved There is ongoing evaluation of Vanderbilt Nursing's Professional Practice Model (PPM) of patient/family centered care both at the organizational level and at all entity levels. The current schematic of the PPM and its description are included in Organizational Overview 8. One of the more formal approaches to the evaluation of the PPM is the annual review of the model along with the Nursing Strategic Plan (in Organizational Overview 3) across the organization. The Nursing Strategic Plan and the PPM are reviewed annually by several committees and groups throughout the organization. These reviews occur prior to the beginning of budget preparation to support changes in the budget related to staffing models, etc. Included in this November 2015 review were the four entity specific nursing staff councils (NSC), which are chaired by clinical nurses; Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) , Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV) , Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital (VPH) and The Clinics. In addition, Marilyn Dubree, MSN, RN, NE-BC, Executive Chief Nursing Officer, hosts a monthly \"Coffee with Marilyn\" group. The most recent group (November 2015) was comprised of clinical staff and the topic was the evaluation of the PPM. In each of these evaluations and discussions we used the same format for clinical staff involvement and feedback. As the clinical staff discussed the PPM based on their current practice in their respective areas, they expressed confidence that the model continues to depict and support their clinical practice. The VPH nursing staff council did however make suggestions for changes to the \"wording\" that accompanies the PPM, meant as a concise explanation. Below is the identified information that will be evaluated and potentially re-worded. The Nursing Professional Practice Model has 4 Primary Components 1. Our interdisciplinary team surrounds the patient/family to provide evidence based care. Our commitment extends to those in the community through support and outreach programs. 2. Our focus is to provide safe, quality care based on evidence from all disciplines and the measure of outcomes. 13. We bring professionalism to our work through VPNPP and certification and continuing education. Our shared governance structure gives nurses a voice at the local and organizational level through our committees/councils. 4. Integrated technology helps us provide coordinated care and communicate with each other as well as our patients. Our PPM is congruent with and supported by the 5 Pillars of Vanderbilt as an organization. These pillars serve as the foundation for our nursing strategic goals. The VPH NSC believes that the information is not comprehensive and does not express the full measure of our PPM. EP1-1 VPH NSC November 2015 Minutes & Attendance Agreement with the VPH NSC for next steps on this concern included: continue gathering feedback from the designated groups and after completed, VPH staff council clinical staff will take a lead with organization wide representation in updating the PPM explanation based on all the feedback. This will also coincide with the review and subsequent updating of the Nursing Strategic Plan. EP1-2 VUH NSC November 2015 Minutes & Attendance; EP1- 3 VMG NSC November 2015 Minutes & Attendance; EP1- 4 Copy of MCJCHV NSC November 2015 Minutes/attendance Shared Governance and Nursing Bylaws Convention Our nursing bylaws are an important part of the professional practice of nursing at Vanderbilt and the heart of our Shared Governance structure. Our biannual Nursing Bylaws conventions have representation from across the Medical Center with all levels of nursing staff serving as delegates. The largest contingency is comprised of our clinical staff. At the last Bylaws Convention in November of 2014, we had approximately 100 clinical nurses present. In addition, several clinical staff nurses serve on the Bylaws committee. The committee works throughout the year in careful review of the bylaws and take suggestions and motions for changes to the Nursing Bylaws. Examples of the changes the nurses voted on at the Nursing Bylaws convention are listed below. These changes serve to strengthen our Shared Governance structure which serves as a foundation for nursing practice at VUMC. EP1-5 November 2014 Nursing Bylaws Convention PowerPoint The role of the administrative directors for participation in individual unit/clinic boards was clarified. The administrative directors support and participate in the process and may attend meetings. Due to the number of meetings, the administrative directors cannot attend every meeting, however, do attend key meetings for key topics. The composition of the various boards and councils were reviewed and changes made to reflect current practices and title changes. The new role of Clinical Staff Leader was added to several boards and councils to reflect a new level of representation. Updated processes for appointments, re-appointments and credentialing of our growing number of advanced practice nurses were adopted. Patient Family as the Center of PPM Throughout the year, various committees and councils address issues related to patient/family centered care. For example, VUH, MCJCHV and The Clinics each had 1Patient/Family Advisory Councils. In response to strengthening the provision of patient/family centered care in the Psychiatric Hospital, a Patient/Family Advisory Council was established in the Psychiatric Hospital; the first of its kind in a psychiatric environment. Utilizing feedback from the VUH Patient/Family Council, we initiated quiet times in the adult hospital to better support sleep patterns. These are just a couple of exa mples. 1EP2EO Professional Practice Model EP2EO: Clinical nurses are involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the professi onal practice model. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of an improvement resulting from a change in clinical practice that occurred because of clinical nurses' involvement in the implementation or ev aluation of the professional practice model. Supporting evidence must be submit ted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Background Clinical nurses have ongoing opportunities to evaluate our Professional Practice Model (PPM) including unit board meetings, nursing st aff council meetings, and several others. Another important time they look at t he PPM is when they evaluate quality data and redesign care delivery. The following is an example by which Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) unit staff were able to focus on evidence to redesign care and keep the patient/family central to their work. By July 2014, VUH falls with harm had been incr easing for several mont hs. A three-unit fall prevention improvement pilo t project kicked off that sa me month with the top three units that had opportuni ty for improvement. After excellent results from the pilot project, staff and manager s from other hospital units began asking to be part of this improvement work and the fall prevention improvement project became a house-wide in itiative in May 2015. Goal Statement Decrease the rate of falls with harm per 1, 000 patient days in the adult hospital (VUH). Description of the Intervention July 2014: In response to the evidence of hav ing some form of leadership \"close\" to the clinical staff, the Clinical Staff Leader (CSL) model wa s added to the care delivery system and was initiated in several units in VUH. In addition to the evidence domain part of our PPM, the CSL model wa s also based on the Professional Development/Leader Domain to help develop clin ical staff into future leaders and again providing role models for the clinical sta ff on leadership at the bedside. As these new CSLs began their roles on the units they were also overseeing many of the unit based quality initiatives. In addition to becoming the unit experts on fall prevention, pressure ulcer prevention, etc., they also became one of the unit resources for reinforcing and supporting safe, evidence based prevention practi ces at the bedside. In conjunction with clinical nurse input, the CSL revised unit prac tice patterns to create a safer delivery of care for their patients. 1July - December 2014: Three unit fall prev ention improvement p ilot projects, that included the following interventions, resear ched and developed by clinical nurses and shift leaders, were implemented: o Purposeful rounding/targeted toile ting on all patients as appropriate o Environmental safety/use of bed/chair alarms o Initiating shift safety huddles o Keeping doors open o Moving patients closer to nursi ng station with more regularity o Revising patient/family education and engagement o Visual cues of high fall risk pati ents with yellow socks, yellow armband, and door sign o Shift leader rounding o Weekly fall prevention audit rounds wit h real-time coaching, mentoring, and recognition o Celebrating success as a team and with individual recognition With the pilots completed, the PPM shar ed governance structure approved the policy and plans for house wide implementation. House-wide implementation included each unit following the same pattern as the first three units. They conducted a review of their data, performed gap analysis between policy and practice, and took these results to their unit board meeti ngs, staff meetings, and quality committees to develop plans for improvement in their practice model with their bedside staff. February 2015: Units insta lled performance boards in public areas for quality data tracking. March 2015: Staff nurse fall preventi on leaders requested to increase the availability and usage of bed alarms for patients at highest risk of falling. May 2015: House-wide rollout of updat ed fall prevention practices with 100% of unit leadership teams attending a day long Quality, Safety, and Fall Prevention workshop with t he entire day focused on principles of quality improvement and fall prevention, specifically. Stemming from this kick-off, unit staff began: o Implementing the evidence based pr actices from the pilot project. o Participating in presenting fall event case reviews to peers. o Re-education on the us e of the Morse scale for fall risk assessment and planning patient specific interventions. o Education for multidiscipline partner s in care on how to scan a patient's room before exiting to leave them with a safe environment. Staff developed a 'Take 2 to Leave\" campaign that was presented to more than twenty groups that included more than 250 multidiscipline team mem bers. The VUH Fall Prevention Policy was updated to include these evidence based practices, and top performers are acting as peer experts to help continue improvement throughout VUH. All VUH inpatient units created a fall prevention action plan and provide updates on progress 1regularly to their peers and leaders in the monthly nursing leadership board meetings.

Note The activities preceding May 2015 were in pr eparation for the roll-out of the house-wide changes based on evidence that would lead to the decrease of the house wide pressure ulcer rate. May 2015 was the 100% house-wide roll out of the new fall prevention practices (a fall prevention bundle based on evidence). No house-wide activities occurred before May 2015. The following interventions were implemented house wide: Installment of performance boards in public areas for quality data tracking on each unit. Increased availability of bed alarms fo r patients at highest risk of falling, as requested by staff nurse fall prevention leaders. 1 House-wide rollout of updated fall pr evention practices with 100% of unit leadership teams attending a day long Quality, Safety, and Fall Prevention workshop with the entire day focused on principles of quality improvement and fall prevention, specifically. Stemmi ng from this kick-off, unit staff began: o Implementing the evidence based pr actices from the pilot project. o Participating in presenting fall event case reviews to peers. o Re-education on the us e of the Morse scale for fall risk assessment and planning patient specific interventions. o Education for multidiscipline partner s in care on how to scan a patient's room before exiting to leave them with a safe environment.

A ll VUH inpatient units created a fall prevention action plan and provide updates on progress regularly to their peers and leaders in the monthly nursing leadership board meetings. 1EP4 Care Delivery System(s) EP4: Nurses create partnerships with pati ents and families to establish goals and plans for delivery of patient-centered care. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of nurses partnering with patients and families to develop and individ ualized plan of care based on the unique needs of the patient. AND Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of nurses partnering with patients and families to improve systems of care at the unit, service line, or organizational level. Example a Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV) developed an individualized plan of care based on a family's cultural/r eligious beliefs In the spring of 2014, the health care team faced a challenging situation in regards to the provision of care to \"Miss L.\" and her mo ther. In addition to a clinical picture that perplexed an impressive group of physicians and nurses, Miss L. also had a complex social situation involving her mot her, who was non-English speaking and her cultural/religious extremism. For quite a few weeks, it was unknown what the eventual outcome would be for this young lady. In t he meantime, the entire team needed to pull together in order to meet bot h the patient's physical needs and the mother's spiritual needs. At Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, our culture is defined by our FOCUS values - Family centered care, One team, Continuous improvement, Unique environment and Service excellence. During the months of Miss L.'s hospitalization, and thanks to the organization's commitment to shared decision-making, her health care team was both inspired and empowered to cr eate the environment which allowed this patient and her mother to receive the care and support exactly as stated in our FOCUS values. Relatively early in Miss L.'s hospitalizat ion her mother independently, and unbeknownst to unit staff, planned a spiritual event in whic h family and friends came to the patient's room and engaged in a prayer service for her. The prayer service was like nothing the staff had ever witnessed before, including loud chanting, crie s for healing, anointing the patient with unknown substance(s) and the prev ention of staff enterin g the patient room. It was disruptive to other patients/families on the unit and extremely concerning to members of the health care team. Healthcare Team When reports of the event reached the nursi ng unit's leadership team and other health care team members, it became clearly evident that we had an unusual situation 1developing and it would be important to come together to share information and combine strategies for care. We initiated weekly care team meetings and invited all disciplines involved in Miss L.'s care, in cluding physicians from multiple specialty services, nursing staff, chaplain, child life , legal counsel, ethics committee, care team and interpretive services. At these meetings, the complexities of Miss L.'s physical care as well as the psychosocial needs of pat ient and mother were discussed. Coming together allowed each disciplin e to share their observations, conversations with the patient's mother and research of the family's spiritual beliefs and practices. The Plan One specific request, stated by the patient's mother to a c haplain intern, was that she would like to be able to \"pray with authority\" for her child - to pray in a manner that is consistent with her faith and bel iefs. When relayed to the hea lth care team, the initial reaction was one of doubt that this could occur. Knowing the circumstances of the mother's first attempt of \"prayer with authorit y,\" the group wasn't su re that this was a request we could approve. Still, it was agr eed that the chaplain and nursing manager would utilize interpretive services and hav e a detailed discussion with the patient's mother to see what \"praying with authority\" would require. The discussion took place on the same day and the mother's wishes were made known to the health care team - a place where 5-8 friends could gather around the patient for 3-4 hours and pray in loud voices. Ideally, the mother would like for this to happen every 1-2 days. The nurse manager shared this information wit h the hospital's Chief Nursing Officer, Chief of Staff and attending physician. Pe rmission was granted for the \"prayer with authority\" service, with some modifications to the mother's request. During a second meeting with the patient's mo ther, the guidelines for the prayer service were agreed upon: one service per week (1\u00bd - 2 hours dura tion) including up to five participants and the patient could be moved from her room to a location t hat was separate from other inpatient rooms as long as there was a nurse present to monitor the patient and intervene if the patient's physical status c hanged. All members of the health care team were informed that we would proceed with pl anning a prayer service for the family. Preparation for the service in cluded consulting with a scheduler for a day and time in which space was available for the service, notification of the em ergency department in the event the patient's condition deteriorated during the service and assistance was needed, notification of the police department and request for assistance to keep the space clear of visitors, gathering of supp lies/equipment that may be needed for the patient during time spent out of her room, identification of nursing staff who would be in the room to quietly and unobtrusi vely monitor the patient, identification of physician staff who would be in house and readily available if needed for change in physical status, and the development of distribution/call list to keep all stakeholders informed before, during and after the prayer service. The day arrived. The patient's mother had her friends arrive at the designated time, the nursing staff bathed the patient and washed and styled her hair, and the nurse manager gathered the supplies and coordi nated movement of friends to the designated location 1and movement of the patient to location. T he nurse manager also confirmation the plan for the prayer service (i.e. duration, # of participants, nurse's ro le) with the patient's mother. The nurse manager and the monito ring nurse stepped aside and the prayer service commenced. The patient tolerated the service without a change in status. The patient's mother and friends were able to pray in the manner in which they believed and no other patients or visi tors were disturbed. A service was conducted the following week, in the same location but for a bit longer than the original service. Additional s upplies were added based on needs identified during the previous service. Again, t he service was completed without changes in patient condition or disruption of services to others. A third service was scheduled the following week and was then cancelled per the mother's request. Her daughter had begun to show signs of improvement and the health care team had made arrangements for someone to sit with the patient while her mother returned to her home church for prayer. Though this part of Miss L.'s story is told within only two pages, the entire story evolved over many weeks on an acute care pod at MCJCHV, with many, many members of the health care team engaged in this young lady 's care and recovery. It was a fabulous demonstration of multiple disciplines putting t he pieces of a puzzle together and making the plan come together. Happily, Miss L.'s story has a very happy ending.

This wa s showing up on their patient satisfaction information and in conversation with the clin ical staff and nursing leadership on the units. In addition, this feedback was also co ming from the Vanderbilt Behavioral Health Patient and Family Advisor Board (VBH-PFA B). VPH determined to partner with them in the development of an informa tion and communication tool in the form of a notebook. The Vanderbilt Behavioral Health Patient and Family Advisory Board developed as one of its priority goals in August 2013 to work on a family handbook. The VBH-PFAB 1communicated that one of the concerns was the communication that families received in regards to the care of their loved ones. They felt that they did not understand the process of hospitalization and thus were not prepared to work with the treatment team during the patients' hospital st ay. There was also concern that they felt ill prepared at times after the patient was discharged to ensure that they could support their loved one after they left the hospital. They set a goal for the creation of a handbook that would provide families with information about the hos pitalization process, contact information on how to get in touch with t he treatment team, a list of questions that they could ask the providers taking care of their lov ed one, and note pages were they can document critical information so it would not get lost. The Vanderbilt Behavioral Health Patient and Family Advisory Board actively partnered with the nursing staff in the development of the handbook. The Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) is an active member on the VBH-PFAB. The CNO served as the liaison between the VBH-PFAB and the clinical nursing staf f in the development of the handbook. The CNO facilitated nursing staff and other discip lines attending the VBH-PFAB meetings to hear family members' concerns and assist in providing feedback about the handbook. The CNO also gave the Nursing Professional Practice Board at Vanderbilt Behavioral Health (VBH) a copy of the handbook for review and to allow feedback on recommendations for change. These recomm endations were brought back to the VBH- PFAB and discussed and incorporated into the final edit. The VBH-PFAB family handbook was finalized in August 2015 and copies are distributed to every family on all inpatient units. EP4b-1 Copy of the 1.27.15; EP4b-5 Meet ing Minutes VBH-PFAB 4.28.15 The Chief Nursing Officer for Vanderbilt Behavioral Health (VBH) during the development of the Patient/Family Handbook was Avni Cirpili, DNS, RN, NEA-BC. Avni left Vanderbilt in January 2016 and during a short overlap, beginning December 7, 2015, Jennifer Barut, PhD(c), RN-BC assumed the interim CNO role and remains in that role to date. In the original submission of the minutes fo r the Patient Family Advisory Board (VBH- PFAB), Avni is in attendance as shown on supporting documents: (Refer to Original Evidence EP4b-2 Meeting Minutes VBH-PFAB 8.22.2013; Refer to Original Evidence EP4b-3 Meeting Minutes VBH-P FAB 9.18.2014; Refer to Original Evidence EP4b-4 Meeting Minutes VBH-PFAB 1.27.2015 [attending this meeting is also Renee Boggs MSN, RN Quality Consultant for VBH]; Refe r to Evidence EPb-5 Meeting Minutes VBH-PFAB 4.28.2015) .

(New Evidence EP4b-2 VPH NSC Meeting Minutes January 2014) See request from September 19, 2014 for clin ical nurse volunteers to work on this project. (New Evidence EP4b-3 Email Request to Clinical Nurses) Improvement in System of Care at the Se rvice Line Level (Vanderbilt Behavioral Health) The improvement in the entirety of the Psychiatr ic Hospital is the actual use of the newly developed comprehensive patient/family handbook for admission, hospitalization and discharge. (Refer to Original Evidence EP4b- 1 Copy of the Family Handbook) As stated before, patients/families expressed their frustration at the gap in information provided to them about the hospital experienc e. Having this new booklet prepared the patients/families in a different way and set t hem up to have a positive experience which promotes wellness. Prior to this new booklet, the units used a two-page copied sheet that was hard to read and prov ided limited information. (New Evidence EP4b-4 Former VPH Orientation Sheets) The CNO (Avni) served as the conduit for the work on the revision of the Patient/Family Handbook with the patients/famili es and the clinical staff. This idea was driven by the patients/families due to their reported lack of comfort in the info rmation they received about the hospitalization process. This lack of comfort created anxiety. This partnership gave both groups the opportunity to address any concerns and clarify the admission, treatment and discharge processes, which would decrease anxiety and lead to a better hospitalization and treatment process. 1EP5 Care Delivery System(s) EP5: Nurses are involved in interprof essional collaborative practice within the care delivery system to ensure care coordination and continuity of care Provide two examples, with supporting ev idence, of nurses' involvement in interprofessional collaborative practice that ensures care coordination and continuity of care. Example a Homeward Bound Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Va nderbilt's (MCJCHV) Homeward Bound is a program that provides discharge teaching to parents of children who have complicated medical issues or will be discharged with m edical devices. The classes currently offered are the American Heart Association's Family and Friends CPR , Care After Heart Surgery , Tracheostomy Care, G-tube Care and Central Line Care. The classes are scheduled regularly during the week and are held in the MCJCHV's Junior League Family Resource Center classroom. The model for the Homeward Bound classes was originally developed on the pediatric cardiology unit. The clinical nurses identified challenges in providing discharge information to families in an effective, cons istent manner. Obstacles such as patient acuity, caregiver availability, environmental distractions, and a lack of content experts would cause delays or inconsistent education being provided. On the day of discharge families may even receive a majority of thei r education in a hurried fashion to meet the compliance standards. Working with the bedsi de staff members to outline material, the nurse educator began a weekly class on the unit to cover information such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), congesti ve heart failure, wou nd care, activity restrictions, pain management, and medication safety. In September 2013, MCJCHV determined a need for a more comprehensive hospital- wide program and developed a plan for high risk patients who required significant education before being dischar ged. One specific patient population identified was patients with tracheostomies. Initially, nurse s were going to educate families at the bedside. Notebooks and protocols were developed, and videos were made available to staff. However with an average of fifty ne wly placed tracheostomies each year, it was apparent that consistent education was going to be hard to achieve and this approach might not be in the best in terest of the patient. In October 2013, an interdisciplinary team comprised of nurses, educat ors, managers, respiratory therapists, and r epresentatives from the Fam ily Resource Center met. During that meeting the idea of developing a class for the tracheostomy population, modeled after the current cardiology classes, was discussed. 1Nursing education took the lead and met with key stakeholders, such as physicians, to create standard guidelines for home care. Nurs ing leaders were then asked to support the program by taking on the cost of printing materials and providing educational supplies. Respiratory therapists were able to partner with the program to reinforce teaching at the bedside. In addition, home health nurses were surveyed to determine what knowledge gap was most consistently addressed after hospital discharge. The supply companies were contacted to ensure ma terials given to the families were similar to those used to teach skills in class. Finally, the Family Resource Center was able to determine ways to provide a protected educational environment and support the siblings while caregivers were in class. Nursing education collected the resources being used to teach families about tracheostomy care and worked with the Patient Education Committee to incorporate the information gleaned from interdisciplinary meeti ngs to create materials for the class. A booklet was developed to standardize the information given to all families of children with tracheostomies and to provide a methodi cal approach to learning. A \"Journey Board\" was also developed to help families track their progress in practicing skills and anticipating discharge. The materials we re reviewed by the Patient Education Committee and the Family Advisory Committ ee to verify appropriate reading levels, content, and language translations. EP 5a-1 Example of Journey Board After the materials were developed, nursing education went on a \"road show\" to introduce this program to the hospital staff. Over several weeks, we met with eleven interprofessional teams to explain the pur pose of Homeward Bound and familiarize them with the content and registration process for classes. EP5a-2 Roadshow Information Working with the Family Resource Center, we were able to schedule a weekly tracheostomy class. Offering cl asses to families in this location on a regular basis would address several needs: 1. Families would be taught the concepts for each class in a consistent manner. 2. Families would be able to learn and pr actice skills on manikins before having to perform the skill on their child. 3. Classes could be offered at a consistent time and space away from patient room distractions. 4. Nurses would be able to plan ahead with the family to attend classes. 5. Nurses would be able to reinforce c oncepts at the bedside during the regular care of the patient. In addition to the family benefits, the benefit for the nursing staff was significant as well. Instead of having to piece together which concepts families had already been taught to ensure information was covered, they now knew that all of the concepts had been introduced to the family. Nurses also knew families had some hands on experience by first practicing with a manikin and now could reinforce concepts at the bedside. Once a patient was discharged, the Vanderbilt Home Health team could then continue to 1reinforce the concepts introduced to the fam ilies and use the same patient education resources for additional questions. Additional benefits have includ ed a reduction in manpower to provide high quality educational experiences. Multiple families can now attend the class offered weekly. We have also been able to coordinate with interpre ter services to prov ide an interpreter for each class if necessary or host an additional class with several families who speak a common language. This opportunity has also provided families with a peer support component, which allowed families to share common stories, questions, and concerns during the class. EP5 a-3 Meeting Minutes Since Tracheostomy Care class began in June 2014, forty families have attended the class. Having a successful model, a similar process was used to develop materials for the cardiac discharge class, g-tube care cla ss, and central line class. All of these classes are held in the Family Resource Center and provide a comfortable place for families preparing for discharge with a ch ild with complex medical conditions. Homeward Bound - Patient Application A patient was born at 38 weeks gestation by C-section. Bo rn with a large mass in the floor of her mouth, she had an obstructed airway at birth. Her airway was further compromised when the large mass began to bleed upon delivery, so she was immediately intubated at the outside hospital and transporte d to MCJCH at Vanderbilt. To maintain her airway, she required an emergency tracheostomy and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The NICU nurses began interacting with this family very soon after admission to keep them updated on their baby's condition. Update s from the healthcare team allowed the patient's parents to underst and the need for a tracheostomy and the important role they would play in caring for their baby. The NICU nurse scheduled the mother for the Homeward Bound Tracheostomy Care class when the baby was just eleven days old. The mom also participated in the Homeward Bound CPR class. The patient's mother was eager to learn and very engaged in the class. After class, the Homeward Bound instructor consulted with the pat ient's nurse and gave her a progress sheet known as a Journey Board. This tool was used to communicate with the entire healthcare team including bedside nurses, resp iratory therapists, case managers, social workers, and physicians to track the patient's mother's progress in learning the new skills necessary to care fo r the patient at home. Although the patient's father was not able to attend the traditional class due to work commitments, he was able to learn the skills necessary to care fo r the patient at the bedside. Utilizing class materials and hands on opportunities, the NICU nurses and respiratory therapists worked with the family to reinforc e concepts taught in class. In the NICU, the nurses participate in inte rprofessional team rounds. This was very important for this patient because of the nat ure of the mass in her mouth. One major goal during this time was to maintain the chil d's airway and control the bleeding from the 1mass. These rounds included physicians, nutr ition, speech therapy, social work, case management, respiratory therapy and the family. During her hospitalization, it was determined that the mass also interfered with her ability to suck effectively and maintain sufficient oral inta ke. When the care team made the plan to place a gastrostomy tube, t he nurses again referred the parents to the Homeward Bound program. This time they were registered for the Gastrostomy Tube Care class to learn how to meet their ch ild's nutritional needs. The NICU nurses worked with the patient's case manager to set up a visit from the medical equipment company to teach them how to use the f eeding pump and work with the family at the bedside to reinforce all of t he concepts taught in class. The mass was diagnosed as a fibrosarcoma; therefore, it would be necessary for the patient to have a Broviac placed and undergo chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The NICU nurses prepared the mother and baby for a tr ansfer to a different level of care in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) w here she could begin these therapies. The nurses in the PICU participated in interdi sciplinary bedside rounds with the physicians, social work, case managers, respiratory therapy, and speech therapy. Reviewing documentation, the PICU was able to det ermine the educational information already given to the families and begin reinforcing that material. The nurses also reached out to the Pediatri c Oncology team to educate the mother about the chemotherapy regimen. As the baby stabilized, she was eventually transferred to the Pediatric Oncology uni t where the parents received education based on the Infectious Disease team's protocol r egarding the care of a Broviac catheter. The nursing team reinforced the techniques le arned in Homeward Bound as the parents continued to practice caring for the child's tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. A collaborative approach was used as multiple medical teams addressed issues with the tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube and chemotherapy regimens. As the child became more stable, the disc harge plans, which began at admission, were activated. Arrangements were made for a home health nurse to visit and assess the child's status, reinforce teaching, and determine the patient's progress. The home health nurses, who collaborated on the devel opment of the Homeward Bound material, were able to reiterate concepts the parent s had learned in class. The baby was also followed by other members of the home health team in cluding speech therapy and physical and occupational therapi sts. The patient was dischar ged at three months old. Since her first discharge, the patient has been followed by the Home Health team and Oncology Clinic staff. She has been readmi tted for her chemother apy each month, and at seven months old, she had the tumor resect ed from the floor of her mouth. On each admission, the nursing admission history generated referrals to nutrition, social work and child life for continuity of care and family support. At this time the patient is nine months old and has finished her chemotherapy. She is growing and developing well. She is still followed by the home health agency for feeding and speech development and is being evaluated for possible decannulation of 1the Broviac catheter. EP5a- 4 Interdiscipli nary Medical Record shows tracking & team communication Interdisciplinary Team Meetings In order to coordinate the ca re of patients with new trach eostomies, a \"super-user\" team was developed. This team consists of physi cians, nurse practitioners, nurse educators, nurse managers, respiratory therapists, case managers, social work and quality improvement. In the bi-weekly meetings, t he nurse practitioner summarizes the status of each patient and then leads the discussi on around clinical progress, need for education and coordination of services for each patient. In this pat ient's circumstance, there were several discussions regarding tr eatment and care due to the nature of the tumor in the floor of her mouth. EP5a-5 Tracheostomy Care Booklet Continuity of Care Vanderbilt is an extremely strong organiza tion when it comes to interprofessional teamwork. As told in the story above, a ll team members were essential to the success of this child. In addition, the early inte rdisciplinary work of Homeward Bound and the use of the Journey Board support succe ssful inpatient management and discharge follow-up. However, nursing case management is a key role that is critical to care coordination as children change services withi n the hospital and transition to home care and back to the clinics. As defined above, case management was critical in the management of this child. They helped c oordinate with the bedsid e nurses to schedule the family for appropriate Homeward Bound classes and helped reinforce teaching with the family. There was also coordinati on between the multiple health care team members, including physicians from at leas t four different serv ices, social work, nutrition, rehab services, etc., that was facilitated by the ca se manager. As the patient became more stable and approached discharge, the case manag er coordinated services with Vanderbilt Home Care Serv ices and a home medical equipment company to assure a smooth transition home and appr opriate further reinforcement of the education the family had received in the hospital.

Example b Coordinated Community Care Prevents Readmissions Background As a tertiary referral center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is well-known for its cutting-edge care for complicat ed disease processes. Vanderbilt's Comprehensive Care Center (VCCC) has tr eated over eight thousand patients and has 1developed an environment wher e patients obtain quality, effective care in a safe, supportive, and compassionate setting. Collective ly, VCCC's interprofessional team has decades of experience caring for HIV posit ive individuals. Current care is collaboratively delivered by a team of five infectious di sease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) certified physicians, four nurse practitioners, a psychiatrist, a psychiatric mental health nurse practiti oner, dietitian, registered nurses (RN) and RN case managers, licensed practical nurses (LPN), social workers, in take coordinators, referral specialist, and education and administrative staff. RN case managers noted that m any complex HIV patients were experiencing frequent hospital readmissions. For this unique popu lation, common barriers post-hospitalization that predisposed patients to the frequent use of acute care services were noted. Contributing factors and barriers complicating care incl uded: complex treatment regimens, multiple medications, timely acquisition of medications and access to services, adherence, transportation, housing barriers, and financial challenges. Consequently, nurse case managers, soci al workers and other VCCC team members identified several critical interventions. Beginning at the time of hospital admission, continuous communication, care coordinat ion, and individualized discharge planning were pivotal to reducing hospital readmissi ons and potential enhancement of a patient's quality of life. The overall goal was to ensure and deliver ongoing care that was comprehensive yet individualiz ed to each patient's needs. Example A patient with HIV/AIDS and multiple other co-morbidities was seen and evaluated at the VCCC with progressive worsening of lo wer extremity weakness. Although he had Medicare coverage, he did not have Part D and could not afford the co-pay associated with his medications. This resulted in the discontinuation of his ant i-retroviral therapy medications for four mont hs contributing to his progressive physical decline. Consequently, his seriously compromised physical state necessitated admission to VUMC in August 2014. Immediately upon admission, a VUMC social worker partnered with VCCC nursing team members, Beverly Woodward, RN, and Lori Taylor, LPN, Patient Assistance Program (PAP) Coordinator, to plan and coordinate the patient's disc harge strategy which would include an inpatient rehabilitation stay. EP5b-1 Admission Discharge Planning Other interdisciplinary team member s, including the inpatient ph ysician partners, were also included and contributed to t he personalization of the patient's hospital discharge care plan. Coordination of effo rts to assure uninterrupted continuance of the patient's prescribed medication regimen during his inpatient rehabilitation at Skyline Rehab, a non-VUMC facility, was also evident through documentation VCCC's PAP continued to assist RNs, Beverly Woodward and Leslie Reese, in resolving issues regarding the patient's enrollment in Medicare Part D prescription coverage. As adequate financial support was ess ential to assure his timely receipt of medications and adherence to his treatment regimen, VCCC RNs maintained frequent two-way communication regarding his PAP status. Additionally, PAP and case 1management continued to explore this patient's eligibility for Insurance Assistance Program (IAP) or Medicare to obtain additio nal financial support to cover medication co- pays. EP5b-2 Communication Re DC Coord, Med Cont , and PAP Status Continuity, coordination, and care support by VCCC's RN case manager, Leslie Reese, was noted at the beginning and extended throughout the duration of the patient's inpatient stay at Skyline Rehabilitation. Documentation verifies the benefits of a detailed follow-up post hospitalization, wit h the rehab entity as a discrepancy in the patient's medication regim en promptly noted and corrected. Leslie maintained contact and made herself r eadily available to the patient and the rehab staff to address issues, resolve pr oblems, and prepare for eventual discharge home. To assure safe and timely transporta tion home from the rehab facility, Leslie worked with Skyline and community-based Na shville CARES to arrange the patient's transportation to VUMC's One Hundred Oaks (O HO) pharmacy to obta in his anti-viral medications. To assure that medications were approved and would be available for dispensing post rehab-discharge, Leslie also communicated and coordinated medication prescriptions and pick-up with the physician, pharmacists, and transportation provider. Cognizant that transportation would pose a continual challe nge for the patient, Leslie continued work with CARES to assure ongoing and uninterrupted transportation to future clinic visits. EP5b-3 Coordination of Transportation Active continuation of planning and coordina tion after the patient's rehab discharge was also pivotal to assure continued adherence, timely assessment, and intervention. Communication channels continue to be open and easily accessible for the patient, as Leslie continues frequent follow-up through phone calls, face-to-face clinic visits, and patient portal, \"My Health at Vanderbilt \". Recognizing that the patient's home safety and sense of independence was essential, Leslie also worked with his physician, Dr. Katie White, and durabl e medical equipment provider to secure a motorized scooter and obtain a disability letter to facilitate reduced public transportation fairs EP5b-4 Coordination of DME Today, the patient is physically and mentally stable, functionally independent within accepted disease limitations, actively engag ed in his self-care, and verbalizes an appreciated improvement in quality of life. Finally, as a result of Leslie's cumulative case management experience in the inpatient and outpatient settings, she wanted to devis e a tool to standardize post-hospital discharge follow-up phone calls. A team physi cian enthusiastically supported Leslie's work and also agreed that a directed, post-acute care follow-up would reduce readmissions and acute care usage by addr essing patients' questions, concerns, and minimizing or removing barriers in an expeditious, consistent manner. 1Consequently, the \"Case Management Follow -Up Phone Call Guide\" EP5b-5 Case Management Follow-Up Phone Call Guide was created and contains sections which sequentially direct a nurse case manager to prepare for the call by reviewing relevant documentation, assess specific elements with the patient during the call, complete post- call documentation using a standardized temp late, promptly identify additional needs and appropriately refer to or utilize inte rnal or external resources. In summary, purposeful care coordination combined with ongoing assessment of patient needs across the care continuum can render both humanistic and fi nancial benefits. This is evident as the patient has not exper ienced or necessitated further utilization of acute care services since fall 2014. 1EP6 Care Delivery System(s) EP6: Nurses incorporate regulatory and sp ecialty standards/guidelines into the development and implementation of the care delivery system. Provide one example, with s upporting evidence, of nurses incorporating specialty standards/guidelines into the delivery of care. Association of Operating Room Nurses, Inc. (AORN) guidelines for surgical incision wound classification The Rascal Flatts Pediatric Surgery Center at the Monroe Carell Jr . Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV) has 18 operating r ooms where an array of procedures are performed, including minimally invasive and r obot assisted surgeries, in 11 specialties. The Association of Operating Room Nurses, Inc. (AORN) is a non-profit organization involved in perioperative research and distributes guidelines that are evidenced based. In keeping with the PPM and care delivery, along with MCJCHV's FOCUS values (Family Centered Care, One Team, Conti nuous Improvement, Unique Environment for Children, and Safety), Vanderbilt surgical nurses continuously look to AORN for standards and recommendations as a foundation for policies and to guide surgical nursing practice. The Surgical Wound Classification Decision Tree published by AORN was adopted by the operating room (OR) t eam. The decision-tree is based on evidence and was created by The Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (CDC) to provide a clinical estimate of microbial contamination of a surgical wound postoperatively and serves as a gauge of how likely a patient will develop an infection at the su rgical site. The documentation of wound classification and agreement by nurse s and surgeons is important because it supports the comparison of wound infection/surg ical site infection rates associated with surgical techniques, surgeons, and facilities. By analyzing the infection rate data, trends can be detected on wounds that are at an increased risk for infection and allow applicable monitoring and preventative measures to be implemented. Concern was expressed by both the OR nursing staff and surgeons of discrepancies in the matching of wound classifications between the two groups. The AORN Surgical Wound Classification Decision Tree is below. 1 Data/Problem Identification In late April 2012, an analysis of patient re cords did reveal discrepancies between how the OR nursing staff and the surgeons cl assified wounds. After data analysis was completed, this information was presented to the OR staff in thei r morning meeting in August 2012. Through September, suggestions for wound classification documentation were generated by the OR staff. Vanderb ilt Perioperative Information Management System (VPIMS) is the electronic documentat ion tool for perioperative services and was 1determined to be the most viable location fo r wound classification. This would require changes in the current VPIMs documentation structure. T hese changes received final approval and were completed in July 2013. Assessment of Knowledge of OR Staff In an effort to understand the problem and where staff needed to focus on education, staff began by identifying the barriers to corr ect identification for wound classification. There was a verbal survey of the OR nur ses completed by Dana Williams, MSN, RN2 (Quality Improvement Analyst, OR and Procedur al Services) to verify the initial educational training the staff had received on wound classification. Some received in- depth training, others had brief tr aining, while others had no training at all. There was also a quiz (Wound Classificati on Pre-Test) given by Mari a Sullivan, MSN, RN, CNOR (Perioperative & Procedural Services Nurse E ducator) to the OR nurses to verify their current understanding of wound cla ssification. This quiz was administered via Survey Monkey and included 10 questions that asked the nurses to identify the correct wound classification based on the procedure that was presented. From this work, education was identified as a primary barrier based on bot h the verbal survey and the pre-test. Education utilizing the Surgical W ound Classification Deci sion Tree from AORN While waiting for the VPIMS c hanges to be initiated, the firs t step was to ensure that all staff had the correct and same training. In February 2013, a wound classification Learning Management System (LMS) module wa s assigned to all the OR nurses by Maria Sullivan, MSN, RN, CNOR. Over the next several months, several opportunities were taken to repeat the data to the staff and outline the plan for correction during staff meetings and quality updates. EP6-1- LM S Learning Module for Periop Wound Classification; EP6-2- QIA U pdate for Staff- February 2013 To further assist perioper ative nursing staff with decision making for wound classification, Misty Jones, BSN, RN, CNOR pos ted the Decision Tree in each operating room along with the wound classification defin itions. Staff nurses were encouraged to use this tool as they discussed the w ound classification with the surgeon. In addition, a badge buddy was created by Dana Williams, MSN, RN, QIA and Daniel Gates, MS, CPC (Perioperat ive Coding Specialist). Th is badge buddy was designed as a quick reference tool for the OR nurses. It was patterned after a wound classification card created by the CDC. Nursing staff we re again encouraged to debrief with surgeons to discuss the correct wound classification. The badge buddy serves as a quick access reference tool. In August 2013, after the VPIMS changes were initiated, an interactive bulletin board was created and placed in the hallway between the staff lounge and locker rooms. Staff members reviewed and completed a quiz. This bulletin board served as education reinforcement. EP6-3- QIA Update- August 2013 Verification of Educational Initiative 1After the educational initiatives, a post te st was distributed to staff nurses by Dana Williams, MSN, RN (Quality Im provement Analyst, OR and Procedural Services). This quiz was administered via Survey Monkey and included the same 10 questions that were on the pre-test. Results are prov ided below. The post education showed an improvement in nurses correctly identifying appropriate wound classification.

Provide one example, with supporting ev idence, of an improvement resulting from a change in clinical practice due to the applicati on of professional organization's standards of nursing practice . The example provided may be at the unit, division, or organizational level. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data t able that clearly displays the data. Background In the Vanderbilt outpatient adul t operating arena, (VOS) tradit ionally, there is a \"battle of sorts\" for the room tem perature that ensues between t he needs of the patient and the needs of the staff and equipment. During the act ual procedure, the personnel dressed in paper gowns and under the int ense lights, find themselves getting hot and may start perspiring. The need to be more comfortabl e and reduce the risk of contaminating the sterile field with perspiration propels staff to reduce the temperature in the operating room. The issue that was observed was that the staff would be scrubbed for the day, and then automatically lower the operating room (OR) temperature prior to the start of the day's surgeries for their comfort. Whil e this is an issue that can a ffect the patient adversely, it is done more by habit than by conscientious thought. Evidenced based practice shows that mainta ining the patient's core temperature between 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F) and 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) reduces the risk of hypothermia-related complications which can include increased bl ood loss, decreased blood supply to the wound, surgical site infection, myocardial damage, and increased length of stay. Vanderbilt perioperative services monitors and follows practice guidelines from the Association of Perioperative Registered Nu rses (AORN), and the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN). The practi ce guidelines are to maintain patients' temperatures within the thermoneutral zone as listed above. Critical is having the patient properly warmed in t he preoperative area bef ore they enter t he OR suite. Goal Statement To have eighty-five percent or greater of preoperative patients wa rmed consistently. Description of Interventions Education Starting in March 2014, the first step was to provide education for the perioperative personnel on the importance of thermor egulation across the perioperative arena, particularly beginning in pre-op holding. The perioperative personn el were defined as the nurses, surgical technologists, physici ans, including residents, nurse anesthetists, 1and anesthesiologists. This education included information on the AORN and ASPAN standards and recommended practices, as we ll as VUMC policies and procedures on thermoregulation in the perioperative arena. The education also covered the different methods of heat loss, the effects of hy pothermia on a patient and evidenced-based ways to warm the surgical patient pre-op and intraoperatively. The intraoperative staff post project survey show s that the majority of the staff felt they were better educated about thermoregulation. The staff understood the need for more consistent warming of the patient and t he operative suite and more aware of the patient's temperature prior to asking fo r the OR temperature to be reduced. Peer Review In March 2014, starting in pre-op and in the OR, the patient's temperature as well as the room temperature were measured every 60 minutes from beginning to end. Using a data sheet that followed the patient from pre-op to the post- anesthesia care unit (PACU) to track the patient's tem perature, the staff could s ee the temperature across the continuum. This data provided the perioperative personnel the ability to actually see how patient warming or not warming can affect the patient from start to finish getting immediate results of improvements in pati ent care. Recording the data required the Better EducatedBetter Asking Anesthesia Prior to Lowering OR TempMore Consistent Warming ORMore Consistent Warming BedMore Consistent Warming Post Project Survey 1personnel to stop and think about performing t he task and thereby improve the care in real time. During the education period in March 2014, the improvement in pre-warming the patients was at a high of 92%, believed to be in part due to the tracking sheets that the staff were required to complete. According to research it generally takes 66 days of repeating an action to form a habit. Therefor e, after the March education and tracking period, there was some variation in the percentage of patients that were pre-warmed; however, stayed consistently higher than bef ore the education was provided and well above the goal of 85%. Agreed upon Action Connect and turn on forced air warmer on all patients preoper atively unless the patient refuses. Place the forced air warmer under the sheets on the operating bed prior to patient entrance into the OR. Connect and turn on the forced air warme r on all patients in the OR unless anesthesia reports the core temp erature to be above AORN guidelines. Connect and turn on the forced air warme r on all patients upon arrival to PACU unless core temperature is above ASPAN guidelines.

Supporting evidence mu st be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that cl early displays the data. VPH uses internal consultants to decrease falls with harm Background/Problem Psychiatric patients are predisposed to falls for a number of reasons (i.e., psychotropic medications, metabolic changes due to medicati ons, disturbances in balance, etc.) and require special attention with regard to prevention. At V anderbilt Psychiatric Hospital (VPH), standardized processes were lacking across the hospital with regard to best practice for falls prevention directly related to psychiatric patients. At Vanderbilt the staff of t he Quality, Safety and Risk Prevention (QSRP) department serve as internal consultants for quality, sa fety and risk prevention issues. Staffed with nursing quality consultants, data analysts, study design expe rts, and statisticians, QSRP is an excellent internal resource. In June of 2015, VPH partnered with QSRP to implement changes in clinical practice t hat would decrease the number of falls with harm. Quality consultants Renee Boggs MS N, RN, CPN and Sonya Moore MSN, RN, CPPS worked with VPH. Goal Decrease the incidence rate of falls with ha rm per 1,000 patient days in the Psychiatric Hospital. Description of the Interventions Historically, patients at VPH were pl aced on standard falls risk precautions for psychiatric patients upon admission. Moderate and high falls risk categories were also assigned to those VPH patients that met t he criteria. A falls risk assessment is completed upon admission, and once on day and evening shifts. A literature review showed that the precautions currently in pl ace were considered the best practices for fall prevention for this pat ient population. After an analysis was conducted of the past falls with harm at VPH, a plan was developed. One of the first actions was the implementation of safety rounding and post- fall huddles. This work was monitored by VPH 's quality committee which is comprised of clinical nurses in the clinical staff l eadership role. The CSLs, along with the quality consultants, collaboratively designed the concept and practice of weekly safety 1rounding on each unit to identify high fall risk patients, as well as to ensure that best practices were in place for those at ri sk patients. These initiatives included: proximity to nurse's station identification fall armbands bedside call system in place the use of safety non-skid footwear patient education The group also initiated a post-fall huddle pr ocess within one hour of the fall with the staff involved and a quality consultant. The purpose was to identify predisposing factors leading to the fall, as well as to ensure t hat all appropriate prevent ive measures were in place, prior to the fall. In an effort to assist staff with ensuring t hat all appropriate falls prevention practices were in place for each patient, a post-fall reference chart was created and shared with all units within VPH. This chart serves to ens ure that all safety me asures, reporting, and documentation are consistent throughout the hospital. The safety rounding, post-fall huddle, and post-fall reference chart were all instituted in Sept ember of 2015. Performance boards were placed in each patient care area to reflect current quality metrics and the related data. The boards were strategically placed on each unit to be in view of patients, their familie s, and staff in order to reflect ongoing quality initiative performance, including falls.

For the three months prior to initiation, VPH experienced five falls with injury. After implementation of t he new practices, two falls with injury have occurred. 1EP9 Staffing, Scheduling, and Budgeting Processes EP9: Nurses are involved in staffing and scheduling based on established guidelines, such as ANA's Principles for Nurse Staffing, to ensure that RN assignments meet the needs of the patient population. Provide two examples, with supporting evidenc e, from different practice settings when input from clinical nurses was used to modify RN staffing assignments and/or adjust the schedule to compensate for a change in patient acuity, patient population, resources or redesign of care. Example a Changes implemented with cl inical nurse input to meet the needs of a specific patient population at Monroe Carell Jr . Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV) The eighth floor of MCJCHV houses pediatri c inpatient surgery, trauma and adolescent medicine services. It also serves as an over flow unit for pediatri c medical patients and oncology patients. The clinical nurses and care partners are educated, trained and equipped to provide high quality nursing care fo r these patient populations. The unit is physically equipped for these patients and the staffing model is created around this population and supports staff to provide patients with the appropr iate level of care and monitoring needed. Historically, the eighth floor has also admi tted suicidal ideation patients and added staff training on the protocols and guidelines ar ound the management of these patients. However, in the past three years, 2013 - 2015, there has been a rapid increase in the pediatric behavioral health population admitted to MCJCHV. This group of patients has been admitted, as needed, for medical or su rgical treatment; however, they end up staying after their physical problems are resolved awaiting psychiatric resources to be provided by other specialized facilities. Because of this rapid increase in admissions, nurse leaders on the unit met with clinical nurses to understand the clinic al needs of these patients as well as the educational needs for the staff. EP9a-1 Staff Behavioral Survey Responses Beginning in February 2013, several changes were made and processes were put in place to better support the nursing staff and the patients. EP9a- 2 Email confirming MCJCHV staff shadowing at VPH In March 2013, ten nurses voluntee red to receive training at Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital through shadowing nur ses on their child and adolescent unit and didactic information. EP9a-3 Flyer for didacti c class; EP9a- 4 Attendance of designated nurses in class The MCJCHV nurses were able to interact one on one with a varied pediatric psychiatric populatio n under the supervision of nurses and mental health specialists as well as witness behavioral m odification, de-escalation and team therapy techniques. This group of nurses has continu ed to serve as our partners when providing 1care to this population in our children's hospital. Their feedback has led to changes needed to ensure safety of all of our behavio ral health patients and clinical staff. In addition, the hours of a house- wide clinical psychiatric liaison team were increased to help meet the growing demands for this patient population. Cohorting patients to meet their needs In a most recent episode, the children's hospi tal experienced a historically high volume in this patient population when there were almost 30 patients in house on one day. Nursing leadership came together with staff on the eighth floor to cohort these patients and provide the extra staffing resources t hat had been determined. One of the pods on the eighth floor has eight beds. The staff we re able to remove the harmful items and secure the rooms according to our suicidal precautions policy and to the standards they had learned at the Psychiatric Hospital. Clinical nurses provided care for eight behavioral health patients on this pod and another three across the rest of the eighth fl oor. Nurses came together to support them by floating across the floor to provide care to these patients if they had received the initial training and to help creat e processes and guidelines arou nd the cohorting of these patients. Within one shift, we began to see the benefits of the work completed. The aggression incidents had declined with the attention and monitoring provi ded by these nurses. Over the rest of the days that followed the nurses that prov ided care to these patients reported increased amounts of self-fulfillment and satisfaction in being able to support these patients in a more consistent and compassionate basis. Processes were developed to address the storage of items in rooms that c ould be harmful and included sitter belongings. Family and visitor education was implemented by st aff. All of these measures were shared shift to shift in order to provide consistency of care. Next steps include possibl e additional education on behav ioral triggers and behavioral modification techniques. Addi tional staff have also r equested to now receive formal mental health specialist training at our psychiatric hospital in an effort to provide care for this specific population. EP9a- 5 Email from manager about cohorting behavioral health patients. An effort to improve the care of patients with Behavioral Health issues at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJ CHV) began in 2013. At t hat time, a survey was sent to the clinical nurses on the eighth floor to assess their educational and experiential needs to better se rve this patient population ( Refer to Original Evidence EP9a-1 Staff Behavioral Survey Responses ). With the information from that survey, several staff nurses began to formulate a plan that included didactic education, real time experience, and improving the environment of care. 1In February and March 2013 clinical nurse La ura Filingo, BSN, RN, CSL suggested that nurses with an interest in caring for this population spend time \"shadowing\" nurses in the pediatric and adolescent units at Vanderbilt Psychiatric Ho spital (VPH). She worked with Laura Zavisa, BSN, RN, PMHN, nurse manager of VPH pediatric and adolescent units, to arrange the shadowing experiences ( Refer to Original Evidence EP9a-2 Email Confirming MCJCHV staff shadowing at VPH). Clinical nurse shadowing experiences at VPH continued through 2013. The clinical nurses involved in these shado wing experiences requested more didactic education regarding this pati ent population to include common diagnoses, intervention strategies, and availability of community resour ces. A lecture series was offered for the interested clinical nurses. ( Refer to Original Evidence EP9a-4 Attendance of designated nurses in class). Sheree Burdette, BSN, RN and Laura Filingo, BSN, RN, CSL were just two examples of clinical staff nurses involved in this work. In 2015, MCJCHV saw a sharp rise in the number of patients pres enting with behavioral health issues. The clinical nurses involved in earlier efforts to serve this population eagerly joined a workgroup and shared their input into the feasibility of c ohorting these patients on the eighth floor and assigning the nurses who participated in the didactic education and shadowing experiences to thes e patients. Clinical nurse Lindsey Kevetter, BSN, RN, CPN participated as well as Laura and Sheree (New Evidence EP9a-1 Workgroup Minutes). The finalized proposal, submitted to seni or leadership, recommended to group (cohort) these patients in a specific area on the eight h floor as well as modify assignments to allow those with competence in caring for this patient population to be the primary group of clinical nurses ( New Evidence EPa-2 Proposal). The cohorting on the 8 th floor occurred in a previously expanded space wh ere all the room numbers start with 87 and are 8737 through 8744. The proposal was supported by leadership and the cohorting of patients on the eighth floor began on September 26, 2015 (New Evidence EPa-3 Patient List). Nurse staffing was also adjusted when th is occurred to ensure that nurses with the competence to care for these pat ients were assigned to these patients ( New Evidence EPa-4 Nursing Assignment Sheet- (September 26, 2015) showing one example of matching trained nurses with des ignated behavioral health patients in cohorted rooms (8740, 8741, 8744) these would be the patients that were determined to need the specialized care that shift) . On September 28, 2015 an email from Cristina Loaiza BSN, RN, NE-BC, Nurse Manager, was sent to the entire eighth floor staff outlining the cohorting proc ess and answering staff questions regarding this change (Refer to Original Evidence EPa-5 Email from manager about c ohorting behavioral health patients ) to improve patient care. 1 Example b Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (V ICC) Oncology Outpatient Infusion Clinic nursing manager uses clinical nur se input to modify staffing assignments and redesign care due to a change in resources. Due to changes in healthcare reimbursement, VUMC senior leadership, in collaboration with frontline leadership (managers), closely ex amined FTE distribution in the fall of 2013. Concurrently, the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center's (VICC) Oncology Outpatient Infusion clinic experienced vol untary attrition of two FTE charge nurse positions. As both charge nurse positions provided less than 50% direct patient care and in light of the current internal fiscal exam ination, the clinic wa s temporarily unable to fill the positions. Subsequently, this provided clinic staff RNs in partnership with nurse manager, Leah Atwell, MSN, RN, an opportunity to redesign care and modify staffing assignments to assure continuation of t he efficient, quality care patients had become accustomed to in this high volume, outpatient setting. VICC's Oncology Outpatient Infusion Center is configured with three distinct care pods (A, B, and C) each accommodat ing 15 patients and staffed da ily by a designated team of RNs and care partners. The clinic has over 1,900 visits per mont h, therefore, ready service access, patient throughput, and care efficiency throughout all three pods is critical. The daily role and tasks of the charge nurse needed to be integrated and redistributed. That work included; making nurse assignments, continuous physician collaboration and communication, reviewing and processing of new orders, providing backup, and direct patient care when needed. Beginning in October, 2013, the clinical staff nurses led by clinical nurse Kristin McDade reviewed the literature for best practice s. Spurred by collective RN input (New Evidence EP9b-1 RN Input Pre-Pilot Functional Nsg) , a pilot in early November, 2013, launched functional nursing as a care deliver y model. Throughout this process, staff RN's provided input regarding challenges (role clarification, staffing assignments, and communication) and possible solutions (New Evidence EP9b-2 RN Input Intra-Pilot Functional Nsg) . Both patients and staff struggled with acclimating to one RN assuming responsibility for only one sole task/role. Collectively, and again with RN input, it was dec ided that an alternative care model utilizing a \"Pod Leader\" model would be trialed. Staff RN's helped delineate the role and clarify expectations regarding other RN work reassignment within each pod (New Evidence EP 9b-3 RN Input Pr e-Pilot Pod Leader Model) . Beginning in mid-November, 2013, one RN would assume the role of Pod Leader each day in Pod A, B, or C. When 1compared to the original RN Charge positions where clinic al oversight and involvement were more global, administrative and wit h lessened visibility, Pod Leaders were pod- based and present, readily available, and dire ctly involved at the patient's bedside. Additional contributions of this evolving RN role have included: Complete and supervise pod staff schedules and assignments Provide back-up to staff and be readily available for emergencies or fluctuations causing increased/high volumes Assume direct patient care (patient load is decreased in comparison to regular fulltime RN staff due to other as signed Pod Leader responsibilities) Assist and support staff, patient, and pat ient's family throughout shift, as needed Process new admissions, initiate care and facilitate hand-over to staff RN. Leah (Nurse Manager) utilized clinical nurse i nput to modify RN staffing assignments based to compensate for a change in resources. The clinical nurse input Review and revision of this new role and the implicat ions are ongoing with continued RN input and discussion (New Evidence EP9b-4 Meeting Minut es re RN Input Post-Pilot Pod Leader Model) .

Provide two examples, with supporting evidence, from di fferent practice settings where trended data was used during the budget process, with clinical nurse input, to assess actual-to-budget performanc e to redistribute existing nursing resources or to acquire additional nursing resources. Trended data must be presented. Example a Vanderbilt Eskind Diabetes Clinic adds RN Certified Diabetes Educators to meet patient demand Background Vanderbilt Eskind Diabetes Clinic (VEDC) is certified by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as an education recognized program (ERP) and therefore utilizes RN Certified Diabetes Educators (RN-CDE) to provide Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) to patient s and their families. Focused on patient-centered care, RN-CDEs engage and actively part ner with patients to identify individual goals. Noted in the literature as best practice, RN- CDEs are integral members of the interprofessional team and promote self-ma nagement, coach patients to achieve behavioral and treatment goals, help control disease progression, and support optimal health outcomes contributing to an enhanced qualit y of life. In early 2013, The Diabetes Clinic CDE staffing and service utilization was insufficient to assure timely, comprehensive service delivery to patients and referring providers. Example In preparation for the upcoming year's budget, VEDC's nurse manager at that time, Carolyn Howard, MSN, RN, NE-BC, noted that RN-CDEs were seeing an average of only seven patients per day. Aware of the physi cian's daily patient volume, the question was \"how many patients are we missing\" w ho actually need DSME? In addition, these visits are billable. Data analysis showed that the addition of even one CDE FTE paired with a revision of the current referral process could increase access to essential education for patients and support direct referrals from internal medicine and primary care physicians, maximize RN-CDE utilization, and boost clinic revenue. At that time, RN-CDE consultations were not readily available to non-VEDC internal medicine and primary care physicians within the Vanderbilt network. A CDE referral could only be made after initial consultation by a VEDC physician. If this barrier were removed, direct CDE 1referral by medicine and primar y care physicians could impr ove the access of valuable education to more patients. Carolyn partnered with the Eskind RN-CDE s to have them analyze the data and determine feasibility of a possible change and w hat that change might look like. Initially meeting weekly, and then monthl y, over six months the group reviewed the following data: potential diabetic volume and trends associated with staffing changes current and potential volume of CDE encounters per VEDC provider actual CDE referrals by provider DSME patient participation survey responses from VDEC physi EP10a-3 VEDC Ph ysician Survey Summary 8.16.2013 From the data analysis, strategies and actions identified included: add at least one RN-CDE FTE foster work relationships and clos er alignment with referring physicians allow direct referrals from internal medicine and primary care physicians restructure DSME team ro les and reengineer work flow recommend that all new diabetic pat ients be referred for CDE assessment Proposals requesting budgetary support for the addition of one RN-CDE FTE, including details of potential impact on patients being missed and therefore subject to unnecessary clinic and hospital visits and the fiscal impact, were presented to senior leadership by the nurse manager and the cu rrent RN-CDEs. EP10a-4 Sr Leadership PPT Additional presentations, tailored for physician partners were provided by the VEDC nurse manager and RN-CDEs at providers' practice sites. The proposal was supported by senior leadership, nursi ng and medical management and the changes were made. EP10a-5 Newly Hired CDE Positions from HR System. Clinical Nurse Input The clinical nurses in the Eskind Diabetes Center were involved from the beginning on how to address the issue of \"mo re CDE time\" to capture all of the patients that needed education and in determining a method to appr opriately capture those patients from primary care physicians. This was in pr eparation for budget submission which occurs at the end of the calendar year. Clinical nurse i nput examples below: The initial discussion began in Ja nuary, 2014 when the manager Carolyn Howard, MSN, RN, CDE and clinical st aff nurse from the Diabetes Center, Patricia Patterson, BSN, RN, CDE me t with the CNO for the Clinics - Robin Steaban, MSN, RN, NE-BC. Cheryl Rhodes , AD, RN, CDE was involved in the email discussion with Caroly n regarding the need for an increased number of certified diabet es educators. (New Evidence EP10a-1 Email re RN Input 1.2014) 1 Planning continued and in February continued feedback on the issue came from Patricia Patterson, BSN, RN, CDE and Cheryl Rhodes (New Evidence EP10a-2 Email from Clinical Nurse 2.2014) In the initial submission for the present ation to senior leadership, at the year end of 2014 Paterson and Davis (CDEs) were part of that discussion as well as King, the NP Program Coordinator. (Refer to Original Evidence EP10a-4 Sr Leadership PPT) Assessment of actual to budget-to-performance to acquire new resources The assessment was prepared by the manager and the current CDEs and presented to the physicians and the Diabetes Center executive leadership team. (Refer to Original Evidence EP10a -4 Sr Leadership PPT [Slides 9-14]) The assessment was based on the actual number of patients seen compared to the physician's daily volume and in addition, a potential volume of patients from referring internal medicine physicians not housed in the Diabetes Center. The budget information was around volume projec tions and profit margin. See below: Shows that adding additional CD Es to the staffing model based on physician volume the growth opportunity would be 73% conservatively. Shows the growth potential based on the number of new CDEs hired. 1 Financial projections for patient volume increases The new hires CDES came on board in July, September and October of 2015. (EP10a - 5 Original Evidence newly hi red CDE positions from HR System.) 1 The clinical RN Staff continued to provide input to the decisions. (New Evidence EP10a-3 Email from Clinical Nurse 6.2015; New Evidence EP10a-4 Email from Clinical Nurse 7.2014) Example b Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital adds Mental Health Specialists and Registered Nurse in response to a highe r level of patient acuity Beginning in the middle of 2014, Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital (VPH) was seeing an increase in the number of pat ients who were requiring hi gher levels of supervision (within eye-sight or 1:1 moni toring). Another trend was an increase in admissions for specific populations such as geriatric pat ients who were being ad mitted and at risk for falls, child and adolescent patients with behav iors (sexual perpetrators, autistic, aggressive and self-injurious pat ients) that required an increased level of supervision, psychotic patients who experienced an asso ciated aggressive symptomology. This increase in acuity was observed across the un its. When the staff reviewed the NDNQI (Press Ganey) Total RN Hours per Patient Day comparison by case mix they saw that VPH was below the 50 th percentile on what wa s needed for staffing. Resulting discussions with staff revealed a co mmon concern on all shifts related to the necessity of an increase in the level of moni toring required. This issue was especially noted by night shift, likely related to a shif t specific decreased staffing matrix. Several occurrences with adverse outcomes supported st aff concerns regardi ng patient safety. The CNO met with staff to conceptualize t he concerns and followed with a review of staffing plans facilitated by t he managers. Review of the existing staffing model and the ongoing use of sitters, Home Health data fr om provided sitter hours, demonstrated that additional staff was needed to monitor patients who required increased levels of supervision. The revisions to the staffing templates were presented to Medical Center leadership. The FY14 budgets were adjusted to add additional Mental Health Specialist (MHS) hours to each cost center. The total increase was 4.2 FTE's of Mental Health Specialists spread through all of the cost centers. The FTE's were not added to any specific shift and could be allocated to address the fluctuation in acuity and precaution levels throughout the hospital. After the new FTEs were added for MHS, VPH's use of number of hours for patient ca re assistants (sitters) fr om Home Health decreased significantly from July 2014 to December 2015. EP10b-1 Email from Home Health Showing Sitter Hours Decreased A second example of staff review of data and looking at trends and requesting additional resources was the increase in volu me of patients who were requiring detox on Adult 2. This resulted in an increase in the number of nursing care hours needed. A review of NDNQI (Press Ganey ) Case Mix comparison for adult psychiatric units revealed that Adult 2 was below the mean for total RN hours per patient day. The original staffing matrix called for this unit to have one registered nurse assigned to night shift with supporting MHS. After review, it was determined that adding a second 1registered nurse to the shift would improve patient safety for those patients experiencing withdrawal. The FY14 budget was modified to increase Registered Nurse staffing on Adult 2 night shift from one RN to two. After the shifts were added, the acuity (c ase mix index) per NDNQI showed Adult 2 to be at the 50 th percentile, and the mean or above with only one low blip in quarter 2 2015. This change also increased the direct RN hours per patient day to 4.4 from 3.8. EP10b-2 NDNQI Case Mix Compare for Adult 2; EP10b-3 Adult 2 Staffing Templates FY13 and FY14 (from budget sheets; showing in crease in total hours of patient care- highlighted in green); EP10b-4 Budget Sheets Showing Increase in HPPD from FY13 to FY14 The night shift clinical nurses noted an incr ease in the number of detox patients on Adult 2 in early 2013 and took their staffing concerns to the VPH CNO (at that time), Avni Cirpili, DNP, RN, the VP H monthly committee meeting. (EP10b-1 Night Shift Board Min 1.3.2013) . These patients requir ed higher levels of supervision (within eye-sight or 1:1 monitoring) . Higher levels of monitoring are required for patients undergoing detox as these patient s are at increased risk for falls due to pharmacotherapy, need management of acute withdrawal symptoms, and have higher risks related to seizure thresholds. With an increase in this population that requires increased monitoring, nurses expressed that they were inadequately staffed to provide safe care to this population of patients. They vocalized concerns incl uding the need for increased staffing due to higher acuity, as well as the volume of patients who were being placed on detox protocols. At this meeting, the CNO listened to their concerns, and agreed to evaluate trended data that would support adjusting st affing models for the current budgeting cycle which was in process at this time. The original staffing plan called for the Adult 2 unit staffing matrix to have one registered nu rse assigned to night shift with a supporting Mental Health Specialist. The graph below shows the increase in the number of detox patient da ys in Adult 2. 1 This change in patient population resulted in an in the number of nursing care hours needed. When the staff reviewed the NDNQ I (Press Ganey) Total RN Hours per Patient Day comparison by case mix they saw that VPH Adult 2 was below the mean for total RN hours per patient day. (EP10b-2 VPH Adult 2 Case Mix for HPPD) The number of patient days in creased from an average of 50.3 patient days/month in FY 13 to an average of 242 patient days/month in FY 14. The CNO reviewed the existing staffing mo del and also reviewed the ongoing usage of sitters being used to provide increased levels of supervision for this patient population. The data on sitter usage (sitters are br ought in from Vanderbilt Home Health) demonstrated that the units consistently required additional staff to monitor and provide safe care to at risk patients. (EP10b-3 Sitter Usage Before & After) By reviewing the staffing model and cont inued usage of sitter services, it was determined that adding a second registered nurse to the sh ift would improve patient safety for those patients experiencing with drawal symptoms. After the new FTEs were added for RNs during budget preparation, VPH's use of number of hours for patient care assistants (sitters) from Home Health decreased significantly from July 2014 to December 2015. (Refer back to EP10b-3 Sitter Usage Before & After) After the shifts were added, the acuity (case mix index) per NDNQI showed Adult 2 to be at the 50 th percentile, and at the mean, or above, with only one low bl ip in quarter 2 of 2015. (Refer back to EP10b-2 HPPD graph) This change also incr eased the direct RN hours per patient day to 4.4 from 3.8. (EP10b-4 Budget Sheets re HPPD Increase in HPPD FY14 to FY15) 1EP11EO Staffing, Scheduling, and Budgeting Processes EP11EO: Nurses participate in recr uitment and retention assessment and planning activities. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of clinical nurses' participation in nursing recruitment activities and the impact on vacancy rates. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Impact on Vacancy Rates Background In July 2014, Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) was experiencing an all-time high vacancy rate. This high rate was due to several factors: Prior to this time, in response to a predicted $250 million decline in revenue over a period of two years due to significant reimbursement changes, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) init iated a Project Management Office (PMO) to address cost-reduction and revenue enha ncement. This was transparent to the staff and even though we st ated from the beginning t he clinical staff would not be affected, the process itself created extreme anxiety throughout the organization. During the following nine mont hs to a year, 1,000 plus jobs were eliminated through layoffs, retirements and job cuts. Approximately 30 nurses retired. Other measures included a re structuring of the benefits programs that included a change to flex Paid Time Off (PTO) and no annual increases. Regardless of our efforts at transparency and protection of clinical staff, we knew that we had lost ground with both in ternal and external image. We had also experienced a sharp decline in our nursing candidate pool. Growth in specialty areas, such as cardiol ogy and transplant programs had created a high demand for experienced nurses in an al ready low candidate pool. We knew from historical data that we needed approx imately four candidates for one hire and we were not close to that number. Another issue that came during this same time frame was a large increase in our \"Time to Fill\" days - it was taking well over 50 days from application to hire for the small number of nursing applicants we had. This frequently prompted them to move on to another or ganization to avoid the l ong wait. Therefore, the question did we have a bigger candidate po ol than we thought, just that the \"Time to Fill\" process needed streamlining? Goal Statement To decrease the total registered nurse (RN) actual vacancy rate as percentage of budgeted full time equivalents (FTE ) in VUH (adult) inpatient. Interventions 1In July 2014, a Staffing Project Management o ffice (PMO) was initiated. Led by the Director of Nursing Professiona l Practice and Magnet Recognit ion, this was a full-force effort to secure new staff by addressing issues with available candidate pool and time to fill to begin to address the vacancy factor. Th is work was slated to be comprehensive, therefore several smaller groups were appoi nted to identify solutions for specific identified problems. One of the groups was tasked to address the issue of access to our application website and the onboarding of new hires. Issues identified included: Application web-site was hard to fi nd, and then to navigate and understand what nursing roles were available and where they were located Nurse recruiting website was static and had not been updated in several years Redundant paper work that was not el ectronic which increased the amount of time to get a new hi re into the system Several hand-overs between the nurse hiring manager and the nurse recruiter which could be confusing to the hiring process and the candidate and increased the amount of time to extend an offer and navigate the required paperwork To address these issues that were termed under \"Candidate Throughput\", an interdisciplinary team was appo inted to address these issues through a LEAN Process. This team worked quickly over the next three months to identify the issues and design and implement new processes. Addressing t he workflow itself supported this team to redesign the current process and implement the changes quickly. Below are some of the areas addressed. Recruitment and application website updates Pre-posting requirements for nursing roles Electronic paper work flow Position reviews - between hiri ng nurse manager and recruiter Candidate review and interview process Offer process Onboarding processes One of the major issues was the recruitment and application website; even if we draw more candidates, frustration wit h the website would possibly det er them from applying. The clinical nursing staff members on the LEAN team had both been here less than a year and had come here from other states and were able to articulate the frustration of dealing with the application website. The VUH clinical nurse representative, Jessica Jurkovich BSN, RN2 from the Trauma Unit, took a leadership role in the advisement and design of an updated recruitm ent and application website. By April 2015, this group had: Updated the nurse recruitment website to a more interactive dynamic site Added a Nurse Recruitment Hotline with a toll free number where potential candidates can talk to a \"live\" person and get questions answered immediately Added a \"Chat with a Nurse Recruiter\" feature 1 Added a \"Tell us about yourself\" pr e-application summary section where candidates send in a short summary and ta lk to a recruiter about options - starting the process -before they ev er have to do the full application Added an easy \"Search Nursing Jobs\" feature which allows a potential candidate to search by role category and location (as we have clinics in outlying counties) Labeled each role with the loca tion - main campus or other Integrated the nurse recruitment website with our Nursing Website Participants Name Credentials Role in organization Practice Area Role Sabrina Downs MSN, RN, NE-BC Director, Nursing Professional Practice & Magnet Recognition Executive Nursing Administration Project Manager - PMO Team Candy Lindsay BS, RACR Senior Director, Talent Management & Operations Human Resources PMO Team Member Jason Mathisen BS, MHM Administrative Resident VUH PMO Team Member Jannis Muscato BS, MS HR Director, Medical Service Delivery Teams Human Resources PMO Team Member Angel Carter BSN, RN Nurse Manager MCJCHV LEAN Redesign Team Anthony Fleming BS, PMC, RACR, PHR, SHRM-CP Talent Acquisition Manager Human Resources LEAN Redesign Team Rachel Ingle BSN, RN Clinical Nurse MCJCHV LEAN Redesign Team Jessica Jurkovich BSN, RN Clinical Nurse Trauma Unit VUH LEAN Redesign Team Doug King BS, MBA Operations Systems Engineer VUMC LEAN Redesign Team Kim Linville MSN, RN Nurse Manager VUH LEAN Redesign Team Brandi Meacham MSN, RN, CPN Nurse Educator MCJCHV LEAN Redesign Team Rosalyn BS, RACR Senior Talent Human LEAN Redesign Team 1Norris Acquisition Consultant Resources Shelly Padgett BSN, RN Nurse Educator Nursing Education & Professional Development LEAN Redesign Team Terri Phillips BS Manager, HR Systems and Reporting Human Resources LEAN Redesign Team Katie Troxler BA, MHA Associate Director Sr. Leadership Adult Enterprise LEAN Redesign Team Rick Woodroof Payroll Specialist Human Resources LEAN Redesign Team Trish Zoller BS Director, HR Systems Human Resources LEAN Redesign Team Outcomes A Staffing Project Management Office (PMO) wa s initiated in July 2014 to address the myriad issues around our vacancy rate and nurse recruitment. Due to the multiple contributing factors, a multi-faceted approach was required. Between July 2014 and April 2015, the issues were clearly identifi ed, leadership support for potential solutions was obtained and training was planned. The \"bundle\" of actual interventions were implemented in April 2015. VUH total RN inpatient actual vacan cy rate as percentage of budgeted FTEs has shown a steady decrease after the interventions. 1 1EP12 Interprofessional Care EP12: Nurses assume leadership roles in collaborative interprofessional activities to improve the quality of care. Provide one example, with s upporting evidence, of a nurse-led (or nurse co-led) collaborative interprofessional quality improvement activity. Nurse Leader Co-Leads the Implementation of a Nurse-directed Pneumococcal Vaccination Protoc ol in Outpatient Clinics The Center for Disease Control reports that every year in the United States, pneumococcal disease results in thousands of infections including pneumonia, meningitis, blood stream and ear infections. Although vaccination does not guarantee infection and illness prevention for all people, pneumococcal (PNA) vaccines are effective in averting illness requiring hospitalization and possible death. Recommended for those 65 years and older, the vaccine is also advised for adults 18 years or older with conditions that weaken the immune sys tem, such as HIV infection, organ transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, and severe kidney disease. Given the CDC's guidelines, awareness of PN A vaccination as a CMS clinical quality measure, and charged with optimizing the wellness of Vanderbilt's outpatient population, the outpatient Medicine Pa tient Care Center (PCC) focused on implementation of a nurse-directed PNA protocol as a major initiative for fiscal year 2015. The current challenge facing the P CC was the absence of a standardized model for screening, administration, and documentat ion of PNA vaccination. Consequently, development and implementation of a streamlined clinical process accompanied by the ability to monitor and quantify vaccination wa s prioritized as a Medicine PCC quality improvement (QI) goal. Our lack of a standardiz ed clinical process certainly contributed to having patients who need the va ccination, not receive it. Critical stakeholders were identified and an interprofessional team (see participation grid below) began working on the protocol in early September 2014. Michelle Hasselblad, MSN, RN, NE-BC, Associate Nu rsing Officer of the Medicine PCC, co-led this initiative with Patty Wright, MD, Associate Professor Adult Medicine Infectious Diseases, Wendy Monaci, Associate Operati ng Officer of the Medicine PCC, and Jane Case, PhD, APN-NP, Director of the Medi cine Advanced Practice Providers. Michelle's initiative, collaborative leadership and direct involvement early in this project is evidenced by her drafting and dist ribution of foundati onal documents to interprofessional team members via e-mail for review and revision. (New Evidence EP12-1 Email to Co-Leaders September 2014) . Her sustained involvement and investment in project work is further validat ed by continued facilitation of team meetings for ongoing process and document review (New Evidence EP12-2 Email re Content Map October 2014) . Such collective interprofessiona l efforts resulted in the Medical 1Center Medical Board's (MCNB) fi nal approval of the protocol (New Evidence EP12-3 MCMB Protocol Approval) and a pilot was launched in November 2014. Several medical specialty clinics were sele cted for pilot implementation (nephrology, rheumatology, hypertension, pulmonary). Michelle partner ed with her PCC peers, who represented the PCC's medical, financial and advanced practice leadership, to provide rolling education and information regarding the protocol's implementation to staff, physicians and advanced practice provider s within the selected clinic settings. Additionally, each individual c linic was empowered to design its own integration process based on its unique patient population, needs, and flow . Again, Michelle's continual presence and support of prot ocol sustained implementati on and trouble shooting was apparent. Effectiveness of Implementat ion was noted by an increase in vaccination compliance rates from a baseline value of 58% in Sept ember 2014 to post implementation value of 77% by June 2015 (See graph below). Due to pilot success, PNA protocol integration was extended into Internal Medici ne and Primary Care clinic sites (New Evidence EP12- 4 Email re Expansion to Internal Med 7.7. 15; New Evidence EP12-5 Example Education PPT) Participants Name Credentials Role in Orga nization Practice Area Committee Role Michelle Hasselblad MSN, RN, NE-BC Associate Nursing Officer, Medicine PCC Medicine Patient Care Center Co-leader Patty Wright MD Medical Director, Associate Professor Infectious Diseases Adult Medicine Medicine Patient Care Center Co-leader Neeraja Peterson MD Medical Director Internal Medicine Clinics Internal Medicine clinic physician consultant Phillip Cook MMHC PCC Quality Consultant Medicine Patient Care Center Quality Consultant Wendy Monaci Associate Operating Officer Medicine Patient Care Center Co-leader Tom Ervin Financial Officer Medicine Patient Care Center Financial Consultant Jane Case PhD, APRN, FNP-BC Advanced Practice Nursing Leader Medicine Patient Care Center AP nurse leader consultant Teresa Milan BSN, RN Clinic Nurse Manager Internal Medicine clinics Internal Medicine clinic nurse 1consultant Holley Cully BSN, RN Charge Nurse Internal Medicine clinics Internal Medicine clinic nurse consultant Katie Brennan MSN, RN, NE-BC Administrative Director, Primary Care and Internal Medicine Clinics Medicine Patient Care Center Internal Medicine and Primary Care nurse consultant Michael Darden BSN, MBA, RN Administrative Director, Medical Specialty Clinics Medicine Patient Care Center Specialty Clinics nurse consultant Lynn Christman Business Manager Medical Specialty Clinics (HTN, Nephrology, Renal Transplant Rheumatology, Toxicology, Pulmonary) Business consultant Karen Gore RN Interim Nurse Manager Medical Specialty Clinics: Renal Transplant Nurse manager Medical Specialty Clinics Specialty Clinic nurse consultant Carla Sevin MD Medical Director - Pulmonology Medicine Patient Care Center Physician consultant Kim Frazier RT Respiratory Therapist Medicine Patient Care Center Pulmonary consultant Haley Rector PharmD Hospital Pharmacist VUH Project- Vaccination- 2014 Leads: Patty Wright, Michele blad, Wendy Monaci, Jane Case PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: Develop a standard model for screening, administering, and documenting Pneumococcal vaccination in the outpatient setting.

Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of an inter-professional patient education activity that was associat ed with an improved patient outcome. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Background/Problem Traditionally, Medicare pays providers for se rvices provided during a single episode or treatment course. This traditional fee- for-service approach resulted in poorly coordinated, fragmented care which rewarded quantity versus quality of service. The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), examines alternative payment and care delivery models. Under BPCI, CMS would pay agreeing organizations for multiple services received during an episode of care. With a focus on performance and financial accountability, this initiative may result in mo re cost effective, coordinated quality care. This innovative payment and care delivery model provided an opportunity for Vanderbilt nurses to actively participate and contribut e to the reengineering of care delivery and outcomes as part of an inter-professional team . As direct caregivers, nurses provide care and education to patients and their families along the entire conti nuum of care. It was theorized that the use of inter-professional collaboration in designing and delivering education and engaging t he patient/family through education from all disciplines throughout the continuum of care would show improvements in the care delivery system and render positive results on quality and patient perception of coordination of care. This ultimately would translate to affirmative and measurable human, quality and financial outcomes. In January 2014, Vanderbilt ent ered into a bundled payment arrangement with Medicare for valve replacement/repair procedures from the pre to post-operative period. In preparation for the January 2014 arrangemen t, an inter-professional team had been assembled in early 2013 to or chestrate a multi-faceted care approach to cost effective, quality care of this uni que patient population. Due to the inter-professional preparation of education materials and timing of delivery, one of the keys was that the team members could reinforce the education, monitor patient understanding and co mpliance at all junctions of t he care continuum. Examples include: Medication education and compliance Wound care 1 Use of incentive spirometer In further preparation for January 2014, in late 2013, V anderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute (VHVI) began to implement seve ral improvements in patient education and patient engagement across the continuum of care for th e valve replacement/repair patients to improve coordinat ion of care and improve qualit y for optimal outcomes. Goal Statement Decrease rate of 90 day readmissions am ong CMS valve bundle project patients by 10%. Description of Intervention/Activities A structured, evidence-based care pathway, Valve Milestone Pathway, was developed by the inter-professional team to guide t he coordination and delivery of evidence-based care and education beginning at the pre-procedure evaluation and continuing through 90 days post-procedure. Patient education and teach back were critic al components of t he pathway. It was hypothesized that the effectiveness of educ ation would be enhanced by providing small amounts of instruction at strategic time s along the care pathw ay beginning pre- operatively and continuing thr ough the recovery phase to 90 days post discharge. By embedding structured, standardized patient education, the team could provide important, relevant informati on with the appropriate materials at appropriate times. In addition, that education would be followed-up and reinforced by each team member. To support effective implementation of the pathway and all its educational components, all members of the team received focused training on the following: Valve Milestone Pathway - Team member s were trained in pathway application and documentation through a simulation e-learning module. Patient Pre-Op class instructor traini ng - Care coordinators were provided with instruction, feedback and consultation in t he development of t he valve patients' pre-op class. Based on the feedback, course flow, facilitation, visuals and course materials were updated. Patient and Family Education - T eam members completed a scenario based interactive learning module to underst and and apply best practices in patient education. Champions of Patient Education - Clin ical Staff Leaders (CSLs) completed an instructor led training to improve abiliti es to coach and assist staff with patient education challenges. The team developed and launched new and innovative patient education tools based on the Valve Milestone Pathway. In addition, documentatio n, understanding and application of the education by the patient are captured in the electronic medical record 1(EMR) for all of the team me mbers to follow, reinforce a nd move to the next phase/level of training. Examples of the new patient education tools included: Re-organized pre-op classes that util ized more visual aids and take-home materials for patient instruction A scenario based interactive patie nt education e-learning module Below are examples of the work of this inter-professional team.

Provide two examples, with supporting ev idence, of how resources are used to support evidence-based clinical decision-ma king in autonomous nursing practice. Introduction Vanderbilt places a high priority on evidence- based nursing practice and the use of that evidence to support clinical decision-making and we provide a number of readily available resources for suppor t. Examples of those re sources are listed below: Nursing Research Office Nursing Research Committee Evidence-Based Practice & Nursing Research website o https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vum c.php?site=evidencebasedpractice Evidence-Based Nursing Prac tice (EBNP) Fellowship Writing for Publication workshops Evidence-based clinical librarians are available through electronic request to assist the clinical nursing staff in literature searches and can also complete evidence searches for immediate pat ient treatment decision needs. The Clinical Work Stations (CWS) - electronic documentation system computers - throughout the units and clinics and in some areas in each patient's room house a number of easily accessible marked websites (icons) in addition to supporting search functions. o Mosby's - our one on-line resource for nursing practice and procedures - provides evidence-based practice reco mmendations and is continuously updated to ensure current evidence is used o ZYNX - a proprietary product that provides an evidence-based plan of care, with direct links to the evidence o Up-To-Date o MD Consult o Direct link to our medical library for searching in Medline, CINAHL and other databases such as Cochrane, with access to the librarians for assistance EP14a-1 Screenshot Library A-Z Database Access Clinical Practice Committee and Clinica l Policy and Practice Committee - all clinical policies, protocols, etc. are required to have supporting evidence Department of Quality, Safety & Risk Pr evention (QSRP) provides consultative services and also supports SciHealth - a portal that houses data such as nurse-sensitive quality indicators, infection ra tes, other quality dat a and administrative data, such as hours per patient day, etc. Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW) - repository for electronic data that can be mined 1 A number of internal specialt y consultants that are readily available to the clinical staff; including, but not limited to: advanced practice nur ses, infection prevention nurses, wound/ostomy nurses, nurs ing quality consultants, etc. Research Support Services (RSS) - provi des assistance for all steps throughout any research process Institutional Review Board (IRB) Consulta tion Services - assists all investigators in the full IRB process Example a Psychiatric Hospital Clin ical Nurses Use Evidence to Develop Groups that Cater to a Geriatric Population Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital's (VPH) Adult 3 program's scope of service includes providing acute psychiatric/mental health inpa tient treatment for patients diagnosed with mood disorders, as well as a geriatric componen t. The provision of care for the geriatric population has required progr am development and staff investment. Along with advocating for needed resources for the deliv ery of quality care for the geriatric population, clinical nurses have been instrument al in utilizing evidence to guide their autonomous practice. Through the unit's ger iatric task force, nurses have utilized evidence to develop psycho-educational groups t hat cater to the specific needs of the geriatric population. During the first quarter of 2014, the Adult 3 clinical staff developed tools that are instrumental in providing quality programming for group content for the geriatric population. Clinical staff at VPH have full access to our Eskind Biomedical Libr ary (EBL) from the Clinical Work Stations, which is the hub of Vanderbilt University Medical Center's (VUMC) information services and resources. The EBL provides access to materials to support patient care, healthcare education, and biomedical research missions of VUMC. The EBL provides an extensive digital librar y of electronic journal s, books, databases and other resources, in addition to over 200,000 print volumes. Additionally, VPH clinical staff have access to an in-house nursing library which houses volumes specific to the care of psychiatric/mental health pat ients, and psychiatric/mental health nursing. Meredith Melvin, BSN, RN-BC and the geriatr ic task force conducted a literature review to develop group content that was evidence-bas ed, and would meet the varied needs of geriatric patients with multiple diagnoses on the Adult 3 unit (i.e., dementia, anxiety, depression, Parkinson's disease).

Needs were identified by clinical staff that included minimal opportunities for physical exercise for the geriatric pati ents, as well as an observed reluctance of the geriatric patients to attend the unit's cu rrent group offerings targeted for the entire unit. The creation of a movement group was devel oped by Meredith and the geriatric task force. Evidence supported t he multiple benefits associated with increasing daily activity for the elderly. Meredith c oordinated and summarized the findi ngs from the literature to outline the movement group cont ent, while working in parallel with the geriatric task force and Dr. William Petrie, the physician chair of the geriatric task force. Initiation of the movement group was approached by encouraging buy-in from the geriatric patients by pointing out the posit ives that the group a fforded (i.e., healthy coping skills, increased physical activity, in creased independence with activities of daily living (ADL), and improved emotional and physical well-being). The group was incorporated into the unit's schedule at specific times in order to provide for convenience and readiness of the patients to attend and participate actively.

They responded well to the concept of targeted group content that supported the addition of increased physical activity into each day. Added benefits of this group work included ease of incorporation into daily programming, little to no resource requirements by way of extra staff or equipment, and applicability for patients with varying diagnoses. Clinical nurses also observed that the benefits experienced by pat ients within the group could be offered as reminders for them throughout their hospitalization relating to healthy coping skills and other gains that were attained by increasing physical activity during each day. Patient participat ion increased by both attendance and engagement within the group. The group was found to be easily modifiable for patients with physical limitations or special n eeds. EP14a-2 Email fr om Manager re: re: Email Movement Points VPH Geriatric Program 4/7 Meredith's structuring of t he movement group included consi deration of the results of evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials on the influence of exercise intervention for older adults. Arnold, Sran, and Harrison (2008) indicate that as part of a systematic review, seventeen of nineteen st udies found positive effects for patients overall, in relation to either group or individual strength/ba lance focused training. In addition, there were improvements in fall risk factors that were measured. Meredith considered chair exercise components as par t of the group in relation to her findings from research by Galantino et al. (2012) who piloted a study that found the use of chair yoga exercise sessions for elderly adults were both feasible and safe with respect to an exercise interventional program for the older adult. These fi ndings were instrumental for the work group in consideration of pati ents with limitations. Guided breathing, 1stretching, flexion and extension were all pa rts of the movement portion of the group which targeted exercises for patients who were mobile and for those with physical limitations. Meredith considered findings associated with research by Schrack, Simonsick, and Ferrucci (2010) who examined the relations hip that physical activity, walking independently, and mobility have on preser ving muscle mass, quality of life, and reducing comorbidities. With the realization that voluntar y aerobic activity helps to sustain endurance, strength, and capacity, she incorporated discussion into the group activity which included the identification of ways to increase movement activities during the course of each day. Oppor tunities to improve cardiova scular health, strength, and endurance were points of reference for t he group discussion. Additionally, the physiological and psychological benefits of ex ercise were planned as discussion points. Underscored during the group was that evidenc e supports that exercise can improve balance and mobility functioning, as well as r educe the likelihood of falls for older adults (Shumway-Cook, Gruber, Baldwin, & Liao, 1997). When the clinical nursing st aff are conducting the exer cise groups they have the information and the outline that Meredith prepared for the groups. The nurses can then target each patient in the group if they need modi fied exercise or special instruction. In addition, as they work with the patients on a daily basis, they can heighten the patient's awareness of how to work more exercise into their daily routines. Meredith's research and group exercise outline as approved by the physicians provides the support for autonomous practice.

(2010) adults and to present an updated synthesis of outcome measures for assessment of fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the safety and feasibility of structured yoga in an elderly population with fall risk. The capacity to walk independently is a central component of independent living. Numerous large and well-designed longitudinal studies have shown that gait speed, a reliable marker of mobility, tends to decline with age and as a consequence of chronic disease. This study hypothesized that a functional participants over age 50. Preliminary research of a chair yoga based program in an assisted living community among 80-90 year old seniors.

A variety of studies have shown that exercise increases balance and quality of life for seniors [1], [2], [3], [4].

Evidence utilized to incorporate chair exercise as part of the considerations for a movement group specific for geriatric patients. Incorporated these findings into group discussions of the evidence behind the need for daily physical activity in order to promote 1 Shumway-Cook, A., Gruber, w., Baldwin, M., & liao, S. (1997) decline of available energy induces the decline in customary walking speed with aging and disease. This prospective clinical investigation examined the effects of a multidimensional exercise program on balance, mobility, and risk for falls in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falling availability. An associated aim was to understand factors that affect these energy constructs in order to help explain why older persons tend to have a low fatigability threshold. The purpose was to identify new targets for disability prevention in older individuals. A total of 105 community-dwelling older adults (> or = 65 years of age) with a history of two or more falls in the previous 6 months (no neurologic diagnosis) participated. They were classified into lacked groups specific to movement for the geriatric population. VPH lacked groups c as it represents the ability of the individual to complete activities of daily life. Findings suggest that, with older age, energy availability declines, and energy needs for independent living increase. The relationship between physical activity and mobility indicates that these changes may be modifiable through maintaining or increasing physical activity in adulthood and late life to preserve muscle mass and quality, and reduce mobility, independence, and quality of life. This evidence was incorporated into talking points within the group to emphasize that exercise can improve balance and mobility function, as well as decrease the fall risks often 1(1) a control group of fallers (n = 21), (2) a fully adherent exercise group (n = 52), and (3) a partially adherent exercise group (n = 32). specific to movement for the geriatric population. comorbidities. Both exercise groups scored better than the control group on all measures of balance and mobility. Although both exercise groups showed a reduction in fall risk compared with the control group, the greatest reduction associated with older adults. 1was found in the fully adherent exercise group. Factors associated with successful response to exercise included degree of adherence to exercise program and pretest score on the Tinetti Mobility Assessment. Exercise can improve balance and mobility function and reduce the likelihood for falls among community-dwelling older adults with a history of falling. The amount of exercise needed to achieve these results, however, could not be determined 1from this study. Additional References: 1. Schmid AA, Van Puymbroeck M, Koceja DM.

Example b Vanderbilt Center for Women's Health Develops an Evidence-Based Education Program for Patients with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Background Fetal macrosomia complicates up to fifty percent of pregnancies in women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). Due to a higher body fat percentage, thicker skin folds, and greater shoulder circ umference, a macrosomic fe tus experiences higher rates of shoulder dystocia and birth trauma. Mater nal morbidity is also adversely affected due to an increased risk of cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, birth trauma, and shoulder dystocia. Aware of the higher rate of macrosomia in women with untreated GDM, the nurses at Vanderbilt's Center for Wom en's Health wanted to provi de patient-focused education and support to these expectant GDM patient s. Creating an educational program based upon a strong, evidence-based f oundation would support optimal health of women with GDM while decreasing the incidence of fe tal macrosomia; ultimately, decreasing maternal and fetal complications. Example 1Supported by physician partners and nursing leadership, clinical nurse Holly Rickets, BSN, RN, EFM, and dietician Becky Gregory, RD, created an evidence-based program to empower GDM patients to embrace and engage in optimal self-care activities. Most importantly, they recognized that individual assessment of each patient's needs and customization of educational approach and content would be the key. Access to professional literatur e and other resources was and continues to be instrumental in the program's development and ongoing refinement and supports practice autonomy to assure and sustain patient-centered care. Using clinical judgment guided by current evi dence and clinical practice guidelines, this team modified education and hea lth coaching to meet the individual needs of each woman. Following an indi vidual needs assessment, sta ff draw upon a number of resources to tailor teaching material s to support understanding, self-care, and independence. Patient handouts have been developed that reflect thoughtful review and effective collation of relevant in formation from multiple resources. Internal and external literature resources are also readily ava ilable from VUMC's clinical and administrative work stati ons. For example, Mosby Nursing Consult and Skills and Up-to-Date are incorporated into and easily accessible while in a patient's electronic health record, \" Star Panel \". EP14b-1 Resources via EHR Most importantly, patients also experience benefits of this ready access. Utilization of laptop computers during the GDM group classes allow the team real-tim e access to internal VUMC references through Eskind Biomedical Library's ext ensive databases, as well as Krames On- Demand patient education is evidence-based. EP14b-2 Krames Patient Education; EP14b-3 materials provi ded by well-known and recognized external experts, such as the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, American Dietetic Association, and National Diabetes Education Progra m are also frequently utilized. Clinical practice guidelines from two national organizations , Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Nutrition Practice Guidelines 2008 and the American Diabetes Association's Guidelines for Pregnancy currently guide the center's care of women with GDM to assure best practice and optimal maternal and fetal outcomes. Becky Gregory, RD is an active member of the Na tional Committee for the Academ y of Nutrition and Dietetics that advises and compiles the organi zation's practice guidelines. Additional resources employed through natio nal professional organizations include: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol ogists Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses and American Academy of Pediatrics. Current editions of the textbooks, \"Pregnancy: A New Life Handbook\" , and \"Telephone Triage for Obstetrics & Gynecology\" also serve as vital information reserves for the center's team and are available at the clinical site. 1In summary, convenient and readily available evidence-based resources provide the GDM nurse team members the flexibility and practice aut onomy to personalize written instructions and guidance for diet, exer cise and self-care behaviors. Such individualization and patient-centered approac h empowers self-care and independence, supports adherence and, ultimately, renders pos itive maternal and neonatal outcomes. EP14b-4 Taking Glyburide During Pregnancy Evidence In addition to previously submitted refer ences, the following evidence-based resources were used in autonomous nursing practice for the clinical assessment, planning, and implementation of care for gestational diabetic patients during group sessions and one-on-one counseling conducted by Holly Rickets, BSN, RN, EFM, clinical nurse.

Example a Clinical Nurse Autonomy Application of the nurse-driven disc ontinuation protocol in the SICU reduces CAUTI to zero The Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), loca ted on the ninth floor of the critical care tower at Vanderbilt University Medical Center is a 34-bed intensive care unit specializing in surgical patients, includi ng transplantation, thoracic, general, and head and neck surgery. Many patients in the SICU require invasive devices for monitoring and treatment. As part of an institutional initia tive to reduce catheter-associ ated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), a nurse-driven disc ontinuation protocol was implemented in April 2014. No change was seen in the frequency of catheter use or the rate of CAUT I for the first six months after implementation. Feedback fr om nursing staff suggested that despite nurses' willingness to adapt to a nurse-driven protocol, there was hesitation noted in discontinuing catheters and a trend of reinserting cat heters more quickly than suggested in the protocol. EP16a-1 Nurs e Driven Foley Removal Protocol; EP16a-2 Guidelines for Management of Indwelling Catheters In March 2013, prior to the nurse-driv en protocol, a unit based protocol had been implemented for providers as well as the es tablishment of a CAUTI task force which included many of the same discontinuation goals and replacem ent considerations. This was challenging to implement du e to a constant turnover in physician staffing and newer advanced practice providers. As a continuous presence in the SICU, the nurses were identified as crucial to t he success of such specific catheter guidelines and were empowered to utilize the nurse-driven protocol. A unit-based quality improvement team 1worked with the clinical nurses to improve compliance with the protocol, encouraging autonomous application of the di scontinuation protocol bas ed on nursing assessment. EP16a-3 SICU PI Meeting Minutes January 2014 Once the knowledge and applic ation gap of the recently launched hospital-wide nurse- driven Foley discontinuation protocol was acknowledged with nursing staff and SICU house staff, multiple efforts were made to re inforce the protocol. Education was sent out to all nursing staff via weekly newslette rs, charge nurses began intentional, daily rounds on all patients on the unit that had Foley catheters, and bedside nurses began presenting the status of t heir patients' Foley cathet ers and whether they met discontinuation criteria during daily interp rofessional rounds. House staff received education regarding the protocol via presentations in leadership focused discussions during monthly Performance Im provement Committee meetings. New residents rotating through the SICU were given education on the nurse-driven protocol as well.

Thes e professional practice groups develop practice improvements that l ead to autonomy in nursing prac tice and for patient care. The following is an example of a nurse recogni zed problem where they took the lead in creating a solution. The autonomous practice of the nurses involved in the pediatric sedation service enabled them to see an organization-wide problem. And resolve it through the governance process. Autonomous practice At Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV), th e pediatric sedation service provides sedation for minor procedur es outside of the operating room using an advanced practice nurse sedation consult serv ice. This nursing team is recognized as an expert resource for sedation care by hos pital administrators, physician and nursing 250270290310330350370390 Jul15 Aug Days (6 month moving average)Number of CAUTI EventsSICU Discontinuation Protocol CAUTIs and Device Days Preintervention Post intervention July 2013 - August 2015 1leaders. With this recognition and responsib ility, the sedation team is empowered to begin problem solving with multiple care providers, and to develop a sedation coordination of care team. In order to define the most effi cient process for planning this care, there was collaboration with anesthesia, pediatric surgical, medical, procedural, scheduling and admitting services in per ioperative and radiology departments. The role of the nurse-driven pediatric sedat ion team is well respected within MCJCHV and thus provides the team with the autonomy and flexibility to create solutions influencing care in multiple departments. Ongoing documentat ion and reporting of patient outcomes with the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium (PSRC) serves to establish the team's reputation for excellence in patient safety. The PSRC is a sedation research network administered through the Society for Pediatric Sedation (SPS) with greater than forty member institutions entering sedation outcome data into a single database. Reports can be generated that prov ide an analysis of the data submitted by the pediatric sedation team at MCJCHV. Th is allows for comparison of the team's patient care outcomes with participating in stitutions. This benchmarking has drawn attention to the team's personalized approac h to sedation care that produces better outcomes for children and their families. One critical function of the team includes ma naging consults from multiple patient care areas, including procedural and diagnostic imagi ng departments. Ea ch sedation consult is reviewed, triaged and coordinated into the most appropriate and readily available sedation resource: the deep sedation servic e, moderate sedation general anesthesia, or pediatric cardiac anesthesia. Interdisciplinary evidence-based protocols identify referral criteria and also guide sedation planning and documentation of the expected standard of care. This pr ocess is designed to increase patient access to procedures and imaging requiring sedat ion and to improve communication and coordination of services fo r the requesting providers. Problem identified Procedural and diagnostic pr ocedures were being planned by schedulers from multiple subspecialties, leading to fragmented, uncoordinated care. For patients, this meant multiple trips to the hospital for two separ ate sedations and procedures or imaging. This also resulted in two separate fasti ng periods, two separate intravascular access attempts, two intubations and two anesthetic exposures. In the past, hospital providers and nursing teams would recognize that patients were scheduled for more than one sedated procedure, such as an MRI and a minor surgery, often withi n the same month, but this was discovered too late to coordinate the care. To decrease risk for patients, a team, led by the sedation nurse practitioner, was developed to coordinate a team effort to proactively plan for all requested imaging and surgical procedures to be sequenced and completed in one visit. Participants: Jill Kinch, Betsy Beazley, BSN, RN, CP N - Pediatric IV Team Lea Ann Bowden, MSN, RN, APN-NP - Sedation Team Candace C. Galbreath, Denise Sadler, Sedation Team Beth Bass, MSN, RN, APN-NP - PATCH Team Sarah Hill, MSN, RN, APN-NP - PATCH Team Jason Willis, MSN, RN, APN-NP - PATCH Team Process for the organization wide improvement identified To define the process, t he nurse leader of the sedation team debriefed with stakeholders and reviewed a number of ear ly cases that could have benefited from coordinated sedation care and three key issues were identified. First, communication flow and a clear process needed to be established to support the team work. Second, an informatics access point for coordination and accountability for the plan was also necessary. Finally, identifying team leader s for aligning resources and scheduling was also essential for success. This wa s an iterative proce ss and required ongoing communication to achieve a well-coordi nated team approach. Bringing key stakeholders together to debrie f was the most efficient form of designing and re- designing the process. For each combined care request, once arrangements for all of the requested procedures and imaging is sequenced and t entatively scheduled to allow for one anesthetic, nursing engages the family in t he opportunity to have the two procedures and/or imaging performed with one single anesthetic. If th e family agrees with the proposed plan of care, the confirmed pl an is shared with the lead anesthesia physicians, surgeons, perioperative and radiology nursing team s, and surgical schedulers by saving the patient's plan to a web-based coordination of care list that can be accessed by all inter-professional team mem bers. Additionally, the individualized sedation/anesthesia coordination of care plan is saved to the patient's medical record. This last step authorizes the schedulers to finalize appointments in the radiology, perioperative and operating room locations. Positive outcomes include both significant patient/family satisf action with the approach and better understanding of best practice for sequencing and planning coordinated anesthetic care. Families of children requi ring combined care procedures can now expect a well-executed hospital experienc e through the nurses working on their behalf to improve the nursing pr actice autonomy and improve patient/family satisfaction. Confirmation of improved patient and family satisfaction are evidenced by responses to our patient satisfaction su rvey (IRB # 120682). 1This important culture change would not have been possible without the strong partnership between the nurse practitioner leader and the anesthesiologist leader Dr. Jill Kilkelly. Dr. Kilkelly was instrumental in t he adoption of these changes by the rest of the anesthesiology team and the surgeons through education on the importance of coordinating care. The advanced practice nurses and the clinical staff had organizational support and autonomy to coordinat e the many details required to develop the care plans and provide communicati on and education to staff and families. One of the other driving fact ors was the enthusiasm of the family members; they were instrumental in motivating all team members to \"get on board\" and make the extra effort to continue this process. This is an excellent example of how a culture was changed empowering families, patients and nursing to improve care of children. Families shared their impressions of their experience with this program: \"I am extremely pleased with the co mmunication level and the compassion shown in trying to coordinate these pr ocedures. My child does not handle anesthesia well and it helped my peace of mind knowing that this was going to be a one-time anesthesia.\" Parent described the coordinat ion of care as \"lifesaving\" for her autistic child. \"It decreased my child's aggression and anxiety.\" \"Improved my child's safety\" \"With him being 2 years old we wanted to limit his exposure to anesthesia\" \"Appreciate the opportunity for multiple procedures in the same day since we live so far away\" EP16b-1 Complex Coordinati on of Care - Rules of the Road; EP1 6b-2 Complex Coordination of Care Request Form; EP16b-3 October 6, 2014 Sedation Monthly Meeting Agenda; EP16b-4 May 4, 2015 Sedation Team Monthly Meeting Agenda 1EP17 Ethics, Privacy, Securi ty, and Confidentiality EP17: Nurses use available resources to a ddress ethical issues related to clinical practice and organizational ethical situations. Provide one example, wit h supporting evidence, of nurses using available resources to address ethical issues related to clinical practice. Ethical Issue Related to Clinical Practice Background The Center for Biomedical Ethics and Societ y provides a Clinical Ethics Consultation Service (CECS) for all of Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) to assist with the resolution of ethical concerns through education and advisory relationships. Any member of the VUMC faculty and staff, as well as all pat ients, their surrogates, and family members can request a clinical ethics cons ultation. A clinical ethics consultant is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The center has an excellent website (http://medicineandpublicheal th.vanderbilt.edu/cbmes/) that is available 24/7 and is located on the home page with t he pager number clearly displayed. The ethics consult service can also be reached by calling the V anderbilt Operator. In addition, the center is linked on the nursing website. The primary goals of the CECS are: to elevate patient care by addressing ethical concerns. to improve the process of deliberat ion about important healthcare decisions. to enhance mediation of conflicts by bringing someone from the \"outside\". to reduce the moral distress of st aff members, patients and families. An RN, MD and PhD faculty who have extensive experience working toward solutions that are respectful and acceptable to all the pa rties involved staff the consult service. All clinical ethics consultations incorporat e the following fundamental objectives: 1. To promote careful, respectful comm unication among VUMC faculty, staff and patients and their surrogates and family members. 2. To assist in identifying and clarifying ethical questions and broader ethical issues in clinical care. 3. To advise on ethical questions as they arise in specific patients' care, with a focus on reasonable treatment options, a ssociated outcomes, and the patients' rights and best interests. As this service is available to all members of the healthcare team, the CECS provides nurses with the tools and resources to seek out assistance with ethical issues. As part of nurse resident orientation, Joseph B. Fanning, PhD, Director of the Clinical Ethics Consultation Service, teaches nurse residents about the CECS program, as well as what to expect if a consult is generated. He presents examples from clinical practice, demonstrating to the nurse residents how nurse s in the institution apply the CECS to 1practice. He empowers and encourages nurses to speak up, providing examples of reasons to call as well as common excuses staff report for not ca lling the CECS. EP17- 1 PowerPoint for Nurse 2014-2015 data, 20.5% of CECS consults were requested by nurses in the organization. EP17-2 Ethics Consult Numbers Example The Neuro ICU at Vanderbilt University Hospit al (VUH) specializes in providing critical care to adult patients with brain tumors, stroke s, and diseases of the brain that require surgery. As a Comprehensive Stroke Center , they provide top-level care and unique services to give patients the best chance at recovery. Their excell ence in patient care was recognized at the unit level in 2014 when they were awarded the AACN Beacon Award and the Professiona l Research Consultants, Inc. Excellence in Healthcare award for Overall Quality of Care. The unit is one of the largest neuro ICUs in the country with 22 ICU beds and 12 step-down level beds. Seeing a variety of critical patients with neurological deficiencies affords the team multiple opportuniti es for the utilization of the Clinical Ethics Consultation Service at Vanderbilt. Stephanie Williams Keisling, BS N, RN started in the nurse residency program in 2010, working on a general inpatient floor in Medical Center No rth. EP17-3 Nurse Residency Workshops/Attendance/Ethics #6 (Stephanie Willia ms) In 2012, she transitioned to the Neuro ICU. Stephanie noted t hat she learned about the CECS through her nurse residency training. In July of 2014, Stephanie cared for a 77-ye ar-old patient with neurologic devastation following a stroke. Upon arrival to the N euro ICU, his prognosis was determined to be very poor, and the palliative care service was quickly consulted to help the family understand the condition and prov ide comfort measures. O ne week after admission, a do not resuscitate (DNR) order was obtained fo r the patient for irreversible neurological condition and imminent death. After th is DNR order was obtained, Stephanie became very concerned that despite palliative care 's efforts to communicate the patient's prognosis and impending death, the family was insisting t hat the medical team continue with aggressive life sustaini ng measures despite the pa tient's impending death. Although they had consented to the DNR order, they still wanted to press forward with other aggressive measures. There was further concern that the family's difficulty in accepting the prognosis and cont inuing aggressive treatment would actually harm the patient by prolonging his dying process. Due to these concerns, Stephanie paged the CECS to have them consult on this case. The CECS team was able to speak with t he patient's medical team and review the patient's medical records to better understand t he concerns. It was identified that the family needed additional support to guide decisions, assist in understanding, and help them come to terms th at additional life sustaining meas ures were not going to help their loved one recover. 1The CECS found that the patient was a chur ch elder and recommended a visit from the chaplain to the family to provide addition al support. The Chaplain was able to spend time talking with each family member indi vidually and helped pr ovide grief support during the dying process. The CECS team worked with this family to build trust and helped guide their difficult decision of transit ioning their loved one to comfort care. The next day, the medical team was able to com passionately extubate the patient, provide comfort medications and the patient was abl e to die with comfort and dignity. In addition, the CECS team invo lvement assisted in supporting the caregivers who were experiencing a great deal of compassion fa tigue and moral distress in caring for this patient.

Provide two examples, with supporting ev idence, of improved workplace safety for nurses resulting from the safety stra tegy of the organization. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Example a Background/Problem The nursing staff approached nursing leadership to explain that patient transfer equipment was not readily ava ilable to meet the needs of patients within Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital (VPH). This was a re sult of recommendations made in the Adult 3 unit board. Nursing staff and the manager r eached out to nursing administration and nursing education in VPH to explore options relative to the procurement of patient transfer devices that could be located wit hin VPH. They also explored additional training that would support the medical c enter's safety strategies with the Smooth Moves Program to eliminate staff injuries rela ted to patient handling. With the addition of a geriatric service line within the Adult 3 program's scope of service, and an increase in the number of medically acute pat ients, staff indicated that patient transfer devices were necessary in order to optimize care and avoid staff injury. Nursing staff were anecdotally noting an increase number of injuries among their colleagues. Upon working with the Director of Patient Hand ling it was determined t hat in 2011 there was an injury rate of 0.369/10,000 bed days with an almost double rate of 0.707/per 10,000 bed days by 2013. Not only are nursing staff injuries costly to a health care organization, they have the potential to be career ending. Vanderbilt is commi tted to staff safety, which is frequently directly linked to patient safety. Theref ore, even a small number of injuries is unacceptable. Goal Statement Decrease the rate of register ed nurse (RN) injuries relat ed to patient transfer through training and smooth moves equipment availability. The measure selected to demons trate improvement was VPH's annual rate of RN injury (rate per 10,000 bed days) related to patient transfer. Description of the Intervention A patient transfer device (Maximove) was obtained through the assistance of Mamie Williams, MSN, RN, APN-NP, NE-BC, Director of Safe Pa tient Handling for Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). 1 The device was introduced at the unit level in Ma y of 2014, by the identification of safe patient handling nursing champions who att ended training in order to educate additional staff. This training was t hen expanded to include opportunities for clinical staff house- wide to attend. To date, the Maximove is readily availabl e to trained staff throughout VPH. Additional safe patient handling champions have been i dentified and have received training in order to continue with education for staff related to the safe use of the device. Safe patient handling/transfer is an addition to the annual staff competency program required for all VPH clinical employees. As part of a simultaneous effort to improve accessibility to patient transfer resources, a product already in place was made more ava ilable to staff on each unit. The safe and effective use of slippery sheets for latera l patient transfer is reviewed upon hire and annually as part of competency requirements. The sheets were added to par levels of supplies on each unit for ease of accessibility for staff.

Example b Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health care Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommend that all U.S. Health care workers get vaccinated annually against influenza. T he definition of health care wo rker is broad and includes a comprehensive list of staff from physicians and nurses to volunteers. Historically and in the early season of 2014-15, nurses are not at the top of the lis t for compliance with annual influenza vaccination co verage. The highest was pha rmacists, and nurses were fifth in line. CDC also states that early season flu vaccination was higher among health care personnel whose employers required or recommended that they be vaccinated, compared to those whose employer did not have a policy or recommendation regarding flu vaccination. Vanderbilt had experienced exactly what the CDC was reporting. Historically, nurses had not been at the top of the list in per centage of nurses receiving flu vaccinations and there was no mandate for immunization. 1Vanderbilt admits a large volume of patients with influenza each year, both adults and pediatrics. In addition, once one staff member contracts the flu, it can spread rather quickly throughout the organization. Vanderbilt has had a safety strategy to increase the numbers of employees vaccinated for the last couple of years. Of particular importance is the clin ical hands-on staff. Goal Increase the number of clinical nurses in our clinics (outpatient ar eas) that receive the influenza vaccination. Interventions When we explored with the clinical nurses the barriers to receiving flu vaccinations, one of the major concerns was accessibi lity. Even with designated influenza days and roving Occupational Health \"immunization ca rts\", clinical nurses believed that their major issue was being able to receive the vaccine on their units and in their clinics. In particular the issue with our vast numbers of clinics, both on-campus and off-campus was a challenge. In July 2013, the Peer Vaccinat ion Program (PVP) wa s started for units and clinics. The purpose is to make the flu vaccine more acce ssible to Vanderbilt nurses where they can receive the vaccine without leaving their clin ical work areas. Peer vaccinators were selected by their managers and were trained in the administration of the vaccine and the Occupational Health electronic influenza vaccination tracking system. That first season, over 1,300 flu vaccines were given via the PVP. With each flu season the PVP has become st ronger. In the beginn ing, areas had to order their flu vaccine doses from the phar macy. Now to increase accessibility and ease for the clinical staff, Occupational Heal th delivers the vaccine to the clinical areas. The PVP is particularly important to our clin ics as many of them are small with a limited number of staff for coverage and the large number that are off the main campus and in surrounding counties. July may seem to be an early \"start\" dat e for influenza vaccinations; however, our employee volume presents quite a cha llenge. Getting the PVP staff trained and oriented in an early time-frame was extremely important. Agai n, extremely important to our clinics as they are in multiple locations . The clinic staff embraced this concept and had a large number of PVP duri ng the initial roll-out of this program. This was instrumental in increasing t he percentage of flu vaccinations in the clinic areas.

Background The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a ninety-eight bed in tensive care unit in three separate locations withi n the medical center; with t he largest number of beds and main location being Monroe Carell Jr. Children' s Hospital at Vanderbilt (MCJCHV). The average daily census in the NICU is eighty-seven babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk becau se it has been shown to protect against respiratory illnesses, ear infe ctions, gastrointestinal diseases, allergies and asthma. Therefore, the NICU s upports and encourages mothers to pr ovide breast milk for their babies. When first admitted to the NICU, most babies ar e not stable enough to breastfeed or to be given breast milk, ther efore mothers are encouraged to express breast milk (EBM) and the EBM is then stored in commercial deep freezers in the unit until the baby is stable and ready to feed. Each patient has a basket or bin in the freezer identified with their spec ific patient information where t heir milk is stored until it is ready for use. In November 2012, clinical nursing staff in conjunction with nursing leadership did a deep review of the safety practices in t he NICU. The nursing staff became concerned when the number of breast milk errors began to increase. The NICU, as well as the rest of the country, was seeing an increase in breastfeeding rates due to increased education and awareness of th e benefits of breastfeeding. This increase in the breastfeeding rate also increased the number of opportunities for breast milk errors to occur. At this time, the NICU had an aver age of 70% of patients receiving breast milk feeds. On any given day, an average of si xty babies was receiving eight feedings per day, equating to nearly five hundred daily enc ounters when breast milk identification errors could potentially occur. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other serious infectious diseases can be transmitted through breast milk and there is a risk of death. Therefore, it was identified that the recent trend in in creased breast milk errors was a significant risk to the patient and should be focused on pr omptly. Proactive measures were needed to decrease this risk and prevent errors. In a ddition, this was just for the NICU. Across MCJCHV, EBM is stored and used by parents fo r their infants, al most doubling the risk for errors on a daily basis. The overall Pe diatric Quality Committee considered this a significant risk with no room for errors. The increasing numbers continued to increase the risk of errors, which was not acceptabl e to the organization. Plans began to address this issue across the organization based on what was successful in the NICU. 1 The NICU initiated a two person bedside identifi cation check prior to each infant feeding on Nov 21, 2012. However, even with this pr actice in place, breast milk errors continued to occur. EBM was sometimes given to a patient prior to the nurse performing a double check of the patient's identific ation and matching this to the label on the breast milk bottle. It was also noted that improvement in breast milk errors would occur for a few months, but the improvement could not be sustained for longer than 3-4 months at a time. Goal Statement The NICU will decrease the number of breast milk errors to zero and sustain this improvement for 12 mont hs in a row. Description of Interventions/Activities Following a breast milk error in November 2014, the leadership team decided to focus interventions on sustainment initiatives to not only help reduce the number of breast milk errors but to sustain this improvement past the historical 4 month relapse period. The leadership team met with clinical nursi ng staff and medical receptionists to discuss the multi-step processes involved from the time a family delivers breast milk to the staff until the time breast milk is prepared for t he baby's feeding. The NICU team believed that families should be a part of the solution and parents we re asked to be partners in this improvement process. By December 2014 the following interventions were in place: Signage placed throughout the unit and hospita l as well as in family admission packets asking parents to partner with us as part of their baby 's healthcare team. Printed information was placed inside eac h bag of breast milk bottles and was provided to each parent. This printed mate rial explained the process that would be followed with each of the baby's feedings and asked for the parent's assistance and cooperation. As their baby's advocate, it emphasized their role in ensuring that proper steps are taken to properly identify breast milk. Medical receptionists printed patient labels for babies' bottles and had parents check, verify for accuracy, and sign the labels prior to distributing them. Medical receptionists a nd care partners performed two person freezer checks to ensure the breast milk is in the co rrect patient bins in the freezer. Weekly EBM freezer audits were conducted by the Clinical Staff Leaders Process was implemented that required a double check with a second individual if EBM is removed from the original bottle and placed into another bottle for mixing to ensure that the correct label is placed on the new bottle Process was implemented requiring a se cond person check, including at least one licensed personnel, prior to taking breast milk into a patient room and prior to mixing breast milk with fortifiers Updated Expressed Breast Milk policy to include specific checks that need to be completed prior to feeding the breast milk to the patient Participants 1Name Credentials Role in Organization Practice Area Role on Committee/Group/Work/etc. Marlee Crankshaw Wood Leadership Team Stephanie Abbu Business Manager NICU/NBN Leadership Team Christy Team Jenny Cotton BSN, RN Educator NICU/NBN Participant Nancy Kennedy Medical Receptionist NICU Participant William Dingman Medical Receptionist NICU Participant Carol Huber RN Lactation Consultant NICU Participant Addie Vienneau BA Manager, Family Resource Center MCJCHV Participant Outcome Based on historical data, the NICU was unabl e to sustain improvement in breast milk error prevention beyond a 3-4 month period. However, the NICU team believed that if families could be a part of the solution and they engaged in the process, the NICU could be successful in sustaining this improvement for a longer period of time. The clinical staff nurses, in conjunction with the NICU leadership team partnered with families and implemented a 2-phase intervention to target family participation in both the expressed breast milk (EBM) bottle label ing and the patient identif ication processes of EBM administration at the critical 4 month-post error juncture. The first intervention was implemented in March 2015 with the focus on correct patient labeling. During this phase, the medical receptionists engaged families by asking the parent to check, verify fo r accuracy, and sign the printed patient labels prior to distributing them for use on EBM bottles. The second intervention involving family partnership was implemented in June 2015 and focused on correct patient identification. During this phase, the families were engaged by involving them as one of the two 1required sources of the 2-person double check needed to either tr ansfer EBM from an original bottle to a new bottle following mixing , to enter a patient r oom with EBM, or to mix the EBM with a fortifier. After the implementation of these interventions, the NICU has continued to monitor progress toward zero breast milk erro rs. The NICU has shown improvement in sustaining a zero erro r rate longer than the previous 3-4 month time frame. Errors were identified in January 2016 and Ap ril 2016. The NICU team took immediate steps to review these errors to identify the underlying causes and take action to prevent future occurrences. Although these two errors occurred, it was determined that the interventions implemented in March and June of 2015 were still being closely practiced. The NICU remains committed to monitoring th is process and ensuring patients in the NICU are free from the harm of pot ential breast milk errors. Due to the interventions implemented by t he NICU nurses for breast milk verification processes, the NICU has experienced a sustained decrease in breast milk errors. This decrease in errors has continued for 12 months. 1 Predata Postdata 1EP20EO Culture of Safety EP20EO: Clinical nurses are involved in the review, action planning and evaluation of patient safety da ta at the unit level. Provide two examples, with supporting evidence, of an improvement in patient safety that resulted from clinical nurses' involvement in the evaluation of patient safety data at the unit level. Supporting evidence must be su bmitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Example a Staff Education \"Blitz\" to reduce CL ABSI occurrence in the PCICU. Background The Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PCICU), located on the fifth floor of MCJCHV, is an 18-bed intensive care unit fo r children with congenital or acquired heart disease. Due to a high number of device (v entilators, central venous catheters, foley catheters) days, hospital-acqui red infections have been an im portant quality metric that the PCICU tracks and displays publicly via a board in the unit displaying days between infections. On January 24 th, 2014, the PCICU had a Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) occurrence; the first in 498 days. Between January 24th and June 23rd, 2014, the PCICU had a total of 6 CLABSI s. Formal, multi-disciplinary Event Analyses were conducted after each CLABSI, with no obvious common causes identified among the CLABSIs. Two unit-based, nur se-led quality committees, the Infection Prevention Committee and the Educat ion Committee, were brought together to provide input on how to intervene. Goal Statement To have monthly Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) rates of zero (0) for CLABSIs in the PCICU for at least a 3-month period following re-education of nursing staff related to CLABSI prevention. SIR is a CDC benchmark that compares the number of infections that occur to what is expect ed based on the nat ional baseline. Description of Intervention/Activities The Unit Manager contacted the staff RN Quality Improvement Analyst (QIA), as well as the staff RN leaders of the Infection Prev ention and Education Committees to update them on the situation. The QIA and committee leaders briefly met with the Unit Manager to review quality data from the QIA's unit-level weekly audits of care and documentation, the roll-up of CLABSI data, and the findings from each Event Analysis. The committee leaders agreed that there were no common causes from each CLABSI to focus on and recommended focusing on a re-education of CLABSI prevention fundamentals. 1A snapshot of the audits complet ed by the QIA is listed below. In the months of January through June 2014, 24 audits were completed, but only 6 of these were fully compliant with the prevention bundle. Of the 24 audits, only 14 demonstrated t hat the RN washed their hands prior to accessi ng the central line. The committee leaders called a combined meet ing of the Infection Prevention and Education Committees to share CLABSI data and recommendations with all staff RN members of the two committees, and to further define the topics for and mode of education. The PCICU Medical Director wa s also present to offer guidance as needed and to show provider support for the initiative . Members of the taskforce identified five education topics that needed to be reviewed wit h all staff based on data from the QIA's weekly audit of nursing care regarding CLABSI prevention and anecdotal staff RN feedback. Those five topics were: 1) Hand Hygiene 2) Correct procedure for injection cap disinfection 3) Correct procedure for injection cap replacement 4) Daily patient baths 5) Surface disinfection in the patient room Five staff RN members of the taskfo rce each took one of the above topics and developed education in a concise PowerPoint format to be shared wit h every staff RN in the PCICU. The material was compiled into one presentation, then reviewed and approved by members of the Ta skforce, the Unit Educator, the Unit Manager, and the Medical Director. The taskforce determined that 1:1, face-to-face education with every RN in the PCICU was the optimal mode of education to reinforce the emphasis on individual practice. Since rapid implementat ion was important to influence practice change quickly, this proposal required a relatively large amount of manpower. 1Staff RN taskforce members looked at thei r work schedules as a group and decided that taskforce members would present the information 1:1 to each staff RN during shifts they worked. They set a goal of educati ng 80% of PCICU RNs between July 28th and August 11th, and educating the remainder before August 18th, 2014. Each staff RN taskforce member rounded with a computer to present the education 1:1 with staff RNs working. A list was updated to reflect RNs who had received the education. By August 18th, each of the 81 staff RNs in the PCICU had received the education 1:1. Following this re- education of staff, the PCICU CLABSI SIR decreased and the PCICU went 4 months without a CLABSI. The goal was reached.

Monthly SIR rates increased from December to June 2014. The running SIR trend decreased post-int ervention, leading to 3 m onths with an SIR of 0. The monthly SIR rate continues to be lower than the rate at the time of intervention. Example b Using a Lean, Multidisciplinary approach to prevent C. difficile in the MICU Background The Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) serves a wide variety of critically ill patients and presents nurses with new challenges from shift-to-shift. MICU patients can be particularly susceptible to mu lti-drug resistant organisms like Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . In March of 2015, there was a significant increase in the number of C. diff events throughout the organization. Driving this surge was the MICU, with a nearly 200% year- over-year increase. During unit board meet ings the MICU nursing staff had reviewed this increase in the number of C. diff case s and were prepared to be part of the team to address these issues. Preintervention Post intervention December 2013 - July 2015 1 A task force was formed with the goal of a ssessing current practice and preventing C. diff across the organization. One of the task force's first recommendations was to form multidisciplinary teams in the most affected units that could address the problem. The sub-group in the MICU consisted of repres entatives from performance improvement, infection prevention, clinical staff nursi ng, pharmacy, and the MICU physician team. Goal Statement Reduce the incidence rate of hospital onset C. diff cases in the MICU. A hospital onset C. diff case is defined as an event where a po sitive specimen is collected greater than 3 days after admission to the unit and is meas ured as a rate per 10,000 patient days. Description of Intervention/Activities Lean is the performance improvement meth odology of choice at VUMC. At the beginning of the project, the te am reviewed the basic prin ciples of Lean (reduce waste, add value) in addition to general information about C. diff. MICU nur ses continued their review of their unit data on the number of cases and unit trends co mpared to national trends. The group then worked through the initial steps of filling out an A3, including identifying stakeholders and performing a thorough root cause analysis. Potential root causes included delays in testing for C. diff, inappropri ate use of antibiotics, variability in room cleaning practices, and a la ck of guidance surrounding the removal of linen and meal trays from contact isolation rooms. To address the potential root causes, severa l solutions were developed. First, the group refined a nursing protocol for C. diff testing where MICU nurses can or der a C. diff test without a provider order, based on the prot ocol. Nurses on the team helped determine the trigger for initiating the protocol and designed the workflow after positive and negative tests (see flow chart below). T he new process began on 04/27/15. The entire unit staff was educated on C. diff and the unit' s performance throughout the process. An abbreviated antibiotic review was implem ented on rounds for every MICU patient and data from these reviews was collected and pl aced in a database for further analysis. 1 Participants MICU C.diff Committee Name Credentials Role in organization Practice Area Role on Committee Jess Bledsoe BSN, RN2 Critical Care Critical Care - Clinical Nurse MICU Member -identifying root causes, refining nursing protocols, solution implementation Phil Cook MHA Quality Consultant Medicine Patient Care Center Analysis, facilitation Julie Foss MSN, RN, NE-BC Inpatient Nurse Manager MICU Member - identifying root causes, refining nursing protocols, solution implementation Stacey Holt MSN, RN, CCRN, CCNS Nursing Education Specialist MICU Member - solution implementation and staff education Jen BSN, RN2 Critical Care - MICU Member - identifying root 1McNaught Critical Care Clinical Nurse causes, refining nursing protocols, solution implementation Mike Noto MD Clinical Fellow MICU Identifying root causes, designing antibiotic review tool, solution implementation Joanna Stollings PharmD Clinical Pharmacist MICU Identifying root causes, designing antibiotic review tool, solution implementation Kathie Wilkerson RN, BSN, CIC Infection Preventionist Medicine Patient Care Center Identifying root causes, providing expertise, refining nursing protocols Outcome Though more time is needed to assess the to tal efficacy of the changes, the initial results have been positive. In t he 6 months prior to the firs t intervention, the MICU had 9 cases of hospital onset C. diff. In the 5 m onths following the interventions, the MICU has had 4 cases of hospital onset C. diff. Future work will focus on the cleaning of patient rooms, conducting event analyses, and implem enting a new process to facilitate the removal of linens and meal trays from contact isolation rooms. 1EP21EO Culture of Safety EP21EO: Nurses are involved in impl ementing and evaluating national or international patient safety goals. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of nurses' involvement in activities that address nationa l or international patient sa fety goals that led to an improvement in patient safety outco mes. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data t able that clearly displays the data. Background In the most recent National Patient Safe ty Goals (NPSG) under NPSG.07.05.01 are the elements of performance regarding implemen tation of evidence-based practices for preventing surgical site infections. These elements are listed below and the example is based on these requirements that we know yield positive outcomes. Education for clinical staff and providers Patient and family member education Policies and practices aimed at reduci ng the risk for surgical infections Conduct risk assessments Selection of surgical site measures based on evidence Monitor compliance with guidelines Evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts Measurement rates Provide data (process and outco mes) for key stakeholders Administer antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis based on evidence Remove hair if needed and by method based on evidence Post-operative sternal wound infections (S WI) are a serious and often life threatening complication of cardiac su rgery. Monitoring showed that SWI were higher than expected based on National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) values. Reducing SWI by monitoring evidence based bundled practice s would codify a team based tactic and maximize institut ional effort. In review of this issue, variations in adherence to recommended infection prevention practices were noted by operating room clin ical nursing staff, infection prevention observers, and quality consultants. As part of an overall infection reduction initiative, a group of evidence-based strategies had been implemented, but not monitored; as determined effective in the NPSG and evid ence. The aim of the new work was to describe bundled evidence based practices used to reduce SWI in cardiac bypass graft 1surgery patients and monitor effectiveness us ing a web-based survey tool. Infection prevention nurses, quality consultant nurses, and cardiac operating room nurses could collaborate together in a web based venue to track compliance with the evidence based bundle elements. Goal Decrease sternal wound infections in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) utilizing evidence based bundl ed practices that are tracked using a web-based survey tool. Interventions Each month the cardiac surgical team along with cardiac operating room clinical nurses and nursing leadership received a surgical site infection report. When the rates were noted to be increasing by Infection Prevent ion, an interprofessional task force was assembled to look at cases and determine possible causes for the increase. Evidence based bundle elements were gathered and approved by the task force to be used to decrease infection rates. Tra cking compliance to the bundle elements was described in a survey tool designed to c apture data elements. A web-based REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) surv ey tool was designed and implemented for purposes of monitoring sternal wound in fections and lapses in practice. January - March 2013: In early 2013, the preoper ative components of the bundle elements were approved. A REDCap survey tool was built by Infection Prevention and Quality Safety and Risk Pr evention in an effort to capture 1compliance to preoperative and post-operative bundle compliance. REDCap is a secure web platform for building and managing online surveys and databases. The REDCap application provides research teams an 'easy way to do the right thing' with planning and data collection strategies. Sections within the tool were divided into Infection prev ention, Quality, Perioperativ e, and Post-operative. o Clinical nurses completed the data points in each of the corresponding sections. o Cardiac clinic nurses educated the patients regarding preoperative bathing with chlorhexidine (CHG) wipes t he night before and the morning of surgery. Supplies were given in the clinic along with in structions. Nasal decolonization with an anti-staphyloco ccal ointment was also instructed along with a prescription for the ointment. April - December 2013: Problems were noted for patients not filling prescriptions prior to the day of surgery or performing CHG bathi ng as instructed. A cohesive educational package was devised to collate the information for the patient and facilitate the nasal dec olonization regime . Postoperative bundle elements were solidified and approved by t he task force. Perioperative clinical nurses in the post anesthesia recovery unit were responsible for compliance. January - December 2014: Additional bundle elements were added to the protocol including an intraoper ative section (Phase 2). o Intraoperative bundle elements were recorded by the CRNAs. o Analysis of the compliance data i ndicated that patients were using the decolonization protocol 4-5 days post op rather than 2-3 days pre-op. Re-education for the patients and clarific ation of the teaching materials improved compliance with this metric. o Teamwork both at the clinic level and in-patient/perioperative arenas was considered essential, in order to ensure patient safety.
