[Inner Traditions/Bear & Company](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/361356815/Inner-Traditions-Bear-Company) Reviews for Healing Stones for the Vital Organs 1 rating0 reviews Book preview Healing Stones for the Vital Organs - Michael Gienger Preface THE ORGAN CLOCK in traditional Chinese medicine is a magnificent aid for the early identification of energy disturbances that, in the long run, can lead to bodily illness or psychic ailments. With the organ clock, the specific conditions of illness can be recognized and swiftly remedied. It is an instrument for the maintenance of health, applicable to both prevention and treatment of disease. For these reasons, the organ clock has been used for diagnosis and therapy since the beginning of modern crystal healing. Its clear structure and ease of manipulation make it a useful aid for laypeople as well, for self-healing and preventive maintenance. Hardly any other medicinal system is so simple in its practical application. The challenge in coordinating the connection between healing stones and the organ clock has been in identifying the appropriate healing stones for the resolution of specific energy disturbances and in treating the discomfort or illness resulting from those disturbances. Initially, the differing views of Western and Chinese medicine were not easy to reconcile. The first correspondences of healing stones to the organ clock were very much influenced by Western thought and Western interpretations of the organs and bodily functions. Through practical experimentation, functional correspondences emerged, but their effect initially was limited predominantly to symptoms, usually not reaching the level of the actual cause of illness. This was sufficient for use as a home remedy but not for lasting therapeutic application. Thanks to Wolfgang Maier's more than fifteen years of research, a deeper level of the connection between crystal healing and the organ clock can now be presented. His precise illustration of the twelve function areas of the organ clock, based on yin and yang as well as on the five phases of change, makes it possible to provide a classification of healing stones at the causative level. The healing stones for the organ clock introduced in this book, therefore, correspond to the energetic seeds of bodily illnesses and psychic disturbances. Their effect is etiological; they allow problems to be identified at their origins and, so to speak, pulled out by the roots. Their therapeutic effect is thus substantially greater and more enduring. The energetic foundations and correspondences are outlined in this book as simply and understandably as possible. This guide is intended to make the application of healing stones, with the help of the organ clock, available to all who are interested\u2014laypeople and therapists alike. Self-healing is more important today than it once was, and it is for this purpose that the organ clock was originally developed. With this book, we hope to make a small contribution to the health of all beings. MICHAEL GIENGER T\u00dcBINGEN, GERMANY Ancient Tools for Timely Healing Yin & Yang ALL OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY\u2014and consequently all of traditional Chinese medicine\u2014is based on the principles of yin and yang. Static, passive yin and dynamic, active yang are the two laws that together form the basis of all existence, and from which all things originate. WHAT ARE YIN AND YANG? Everything that tends outward and upward, all that is active and dynamic, is yang. In contrast, all that tends inward and downward, all that is heavy and substantial, is yin. When we look at the contrast between matter and energy, matter is yin and energy is yang. In comparing day and night, day is yang and night is yin. Yin and yang forever describe the relationship of two opposites to one another. EVERYTHING IS CHANGING The idea of yin and yang is an idea of eternal change. Yin changes into yang and yang back into yin. Thus day emerges from night, growing ever brighter, reaching its high point, and finally, inevitably, beginning to wane. Noon, the brightest point of the day, is also the beginning of the day's ending. In other words, when yang (here, brightness) is strongest, yin (here, darkness) begins to increase. Likewise, the summer solstice is the high point of the brighter time of the year but is also the beginning of the transition toward the darker time of the year. ALL THINGS EMERGE FROM OPPOSITES Just as light is not imaginable without darkness (without either, there would be eternal twilight), so yin cannot exist without yang, and vice versa. The one requires the other, just as the front side of a wall requires its back side. A wall with only one side simply cannot exist. YIN AND YANG ARE RELATIVE Mountains are larger than people. Thus a mountain is yang in relation to a person, and a person is yin in relation to a mountain. People are larger than flies. Thus a person is yang in relation to a fly, and a fly is yin in relation to a person. So is a person yin or yang? A fire is yang in relation to a cold pile of logs but yin in relation to the sun. Yin and yang are always connected to the relationship between two things. So the saying that yin is darkness and yang is light, that heat is yang and cold is yin, is correct yet imprecise. Yin is darker than yang; yang is lighter than yin. EXTREMES CHANGE INTO THEIR OPPOSITES There is no absolute darkness, because darkness changes back into light. There is no limitless heat, for cooling always must follow eventually. There is no eternal height; after reaching the highest point, a descent must follow. Yang, at its maximum, changes into yin; and yin, at its extreme, becomes yang. The Five Phases of Change IN CHINA, MILLENNIA OF OBSERVATIONS in nature gave rise to the system of the five phases of change. Each phase of change corresponds to a specific element for which it is named. All processes in life and in nature go through five steps: beginning, expansion, high point, retreat, and end (completion). The five phases of change reflect this principle: The phase of water is the beginning of everything. Expansion takes place in the phase of wood, reaching the high point in the phase of fire. Metal is the phase of retreat, and at the end of everything there is water again. The fifth phase, the phase of earth, is usually placed between fire and metal. This is the phase of duration, the time when things are steady and lasting in the world; the phase of beingness. The harmony of this cycle is the basis for health in humans. Disturbances and disharmony lead to illness. The phases of change describe the progression of the seasons and the passage of the day on the organ clock. They explain the interplay of the twelve function areas of the clock and indicate which influences lead to illness or preserve health. Whereas Western medicine recognizes and addresses only the physical (in this case, specific internal organs), treatment of the function areas embraces organs and bodily structures as well as the senses, emotions, psychic aspects, and spiritual capabilities connected with them. WOOD The change phase of wood is the phase of construction and growth. The primary qualities of wood are flexibility and creativity; flexibility for adapting to external conditions, and creativity for surmounting obstacles and creating optimal situations. Assertiveness, required in order to gain and maintain a place in life, also belongs to wood; likewise the sinews and muscles that serve for movement, and the fingernails and toenails that serve as rudimentary claws. The season of wood is spring, the time of growth and beginnings. The change phase of wood corresponds to the function areas of the liver and gallbladder. FIRE The change phase of fire is pure action, exuberance, and the zest for life, movement out of joy and enthusiasm for being in the moment. Fire is warmth and light. It is vibrant and energizing, active, brilliant, exciting, and colorful. Fire corresponds to the season of summer, the time of year for the greatest amount of activity. Spirit belongs to fire, corresponding to our true nature. As a vocal expression, laughter, a sign of joy in life, corresponds to fire. The function areas of fire are the heart, small intestine, pericardium, and triple heater. EARTH The change phase of earth is the center and source of all the other phases of change. Every life, every condition, all that is material emerges from earth, has its roots in earth, grows from earth, and returns to it upon death. To be grounded means to be balanced and consistent in the play of forces in the world. The change phase of earth rules the rhythmic forces in nature and in our bodies\u2014it governs the changing of the seasons and natural changes in nature. The season of the change phase of earth is late summer, the time of ripening and harvest. The nature of earth corresponds most to the ample wealth of the present day, in which food is plentiful. Earth does not correspond to any direction; it is the center. Its function areas are the spleen and stomach. METAL The change phase of metal represents firmness and stability. Metal holds things together, binds them and makes exchange possible. Thus communication and contact, the interplay between being too close and being too far, also belong to metal. The vocal expression of metal is crying, which happens when connections are broken or when a desired connection is denied. The season of metal is autumn, the time of transition and letting go. The skin, the greatest contact organ of the "}
