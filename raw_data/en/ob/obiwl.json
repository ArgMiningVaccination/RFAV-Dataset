Infertility af - fects up to 15% of couples, and male fertility has been found to be deficient in no fewer than 50% of infertile couples [1]. According to the 2012 publication of the European Association of Urology Guidelines on Male Infertility (MI), 30% of infertile men suffer from idio - pathic infertility [2]. However, evidence-based data are limited in the empirical use of drugs for idiopathic MI [3], and some drugs have obvious side effects. The treatment of MI has been revolutionized by ad - vances in assisted reproductive technology, including intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and even intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). How - ever, IVF and ICSI procedures are costly and traumat - ic. Additionally, the use of IVF and/or ICSI techniques may increase the risk of birth defects and childhood cancers in the offspring.

At present, the evidence for the effectiveness of empirical drugs is limited, and in vitro fertilization is costly and may increase the risk of birth defects and childhood cancers. Therefore, affected individuals may feel obliged to pursue natural remedies. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may represent a useful option for infertile men. It has been demonstrated that TCM can regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and boost the function of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. TCM can also alleviate inflam- mation, prevent oxidative stress, reduce the DNA fragmentation index, and modulate the proliferation and apoptosis of germ cells. Furthermore, TCM can supply trace elements and vitamins, ameliorate the microcirculation of the testis, decrease the levels of serum anti-sperm antibody, and modify epigenetic markers. However, the evidence in favor of TCM is not compel- ling, which has hindered the development of TCM. This review attempts to elucidate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of TCM. We also explore the advantages of TCM, differences between TCM and Western medicine, and problems in existing studies. Subsequently, we propose solutions to these problems and present perspectives for the future development of TCM.

In China, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been employed to treat MI for more than 2000 years, which has influenced the opinions of people in sur - rounding areas and has made it increasingly appealing to people with infertility. Holism and treatments based on syndrome differentiation are the essence and the basic characteristics of TCM, and utilizing this theory for treating MI yields satisfactory results. However, the theory of TCM is abstract, and the therapeutic mechanism of TCM is obscure, which has impeded its popularization and aroused skepticism among Western scientists regarding its potency. This review sheds light on the potential therapeutic mecha - nisms of TCM and includes information regarding the advantages of TCM, the differences between TCM and Western medicine, and problems with existing stud - ies. Subsequently, we propose solutions to the problems and present perspectives for the future development of TCM. POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC MECHANISMS OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE 1. Regulation of the reproductive endocrine system In the theory of TCM, the kidney stores an indi - vidual's essence and governs growth, development, and reproduction. TCM regards the kidney as the prenatal source of life; therefore, the fundamental pathogen - esis of MI is kidney deficiency, and supplementing the kidney is recognized as the essential therapy for MI. The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (H-P-T) axis is a major positive- and negative-endocrine feedback sys - tem that regulates testis function. Hormone levels that are either too high or too low are detrimental to sper - matogenesis. Modern research has demonstrated that kidney deficiency often manifests with the dysfunction and impaired structure of the H-P-T axis [4]. Experi - ments have shown that kidney-supplementing formu - las could repair the structure and restore the function of the H-P-T axis [5], bidirectionally regulate the hor - mone levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), and eventually increase the level of testosterone (T) to improve the quality of se - men.1) Enhancement of follicle-stimulating hormone levels, regulation of luteinizing hormone levels Recent studies have indicated that a Chinese herbal monomer regulates the levels of FSH and LH. Lycium barbarum , a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used to enhance male fertility for thousands of years, and L. barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) is the major active component isolated from L. barbarum . An- imal experiments have shown that LBP could - cantly raise FSH and LH Ginsenosides and their monomers of Rb1 and Rg1 were able to stimulate cultured anterior pituitary cells to secrete FSH and LH in vitro [7]. Additionally, semen Cuscutae extracts significantly improved FSH and LH levels in adenine-induced model rats [8]. Chi - nese herbal compounds also have had the same effect. Studies have found that the liuwei dihuang pill sig - nificantly increased FSH and LH in kidney-yin- deficient infertile men [9]. Furthermore, the wuzi yan - zong pill (WYP) was found to promote the secretion of FSH and to simultaneously reduce LH levels through a negative feedback pathway [10]. Low levels of FSH imply hypospermatogenesis, and kidney-supplementing and replenishing herbal medicines heightened testicu - lar function in spermatogenesis through upregulation of FSH. 2) Reducing follicle-stimulating hormone levels, regulating luteinizing hormone levels Previous data suggest that Schizandra chinensis polysaccharide extracted from S. fructus reduced FSH and LH levels in cyclophosphamide-induced model rats [11]. In addition, animal experiments confirmed that the jingui shenqi pill remarkably lowered FSH and LH decoction was - ble of decreasing FSH levels and increasing LH levels in model rats treated with gossypol acetate [13]. Abnor - mally high FSH and - matogenesis in the testis, and kidney-supplementing and essence-replenishing herbal medicines can repair the damaged histologic structure of the seminiferous epithelium and stimulate spermatogenesis by down - regulating FSH levels. 3) Raising testosterone levels In addition to regulating the H-P-T axis to raise T levels [8-13], modern pharmacological studies have Shao Hu Zhou, et al: Traditional Chinese Medicine as a Remedy for MI177 www.wjmh.org shown that echinacoside extracted from tubulosa itself significantly enhanced testosterone biosynthesis by increasing the expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, including ste - roidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), P450 This suggests that kidney-supplementing herbal medicines elevate T levels via multiple targets and pathways. 4) Regulating follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels bidirectionally A prospective controlled study showed that the bushen sheng jing pill increased LH levels in kidney- yang-deficient infertile men, and decreased FSH levels in kidney-yin-deficient and kidney-yin and -yang- deficient men [15]. The results from this study and the studies mentioned in the previous sections suggest that TCM regulates FSH and LH level bidirectionally, maintaining endocrine homeostasis. 2. Boosting the function of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells Sertoli cells (SCs) play a central role in spermato - genesis. A reduction in the number of SCs leads to a proportional decrease in the number of germ cells and Leydig cells (LCs), with detrimental effects on fertility [16]. SCs secrete androgen-binding protein under the regulation of FSH, while LH stimulates LCs to synthe - size T. These 2 processes cooperate to maintain normal spermatogenesis. Experiments have shown that TCM promoted the proliferation of SCs and LCs, elevated the levels of inhibin B and T, and eventually facili - tated the progression of germ cells to spermatozoa. The WYP is an essential formula for the treatment of MI. Previous studies have demonstrated that the WYP could dramatically enhance the activity of cy - tochrome c oxidase in SCs [17] and inhibit the overex - pression of Cox7a2 in SCs [18]. Additionally, the WYP prominently elevated levels of serum inhibin B in model rats induced by multiglycosides of Tripterygium wilf ordii Hook F [19]. WYP treatment also increased vimentin expression and repaired the cytoskeleton in SCs [20], and additionally activated the Akt signal transduction pathway and upregulated p-Akt expres - sion to induce proliferation of SCs [21]. Notably, liuwei dihuang pill extract was also capable of stimulating SCs to proliferate [22].Previous studies have suggested that yangjing capsule (YC) extract could significantly upregulate testosterone synthesis in LCs via the Nur77 pathway [23]. Moreover, icariin treatment significantly reduced apoptosis and promoted the proliferation of LCs [24]. Meanwhile, icariin was found to stimulate the prolifer - ation of SCs by activating the ERK1/2 signal pathway and upregulating the mRNA expression of FSH recep - tor and claudin-11 in SCs [25,26]. 3. Preventing oxidative stress In recent decades, problems including infection, en - vironment pollution, and lifestyle have increased, and cellular damage caused by oxidative stress (OS) has attracted attention. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) attack the membrane and DNA of sperm cells, leading to decreased fluidity and impeded permeability of the sperm plasma membrane. This results in an aug - mented DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and apoptosis rate, ultimately resulting in infertility. TCM has been demonstrated to scavenge ROS, improve the antioxi - dant capacity of the seminal plasma, lower sperm DFI, and protect the male reproductive system from the le - sions induced by ROS. Pharmacological studies have indicated that (SOD) levels and reduce the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the testis to protect the sperm from OS [27-30]. Wuzi yanzong compound extract improved the survival rate of SCs, elevated the activity of SOD, and reduced the MDA content in SCs injured by H2O2 [31]. The jinkui shenqi pill increased the activity of SOD and decreased MDA levels in serum from model rats with infertility induced by hydrocortisone [32]. Furthermore, experiments by Zhou et al [33] and Weng et al [34] on rats induced by cadmium chloride and cigarette smoke indicated that kidney-supplementing and blood-quickening formulas were capable of signifi - cantly raising the activity of SOD and glutathione re - ductase (GSH) in the testis, while lowering MDA levels and sperm DFI [33,34]. OS is a common consequence of spermatogenic dam - age, and TCM remedies MI by means of antioxidation. 4. Modulating the proliferation and apoptosis of germ cells SCs are the paracrine regulators of spermatogenesis https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.180069 178 www.wjmh.org and secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is an important growth factor that modulates the differentiation and self-renewal of sper - matogonia [35]. Animal experiments have shown that Cynomorium songaricum extracts dramatically in - creased the expression of GDNF (mRNA and protein) in SCs [36]. In vitro cell culture experiments indicated that YC extract could act on GDNF to upregulate POU3F1 expression by triggering the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, ultimately stimulating spermato - gonial stem cell proliferation [37]. Furthermore, matri - mony vine treatment was able to facilitate the division and differentiation of spermatogonia and propagation of primary spermatocytes [38]. Apoptosis is commonly known as programmed cell death. The apoptosis of germ cells is an important testicular self-regulation process. However, high lev - els of apoptosis cause MI. Researchers have suggested that LBP decreased the expression levels of caspase-3, increased the Bcl-2/Bax-43 ratio and the testicular an - tioxidant enzyme activity of SOD and GSH, and even - tually inhibited the apoptosis of testicular germ cells in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice [29]. The jingui shenqi pill reduced the expression of Fas/FasL to in - hibit germ cell apoptosis in a kidney-yang-deficiency mice model [39]. Furthermore, wuzi yanzong formula treatment downregulated expression levels of Bax and caspase-3 [40], and upregulated the expression of Bcl-2, which modulates the p53 signal pathway and the H-P-T axis. Ultimately, T levels were increased, in - hibiting apoptosis in germ cells [41,42]. Therefore, TCM prompts the proliferation of sper - matogonia and inhibits the apoptosis of germ cells to treat MI. 5. Supplementing trace elements Zinc and selenium are essential trace elements for testicular development and spermatogenesis. Zinc is a component of SOD and plays an important role in antioxidation [43], DNA repair mechanisms, and main - taining genomic stability [44]. Selenium is a critical shields membrane lipids from oxida tion. Selenium is also a constituent the mitochon - drial sheath of spermatozoa [45]. Manganese is also an essential trace element that acts as a potent trigger of sperm motility by increasing adenylate cyclase activ - ity [46]. Substantial evidence has demonstrated that infertile men are likely to have a zinc or selenium deficiency, and moderate supplementation of zinc and selenium improved the semen quality of infertile men [47,48]. Domestic studies have shown that kidney- supplementing herbal medicines such as E pimedium and Curculigo were rich in zinc and manganese [49], while cooked Rehmannia had high levels of selenium [50]. Therefore, TCM supplements zinc, selenium, and manganese to MI. 6. Ameliorating the microcirculation of the testis Spermatogenesis is a highly metabolic process that is susceptible to disruptions in the supply of nutrients and oxygen. Sufficient blood supply for the testis is a prerequisite for normal spermatogenesis. Previous studies have advanced the concept of treating male disease from the perspective of blood stasis [51]. Zhou and Xie [51] insisted that blood-quickening medicines ameliorated the microcirculation and metabolism of the testis and ensured an adequate nutrient supply for the testis. Blood-quickening medicine alleviated inflam - matory effusion and inflammation and unblocked the vas deferens. Animal experiments have suggested that bushen huoxue formulary treatment could upregulate the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth fac - tor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Rous sarcoma oncogene (Src) testicular microcirculation in cyclophosphamide model mice [52]. A randomized controlled trial of 128 infertile men indicated that kidney-supplementing and blood-quickening methods dramatically raised sperm concentration and motility more effectively than other therapeutic methods [53]. Kidney-supplementing and blood-quickening formulas also improved semen qual - ity and pregnancy rate. 7. Improving semen quality and the pregnancy rate 1) Improving seminal plasma quality Fructose and alpha-glucosidase are the major compo - nents of seminal plasma. Fructose is the energy source for sperm; it is metabolized into adenosine triphosphate by glycolysis and is associated with sperm motility. Alpha-glucosidase can catalyze the degradation of the glycogen stores of sperm in the epididymis, supplying Shao Hu Zhou, et al: Traditional Chinese Medicine as a Remedy for MI179 www.wjmh.org energy for the maturation and motion of sperm. Stud - ies by Chen et al [54] found that jiawei wuziyanzong decoction treatment increased fructose levels in semi - nal plasma in infertile men with asthenozoospermia. We thought that seed herbal medicines contained numerous vitamins and fructose and could elevate the fructose level in seminal plasma, consequently improving sperm motility. Another study showed that shengjing prescription treatment significantly in - creased the levels of seminal plasma alpha-glucosidase and fructose [55]. Therefore, TCM can elevate sperm motility by increasing fructose and alpha-glucosidase levels in seminal plasma. 2) Improving sperm quality A randomized controlled study showed that both jiawei wuzi yanzong decoction and liuwei dihuang pill treatments improved sperm vitality and motility in kid - ney-yin-deficient infertile men [9], which is consistent with previous studies. A multicenter study found that both the qilin pill and the WYP could effectively im - prove the seminal concentration and sperm motility in oligoasthenozoospermia patients, which is in accordance with the results from treatment with the shengjing prescription [56]. In addition, shengjing prescription treatment improved normal sperm morphology and ac - rosin activity, reducing sperm DFI [55]. Because of the differences in basic features of the included studies, 2 meta-analyses yielded inconsistent results. One meta- analysis suggested that TCM could improve sperm concentration, sperm motility, and the pregnancy rate more effectively than Western medicine [57]. However, another meta-analysis indicated that TCM and Chinese- Western combined therapy significantly enhanced the pregnancy rate. That study only performed a descrip - tive analysis on semen parameters due to the high het - erogeneity of the included studies [58]. In terms of the efficacy of acupuncture, a meta-analysis showed that acupuncture was able to increase grade A sperm mo - tility and sperm concentration, but had no significant impact on the pregnancy rate [59]. 8. Others 1) Alleviating inflammation Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infections of the male genital tract are a common etiology of MI [60], result - ing in decreased sperm motility and increased abnor-mal sperm counts. Inflammation leads to leukocyte in - filtration into the seminal plasma, and the leukocytes release excessive ROS, which attack the plasma mem - brane and DNA of sperm. Experiments have shown that Phellodendron , Scutellaria , and Taraxacum were effective in vitro , while zhibai dihuang decoction treatment increased protein and mRNA expression levels of interleukin-2 and inhibited the protein and mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha in rats infected by Urea - plasma urealyticum [61]. Hence, TCM not only kills pathogenic microorganisms directly, but also regulates cytokine secretion to treat infections indirectly. 2) Decreasing the level of anti-sperm antibody Sperm is a specific antigen that causes the human body to generate anti-sperm antibody (AsAb) when the immune system is exposed to it. AsAb decreases sperm motility [62], impedes sperm from undergoing capacitation and acrosome reactions, and interferes with sperm-oocyte recognition and fusion [63]. Animal experiments have suggested that zhibai dihuang decoc - tion treatment could remarkably reduce serum levels of AsAb in rats [64]. While the concrete mechanism is obscure, TCM may eliminate testicular immunological complexes and regulate the ratio of CD4/CD8 T cells to cure immune-induced infertility [65,66]. 3) Modifying epigenetic markers Epigenetics is the study of modification of gene ex - pression without changing the DNA sequence, and epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling [67]. Normal H19 gene expression is crucial to spermatogenesis, and many patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia had hypomethylation at the H19 locus [68]. A study by Lian et al [69] indicated that shengjing formula treatment could improve sperm concentration, motility and clini - cal pregnancy rate by reducing the loss rate of the H19 imprinted gene. Research into TCM in the field of epi - genetics is limited and needs to be strengthened. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the effectiveness of TCM for MI has been confirmed by numerous studies, but many problems exist in these studies.

Advantages of Traditional Chinese medicine and potential mechanisms We propose the following potential mechanisms of TCM treatments of MI: regulation of the H-P-T axis, boosts to the function of SCs and LCs, alleviation of inflammation, prevention of OS, and reduction of the DFI. TCM also acts to modulate the proliferation and apoptosis of germ cells, supply trace elements and vi - tamins, ameliorate the microcirculation of the testis, decrease AsAb levels, and modify epigenetic markers (Table 1, Fig. 1). TCM has effects on multiple targets, systems, and pathways to improve sperm parameters and the pregnancy rate. The therapy of TCM focuses on overall balance by improving the condition of the body and regulating the testis, instead of complement - ing a certain hormone directly. Moreover, natural prod - ucts have few side effects. This may be the underlying mechanism for the bidirectional effects of TCM on dis - ordered hormone levels.2. Problems and insufficiency At present, however, the evidence in favor of TCM is not compelling. The studies of TCM for MI are almost all domestic and contain small sample sizes. They are also not blinded randomized controlled trials, and do not contain detailed descriptions of the methods of ran - dom sequence generation and allocation concealment; therefore, the overall quality score for methodology is low. The absence of uniform standards for the evalua - tion of TCM efficacy causes considerable heterogeneity. In addition, most TCM studies lack reports of adverse effects and mainly target infertile men with oligoas - thenozoospermia, neglecting patients with azoospermia and teratozoospermia. Additionally, the extraction of effective components and reforms in the preparation of herbal medicines are lagging, which hinder its develop - ment and popularization. 3. Solutions and outlook In our view, evidence-based-medicine methods must be applied to assess the efficacy of TCM in modern times. The refinement of herbal medicine needs to be promoted.
