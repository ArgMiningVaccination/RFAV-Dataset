TABLEOFCONTENTS PERSONAL OF CONFEREES ONH.R. 3734, WELFARE AND MEDIC- AID REFORM ACT OF 1996Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, Iask unanimous consent to take from theSpeaker's table the bill (H.R. 3734), toprovide for reconciliation pursuant tosection 201(a) (1) of the concurrent reso-lution on the budget for fiscal year1997, with a Senate amendment there-to, disagree to the Senate amendment,and agree to the conference asked bythe Senate.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is thereobjection to the request of the gen-tleman from Ohio?There was no objection.MOTION To INsTRUcT OFFERED BY MR. 5ABOMr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, I offer a mo-tion to instruct.The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will re-port the motion.The Clerk read as follows:Mr. SABO moves that the managers on thepart of the House at the conference on thedisagreeing votes of the House of Represent-atives and the Senate on HR. 3734 be in-structed to do everything possible within thescope of the conference to\u2014(I) eliminate any provisions in the Houseand Senate bills which shift costs to statesand local governments and result in an in-crease in the number of children in poverty;(2)maximize theavailabilityof Food Stamps and vouchers for goods and servicesfor children to prevent any increase in thenumber of children thrown into povertywhile their parents make the transition fromwelfare to work;(3) ensure that the bill preserves Medicaidcoverage so that the number of people with-out access to health care does not increaseand more children and old people are notdriven into poverty; and(4) provide that any savings that redoundto the Federal Government as a result of thislegislation be used for deficit reduction.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Underrule XXVIII, the gentleman from Min-nesota [Mr. SiO] will mm-utes, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.KASICH]will control30 the gentlemanfrom Mr. Speaker. I yield my-self 2 minutes.Mr. Speaker, there is no denying thatwe must make needed changes to ourwelfare system to make it more effi-cient and fair for the American people.In doing so, we should emphasize per-sonalresponsibility,and we shouldhonor work. But we should not shredthe entire safety net in the process.It would be unconscionable of thisCongress to,in the name of reform,pass a welfare bill that drives millionsof children into poverty. It would beequally irresponsible to simply pushFederal welfare responsibilities off onState and local governments whichmay or may not have the resources tocare for those truly in need. That iswhy I am offering this motion to in-struct conferees today.House conferees should use this op-portunity to negotiate with the Senateand with the President to ensure thatmillions of children are not pushed intopoverty because of the welfare changesenacted by this Congress. We shouldalso ensure that we do not overwhelmthe ability of States and localities todeliver needed welfareservices. Wemust reform our welfare system, butwe must not do it in a fashion that in-creases child poverty or increases theburden on State and local government.Also. Mr. Speaker, it should be clearthat any savings that result from thislegislation should go for deficit reduc-tion, not for other purposes.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, Iyield such time as he may consume to thegentleman from Florida [Mr. SHAW].Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I have readwith great interest the motions to in-struct. I might say, as to each one ofthese items,in crafting the welfarebill, we had these objectives in mind.Therefore, I find it would be most dif-ficult to oppose the motions to instructbecause I think that is exactly what weintend to keep uppermost in our minds.I think it is necessary to see this asto how we view welfare reform. Weview this as giving a path and a way forpeople to get out of poverty. We knowthat the present system does not work.We know that people have been paid tostay in a way of life which is self-de-structive and which has totally doneaway with a future for these people.Unfortunately, the poor victims ofthis current system, which has beenheld in place for so many years, are thechildren. We know that the children ofwelfare parents are going to. inall probability, and statistics prove theseto be correct, are more likely to bepoor themselves. They are more likelyto fail in school or drop out of school.They are more likely to have troubleand get in trouble with the law. It is aself-destructive behavior.Mr. Speaker, I think the difference indefending the existing system, to de-fend the existing system is simply tomake somebodycomfortablewhile they are living in poverty. That is notthe way. That is destructive of thehuman spirit. The new way. the way ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEwelfare reform is going to go to theroot of poverty. The root of poverty isjoblessness.We have now found that in the innercities of this country we have piledgeneration upon generation of peoplewho otherwise would, as their ances-tors were, be productive. It is impor-tant to remember that these peoplewho are the descendants, who are onwelfare, many of them are descendantsof people who struggled their wholelives, who went to the cities for a bet-ter way of life, and now find that whenthe jobs went away, they were paid tostay there and do absolutely nothing.The answer to welfare reform veryclearly is to get people out of poverty,to get them jobs, to give them incen-tives, to give them child care, which wedo, to give the States greater flexibil-ity in order to craft these programs.the welfare programs, in order to helpthe people. We are at last going to bemeasured by the number of people weget out of poverty. not the number ofpeople that we pay while they are inpoverty. We are going to give the bu-reaucrats a vested interest in the solu-tion to poverty, not the question ofjust how many people they keep in wel-fare.This is a new day. I think yesterdaywe saw the action that was taken bythe other body as a quantum leap for-ward in bipartisan cooperation. I cansay that I am looking forward to a bi-partisan solution in this body also.We had 30 Democrat Members whocrossed over and voted with the Repub-licansjust last week on welfare reform.I am looking forward to increasingthat number, and I would like to al-most rival the Senate in getting asmany of the minority party as I pos-sibly can to vote with us on the finalpassage of this bill.Mr. Speaker, there is not one Mem-ber of this Congress that is willing toget up and defend the status quo. Why?Because we all want a better life forthe people of this country. I can say,again, that the four objectives that areset forth in the motion to instruct, un-less somebody jumps up and says thatthere is something in here that I do notsee, that there are some fishhooks thatI do not anticipate,I would suggestthat perhaps the Members vote yes onthe motion to instruct that sets forth ageneral path toward getting people outof poverty. I believe it is a constructivemotion to the conferees at this point.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemanfrom Ohio for yielding me the time.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, Iyield2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas[Mr. STENHOLM].Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I risein support of motion to instruct theconferees in exactly the same spirit thegentleman from Florida has just spo-ken with. I believe when we carefullyanalyze this amendment, in the spiritin which was indicated support for, wewill find that this motion ensures thatwelfare reform will not shift costs toState and local governments, which IJuly 24, 1996know thegentlemanfromFlorida agrees to.The National Governors Association,the National Council of State Legisla-tures,theNationalAssociationof Counties, the U.S. Conference of May-ors, and the National League of Citiesall have said the bill passed by theHouse places unfunded mandates onState and local governments and re-stricts the flexibilityto administerwelfareprogramsintheir commu-nities.I am submitting for the RECORD a let-ter from each of the latter three orga-nizations. Members will find that theSenate has made marginal improve-ments. The conferees can. if allowed todo our work. make it much better inthe spirit of this motion to instruct.I was particularly concerned to learnthat the bills passed by the House andSenate would conflict with the reforminitiativesbeingimplementedby Texas, my State, and others Statesacross the country. State legislatorsandGovernorsdevelopedproposalsafter consulting with welfare field of-fices studying local job markets, evalu-ating the cost of implementing re-forms, and deciding how best to protectchildren and other vulnerable popu-lations.The bill as passed by the House doesexactly what the majority party gen-erally rails against: That is, havingWashington dictate to the States aone-size-fits-all solution. In the spiritof this instruction, we can work thatout in cbnference and have a much bet-ter bill.The bill would force many States ei-ther to apply for waivers from themandates, make significant changes inthe plans currently being implemented,or face penalties from the Federal Gov-ernment.The second key principle in this mo-tionis protecting children. Again, Iwould encourage my colleagues to lis-ten to what the States decided must bedone to protect children. For example,the welfare reform proposal now beingimplemented in Texas continues bene-fitsfor children after their parentsreach a time limit.Severalother States have followed Texas'lead in protecting children from the impact oftime limits. Unfortunately, the bill passed bythe House substitutes the views of Membersof Congress in Washington for the judgmentsof State officials on how best to provide forchildren in their States by explicitly prohibitingStates from using block grant funds to protectinnocent children from being harmed becauseof the mistakes of their parents. If these provi-sions in the bill passed by the House becomelaw, Texas and other States will be required tochange their plan to apply time limits to chil-dren. If you believe that State and local offi-cials know better than Washington how to pro-vide for the needs of low-income children intheir communities, you should support the mo-tion to recommit.Third, the motion to instruct provides that noone should lose health coverage as a result ofwelfare reform.I was pleased that both theHouse and Senate adopted amendments pre-serving currenteligibilityrules for Medicaid July 24. 1996coverage.However, I am concerned about re-ports that this provision may be dropped inconference. Ihope that Chairman SHAW canassure me and other members concernedabout this issue that current Medicaid eligibilityruleswillbe preserved by the conferencecommittee.I am also concerned about the impact thatdenying Medicaid to noncitizens will have onthe health care system. The bifi passed by theHouse will effectively deny Medicaid to thou-sands of individuals, removing $7 billion ofMedicaid assistance from the health care sys-tem. However, health care providers will con-tinue to be morally and legally obligated toprovide care to these individuals, resulting in acost shift to health care providers that will af-fect the cost, availability, and quality of care toeveryone in Texas and other States with 'argeimmigrant populations.In closing,I would say to my colleagues onboth sides of the aisle that this motion reflectsa continuation of the spirit of trying to breakthrough partisanship to find a commonsensemiddle ground position on welfare reform. Allmembers who voted for the Castle-Tannersubstitute\u2014and all Members who agreed withthe principles of the Castle-Tanner substitutebut who voted against it for whatever reason\u2014should vote for the motion to instruct. I urge a'yea\" vote on the motion to instruct conferees.Mr. Speaker,Iinclude RECORD 1996.DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: You may bevoting soon on the Welfare and Medicaid re-form bill (HR. 3507/S. 1795). The National As-sociation of Counties (NAC0) is encouragedthat there were improvements to the welfaresection of the bill, including: increased fundsfor child care: maintaining current law forfoster care adoption assistance maintenanceand administration payments: and no fund-ing cap for food stamps nor a block grant forchildnutrition.However,therearenot enough improvements to warrant our sup-port. In some respect, particularly the workrequirements, the bill has become even moreburdensome. NAC0 particularly opposes thefollowing welfare provisions:1. The bill ends the entitlement of Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children, therebydismantling the safety net for children andtheir families.2. The eligibility restriction for legal im-migrants goes too far. The most objection-ableprovisionsincludedenyingSupple- mental Security Income and Food Stamps.particularly to older immigrants. In fact, bychanging the implementation date for theseprovisions, the bill has become more oner-ous. NAC0 is also very concerned about theeffect of the deeming requirements particu-larly with regard to Medicaid and children inneed of protective services.3. The participation requirements have be-come even more unrealistic. NAC0 particu-larly opposes the increased work participa-tionratesandincreasedpenalties,the changes in the hours of work required. andthe new restrictions on the activities thatmay count toward the participation rates.As the level of government closest to thepeople. local elected officials understand theimportance of reforming the welfare system.While NAC0 is glad that the bill does containlanguage that requires some consultationwith local officials we prefer the strongerlanguage that is contained in the bipartisanwelfare reform bill (HR. 3266).NAC0 also continues to oppose the Medic-aid provisions. By capping the fiscal respon-sibility of the federal government and reduc-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEing the state match for the majority of thestates. the bill could potentially shift bil-lions of dollars to counties with responsibil-ity for the uninsured. Allowing the states todetermine the amount, duration and scope ofservices even for the remaining populationswhich would still be guaranteed coverage,will mean that counties will be ultimatelyresponsibleforservices not covered ade-quately by the states. While we support theincreased use of managed care and additionalstate and local flexibility in operating theMedicaid program. we do not support the re-peal of Medicaid as envisioned in the currentlegislation.As itis currently written. the Medicaidand Welfare Reform bill could potentiallyshift costs and liabilities. create new un-funded mandates upon local governments,and penalize low income families. Such abill. in combination with federal cuts and in-creased demands for services. will leave localgovernments with two options: cut other es-sential services. such as law enforcement. orraise revenues. NAC0 therefore urges you tovote against HR. President.NATIONAL LEAGUE DC. July18. 1996.DEAR REPRESENTATIvE On behalf of theover 135,000 local elected officials the Na-tional League of Cities represents, we arewriting to urge you to oppose the Welfareand Budget Reconciliation legislation (H.R.3734) being considered on the floor this week.As it is currently written, the Welfare andBudget Reconciliation bill would cut federalinvestments in families and children. shiftcosts and liabilities. create new unfundedmandates upon local governments. and pe-nalize low-income families.While we find it encouraging that this wel-fare bill has some improvements such as in-creased funds for child care. a larger contin-gency fund and smaller reductions in SSIbenefits for low-income disabled children. isstill does not merit our support. In some in-stances, particularly the stringent work re-quirements, the bill has become even moreharsh. NLC is especially Opposed to the fol-lowing provisions:1. The bill ends the entitlement of Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children. therebydismantling the safety net for children andtheir families.2. The eligibility restrictions for legal im-migrants goes too far. The most objection-able provisions include denying SSI benefitsand food stamps to immigrants, especiallyolder immigrants. These provisions will shiftsubstantial costs Onto local governments.Local governments cannot and should not bethe safety net for federal policy decisions re-garding immigration.3. The participation requirements have be-come even more unrealistic. NLC is particu-larly opposed to the increased work partici-pation rates, the increased penalties. thechanges in hours of work required. and thenew restrictions on the activities that maycount toward the participation rates. Insteadof providing more local flexibility, the billmoves in the direction of ever greater un-funded federal mandates.As the level of government closest to thepeople. local elected officials understand theimportance of reforming the welfare system.While NLC is happy to see that the bill doescontain language that requires some con-sultation with local officials, we prefer thestronger language that is contained in thebipartisan welfare reform bill (HR. 3266).We believe that this budget legislation willsharply reduce resources in cities for fami-lies and children. It proposes a whole newchapter of unfunded federal mandates. Fi-H8321nally. the shift of liabilities to local govern-ments will leave local governments with twooptions: cut other essential services, such aslaw enforcement. or raise revenues. NLC.therefore. urges you to vote against this bill.Sincerely,GREGORY S. LASHUTKA,President.THE UNITED STATESCONFERENCE OF MAYORS,Washington, DC. July 17. 1996.DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The U.S.Con- ference of Mayors has long advocated reformof the current welfare system which wouldchange it from a system of dependency toone of work and self-sufficiency. We wouldliketo see welfarereform enactedthis year\u2014reform that would be good for our na-tion, good for our cities and. most impor-tant, good for recipients.We have. however. serious concerns withthe welfare reform legislation now movingthrough Congress. Our primary concern isthat the legislation will harm children, in-creasing the poverty rate among childrenand making many children who are cur-rently poor even poorer.The Conference of Mayors has a substan-tial body of adopted policy on welfare re-form. Our basic principles for welfare reformare: the availability of: Jobs which pay anadequate wage. health care coverage andchild care; provisions which encourage fa-thers to assume responsibility for providingbothfinancialand emotional support totheir children; welfare benefits sufficient tomaintain a standard of living compatiblewith health and well-being, and which re-main available for a period of time deter-mined by the client's need rather than an ar-bitrary time limit; a system based on incen-tives rather than punitive measures.While HR 3507 represents an improvementover HR 4, with increased funding for childcare, maintenance of the entitlement natureof foster care and adoption assistance, andmaintenance of the current mix of child nu-trition programs. the bill does not meet theprinciples for welfare reform which we haveset. Unless these concerns are addressed, TheU.S. Conference of Mayors must urge you tovote against HR 3507.Sincerely.CARDELL COOPER.Chair. Health and Human Services Committee.RICHARD M. DALEY,President.HR. 3734 RESTRICTS STATE FLEXIBILITY TOIMPLEMENT WELFARE REFORM INITIATIVESWhile Congress has been debating welfarereform, states have begun to implement ag-gressive welfare reform initiatives throughthe waiver process. These innovative stateplans requires greater personal responsibil-ity, place work requirements on welfare re-cipients and set time limits on benefits.State legislatures and governors developedproposals after consulting with welfare fieldoffices, studying local job markets. evaluat-ing the costs of implementing reforms anddeciding how to best protect children andother vulnerable populations. State officialswere able to develop welfare reform initia-tives that were tailored to the conditions intheir states so that the programs would bepractical and successful in moving welfarerecipients in the state into work. These stateplans reflected the views of citizens of theirstates.The welfare reformbillpassed by theHouse and Senate would conflict with manyof the reform initiatives being implementedby states across the country. The bill over-rules the Judgement of state officials aboutwhat is practical and realistic in work pro-grams by mandating work rules which are H8322much more severe than most states have es-tablished. The work requirements mandatedby the bill are more severe than most statesbelieved they could afford or successfully im-plement. In addition, the bill would prohibitseveral states from continuing provisionsprotecting children from the impact of timelimits On benefits. Although the bill is in-tended to give states flexibility to imple-ment welfare reform plans without the needfor federal waivers,thebill would forcemany states to either apply for waivers fromthe mandates in the bill, make significantchanges in the plans currently being imple-mented (absorbing additional costs to meetfederal mandates while federal funding is being frozen), or face penalties from the fed-eral government.Among the states that are implementingwelfare reform initiatives that would notcomply with the mandates in HR. 3734 aspassed by the House:Connecticut: Welfare recipients would berequired to work a minimum of 15 hours aweek after two years of assistance, 25 hoursafter three years and 35 hours after fouryears. The Connecticut program would failto meet the work requirements mandated inHR. 3734 because most individuals workingunder the state plan would not be countedunder the rules established in HR. 3734. Con-necticut imposes a time limit for a portionof the caseload that applies only to employ-able adults, Under HR. 3734, Connecticutwould be required to apply the time limit tochildren as well.Delaware: Private contractors are paid forplacing welfare recipients in private sectorjobs of at least 20 hours a week, recognizingthe nature of opportunities in the labor mar-ket for unskilled applicants. HR. 3734 wouldnot count individuals placed in private sec-tOr jobs of 20 ho\u00e0rs a week as meeting workrequirements.Georgia: Georgia applies a work require-ment in ten counties that require recipientsto work up to 20 hours per month at an as-signed in local, state or Federal governmentor at a non-profit agency. the Georgia plandoes not meet the mandates regarding eitherthe hours of work required or the percentageof the caseload that must be working. TheGeorgia plan provides that benefits to chil-dren are not affected by the plan. H.R. 3734would require Georgia to amend its plan toeliminated benefits for children after thefive year time limit.Hawaii: The state plan places job-ready re-cipients in part-time private sector jobs ofup to 18 hours a week. These jobs would notcomply with the mandates in HR. 3734.Indiana: The Indiana plan applies the timelimit on benefits to adult benefits only. HR.3734 would require Indiana to amend its planto apply the time limit to children as well asadults.Iowa: Under the state plan, caseworkersare given latitude to set forth a work planforrecipientsbasedonindividualcir- cumstances, including the individuals workhistory, education level, etc. and environ-mental barriers such as transportation, childcare and the local job market. The work re-quirementsintheindividual agreementsrange from 20 to 45 hours a week. The workrequirements mandated in H.R. 3734 wouldseverely restrict the ability of caseworkersin Iowa to set work requirements based onindividual circumstances.Missouri: The Missouri plan applies thetime limit on benefits to adults only. HR.3734 would require Missouri to amend itsplan to apply the time limit to children aswell as adults.Montana: The Montana plan requires re-cipients to perform 20 hours of communityservice per week after receiving two years ofbenefits. This work requirement would notCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEmeet the mandate in H.R. 3734. The Montanaplan does' not apply the time limit to chil-dren's benefits, as H.R. 3734 would require.Oklahoma: Recipients in six counties whoare not able to find ajob after receiving ben-efits for three years are required to work atleast 24 hours a week in a subsidized job. TheOklahoma plan does not meet the mandatesregarding either the hours of work requiredor the percentage of the caseload that mustbe working.Rhode Island: The bipartisan welfare re-form proposal being considered in the RhodeIsland General Assembly with the support ofthe Governor would exempt children's bene-fits from the time limit. HR. 3734 would re-quire Rhode Island to change its plan beforeit could be implemented.Tennessee: The Tennessee welfare waiverrequest would require welfare recipients towork 25 hours a week. which would not meetthe mandates in HR. 3734.Texas: The Texas plan requires individualswho are unable to obtain private sector em-ployment of 30 hours week to participate inwork activities under the JOBS program of20 hours a week. The Texas plan is extremelyunlikely to meet the mandates in HR. 3734.The Texas plan continues benefits for chil-dren after the time limit, which H.R. 3734would prohibit.The list above is only a partial list ofstates that do not meet the mandates in H.R.3734. Several states not listed above are inthe process of developing programs thatwould not meet the mandates in the bill.Many other states have welfare reform ini-tiatives that do not address the issues ofwork requirements and time limits man-dated in the bill. Finally, virtually all statesthat are implementing work requirementshave limited the work requirements to tar-geted segments of the caseload which fall farshort of the participation rates mandated bythe bill.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3minutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Michigan [Mr. CAMP].Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank thegentlemanfor yielding time to me.I also have looked at themotionto instruct and do not find anything tooobjectionable in it, as well. When welook at the costs, I know it mentionsthe costs that have been put on Stateand local governments, that they areconcerned that costs will be shiftedthere. What our bill tries to do is giveStates more flexibility to design andimplement a welfare program that willfree up resources because, clearly, thekind of welfare system we have had forthe last 30 years has been overly re-strictive. Just look at the number ofwaivers States have applied for, whichhas been a long, difficult, bureaucraticprocess. Some I think have recentlybeen granted for Tennessee, or that an-nouncement will be made very soon.Even the Federal Government recog-nizes,the administration recognizesthat the current system has not donethe job. The whole purpose of our bill isto try to ease that. The purpose ofdoing that, of course, is to help liftchildren from poverty.I think if welook at the last 30 years, the war onpoverty has not been won, and it is very, very important that we do betterat that.I think the bipartisan nature of thisbill that came out of the Senate, halfthe Democrat Senators supported theJuly 24, 1996welfare bill. I think it is a very good.strong signal that the kind of bill weare going to design will be a very posi-tive change, one that has been neededfor a very, very long time.0 1730Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, Iyield2 minutes from Florida [Mrs. THURMAN].Mrs. THURMAN. Mr.Speaker,I thank the gentleman from Minnesotafor yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, as we head toward thethird conference on welfare reform, Ihope that this time everybody gets itright and focuses on the children whoneed to be protected, rather than thepolitical gains to be made. We have ac-tually come very far over the pastyear, and the bill making its way tothe conference is a little bit fairer andmore reasonable than the first one.But there are still loopholes. In otherbills, loopholes mean a loss of revenueor a tax shelter. In this bill, a loopholemeans thousands of starving children.Here are the holes in the conferencethat must close. First, in the Housebill, children are penalized for theirparents' mistakes. If a parent is irre-sponsible and does not get ajob withinthe time limit, kids get cut off, too.Nobody wants starvingchildrenin dirty diapers. That is not welfare re-form, but it is what will happen unlessthe loopholes are closed, with vouchersfor kids.Second, the House bill contained un-derfunded optional block grants forfood stamps. The Senate was wise torecognize that these block grants willbe attractive to States, but dangerousfor children. When the money runs out,and it will for many States, there willbe no money for hungry families. Forexample, what happens when compa-nies downsize or a recession hits? Fam-ilies that worked hard, but struggledfrom paycheck to paycheck, will lookto us to help feed their children, andwe will have to turn them away. TheSenate recognized this problem and weshould support their amendment toeliminate the optional block grants.Like everyone else in this body, I want to see welfare reform, not statusquo, signed into law this year. But indoing so, let us be guided by the wordsof Hubert Humphrey, who consideredthe moral test of government to be howthat government treats those who arein the dawn of life, the children. If we,the most plentiful Nation on Earth,bring harm to our children by passingthe wrong welfare reform, we will havefailed this test.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from the State of Connecticut(Mrs. JOHNSON].Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut. Mr.Speaker, I welcome the Sabo amend-ment, because it does clarify a numberof issues that are important for theconference to focus on.I personallyworked very, very hard on the Medic-aid provisions, and we need to assure July 24, 1996thatthey are strong and will providethe kindofhealth care that childrenneed.I personally feel that one of the im-portantthingsfortheconference.though. is not to be bound by the oldthinking. When I hear the precedingspeaker talk about children after the 5years. I do not feel that she really seeswhat the impact of this plan is going tobe. There are just so many opportuni-ties from day 1 to provide day care, toget into job training, to use those daycare dollars so effectively that womenwork in day care centers half the dayand then they are in job training halfthe day, and from the very beginning.day 1. the whole family comes togetherto the family center and everybody be-gins growing, changing their future.So. I think there is enormous oppor-tunity here.Michigan has done a great job withkinship groups.If you see you aregoing to have trouble, you can bringkinship groups into it, and the wholefamily, the larger family. needs tohave the role here, have a role in plan-ning the solution for this family. So,we need to be sure to be creative andnot to cut off the kinds of initiativesthat are going to develop.We do have that 20 percent protec-tion. I agree. we do not want any chil-dren disadvantaged by this reform Thisshould offer opportunity and hope toboth women and children. But we donot want our thinking about the wel-fare of the next 20 years to be too nar-rowly fenced in by the experience ofthe last 10 years and 20 years when theStates were very limited in what theycould do.In Connecticut, we have a 21-monthlimit, and one of the biggest newspapercritics of it wrote a column just theother day saying, you have to own upwhen you are wrong. and he was wrong.It is working great.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker,Iyield2minutestothedistinguishedgen-tleman from Tennessee [Mr. TANNER].(Mr.TANNER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker. I want tocompliment the gentleman from Flor-ida[Mr. SHAW] and the others whoworked with us.I certainly who worked on our side. Ithink we are very close.This motion to instruct has reallyfour general. but necessary. principles Ithink we all share in this body, Demo-crat or Republican, to make sure, asone of the previous speakers said, weget it right. It talks about the costshifting to local governments, and weneed to really take a look at that. Asthe gentleman from Texas [Mr. STEN-HOLM]said.there is no reason to againdemand that States do it our way orface penalties. and then we all knowwhat happens there.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThereis still a part of the House billthat treats a 4-year-old child like a 34-year-old irresponsible adult. We reallycan fix that. and we need to.We talk also about Medicaid cov-erage. The Senate took a great stepyesterday in a vote of. I think it was.95 to 2 to fix that portion of it. andsurely the conference committee cantake a look at that. Finally. we talkabout the savings that are achievedhere going .to deficit reduction, whichdirectly will affect these children thatwe are talking about in the previousparts of the bill.So we are close. The Senate did somegood work yesterday. If we can just inthe conference utilize our imagination.as one of the previous speakers overthere said. to try to get to some clo-sure on these principles. not harmingchildren. actually making sure thatthe funding is there to make the sys-tem work. I think we are very close toa breakthrough and a conference com-mittee report that we can all supportand the President can sign.Mr. KASICH.

Mr. Speak-er, I thank the gentleman for yieldingme this time.I am very pleased today to see usmoving toward bipartisanship on wel-fare. We are all very concerned aboutsolving this major problem. Many of ushere on the House floor who haveworked onthisissue month aftermonth, and some people year afteryear. are worried about what the cur-rent system of welfare has done to chil-dren.Ido want to reassure the gentle-woman from Florida that we have in-deed built flexibility into this system,this new bipartisan proposal that willtake care of children. that they willnot suffer at the end of 5 years, thatthere is a 25-percent exemption numberthere. that money can be shifted fromchild care from title XX to take care ofthose children. and they can be trans-ferred within the block grants. andthat there are other State sources thatmay be used to support the childrenafter 5 years as well.But I continue to be very pleased tosee how much emphasis both sides ofthe aisle are putting on the issues thatare most important to me in this bill,the issues of child care and child sup-port. In the original welfare bill. wewere very thoughtful in how we ad-dressed child care. We took a great dealof time to work with the governors ofthe States. the Members on both sidesof the aisle. the administration, to de-velop a plan that would fund child careat a level that would be far better thanwhat existsinthe current systemtoday.So at this point we are somethingaround $4.5 billion more than the cur-rent welfare program provides to theStates for child care. including theirH8323funding. and $2 billion more than thePresident originally asked for. and Ithink this is an appropriate level andshows the concern that we have forthose mothers on AFDC who are wish-ing to get off welfare and into the workforce. We have talked to these womenand we have figured out that this is themost important piece of this whole leg-islation that allows them the peace ofmind they need to make this transfer.Child support is critically important.We spent a lot of time. there has beena lot of work that has gone into thechild support issue. the issue of dead-beat parents. 30 percent of whom leavethe States, Mr. Speaker. to avoid pay-ing child support. We have provided anationwide information service herethat will allow States to find thosedeadbeat parents, and I must say thattoday in our Nation, $34 billion is owedin court-ordered child support to custo-dial parents. When it is not paid. thosekids go on welfare and the taxpayersbecome the parent.So I am here today to commend bothsides of the aisle to support the Sabomotion to instruct and to urge my col-leagues to continue the bipartisan ap-proach to welfare that I hope will con-tinue right through to the signing bythe President in the White House.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker.Iyield2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from California [Ms. WATERS].Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise insupport of this motion to instruct theconferees. First. let me make one at-tempt, one final attempt. to interjectsome sanity into this debate about thefuture of mothers and their children.We canaccomplish welfarereform without abandoning poor children. Ifthis government cannot agree to that,it will agree to nothing.Both the House and Senate versionsof this bill would decimate the foodstamps program: both would unduly re-strict benefits for legal immigrants.The proponents of this legislation areclearly driven by two impulses. neitherof which is reforming welfare. First,they are eager to balance the budget onthe backs of poor children rather thantackle corporate welfare. And second,they are attempting to create a wageissue, which they know divides Ameri-cans, and inject their divisive spiritinto this political season.This is not how we make sound pub-lic policy, Mr. Speaker. The last billthat was sent to the President's deskwould have thrown at least 1.2 millionchildren into poverty. While we do nothave a comparable study on the impactof this bill, I would ask my colleagues,how many children will this Congressfeelcomfortable making poor? Onemillion,2million.ahalf million?Where is the job creation? Where arethe incentives to business to stop ex-porting our jobs to Third World coun-tries for cheap labor so that we canprovide jobs for jobless Americans hereat home?Mr. Speaker. many welfare recipientswant desperately to change their lives. H8324They want to correct the mistakes intheir lives. They want help, not morepain. They want jobs. Let us trainthem, not starve them.Mr. Speaker, we should support thismotion to instruct the conferees tokeep children out of poverty, preserveMedicaid, maximize food stamps, pro-vide job training and work opportuni-ties. This is not fun and games. Thisissue is about human lives.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker.I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. Speaker,Ithinkitis prettyamazing for the American people tomake note of the fact that in the otherbody. 74 Members of the other bodyvoted for a significant. the most sig-nificant change in welfare that we haveseen in this country since welfare wascreated, and that of course enjoins theaction of this body to do a number ofthings.First, to say that we will take care ofpeople who cannot, simply cannot takecare of themselves. But at the sametime, it says for those people who areable-bodied and find themselves on thiswelfare system, that we will provideadequate day care so that the childrenof people on welfare will be protected.Second, that the people who are onwelfare are going to be asked to gettrained. We are going to give them askill. We are going to educate them.We are going to help them. And at theend of the day. it is also expected thatthose folks will be able to leave welfareand find employment to work.I think that is what Americans havebeen calling for in this country my en-tire political career, and frankly all ofmy lifetime. Because in a Judeo-Chris-tian society, itis wrong not to helppeople who need help; but in a Judeo-Christian society, it is also wrong tohelp people who need to learn how tohelp themselves. I do not think there ismuch disagreement with this.Now, there are some starts and somestops in any legislation. There is al-ways concerns about what happens.But it has been those concerns thathave blocked this Congress. not thisCongress, but previous Congresses frombeing able to deliver the kind of wel-fare reform that taxpayers want, andthe kind of welfare reform that tax-payers will support.0 1745I would say to the Members of theHouse today that the gentleman fromMinnesota makes an amendment that Ithink has a lot of merit. It speaks tothe fact that we do not want unfundedmandates. That is why, in fact, Gov-ernors sit in our deliberations and giveus their opinions in terms of the im-pact of this legislation on their States.They basically have one plea, however:'Trust us, we can do the job. After all,it is our citizens' money, and we thinkwe can design a program that fits localsolutions to local problems at less costand will be more productive and rescuepeople from poverty.'At the same time I think it is veryimportant to realize that as we goCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEthrough this, we are going to be in aposition where taxpayers finally aregoing to be able to say, \"I can supportthis program. It is fair to those whocannot help themselves, itis fair tothose because we provide the adequateprograms to protect their children asthey get skills and get work. and it isfair to me as a taxpayer.\"I am always proud of saying that Ithink the real American heroes in thiscountry are not the Shaquille O'Nealswho make $125 million or the JuwanHowards who make $100 million. Godbless them for having the skills todrive the market to make that kind ofmoney but they are not my heroes.My hero is that lady who goes to theairport to pour the coffee. puts herchildren in day care, and works likethe dickens with her husband to makeends meet. and they do not get any-thing from the government. They arenot unwilling to help those that cannothelp themselves. but at the end of theday they want to believe it is a systemthat encourages people to leave.We cannot let the concerns that wehave had over the years deny the kindof welfare reform we ought to have. Ithink the gentleman from Minnesota[Mr. SABO]speaksto the issue of thelocal mandates, the need to be con-cerned about children, which all of usare. We believe at the end of the daythis is a compassionate bill that willhelp the folks that need the help andhelp the taxpayers who want to have alegitimate welfare system.So we can support the Sabo amend-ment, move to conference, and, ladiesand gentlemen, I think we are on theverge of truly historic reform of thesystem that has needed reform all ofmy lifetime and I think it is a day forus to be excited.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, Iyield the Cali-fornia [Ms. WOOL5EY].(Ms. WOOLSEY asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend her re-marks.)Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker. we willagree that the welfare system does notwork for taxpayers and it certainlydoes not work for families on welfare.That is the easy part.The challenge and responsibility weface as legislators. however, is to fixthe system so that it helps parentsmove from welfare to work while at thesame time ensuring that children aresafe. healthy and protected. We have todo that because parents cannot succeedin school, training or work if theirchildren are not taken care of. Theycannot do their best when their chil-dren are home alone or in a car or ifthey are sick or hungry.Take it from me. I was on welfare.Even though I was working, I neededAid For Dependent Children for onereason and one reason only, to give mychildren the food. the medical care,and the child care they needed. With-out those crucial support services, Mr.Speaker, without that safety net, I donot know what would have happened tomy family.July 24, 1996So, conferees, Members of this body,remember. the lives of millions of chil-dren are in your hands. Take this re-sponsibility very seriously. If you err,err on the side of our children. Makesure that no child is left without prop-er health care, nutrition, or child care.Make sure that no child is left behind.Remember how the safety net savedmy family. Remember the children. Iurge my colleagues, protect our chil-dren.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the very distinguished gen-tleman from Delaware [Mr. CASTLE],the former Governor.Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentlemanfor yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker,I would just like toshare some thoughts I have on welfarereform. I support all the concepts ofthe motion to instruct conferees. I think the gentleman from Minnesota[Mr. SABO] has done a good job here,but I would just like to point out wherewe have gone in the welfare reformpackage.We had it coming out of committee,we took it to the floor of the House, wemade some amendments to it which Ithink made it a better bill.It wentover to the Senate, they acted on it. Ithink they have added some aspects toit or reaffirmed what we have done inthe House, which makes it a better bill.Hopefully the conferees can sit downand meet and also make some of theimprovements along some of the linesthat have been discussed here to makeit an even better bill.I think we are going to have welfarereform in the United States. I think weneed to be very serious about what isgoing to be in it. Quite frankly, I thinkwe have worked hard to actually makethis a very good piece of legislation.I could not agree more, we should nothave unfunded mandates. We have nowpreserved Medicaid coverage almostcompletely in this bill. We need to pro-tect that. That is a very importantpoint which is made here. I also believewe need to deal with the vouchers forgoods and services, and I think maybewe are a little further long that linethan even I thought after some furtherresearch.Hopefully we can developthat a little bit more too, as well, aswe look at this.Obviously I believe we should havewhatever savings we can possibly have,but the bottom line is right. So manypeople have spoken here today and be-fore on welfare reform. We need to putinto place a system which will changeit. There are job opportunities beingcreated in America. The President ofthe United States says that constantly.Our economy shows that. We thinkthese individuals ought to have the op-portunity to go out and work wherethey can. We believe some should beprotected, the 20 percent who cannotwork.I think this is all coming together. Icongratulate all the Members of theHouse. Sometimes we do not listen toone another. I think in this instance July 24, 1996we have been listening to one another.Hopefully we will listen to this motionto instruct conferees, go to conferenceand have a good welfare reform pack-age.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker. Iyield1 minute to the gentleman from NorthDakota [Mr. POMEROY].Mr. POMEROY.Ithank the gen-tleman for yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to followthe preceding speaker who has workedso hard to make certain that a biparti-san welfare reform package is possible.The issue before us is not whether weshould reform welfare. It is how we re-form welfare in the correct way. I think the Senate took a major step for-ward in showing that true bipartisanreform is possible. Sbustantial changeswere made in the Medicaid and in thefood stamp areas, resulting in a muchmorebipartisanvotethanwasachieved in the House.What other changes can be made inconference to get a stronger bipartisanHouse vote? The motion before us laysthem out. Do not shift costs to local-ities, do not harm children, particu-larly as parents make that criticaltransition into the work force, preserveMedicaid coverage so that people with-out health care access does not in-crease, and, finally,if there are sav-ings, let us apply them on the deficit.We can do better than the bill thatcame out of the House in reaching bi-partisan agreement. If the confereesadhere to these points, we will have abipartisan welfare reform proposal.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I reservethe balance of my time.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker,I yield2 minutes to the gentleman from Califor-nia [Mr. BECERRA], and I ask unani-mous consent to yield the balance ofmy time to the distinguished gen-tleman from New York [Mr. RANCEL]and that he have authority to yield toothers.The SPEAKER protempore(Mr. KNOLLENBERC). Is there objection tothe request of the gentleman from Min-nesota?There was no objection.Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker. I thankthe gentleman for yielding me thistime.Mr. Speaker, if there is one clarioncall that we should hear in this Con-gress when it comes to reforming wel-4are, it should be: Hold our childrenharmless. We can disagree on a lot of'things. but I think one thing is clear:None of us intends to put children inworse condition by reforming welfare.Yet we still have an issue. The Repub-lican welfare bill that passed in thisHouse would send 1.5 million childreninto poverty.It would increase thelevel of poverty for those children al-ready existing without enough. Whywould we want, as this bill does, todeny a child who lives in a home wherethere is domestic violence the oppor-tunitytoescapethat home? Whywould we want to deny more than300.000 children who exist with a dis-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEability the opportunity to try to havethe same opportunity as any otherchild? Why would we want to deny achild who is hungry the opportunitythrough food stamps to be nourished? Ido not think we want to do that, and Ibelieve on a bipartisan basis we can getthere. We are getting closer. There arestill some disagreements. But certainlywe can get there. Let us not fool our-selves. If we do not give through theFederal Government some assistancethrough food stamps or other servicesto that child, no one in the communityin Los Angeles where I live or any com-munity where you live will say, \"We'regoingtoleavethatchildonthe street.\" We are going to care for thatchild one way or the other because weare very humane in this country. Butlet us not shift costs to the local gov-ernments and claim that we have savedwelfare. Let us do it the right way andlet us remember, in the end, the clar-ion call should be: We will hold ourchildren harmless.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.(Mr. RANGEL asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, my dearfriend CLAY SHAw who has worked sohard to protect the children of ourgreat Republic and who made so manyattempts to make this a bipartisan ef-fortclosedhis remarks by saying,\"And who would want to be in a posi-tion of defending the status quo?'Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has noidea what a powerful political state-ment he made. Because the answershould be, \"Nobody.\"There is widespread feeling in thisCongress and in the United States thatanybody that can work should be work-ing, and anybody who freeloads is in-consistent with the ideas and the idealsthat made our country the great coun-try it is. Nothing gets to a taxpayermore than seeing a freeloader living attheir expense and not making any at-tempt to pay their own way with thedignity that ajob brings to them.Having said that, if I understand thisbill, this is notjust reform because youcall it reform. President Clinton saidyou can put wings on a pig but it doesnot make it an eagle. Why should I ac-cept the fact that just because it is dif-ferent, it is reform?\"TrusttheStates.\"Itrustthe States. Give them the Federal money,they are closer to the problem. Put ina safety net. Make certain the childrenare protected. We are not talking aboutaid to dependent mothers. We are talk-ing about children. Whether you areDemocrat, conservative, liberal, or Re-publican, 0MB says 1 million kids aregoing to be pushed into poverty. Why?Because people have arbitrarily said,'Trust the Governors.\" After 2 yearsthey decide if the mother is not work-ing, kick the kid off.Well, I do not know what would havehappened in the manger at Christmas-time if that attitude had prevailed. butH8325I think that Mary and Joseph wouldhave had a harder time under today'sbill than they had 2,000 years ago.The fact remains is, if you say go towork, is there not a responsibility tohave a job? If someone plays by therules, makes a mistake, the boyfriendgot killed, they were on their way tothe church, they looked for the job,they took the training, but there wereno jobs.0 1800Oh, the Governors will work outsomething. If we are providing Federalfunds and for the first time in 60 yearsare saying we wash our hands of thisproblem, it is now a State problem andyou, RANCEL, trust the Governors, youhave been there for 40 years, that is aheck of a thing to tell to a child thatis being denied food stamps, that isbeing denied health care because wehave a problem with the mother. But ifyou do not have a problem with themother and she has worked hard andthere is no job for her to find, you sayif it is 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years,it is OK with you that she has not gotajob.I say if we want to turn it over to theStates, I think it is wrong, but I wouldsupport it. But we have an obligationas a Congress, as a Nation to put asafety net there for those kids. Theyhave not hurt anybody. But it is notthere in any of these bills.What has really happened is that thequestion before us as we adopt the res-olution that the gentleman from Min-nesota [Mr. SABO] has is not whether ornot this is a good or bad bill. It is thequestion that the gentleman from Flor-ida [Mr. SHAw], my friend, raised: Whois prepared before this election to pro-tect the status quo? It is not me, butthat does not mean that this flying pigis an eagle. It means that we have todo something before the election.Democrats have to have a vote onsomething and so do the Republicans,unless, of course, which I know neverentered the minds of my friends in themajority,unless we can make thePresident look worse by having to vetoit. So now good-thinking people are.wondering inthe Congress do theyreally want a bill or do they reallywant to embarrass the President. Andthatis what we are talking abouttoday. The urgency to get this bill outis based really to get it out before wego to the election.All I am saying is,if the bill is sogood, why does Catholic Charities sayit is so bad? Are they dealing with sucha higher authority that they cannotreach the Christians outside of theChristian Coalition? If the bill is so good, why is it my Jewish friends whotake care of kids every day in the Jew-ish Council Against Poverty, whichevery year, the gentleman from NewYork [Mr. GILMAN], my good friend,and I are there saying that poverty isnot black or white or Catholic orProtestant or Jew or gentile, hey. theyare against the bill. And the Muslims H8326are against the bill. The ProtestantCouncil said it may be a good conceptbut it is bad for children.I tell my colleagues one thing, this isthe best medicine we can find to havefood for an election. So I retain mytime to yield to other Members, but Ireally wish that we could hurt the peo-ple that should be hurt and provide thejobs and the opportunity for those peo-ple who played by the rules; but thereis no provision there to protect them.One day when we are talking aboutwelfare reform, we will concentrate oneducation and dreams and training andhave people that have more time to beprepared to get married and to get thepicket fence and to have the samedreams as other people. But I realizethat that issue is a local issue. We willleave that to the local school boards,and we will tackle the big ones likewelfare reform and let the Governorstell us how well they are doing.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Florida [Mr. SHAW].Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I would liketo respond very briefly to my goodfriend from New York. On this floor weoften use the word good friend in refer-ring to somebody right before we slapthem upside the head, but CHARLIE andI are good friends; we really are, bothon the floor and off of the floor. I wouldlike to say to the gentleman from NewYork, next year I think we all antici-pate he would be the ranking memberon the Committee on Ways and Means.My colleague may try to make theargument that he is going to be chair-man, but it is not going to happen nextyear. But in any event he is going to bethe top Democrat on the Committee onWays and Means. In that position, as Ihave said to him in the past that Iwould hold out to him my hand towork in cooperation with him oncewelfare reform gets in place to be sureit is going to work, there are going tobe problems with welfare reform.Anyone in this body that feels thatwe have washed our hands of the prob-lem is kidding themselves. The FederalGovernment. by defense of a welfaresystem that has not worked and hasbuilt up layer after layer of genera-tions on poverty, we have a responsibil-ity as a Federal Government to go inand clean up this mess and to get peo-ple where the jobs are or get the jobswhere the people are. I know, I say tomy friend and colleague, that this issomething that he is interested in, andI will tell my colleague tonight that Iwould be happy to go to his districtand to work with him because I knowof his concern for the people he rep-resents. I also have concern for them.Now, one quick response to the ques-tion as to whether we are trying torush something in before the election,we are trying to give this President theopportunity to deliver on a promise hemade 4 years ago during the campaignon which he mentioned right belowwhere the speaker is standing here to-night in telling us during the State ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEthe Union Address that he wants a wel-fare bill that he can sign. We intend todeliver him a welfare bill that hope-fully he will sign.It got great support in the Senate. Ihope we take the momentum that theycame out of the Senate Onto the HouseFloor and that we send him a biparti-san bill and he will sign it.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am cer-tain that the President will make noteof this contribution that we are mak-ing to his campaign and the great op-portunity that we have given to him. Iwould like to yield 2 minutes to thegentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs.KENNELLY].Mrs.KENNELLY.Mr.Speaker, DemocratsandRepublicanshave agreed from the very beginning of thissession on welfare reform, the need forwelfare reform. We agreed that onetitle of the welfare reform bill shouldbe there, child support enforcement. Itwas placed in. we worked together andit stayed that way.Other than that, there were manydisagreements. There were many de-bates. There were many arguments. Wecome to this point where we have themotion before us that will put peopleto work and protect children.We look at this motion. It says yes towelfare to work programs and no to un-funded mandates. We look at this mo-tion that says yes to strict time limitson adults and no to driving additionalchildren into poverty. The motion saysyes to reforming welfare but no to in-creasing the number of people withouthealth coverage.So the motion is a good motion. Thisbill can become a better bill. I remem-ber the other day last week when wewere voting on final passage in theHouse, on the welfare bill. One of mycolleagues on the other side of the aislecame downandsaid:BARBARA,I thought you said, if we made this billbetter, you would vote for it. I said yes,I said that, but I think it can be better.Yesterday it was made better. Yes-terday Medicaid language was muchbetterinthe Senate. Yesterday noblock grant for food stamps. Let us usethe surplus agriculture supplies wehave for nutrition for the children. Yetthere were other ways that the Senatebill very definitely made this a betterbill.We have this motion, a commonsenseblueprint for welfare reform that willwork and that President Clinton canlook at so he can decide if he is goingto sign it.I say to my colleagues on the otherside of the aisle this is a much betterbill that we continue to talk about. To-morrow there willbe a conference,where we will meet. The gentlemanfrom Florida [Mr. SHAW] has been aleader on this and has been patient, un-believably patient.I say let us still consider that safetynet for children. Let us still make it abetter bill so that we can all vote for itand the President can sign it and wecan all say we did welfare reform.July 24, 1996Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes gentlewoman from Con-necticut [Mrs. JOHNSON].Mrs.JOHNSON of Connecticut. Mr.Speaker, certainly it is the tradition ofthe Congress that going to conferenceis a time when House Members andMembers of the other body think to-gether anew about legislation, and thebest ideas from both sides are merged.So. there is no doubt in my mind thatwhat comes out of conference will be abill we will all be proud of.I do want to go back to somethingthat my friend from New York said,and that is jobs; what are we going todo if there are no jobs? And why do allthese religious groups oppose the bill?Well, I would say to my colleagues thatwelfare reform is not just about wel-fare. Welfare reform is about systemchange in America. Those groups donot understand that. They do not seethe possibilities.I think we are missing the under-standing of the new opportunities thisbill creates. For example, it has alwaysbeen unfair for local taxpayers, and weknow how terribly, terribly stressedpeople are at the level of local propertytaxes. Those people are paying theirlocal government people, and they areparticipating in paying welfare bene-fits.Through attrition, without anybodywho is employed losing their job, thereis not any level of government thatcannot open up entry-level jobs for wel-fare recipients so right off the bat theyget real wages for real work. Theymake contacts and then the local gov-ernments can use that money to up thesalaries of some of their people to dosupervision and to do coordination.So I believe in the long run we aregoing to use our public dollars betteras a result of welfare reform becausewe are going to open up jobs. We aregoing to build job training into ourFederal, State and local bureaucracy,andpeoplewillhaveopportunitiesright off the bat they never dreamed of.So I think using the resources of theemployment base that government pro-vides with taxpayer dollars, our com-munity colleges and our adult edu-cation resources, we are going to cre-ate opportunity with this bill that weare going to be proud of.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Michi-gan [Mr. LEVIN].(Mr. LEVIN asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, the basicfoundationsof welfare reform havebeen clear for some time: moving peo-ple on welfare into productive workwith time limits and State flexibility.protecting the child who will be a mainbeneficiary of breaking the cycle of de-pendency.While I have believed that there wasa mainstream cutting across the par-ties to build a new structure on thesefoundations, and I have been activelyengaged along these very lines, early July 24, 1996Republican bills veered sharply in anopposite direction and as a result thePresident vetoed them.Indirectresponse,themajoritymoved and there have been some sig-nificant improvements in the proposedlegislation. moving from no specificprovision for health care and woefullyinadequate day care to assurance ofhealth and day care as parents moveoff of welfare to work, better ensuringthat States who meet their responsibil-ities and maintain their effort, not simply substituting Federal dollars fortheir own, canceling the punitive pro-gram cuts for severely handicappedchildren, restoring the safety net forfoster care and child nutrition and cre-ating a structure, though still very in-adequate. to protect people who wantto work from the ravages of a major re-cession.The bipartisan Tanner-Castle bill, which I actively supported, and severalamendments in the Senate point toseveral key areas where there is a seri-ous need for further change, especiallythose relating to the protection ofhealth and welfare of children who arelegally in this country, and to reallyachieving what is most needed for theparent on welfare, for their benefit, forthe child and for the taxpayer; that is,work.This motion instructs the confereesto do everything possible to achievethe stated objectives on a bipartisanbasis. The conference can be an impor-tant step forward on a bipartisan basistoward welfare reform or a backwardstep on a partisan one leading to fur-ther gridlock. This Nation badly needsand wants the former. We must striveto achieve it.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, Iyield myself 2 minutes.I want to say to my friend from NewYork I was amazed the other day intalking to some of my friends on theDemocratic side of the aisle. They werewondering about our economic pro-gram. I think what my colleagues haveto understand, they may not like ourprogram. but our program balances thebudget and lowers interest rates.One of the major ways we do it is toshift power and money from this cityback home so that people can solvelocal problems with local solutions. Iwould say to the gentleman. I want mylocal housing authority administratorsto set the rules for the people that livein the housing in my community. I donot want to come to Washington forthe rules. I want to do it in the neigh-borhood.Our program is to provide tax incen-tives, we believe, and lower taxes onrisk-taking. We think that will createjobs. and my good friend Bob Garciajoined with Jack Kemp to create enter-prise zones to give tax relief so we cancreate jobs. The day is going to come.in my judgment. where the poorestAmericans are going to support lower-ing capital gains taxes so that peoplewil.1 risk money to create jobs.I would also say to the gentlemanthatour viewofderegulation.ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEunshackling businesses that cannot getstarted in communities because theygot to hire lawyers and accountantsand Lord knows how much. Instead oftreating those people with great re-spect, we make it difficult for them tocreate a job and hire people. That iswhy we support deregulation.0 1815That is why we support less Federalinvolvement. because we believe weneed to reclaim our communities andour neighborhoods and our families.So this plan cannot be divorced fromour economic plan. The gentleman maynot agree with our economic plan. butwe are sincere in our efforts to try tobring greater prosperity to this coun-try, and we think we are on the righttrack. The gentleman believes we arenot. But we cannot divorce welfarefrom the need to provide economicgrowth. We believe we have the betterway to do it, and I want the gentlemanto understand that is our approach.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yieldsuch time as she may consume to thegentlewomanfromCalifornia[Ms.PELOSI].(Ms. PELOSI asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend her re-marks.)Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise insupport of the motion to instruct andreject the idea of putting more chil-dren into poverty.Mr.Speaker. we can all agree that the wel-fare status quo is unacceptable. But the Re-publican welfare reform proposal will make theproblems of povertyanddependence muchworsebecause itrefusesto make work thecornerstone of welfare reform.Real welfare reform is about work. Opportu-nities for work. jobs that pay a living wage, jobtraining opportunitiestoprovideskillsnec-essary toearnalivingwage are long term so-lutions for a permanent and productive reformin our welfare system.Real welfare reform must emphasize the im-portance of work. Real welfare reform mustalso aid rather than punish children. In theUnited States, 14 million children 'ive in pov-erty. Passage of this legislation would add mil-lions more to that statistic. This welfare bill ispunitive and unrealistic.Abolishing the safety net for children, impos-ing famiiy caps, denying legal immigrants ben-efits, imposing arbitrary time limits and failingto provide adequate child care, health care,education, job training, and work opportunitiesfor people in need will thrust millions more intopoverty.Thisbillcuts almost $60 billion from thepoor in this country. These cuts will affect chil-dren whose parents are onwelfare. Thesecuts will trap countless women in abusive rela-tionships, with nowhere to turn\u2014without a re-alistic way to gain independence, gain work,and provide for their children.Welfare reform must be about education,job training. and work. We must keep familiestogether. rather than ripping them apart. Wecannot simply reduce the deficit at the cost ofour poorest Americans. This proposal has littlewisdom, conscience, or heart.Some of my colieagues will vote for this billand then wash their hands of welfare reform.H8327saying they have done their job. But the job ofwelfare reform is more complex and dire. Peo-ple living in poverty are not cardboard cutouts:they do not have the same stories, they do notneed the sameservices.This bII treats every-onealike, with unrealistic time limits and noreal lasting and effective plan to move welfarerecipients to work at a living wage.The denial of benefits to legal immigrants inthis legislation will do great harm to childrenand have a devastating impact on the healthcare system in our country. Only 3.9 percentof immigrants, who come to the United Statesto join their families or to work, rely on publicassistance compared to4.2 percentofnative-born citizens. According to the Urban Institute,immigrants pay $25 billion more annually thanthey receive in benefits. Yet the myth persiststhat welfare benefits are the primary purposefor immigration to the United States. Instead ofappreciatinglegalimmigrantsfortheirsignficant contributions to this, their adoptedcountry, thisbill blatantly punishes them, es-pecially young children and the elderly. It bansSSI and food stamps for virtually all legal im-migrants.Ittosses aside peoplewhopaytaxes, serve our country, and play by therules. This lacks compassion and commonsense.Ifwe want to achieve real welfare reform,we need to offer somelong-termsolutions tohelp people move up and out from the cycleof poverty. The current welfare system is notadequate, but this bill makes it far worse.I urge my colleagues to oppose theRepub-lican bill and work together for meaningful re-form that puts people to work and pulls themout of povertyforgood.Mr.RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Massa-chusetts [Mr. NEAL].(Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts askedand was given permission to revise andextend his remarks.)Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker,Iwant to thank the gen-tleman from New York [Mr. RANCEL]for yielding me this time.Let me offer a statistic this eveningthat I think is the most compellingnumber that has surrounded this de-bate for the better part of 18 months.There are 12.8 million people in Amer-ica who receive AFDC. Of that number,between 8 and 9 million of those recipi-ents are children.That is the issue that we can neverlose focus on. That is the issue thatought to motivate, and that is theissue that ought to drive these delib-erations. And yet after 18 months therehas only been one bipartisan initiativethat deals with welfare. The authorshaving been the former Governor ofDelaware, MIKE CASTLE, and the Con-gressman from Tennessee, JOHN TAN-NER. Only one bill had the support ofDemocrats and Republicans alike inthis institution, and it was the piece oflegislation that Bill Clinton said \"Iwill sign if you put that on my desk.\"But the posturing that has takenplace over this issue has delayed get-ting to a bill that withstands the scru-tiny that we all know welfare reformdeserves. Let me just read one sentencefrom a letter that was sent by theSpeaker of the House to the members H8328of the Republican Conference. He said,in suggesting they oppose the biparti-san bill, the following:'It is criticalthat Republicans maintain the upperhand on this issue by rejecting theGephardt substitute.\"That they maintain the upper hand,because that is what this debate hasbeen about. This debate has been aboutNovember. This debate has been abouttrying to get a bill down to the WhiteHouse that they know the President ofthe United States cannot sign. That ishow policy has been made, and that ishow it has evolved in this institution.And remember those words, it is impor-tant that the Republicans maintain theupper hand on this issue.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker. I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Louisi-ana [Mr. McCRERY].Mr. MCCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman for yielding me time.Mr. Speaker, just a couple of points.My good friend on the Committee onWays and Means, the gentleman fromMassachusetts [Mr. NEAL], is a goodmember of that committee and cer-tainly I listen when he speaks. He talksabout a bipartisan bill that was offeredhere on this floor, and he said that wasthe only bipartisan bill offered. Well,maybe it was the only bill with a bipar-tisan list of authors, but the fact isthat that bill only got 9 Republicans tovote for it on the floor. The Republicanbill got 30 Democrats to vote for it onthe floor. So the more bipartisan ofthose two bills, my colleagues, was notthe so-called bipartisan bill, it was theRepublican bill that in fact passed thisHouse.Another point. The gentleman fromMassachusetts, [Mr. NEAL] and the gen-tleman from Michigan [Mr.LEVIN] talked about how far Republicans havecome, and I appreciate their giving usthat. We have come a long way fromwhere we started. But so has the Presi-dent. To give him some credit, he hascome a long way.The first bill the President sent tothis House increased spending for wel-fare programs in this country. The billthat we hope he will sign now will savesomewhere on the order of $60 billion.So that is coming a long way on thepart of the President and the Demo-crats in this House. And I appreciatethat, too.Mr. Speaker, I think this is a classicexample of negotiators starting at thefar ends, coming to the middle, produc-ing a product that is a compromise butthat will move this country forward,that will bring families and childrenout of poverty finally in this country,give them some hope instead of lives ofdespair and hopelessness.So I want to congratulate both sidesof the aisle, the Republicans and theDemocrats, for compromising, comingto the middle, producing a bill that Ihope will become law.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker,I urge Members to support the Sabo amend-ment, and I yield back the balance ofmy time.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut [Ms. DELAURO].Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise instrong support of the motion to in-struct. Welfare conferees should do allin their power to ensure that the wel-fare conference agreement reinforcesour basic values of responsibility andwork and protects our Nation's chil-dren.The welfarebillthatpassedthe House last week woefully fell short onthese goals. Instead, the bill is toughon children and soft on requiring work.The Republican bill fails to meet thegoal of moving people from welfare towork by underfunding the work pro-gram by $10 billion. My Republican col-league from Connecticut talked aboutlocal government being the source ofjobs. I quite frankly do not understandhow New Haven and Hartford andBridgeport and Stanford, how they pro-vide jobs without raising the propertytax in Connecticut. And those in Con-necticut know that they are beingchoked by taxes.Let me just say that I urge the con-ferees to protect our children. Withoutthese protections attempts to reformwelfare will increase the number ofchildren living in poverty and fail tomove people off the welfare rolls andinto the work force. Protect innocentchildren, vote for the motion to in-struct.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30seconds to the gentleman from Califor-nia [Mr. WAxMANJ.Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman from New York foryielding me this time.I am astounded to hear the gen-tleman from Ohio [Mr. KASICH] talkabout a bill that will cut out the safetynet under the poor and then say inyears to come the poor will ask us tocut capital gains and maybe somethingwill trickle down.We need this motion toinstruct.Both the House and the Senate haveprotections for eligibility standards forMedicaid. Let us make sure they do notdrop it. That is what they did in thelast conference, and unless we get anyassurances to the contrary, let us in-struct our conferees to hold to the pro-visions that protect the rights of chil-dren at least to get health care, whichis both in the House and the Senatebill.Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, as weconclude the debate in support of themotion to instruct by the gentlemanfrom Minnesota [Mr. SAB0], I would like to say that I do not think that anyMember in this House could challengethe fact that if we want true welfarereform we have to talk about edu-cation, training, access to jobs and peo-ple working with dignity and withpride so that they do not have time todo the things that require dependencyon the Government.Maybe one day we will get to thoseissues instead of talking about punish-ment, cutting grants, mandatory sen-July 24, 1996tences, and make this country as greatas she can be with education, jobs, andproductivity. One day when we reachthat, that truly will be welfare reformand an opportunity for this great re-public to reach the heights that shecan reach.(Mr. MYERS of Indiana asked andwas given permission to speak out oforder.)PROvIDINGFOR FURTHERCONSIDERATIONOFH.R. 3816, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENTAPPROPRIATIONS ACT. 1997Mr.MYERS of Indiana.

FINDINGS.The Congress makes the following findings:(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful soci-ety which promotes the interests of children.(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood isintegral to successful child rearing and the well-being of chil-dren.(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families withchildren had a child support order established and, of that 54percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Ofthe cases enforced through the public child support enforcementsystem, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to familieswith dependent children (in this section referred to as \"AFDC\") 7has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of theserecipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of children receivingAFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is present.(A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiv-ing the number of children receiving AFDC bene-fits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, thetotal number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18has declined by 5.5 percent.(B) The Department of Health and Human Serviceshas estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDCbenefits within 10 years.(C) The increase in the number of children receivingpublic assistance is closely related to the increase in birthsto unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percent-age of live births to unmarried women increased nearlythreefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births iswell documented as follows:(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teenpregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991.The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percentfrom 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall preg-nancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent be-tween 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,900married women in 1980 to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent andif the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births bythe year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy mustaddress the issue of male responsibility, including statutoryrape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage preg-nancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and islinked to predatory sexual practices by men who are signifi-cantly older.(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's, the rate forgirls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.(B) Data indicates that at least half of the childrenborn to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Avail-able data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teen-age girls are fathered by men over age 20.(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a ma-jority of such mothers have histories of sexual and physicalabuse, primarily with older adult men.(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth onthe mother, the child, the family, and society are well docu-mented as follows: 8(A)Young women 17 and under who give birth outsideof marriage are more likely to go on public assistance andto spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These com-bined effects of \"younger and longer\" increase total AFDCcosts per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 1 7.year-olds.(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantiallyhigher risk of being born at a very low or moderately lowbirth weight.(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to ex-perience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as morechild abuse, and neglect.(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely tohave lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations,and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents them-selves.(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces thechances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.(F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more like-ly to be on welfare when they grow up.(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homeswere born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that ofchildren in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorceor tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficulttask of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative con-sequences of raising children in single-parent homes are welldocumented as follows:(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with chil-dren under 18 years of age have income below the nationalpovertylevel. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headedhouseholds with children under 18 years of age are belowthe national poverty level.(B) Among single-parent families, nearly 1/2ofthe mothers who never married received AFDC while only 1/5 of divorced mothers received AFDC.(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assist-ance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when theyreach adulthood than children not born into families re-ceiving welfare.(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatestrisk of bearing low-birth-weight babies.(E) The younger the single parent mother, the less like-ly she is to finish high school.(F) Young women who have children before finishinghigh school are more likely to receive welfare assistance fora longer period of time.(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births toteenage mothers under the aid to families with dependentchildren program, the food stamp program, and the medic-aid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child hasa negative effect on school performance and peer adjust-ment. 9(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cog-nitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greaterlikelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times morelikely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than arechildren from intact 2-parent families.(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youthaged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages ofsingle-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses withinthe State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived pri-marily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these in-carcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children inthe Nation's resident population were living with both par-ents.(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisisin our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention ofout-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birthare very important Government interests and the policy con-tained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (as amend-ed by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the cri- sis.SEC. 102.

STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFAREANDIMMIGRATION.The Congress makes the following statements concerning na-tional policy with respect to welfare and immigration:(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of UnitedStates immigration law since this country's earliest immigra-tion statutes.(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the UnitedStates that\u2014(A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend onpublic resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on theirown capabilities and the resources of their families, theirsponsors, and private organizations, and(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute anincentive for immigration to the United States.(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have beenapplying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State,and local governments at increasing rates.(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unen-forceable financial support agreements have proved wholly in-capable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the publicbenefits system.(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rulesfor eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigra-tion policy.(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the in-centive for illegal immigration provided by the availability ofpublic benefits.(7) With respect to the State authority to make determina-tions concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public ben-efits in this title, a State that chooses to follow the Federal clas-sification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for publicassistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restric-tive means available for achieving the compelling governmentalinterest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordancewith national immigration policy. 163SubtitleA\u2014Eligibility for Federal BenefitsSEC. 401.

The differences between the Housebill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed to in con-ference are noted below, except for clerical corrections, conformingchanges made necessary by agreements reached by the conferees,and minor drafting and clerical changes.EXPLANATION OF THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENTPRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENTThe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconcili-ation Act of 1996 puts in place the most fundamental reform ofwelfare since the program's inception. It promotes work over wel-fare and self-reliance over dependency, thereby showing true com-passion for those in America who need a helping hand, not a hand-out. It takes the historic step of eliminating a Federal entitlementprogram\u2014Aid to Families with Dependent Children\u2014and replacingit with a block grant that restores the States' fundamental role inassisting needy families. It makes substantial reforms in the FoodStamp Program, cracking down on fraud and abuse and applyingtough work standards. It reforms the Supplemental Security In-come ESSI] disability program to strengthen eligibility require-ments and eliminating incentives for coaching children to mis-behave so they can qualify for benefits. It makes sweeping reformsrelating to benefits for noncitizens, strengthening the principle thatimmigrants come to America to work, not to collect welfare bene-fits.The legislation does not abandon those Americans who trulyneed a helping hand. It retains protections for those who experi-ence genuine and intractable hardship. Above all, it recognizes thevulnerability of America's children. It guarantees that they willcontinue to receive the support they need. Indeed, by discouragingillegitimacy and promoting stable families, this bill vastly improvesthe prospects of children in welfare families. But for most, welfare(261) 262should mean temporary assistance for those striving to return toself-sufficiency.The legislation is the first of three reconciliation bills called forin the reconciliation directives contained in the fiscal year 1997budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 178). The measure will slow thegrowth of Federal welfare spending, but still maintain sufficient in-creases to protect vulnerable populations. According to preliminaryestimates, welfare spending would grow from approximately $83billion this year to about $107 billion in 2002, excluding the effectsof Earned Income Credit [EIC] outlays. When EIC outlays are in-cluded, the preliminary estimates show welfare spending growingfrom about $99 billion this year to roughly $128 billion in 2002.The Federal Government still will spend nearly $600 billion on wel-fare programs not counting the EIC, and nearly $700 billion whenthe EIC is included. Either way, when compared with Federalspending projections for the current welfare program, this legisla-tion will reduce the Federal budget deficit by about $55 billion to$56 billion over 6 years.The importance of these budgetary effects is matched by thehistoric transformation of the welfare program embraced in thislegislation. This measure rests on five principles that are the pil-lars of the welfare reform strategy in the 104th Congress:Welfare Should Not Be a Way of Life. The legislation assuresthat welfare will be a helping hand, not a lifetime handout, by im-posing a 5-year lifetime limit on benefits (although as many as 20percent of families may be allowed exceptions for conditions ofhardship).Work, Not Welfare. For the first time ever, able-bodied welfarerecipients will be required to work for their benefits. At least oneperson in every family must be working within 2 years after receiv-ing welfare or lose benefits, and States are required to have atleast half of their single-parent welfare recipients working by 2002.No More Welfare for Noncitizens and Felons. Most welfare (ex-cept emergency benefits) ends for most non-citizens during theirfirst 5 years in the United States. Exceptions are made for refu-gees, persons who have worked and paid taxes in the United Statesfor 10 years, and those who have served in the U.S. military.States will have the option of denying Medicaid eligibility to non-citizens who enter the United States after enactment. The legisla-tion also terminates benefits for fugitive felons fleeing from pros-ecution or imprisonment or violating parole, and offers financial in-centives to local corrections authorities to report persons incarcer-ated in their jails who are improperly receiving welfare checks.Power and Flexibility to the States. The best welfare solutionscome from those closest to the problems\u2014not from bureaucrats inWashington. The legislation creates broad cash welfare and childcare block grants providing maximum flexibility so that States canreform welfare in ways that are appropriate for them, and canmove families into jobs.Encouraging Personal Responsibility To Halt Rising Illegit-imacy Rates. As a result of the current welfare system, which dis-courages two-parent families, today's illegitimacy rate among wel-fare families is almost 50 percent and is rising. This legislationseeks to reverse the trend by boosting efforts to establish paternity 263and make fathers pay child support. As an added incentive, Statesthat reduce out-of-wedlock births will receive added cash grants.This legislation reforms welfare to make it more consistentwith fundamental American values\u2014by rewarding work and self-reliance, encouraging personal responsibility, and restoring a senseof hope in the future.TITLE I: BLOCK GRANT FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDYFAMILIES1. FINDINGSPresent lawNo provision.House billCongress finds that marriage is the foundation of a successfulsociety and an essential institution that promotes the interests ofchildren. Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood isintegral to successful child-rearing and the well-being of children.It is the sense of Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock preg-nancy and reduction on out-of-wedlock birth are very importantgovernment interests and that the policy outlined in the provisionsof this title is intended to address the crisis.Senate amendmentAdds that an effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancymust deal with the issue of male responsibility, including statutoryrape culpability and prevention. Finds protection of teenage girlsfrom pregnancy as well as predatory sexual behavior to be very im-portant Government interests.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.2.

BLOCK GRANT TO STATES; PURPOSEPresent lawTitle W\u2014A of the Social Security Act, which provides grants toStates for aid and services to needy families with children (AFDC),is designed to encourage care of dependent children in their ownhomes by enabling States to provide cash aid and services, main-tain and strengthen family life, and help parents attain maximumself-support consistent with maintaining parental care and protec-tion.House billBlock grants for temporary assistance for needy families(TANF), which replace Title W\u2014A of the Social Security Act, are es-tablished to increase the flexibility of States in operating a pro-gram designed to provide assistance to needy families; end depend-ence on government benefits by promoting job preparation, workand marriage; prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlockpregnancies; and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.This part shall not be interpreted to entitle any individual orfamily to assistance under any State program funded under thispart.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.4. ELIGIBLE STATES\u2014STATE PLAN REQUIREMENTSPresent lawA State must have an approved State plan for aid and servicesto needy families containing 43 provisions, ranging from single-agency administration to overpayment recovery rules. State plansexplain the aid and services that are offered by the State. Aid isdefined as money payments. For most parents without a childunder age 3, States must provide education, work, or trainingunder the JOBS program to help needy families with childrenavoid long-term welfare dependence. Note: work and education re-quirements of JOBS are subject to two conditions\u2014State resourcesmust permit them and the program must be available in the recipi-ent's political subdivision. To receive Federal funds, States mustshare in program costs. The Federal share of costs (matching rate)varies among States and is inversely related to the square of Stateper capita income. For AFDC benefits and child care, the Medicaidmatching rate is used. This rate now ranges from 50 percent to 78percent among States and averages about 55 percent. For JOBS ac-tivities, the rate averages 60 percent; for administrative costs, 50percent. The general JOBS participation rate, which expired Sep-tember 30, 1995, required 20 percent of employable (nonexempt)adult recipients to participate in education, work, or training under 265JOBS, in fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1996, at least one parentin 60 percent of unemployed-parent families must participate atleast 16 hours weekly in an unpaid work experience or other workprogram. States must restrict disclosure of information to purposesdirectly connected to administration of the program and to any con-nected investigation, prosecution, legal proceeding or audit. EachState must offer family planning services to all \"appropriate\" cases,including minors considered sexually active. State may not requireacceptance of these services. Regulations require that States deter-mine need and amount of eligibility on an objective and equitablebasis.House billAn \"eligible State\" is a State that, during the 2-year period un-mediately preceding the fiscal year, has submitted a plan to theSecretary of HHS that the Secretary has found includes a writtendocument describing how the State will:1. conduct a program, designed to serve all political sub-divisions in the State, that provides cash assistance to needyfamilies with (or expecting) children, and that provides parentswith work and support services to enable them to become self-sufficient;2. require a parent or a caretaker receiving assistance toengage in work as defined by the State once the parent or care-taker has received assistance for 24 months (whether or notconsecutive) or earlier;3. ensure that parents and caretakers engage in work ac-tivities as described below;4. take such reasonable steps as the State deems necessaryto restrict the use and disclosure of information about recipi-ents of assistance attributable to funds provided by the Federalgovernment.5. no provision.

States may opt out of this re-quirement by notifring the Secretary.11. outline how the State will conduct a program, designed toreach States and local law enforcement officials, the education sys-tem, and relevant counseling services, that provides education andtraining on the problem of statutory rape so that teenage preg-nancy prevention programs may be expanded to include men.Conference agreementIn general, the conference agreement follows the Senateamendment, except that the Senate recedes on requirements 2, 8,and 9. Requirement 10 is modified to provide that a State may optout of this requirement by submitting a letter from the Governorto the Secretary.5. ELIGIBLE STATES\u2014CERTIFICATIONSPresent lawStates must have in effect an approved child support program.States must also have an approved plan for foster care and adop-tion assistance.

GRANTS TO STATES\u2014FAMILY ASSISTANCE GRANTPresent lawAFDC entitles States to Federal matching funds. Current lawprovides permanent authority for appropriations without limit forgrants to States for AFDC benefits, administration, and AFDC-re-lated child care. Over the years, because of court rulings, AFDChas evolved into an entitlement for qualified individuals to receivecash benefits. In general, States must give AFDC to all personswhose income and resources are below State-set limits if they arein a class or category eligible under Federal rules. 268House billEach eligible State and Territory is entitled to receive a grantfrom the Secretary for each of 6 fiscal years (1996 through 2001)in an amount equal to the State family assistance grant for the fis-cal year.A State's family assistance grant is equal to the highest offormer Federal payments to the State for AFDC benefits, AFDCAdministration, Emergency Assistance, and JOBS during (1) fiscalyears 1992 through 1994, on average; (2) fiscal year 1994 plus,under certain circumstances, 85 percent of increased fiscal year1995 spending for emergency assistance, or (3) fiscal year 1995.If a State fails to make qualified State expenditures for eligiblefamilies under all State programs equal to at least 75 percent ofits fiscal year 1994 spending level (or at least 80 percent, if theState fails to meet its mandatory work requirements) for AFDCbenefits, AFDC Administration, Emergency Assistance, JOBS,AFDC-related child care, and at-risk child care, its family assist-ance grant is reduced by the shortfall (see the discussion of pen-alties below).Senate amendmentSame, except raises required State expenditures to 80 percentof fiscal year 1994 level.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.8. GRANTSTOSTATES\u2014GRANT STATES THAT REDUCE OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHSPresent lawNo provision.House billFor each fiscal year beginning with 1998, a State's grantamount is increased by 5 or 10 percent if the State \"illegitimacyratio\" is 1 or 2 percentage points, respectively, lower in that yearthan its 1995 illegitimacy ratio. Only States in which the rate ofabortion falls below the 1995 level are eligible for these additionalgrants.The term \"illegitimacy ratio\" means, during a fiscal year, thenumber of out-of-wedlock births that occurred in the State dividedby the number of births. In calculating grants, the Secretary mustdisregard any difference in illegitimacy ratios or abortion rates at-tributable to a change in State methods of reportmg data.Senate amendmentFollows the House bill, except that for each of 5 fiscal years(1999 through 2003) the Secretary shall make a grant of up to $20million for each of the 5 States that demonstrate the greatest de-crease in out-of-wedlock births during the most recent 2-year pe-riod for which the information is available. If fewer than 5 Statesare eligible, the amount of such grants shall be $25 million. 269Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, withthe modification that funds are available between 1999 and 2002.9. GRANTSTOSTATES\u2014SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FOR POPULATION IN-CREASES ANDLOWFEDERAL SPENDING PER POOR PERSON IN CER-TAIN STATESPresent lawThere is no adjustment for population growth. Instead, currentlaw provides unlimited matching funds. When AFDC enrollmentclimbs, Federal funding automatically rises.House billSubject to the eligibility criteria below, each qualilying State(for purposes of this section, the term \"State\" is limited to the 50States and the District of Columbia) is entitled to receive from theSecretary supplemental grants to assist in making cash welfarepayments for 4 years, fiscal years 1997-2000. For fiscal year 1997the supplemental grant equals 2.5 percent of Federal payments tothe qualilying State during fiscal year 1994 for AFDC benefits,AFDC Administration, Emergency Assistance, JOBS and AFDC-re-lated child care. For fiscal years 1998 through 2000, each qualifr-ing State is entitled to receive an amount equal to the supple-mental grant for the immediately preceding year plus, if it contin-ues to meet the eligibility criteria below, an annual increase. Statesthat no longer meet the qualification criteria are entitled to receivethe prior year's grant without increase. A State is a qualilyingState for a fiscal year if average Federal welfare spending per poorperson is less than the national average and State populationgrowth exceeds the average for all States. States must qualifr dur-ing fiscal year 1997 in order to qualifr during later years. CertainStates (i.e. those in which Federal welfare spending per poor per-son for fiscal year 1994 was less than 35 percent of the fiscal year1994 national average or in which population has increased bymore than 10 percent from April 1, 1990 to July 1, 1994) aredeemed to qualify for supplemental grants in each year betweenfiscal year 1997 and 2000. A total of $800 million is appropriatedfor this purpose. If this sum is insufficient for full supplementalgrants for all qualilying States, pro rata reductions will be made.(p. 244)Senate amendmentSame except for change in years of possible supplementalgrants: fiscal years 1998 through 2001 (instead of 1997 through2000). States must qualifr during fiscal year 1998 in order to. doso in later years.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment. 27010. TO REWARD HIGHPERFORMANCESTATESPresent lawNo performing\" States (i.e. those most successful inachieving the purposes of the block grant program) are entitled toreceive additional payments of up to five percent of their Statefamily assistance grant. The formula for measuring State perform-ance shall be developed by the Secretary in consultation with theNational Governors' Association and the American Public WelfareAssociation. A total of $0.5 bfflion is appropriated for high perform-ance bonuses to States during 5 fiscal years, 1999 through 2003,and average annual performance bonuses are to equal $100 million.Note.\u2014In addition, required maintenance-of-effort spending isto be reduced for States that achieve performance scores above athreshold set by the Secretary.Senate amendmentAppropriates twice as much money for high performance bo-nuses\u2014$1 billion\u2014and provides that average annual bonuses areto equal $175 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2002 and $300million for fiscal year 2003.Con ference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment re-garding funding (total of $1 billion) and follows the House bill re-garding the criteria for awarding bonuses to \"high performance\"States. The provision allowing certain high performance States tomeet a lower maintenance of effort requirement is dropped (seebelow).11. GRANTS TO STATES\u2014CONTINGENCY FUND FOR STATE WELFAREPROGRAMSPresent lawNo provision. Current law provides unlimited matching funds.House billTo assist States (for purposes of this section, the term \"State\"is limited to the 50 States and the District of Columbia) with in-creased welfare needs, the House proposal establishes a contin-gency fund for matching grants and appropriates up to $2 billionover a total of 5 fiscal years (1997 through 2001) for the fund. Eli-gible States may receive contingency fund payments totaling up to20 percent of their annual family assistance grant in any singleyear (in any single month, States cannot receive more than \u00bd2 of20 percent of the annual family assistance grant). States are tosubmit requests for payment of contingency funds, and the Sec-retary of the Treasury must make payments to eligible States inthe order in which requests are received. 271States are eligible to receive payments if State unemploymentis high (at or above 6.5 percent in the most recent three-month pe-riod) and rising relative to previous years (at least 10 percentabove the comparable level in either or both of two precedingyears). States also are eligible to receive payments if food stampparticipation in the State in the most recent three-month periodhas risen at least 10 percent from the average monthly number ofrecipients who would have participated in the comparable quarterof fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, as determined by the Sec-retary of Agriculture, if amendments made by this proposal to thefood stamp program (including optional food stamp block grant pro-visions) and to eligibility of noncitizens had been in effect through-out fiscal year 1994 and 1995. States must maintain 100 percentof historic State welfare spending (generally, the amount of Statefunds spent in fiscal year 1994 for AFDC benefits and administra-tion, AFDC-related child care, at-risk child care, Emergency Assist-ance, and JOBS) during years in which contingency fund paymentsare made, or repay an amount reflecting the shortfall. States mustshare in the cost of contingency funds at their fiscal year 1995Medicaid matching rate. To smooth their transition to recovery,States that have been receiving contingency fund payments willcontinue to receive payments for one month after they no longermeet the criteria described above.Senate amendmentContingency fund of $2 billion covers 4 fiscal years (1998through 2001) rather than 5. (Because of the Byrd rule, the provi-sion specifring that the CBO baseline is to assume that no grantwill be made after 2001 is deleted.)Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill, with themodification that, notwithstanding section 257(b)(2) of the Bal-anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the base-line shall assume that no grant shall be made under this sub-section after fiscal year 2001.12. GRANTSTOSTATES\u2014WORK PROGRAM GRANTPresent lawHouse billTo assist States in meeting the work requirements, eligibleStates may receive funds from a supplemental grant for the oper-ation of work programs. To be eligible, a State's total expendituresfor the fiscal year to meet work participation requirements mustexceed its total jobs spending for fiscal year 1994, its TANF workprograms must be coordinated with job training programs of TitleII of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), or its successor, andthe State must need the extra funds to meet TANF work require-ments or certify that it intends to exceed participation require-ments. The Secretary is to issue regulations for equitable distribu-tion of the grants. For these supplemental grants, $3 billion is au-thorized for fiscal year 1999 (amounts appropriated are authorizedto remain available until spent). 272Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference follows the Senate amendment.13. USE OF GRANTS\u2014IN GENERALPresent lawAFDC and JOBS funds are to be used in conformity with Stateplans. A State may replace a caretaker relative with a protectivepayee or a guardian or legal representative.House billGrants may be used in any manner reasonably calculated toaccomplish the purposes of this title, including activities now au-thorized under Titles IV-A and IV-F of the Social Security Act, orto provide low-income households with assistance in meeting homeheating and cooling costs.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.14. USE OF GRANTS\u2014LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE SPENDINGPresent lawNo provision.House billStates may not use more than 15 percent of the family assist-ance grant for administrative purposes.

USE OF GRANTS\u2014RECIPIENTS MOVING INTO THE STATE FROMANOTHER STATEPresent lawThe Social Security Act forbids the Secretary to approve a planthat denies AFDC eligibility to a child unless he has resided in theState for 1 year. The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated someState laws that withheld aid from persons who had not resided 273there for at least 1 year. It has not ruled on the question of payinglower amounts of aid for incoming residents.House billStates may impose program rules and benefit levels of theState from which a family moved if the family has lived in theState for fewer than 12 months.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and amendment.16. USE OF GRANTS\u2014TRANSFER OF FUNDSPresent lawNo provision.House billStates may transfer up to 30 percent of funds paid under thissection to carry out a State program under Part B(child welfare and family preservation) or Part E(foster care and adoption assist- ance), the social services block grant, and the child care and devel-opment block grant. Of the 30 percent that may be transferred, notmore than one-third (that is, not more than 10 percent of the totalblock grant) may be transferred into the Social Services BlockGrant. Amounts transferred to the Social Services Block Grantmust be spent on programs and services for children or their fami-lies.Senate amendmentStates may transfer up to 30 percent of funds only to the childcare and development block grant.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill, except thatthe provision allowing transfers into the child protection blockgrant, which was deleted, is dropped. The conference agreementadds the modification that funds transferred into the Title XX So-cial Services Block Grant must be spent on families with incomesthat do not exceed 200 percent of the poverty level (as determinedannually by the Federal Office of Management and Budget).17.

USE OF GRANTS\u2014IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC BENEFITTRANSFER SYSTEMPresent lawRegulations permit States to receive Federal reimbursementfunds (50 percent administrative cost-sharing rate) for operation ofelectronic benefit systems. To do so, States must receive advanceapproval from HHS and must comply with automatic data process-ing rules.House billStates are encouraged to implement an electronic benefittransfer (EBT) system for providing assistance under the State pro-gram funded under this part, and mayuse the grant for such pur- pose. (The food stamp title of the bill exempts any EBTsystem dis- tributing need-tested benefits established or administered by aState from Federal Reserve Board rules known collectively as \"Reg-ulation E.\" The most important Regulation E provision requiresthat lost/stolen benefits be restored; individuals with accounts areresponsible only for the first $50 of any loss, when reported in atimely fashion.)Senate amendmentSame (in Miscellaneous chapter). 275Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill. Confereesalso agreed to put comprehensive language on EBT and RegulationE in the food stamps section of this legislation.20.

The Secretary is to estimate each State'spayment on the basis of a report about expected expenditures fromthe State and to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury theamount estimated, adjusted if needed for overpayments or under-payments for any past quarter. The Secretary must notify Statesnot later than three months in advance of any quarterly paymentthat will be reduced to reflect payments made to Indian tribes inthe State. Under certain circumstances, overpayments to individ-uals no longer receiving temporary family assistance will be col-lected from Federal income tax refunds and repaid to affectedStates.Senate amendmentSame, except the provision regarding \"Collection of State Over-payments to Families from Federal Tax Refunds\" was deleted be-cause of the Byrd rule.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment. 27622.

MANDATORY WORK REQUIREMENTS\u2014CALCULATION OFPARTICIPATION RATESPresent lawParticipation families are cakulated for eachmonth. A State's rate, expressed as a percentage, equals the num-ber of actua' JOBS participants divided by the number of AFDC re-cipients required to participate (nonexempt from JOBS). In cal-culating a State's overall JOBS participation rate, a standard of 20hours per week is used. The welfare agency is to count as partici-pants the largest number of persons whose combined and averagedhours in JOBS activities during the month equa' 20 per week.Participation rates for two-parent families for a month equa'the number of parents who participate divided by the number ofprincipal earners in AFDC-UP families (but excluding families whoreceived aid for two months or less, if one parent engaged in inten-sive job search).House bill1. The participation rate (for all families and for two-parentfamilies) for a State for the fiscal year is the average of the partici-pation rates for each month in the fiscal year. The monthly partici-pation rate for a State is a percentage obtained by divithng thenumber of families receiving assistance that include an adult whois engaged in work by the number of families receiving assistance(not counting those subject to a recent sanction for refusa' to work).2. The required participation rate for a year is to be adjusteddown one percentage point for each percentage point that the aver-age monthly caseload is below fiscal year 1995 levels, unless theSecretary finds that the decrease was required by Federa' law orresults from changes in State eligibility criteria (which must beproved by the Secretary). The Secretary is to prescribe regulationsfor this adjustment. 2783. States have the option of counting individuals receiving as-sistance under a tribal fan\u00f1ly assistance plan towards the Statework participation requirement.4. States have the option of not requiring single parents of chil-dren under age one to engage in work and may disregard theseparents in determining work participation rates.Senate amendment1. Same.2. Same.3. Same.4. Allows a parent to receive this exemption only for a total of12 months, whether or not consecutive.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, witha modification. For item 1, the conference agreement includesminor heads of households along with adults in the calculation ofState work participation rates (in both the numerator and denomi-nator of the calculation).25. MANDATORY WORK REQUIREMENTS\u2014OPTIONAL INDIVIDUALRESPONSIBILITY PLANPresent lawStates must make an initial assessment of the educational,child care, and other supportive service needs, and of the skills andemployability of each JOBS participant. In consultation with theparticipant, the agency shall develop an employability plan for theparticipant, which shall not be considered a contract. After thesesteps, the State agency may require the participant to negotiateand enter into an agreement that specifies matters such as the par-ticipant's obligations, duration of participation, and services to beprovided.House billStates are required to make an initial assessment of the skills,work experience, and employability of each recipient of assistingunder the block grant who is over age 17 or has not completed highschool or the equivalent, and is not attending secondary school.States may develop individual responsibility plans setting forth em-ployment goals, obligations of the individual, and services the Statewill provide. In addition to other penalties that may apply, Statesmay reduce assistance to families that include an individual whofails to comply with the terms of such plans.Senate amendmentRequires States to require TANF recipient families to enterinto a personal responsibility agreement, as developed by the State.The agreement means a binding contract. It is to include a nego-tiated individual time limit for benefit eligibility, outline steps thefamily and State will take to move the family to self-sufficiency,provide for sanctions if the individual fails to sign the agreement 279or comply with its terms and shall be invalid if the State fails tocomply with its terms.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.26.

MANDATORY WORK REQUIREMENTS\u2014PENALTIES AGAINSTINDIVIDUALSPresent lawFor failure to meet JOBS requirements without good cause,AFDC benefits are denied to the offending parent and payments forthe children are made to a third party. In a two-parent family, fail-ure of one parent to meet JOBS requirements without good causeresults in denial of benefits for both parents (unless the other par-ent participates) and third-party payment on behalf of the children.Repeated failures to comply bring potentially longer penalty peri-ods.House billIf an adult recipient refuses to engage in required work, theState shall reduce the amount of assistance to the family pro rata(or more, at State option) with respect to the period of work re-fusal, or shall discontinue aid, subject to good cause and other ex-ceptions that the State may establish. In addition, if block grant re-cipients fail to meet any of the work requirements, States may ter-minate their coverage under the Medicaid program. A State maynot penalize a single parent caring for a child under age eleven forrefusal to work if the parent proves a demonstrated inability to ob-tain needed child care for specified reasons.Senate amendmentSame as House provision except that Senate does not providethat States may end Medicaid for block grant recipients who failto meet any of the work requirements in the act.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill with themodification that, if benefits are terminated under the work re-quirements of section 407 of this part, States may end Medicaid eli-gibility for adults made ineligible, but not children in the family.In addition, modifies the House bill and Senate amendment so thatStates may not penalize a single parent caring for a child underage 6 for refusal to work if the parent proves a demonstrated in-ability to obtain needed child care for specified reasons.29. MANDATORY WORKREQUIREMENTS\u2014NONDISPLACEMENT IN WORKACTiVITIESPresent lawUnder JOBS law, no work assignment may displace any cur-rently employed worker or position (including partial displacementsuch as a reduction in hours of non-overtime work, wages, or em-ployment benefits). Nor may a JOBS participant fill a position va-cant because of layoff or because the employer has reduced theworkforce with the effect of creating a position to be subsidized.House billIn general, an adult in a family receiving N\u2014A assistance mayfill a work vacancy. However, no adult in a Title N\u2014A work activ- 283ity shall be employed or assigned when another person is on layofffrom the same or a substantially equivalent job, or when the em-ployer has terminated the employment of a regular worker or oth-erwise caused an involuntary reduction of its workforce in order tofill the vacancy thus created with a subsidized worker. This provi-sion does not preempt or supersede any State or local law providinggreater protection from displacement.Senate amendmentIn general, an adult in a family receiving N\u2014A assistance mayfill a work vacancy. However, no N\u2014A work assignment maydisplace a currently employed worker (including any partial dis-placement such as a reduction in hours of overtime work, wages,or employment benefits), impair an existing contract or collectivebargaining agreement, or result in ending a regular worker's em-ployment. States must establish and maintain a grievance proce-dure, including hearing opportunity, for resolving complaints andproviding remedies for violations. This section does not preempt orsupersede any State or local law providing greater protection fromdisplacement.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill, with themodification to include a requirement that States establish a griev-ance procedure for workers adversely affected pursuant to this sec-tion.30.

Block grant funds may not be used to provide cash benefitsfor a child born to a recipient of cash welfare benefits or an individ-ual who received cash benefits at any time during the 10-month pe-riod ending with the birth of the child. This prohibition does notapply to children born as a result of rape or incest. Block grantfunds can be used to provide noncash (voucher) assistance for par-ticular goods and services suitable for the care of the child.2. States that pass a law specifically exempting their own pro-grams from this national rule may use Federal funds to increasecash benefits for families that have additional children while onwelfare.3. If a State has a family cap policy under a section 1115 waiv-er on the date of enactment, it may continue terms of those familycaps.Senate amendment1.

States may give hardship exemptions in a fiscal year toup to 20 percent of their average monthly caseload, including indi-viduals who have been battered or subjected to sexual abuse (butStates are not required to exempt these persons). When consideringan individual's length of stay on welfare, States are to count onlytime during which the individual received assistance as the headof household or as the spouse of the household head. Any Statefunds spent to aid persons no longer eligible for TANF after 5 yearsof benefits may be counted toward the maintenance-of-effort re-quirement.This part shall not be interpreted to prohibit a State fromusing State funds not originating with the Federal government toaid families that lose eligibility for the block grant program be-cause of the 5-year time limit.Senate amendmentSame, except adds an exemption from the time limit for per-sons who live on a reservation of an Indian tribe with a population 289of at least 1,000 persons and with at least 50 percent of the adultpopulation not employed.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment on the time limit policy, and includes the Senateprovision on exceptions for certain Indian populations and theHouse provision specifying States' authority to use State and localfunds to provide support, including cash assistance, after 5 years.(For a description of other Federal funds that may be providedsuch families, see the conference agreement description of item 33above.)42.

PROHIBITIONS; REQUIREMENTS\u2014MEDICAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREDTO BE PROVIDED FOR FAMILIES BECOMING INELIGIBLE FOR ASSIST-ANCE DUE TO INCREASED EARNINGS OR COLLECTION OF CHILD SUP-PORTPresent lawStates must continue Medicaid (or pay premiums for employer-provided health insurance) for 6 months to a family that losesAFDC eligibility because of hours of, or income from, work of thecaretaker relative, or because of loss of the earned income dis-regard after 4 months of work. States must offer an additional 6months of medical assistance, for which it may require a premiumpayment if the family's income after child care expenses is abovethe poverty guideline. For extended medical aid, families must sub-mit specified reports. States must continue Medicaid for 4 monthsto those who lose AFDC because of increased child or spousal sup-port. 291House billStates must provide medical assistance for 1 year to familiesthat become ineligible for block grant assistance because of in-creased earnings, provided they received cash block grant assist-ance in at least 3 of the 6 months before the month in which theybecame ineligible and their income is below the poverty line. Forpurposes of determining family income to compare with the Federalpoverty line, States have the authority to set their own definitionof income except that income from the Earned Income Tax Credit must be disregarded. States also must provide medical assistancefor 4 months to families that leave welfare (after being enrolled forat least 3 of the previous 6 months) because of increased incomefrom child support or spousal support.Senate amendmentSame as current law.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen..ate amendment, with the modification that income restrictions con-form to current law. Transitional Medicaid coverage is extendedthrough the life of the block grant.46. PROHIBITIONS; REQUIREMENTS\u2014MEDICAIDPresent lawStates must provide Medicaid to all AFDC recipients and tosome AFDC-related groups who do not receive cash aid. Examplesinclude persons who do not receive a monthly payment because theamount would be below $10 (Federal law prohibits payments thissmall) and persons whose payments are reduced to zero in orderto recover previous overpayments.States must continue Medicaid for specified periods for certainfamilies who lose AFDC benefits. If the family loses AFDC benefitsbecause of increased earnings or hours of employment, Medicaidcoverage must be extended for 12 months. (During the second 6months a premium may be imposed, the scope of benefits may belimited, or alternate delivery systems may be used.) If the familyloses AFDC because of increased child or spousal support, coveragemust be extended for 4 months. States are also required to furnishMedicaid to certain two-parent families whose principal earner isunemployed and who are not receiving cash assistance because theState has set a time limit on their AFDC coverage.House billStates must provide medical assistance to persons who wouldbe eligible for AFDC cash benefits (under terms of July 16, 1996)if that program still were in effect.A State may increase the AFDC income standard above thatof July 16, 1996 by the percentage increase in the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers over the same period. 292Senate amendmentStates must provide medical assistance to persons who wouldbe eligible for AFDC (under terms of July 1, 1996) as if that pro-gram were still in effect. Simplifies standards to make it easier forStates to administer. States would have the option to: (1) lowertheir income standard, but not below those in effect on May 1,1988; and (2) use income and resource standards and methodolo-gies that are less restrictive than those in effect on July 1, 1996.In order to provide States additional flexibility, States may use1 application form and may administer the program through eitherits title IV agency or its title XIX agency.Families would receive transitional Medicaid benefits as undercurrent law.Con ference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment, with the modification that States must retain theincome and resource standards they had for AFDC eligibility onJuly 16, 1996. States may terminate Medicaid eligibility for anadult who is terminated from TANF because of failure to work.Conferees are concerned that the conference agreement may re-quire States to maintain a dual-eligibility determination system.Conferees, however, lacked adequate information to determine thetrue nature and extent of this problem. Thus, conferees recommendthat the Committees on Ways and Means, Commerce, and Financeconduct hearings in the next Congress to carefully examine thisproblem. If the committees determine that the dual-eligibility sys-tem does in fact impose additional administrative costs on theStates,CongressshouldconsiderFederal-Statecost-sharing schemes and other legislative solutions. In the meantime, confereesare establishing a fund of $.5 billion in entitlement spending thatwill be distributed among States that experience additional admin-istrative expenses directly attributable to conducting a dual-eligi-bility system.47.

Family members or depend-ents of the individual are exempted, and individuals made ineli-gible would continue to be eligible for emergency benefits, includingemergency medical services.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, withthe modification that only TANF block grant benefits and foodstamps are denied and that the denial is only for a felony offense.50. PENALTIES\u2014USE OF GRANT IN VIOLATION OF THIS PARTPresent lawIf the Secretary finds that a State has failed to comply withthe State plan, she is to withhold all payments from the State (orlimit payments to categories not affected by noncompliance).House billNote.\u2014Before imposing any of the penalties below, the Sec-retary shall notify the State of the violation and allow the State toenter into a corrective action plan (item 60). Also, except for items 29451 and 52, the Secretary may not impose a penalty if she finds thatthe State has reasonable cause for its failure to comply.If an audit finds that a State has used Federal funds in viola-tion of the purposes of this title, the Secretary shall reduce the fol-lowing quarter's payment by the amount misused.

PENALTIES\u2014FAILURE TO SATISFY MINIMUM PARTICIPATION RATESPresent lawIf a State fails to achieve the JOBS participation rate specifiedin law, the Secretary is to reduce to 50 percent the Federal match-ing rate for JOBS activities and for full-time personnel costs, whichnow ranges from 60 percent to 78 percent among States. (However,see item 54, \"Corrective Compliance,\" for penalty waiver authority.)House billIf a State fails to achieve its required work participation ratefor the fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the following year'sblock grant by up to 5 percent, with the percentage cut based onthe \"degree of noncompliance.\" The Secretary has the authority toreduce the penalty if the State economy is in recession. In addition,failure to meet required work participation requirements results inStates' being required to maintain 80 percent of historic spendinglevels, instead of 75 percent. 295Senate amendmentImposes a graduated penalty on each consecutive failure by aState to meet the work participation standard. The Senate amend-ment also does not authorize the Secretary to reduce the penaltyfor States with high unemployment.Con ference agreementOn penalty amounts, the conference agreement follows theSenate amendment with the modification that there is a graduatedpenalty of 5 percent the first year and 2 percent in addition to theprior year's penalty in subsequent years (so annual penalties inconsecutive years would be 5 percent in the first year, 7 percentin the second, 9 percent in the third, and so on), with a maximumcumulative penalty of 21 percent. The conference agreement followsthe House bill in authorizing the Secretary to reduce the penaltyfor needy States as defined under the contingency fund eligibilitycriteria.53.

FAILURE OF ANY STATE TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVEL OF HISTORICEFFORTPresent lawNo provision.House billIf in fiscal years 1997 through 2001 a State fails to spend asum equal to at least 75 percent of its \"historic level\" (generally fis-cal year 1994 expenditures for AFDC, JOBS, Emergency Assist-ance, AFDC-related child care and \"at-risk\" child care) of Statespending on specified programs, the Secretary shall reduce the fol-lowing year's family assistance grant (that is, in fiscal years 1998through 2002) by the difference between the 75 percent require-ment and what the State actually spent. However, States that failto meet required work participation rates must maintain 80 per-cent of historic spending levels.Qualified State expenditures that count toward the 75 percent(or 80 percent) spending requirement are all State-funded expendi-tures under all State programs that provide any of the followingassistance to families eligible for family assistance benefits (andthose no longer eligible because of the 5-year time limit or ineli-gible because of the Act's treatment of noncitizens): cash and child 297care assistance; educational activities designed to increase self-suf-ficiency, job training and work (excluding any expenditure for pub-lic education in the State other than expenditures for services orassistance to a member of an eligible family that is not generallyavailable to other persons); administrative costs not to exceed 15percent of the total amount of qualified State expenditures; andany other use of funds reasonably calculated to accomplish pur-poses of the temporary family assistance. Qualified expendituresexclude spending from funds transferred from State or local pro-grams except those that exceed the amount expended in 1996 orthose for which the State is entitled to a Federal payment underformer AFDC/JOBS law (as in effect just before enactment).The Secretary is to reduce the 75 percent (or 80 percent) main-tenance of effort spending requirement by up to eight percentagepoints (i.e., to no lower than 67 percent or 72 percent) for Statesthat achieve \"high performance\" scores, based on a threshold to beset by the Secretary, for achieving the goals of the program of Tem-porary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).Senate amendmentRaises required State spending to 80 percent of the \"historic\"level for all States. (Does not distinguish between States that meetor fail work participation rates in maintenance-of-effort rule.)The Secretary is to reduce the 80 percent spending require-ment by up to 8 percentage points (to as low as 72 percent) forStates with high performance scores. (This provision was deletedbecause of the Byrd rule.)Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows thee House bill, except thatthe provision allowing reduction of required State spending forhigh performance States is dropped. Conferees note that Statespending on programs that promote self-sufficiency and preventwelfare dependence including, but not limited to, substance abusetreatment, teen parenting and pregnancy prevention shall count to-wards a State's maintenance of effort. The fact that such funds arespent through or by State or local education agencies should notprevent their being counted towards the State maintenance of ef-fort.57. SUBSTANTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE OF STATE CHILD SUPPORTENFORCEMENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTSPresent lawIf a State child support program is found not to be in substan-tial compliance with Federal requirements, the Secretary is to re-duce AFDC matching funds: by 1\u20142 percent for first finding of non-compliance, by 2\u20143 percent for second consecutive finding, and by3\u20145 percent for third or subsequent finding. (See \"corrective compli-ance\" item 54.) Note: State child support plans must undertake toestablish paternity of children born out-of-wedlock for whom AFDCis sought, and AFDC law requires the parent to cooperate in estab-lishing paternity. Failure to cooperate makes the parent ineligiblefor AFDC. 298House billIf a State child support enforcement program is found by re-view not to have complied with Title IV\u2014D requirements, and theSecretary determines that the program is not in compliance at thetime the finding is made, then the Secretary will reduce the State'squarterly block grant payment for each quarter during which theState is not in compliance. For the first finding of noncompliance,the reduction will be between one and two percent; for the secondconsecutive finding, between two and three percent; for the thirdor subsequent findings, between three and five percent. Non-com-pliance of a technical nature is to be disregarded.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.58.

ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO PUERTO RICO, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, GUAM,AND AMERICAN SAMOA; LIMITATION ON TOTAL PAYMENTSPresent lawUnder current law, the territories are eligible for 75 percentmatching grants for their expenditures on cash welfare for adultassistance (i.e., assistance for needy persons who are aged, blind,or disabled), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),Emergency Assistance (EA), Foster Care and Adoption Assistance,the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program, and theFamily Preservation program (Title W\u2014B, subpart 2). These match-ing grants are limited by caps on Federal payments. The territoriesalso receive grants under the child welfare services (Title W\u2014B,subpart 1) program.[Note.\u2014Although eligible, territories do not claim foster careand adoption assistance funds.]The law places a ceiling on total payments for AFDC, aid toneedy aged, blind or disabled adults, and foster care and adoptionassistance to Puerto Rico\u2014$82 million, the Virgin Islands\u2014$2.8 315million, Guam\u2014$3.8 million, and (AFDC, fostercare, and adoption assistance)\u2014$ 1 million.House billThe proposal retains but increases aggregate welfare ceilingsin each of the territories and combines the individual programsinto a single block grant. The new ceilings would apply to aggre-gate spending for cash aid for needy families (TANF), cash aid toneedy aged, blind or disabled adults, and child protection (childwelfare and family preservation services). The proposal authorizesterritories to transfer funds among these programs. Maximum po-tential fiscal year payments (including both the capped mandatorypayments listed below and the authorization of discretionarygrants) are as follows: Puerto Rico\u2014$113.5 million; Samoa\u2014$1.3 million.To receive mandatory ceiling amounts (capped entitlements),territories must spend from their own funds in a fiscal year asmuch as they did in fiscal year 1995 for cash aid to needy families,and cash aid to needy aged, blind, or disabled adults. Federalmatching funds, at a 75 percent rate, would reimburse territoriesfor expenditures above their fiscal year 1995 base level, but belowthe Federal cap. Mandatory ceiling amounts: Puerto Rico\u2014$105.5million; proposal retains but increases aggregate welfare ceilingsin each of the territories and, in effect, combines all but IV\u2014B serv-ices (child welfare services and family preservation) into a singleblock grant. The new ceilings would apply to aggregate spendingfor cash aid for needy families (TANF), cash aid to needy aged,blind, or disabled adults, and foster care and adoption assistance.The proposal authorizes territories to transfer funds among theseprograms.To receive the new ceiling amounts (capped entitlements), ter-ritories must spend from their own funds in a fiscal year for cashaid to needy families and cash aid to needy aged, blind, or disabledadults. Federal matching funds, at a 75 percent rate, would reim-burse them for expenditures above their fiscal year 1995 base level,but below the Federal cap. Mandatory ceiling amounts\u2014PuertoRico\u2014$102 million; Guam, $4.7 million; Virgin Islands, $3.6 mil-lion; and American Samoa, $1 million. (Current law and fundingarrangements are retained for IV\u2014B programs.)Conference agreementThe conference agreement generally follows the Senate amend-ment. The conference agreement adds a provision specifying thatStates may use Title XX funds to provide vouchers to families los-ing TANF block grant assistance due to a State-imposed familycap. 31691. REPEAL OF PROVISIONS REQUIRING DISAPPROVAL OF MEDICAIDPLANS OR DENIAL OF SAME MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO STATES THATREDUCE WELFARE PAYMENT LEVELSPresent lawIf a State reduces AFDC \"payment levels\" below those of May1, 1988, the Secretary shall not approve the State's Medicaid plan.If a State reduces AFDC payment levels below those of July 1,1987, Medicaid matching funds shall be disallowed for requiredservices to pregnant women and children not enrolled in AFDC buteligible for Medicaid on grounds of low income.House billThe House proposal repeals provisions that impose Medicaidsanctions upon States that reduce AFDC payment levels.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.92. SERVICES PROVIDED BY CHARITABLE, RELIGIOUS, AND PRWATEORGANIZATIONSPresent lawThe Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Actprohibits use of any financial assistance provided through anygrant or contract for any sectarian purpose or activity. In general,the CCDBG requires religious nondiscrimination, but it does allowa sectarian organization to require employees to adhere to its reli-gious tenets and teachings.House billThe proposal authorizes States to administer and provide fam-ily assistance services (and services under SSI, the child protectionblock grant program, foster care, adoption assistance, and inde-pendent living programs) through contracts with charitable, reli-gious, or private organizations. Under this provision, religious orga-nizations would be eligible, on the same basis as any other privateorganization, to provide assistance as contractors or to accept cer-tificates and vouchers so long as their programs are implementedconsistent with the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.States may pay recipients by means of certificates, vouchers, orother forms of disbursement that are redeemable with such privateorganizations.The proposal provides that, except as otherwise allowed bylaw, a religious organization administering the program may notdiscriminate against beneficiaries on the basis of religious belief orrefusal to participate in a religious practice. States must provide analternative provider for a beneficiary who objects to the religiouscharacter of the designated organization. 317Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt any pro-vision of a State constitution or State statute that prohibits or re-stricts the expenditure of State funds in or by religious organiza-tions.Senate amendmentSame provision, except that administration by charitable, reli-gious, and private organizations is authorized only for TANF and SSI.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.93.

MODIFICATIONS TO THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR CERTAIN LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS PROGRAMSPresent lawThe Family Support Act of 1988 (Sec. 505) directed the Sec-retary to enter into agreement with between 5 and 10 nonprofit or-ganizations to conduct demonstrations to create job opportunitiesfor AFDC recipients and other low-income persons. For theseprojects, $6.5 million was authorized to be appropriated for eachfiscal year, 1990\u20141992.House billThe word \"demonstration\" is struck from the description ofthese projects; the projects are converted to grant status.

DEFINITION AND ELIGIBILITY RULESDefinition of Childhood DisabilityPresent lawThere is no definition of childhood disability in the statute. In-stead, the statute prescribes that an individual under age 18 shallbe considered disabled for purposes of eligibility for SSI if that indi-vidual has an impairment or combination of impairments of \"com-parable severity\" which would result in a work disability in anadult. This impairment or combination of impairments must be ex-pected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of notless than 12 months.House billThis section adds a new statutory definition of childhood dis-ability: an individual under the age of 18 is considered as disabledif the individual has a medically determinable physical or mentalimpairment, which results in marked and severe functional limita-tions, and which can be expected to result in death or which haslasted or can be expected to last for at least a continuous periodof not less than 12 months.The Commissioner shall ensure that the combined effects of allphysical or mental impairments of an individual are taken into ac-count in determining whether an individual is disabled. In addi-tion, the Commissioner shall ensure that the regulations prescribedby these provisions provide for the evaluation of children who can- not be tested because of their young age. 328Senate amendmentIdentical to House bill regarding the new definition of disabil-ity. The provision does not include language regarding combinedimpairments or evaluation of children who cannot be tested be-cause of their young age.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment. Theconferees intend that only needy children with severe disabilitiesbe eligible for SSI, and the Listing of Impairments and other cur-rent disability determination regulations as modified by these pro-visions properly reflect the severity of disability contemplated bythe new statutory definition. In those areas of the Listing that in-volve domains of functioning, the conferees expect no less than twomarked limitations as the standard for qualification. The confereesare also aware that SSA uses the term \"severe\" to often mean\"other than minor\" in an initial screening procedure for disabilitydetermination and in other places. The conferees, however, use theterm \"severe\" in its common sense meaning.In addition, the conferees expect that SSA will properly ob-serve the requirements of section 1614(a)(3)(F) of the Social Secu-rity Act and ensure that the combined effects of all the physical ormental impairments of an individual under age 18 are taken intoaccount in making a determination regarding eligibility under thedefinition of disability. The conferees note that the 1990 SupremeCourt decision in Zebley established that SSA had been previouslyremiss in this regard. The conferees also expect SSA to continue touse criteria in its Listing of Impairments and in the application ofother determination procedures, such as functional equivalence, toensure that young children, especially children too young to be test-ed, are properly considered for eligibility of benefits.The conferees recognize that there are rare disorders or emerg-ing disorders not included in the Listing of Impairments that maybe of sufficient severity to qualif' for benefits. Where appropriate,the conferees remind SSA of the importance of the use of functionalequivalence disability determination procedures.Nonetheless, the conferees do not intend to suggest by this def-inition of childhood disability that every child need be especiallyevaluated for functional limitations, or that this defmition createsa supposition for any such examination. Under current proceduresfor writing individual listings, level of functioning is an explicitconsideration in deciding which impairment, with certain medicalor other findings, is of sufficient severity to be included in the List-ing. Nonetheless, the conferees do not intend to limit the use offunctional information, if reflecting sufficient severity and is other-wise appropriate.The conferees contemplate that Congress may revisit the defi-nition of childhood disability and the scope of benefits, if deemedappropriate, and have provided elsewhere for studies on these is-sues. 329Requests for Comments To Improve Disability EvaluationPresent lawNo provision.House billNo provision.Senate amendmentRequires the Commissioner to request comments in the Fed-eral Register regarding improvements to the disability evaluationand determination procedures for individuals under age 18 to en-sure the comprehensive assessment of such individuals.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill (i.e., no provi-sion).Changes to SSI Childhood RegulationsPresent lawUnder the disability determination process for children, SSAfirst determines if a child meets or equals the \"Listing of Impair-ments\" in Federal regulations. Under the Listings that relate tomental disorders, maladaptive behavior may be scored twice, in do-mains of social functioning and of personal/behavior functioning.Under the disability determination process for children, indi-viduals who do not meet or equal the Listing of Impairments aresubject to an \"Individualized Functional Assessment\" (IFA). Thisassessment is intended to determine whether, or to what extent, achild can engage in age-appropriate activities. If the child cannot,the child may be determined disabled.House billThe Commissioner of Social Security shall eliminate referencesin the Listing of Impairments to maladaptive behavior among med-ical criteria for evaluation of mental and emotional disorders in thedomain of personal/behavioral function.The Commissioner of Social Security shall discontinue use ofthe Individualized Functional Assessment for children set forth inthe Code of Federal Regulations.Senate amendmentIdentical to House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.Medical Improvement Review Standard as it Applies to IndividualsUnder the Age of 18Present lawNo provision. 330House billThis section contains technical modifications to the medical im-provement review standard based on the new definition of child-hood disability.Senate amendmentIdentical to the House bill.Conference House bill.Effective datesPresent lawNo provision.House billChanges in eligibility rules apply to new applications andpending requests for administrative or judicial review on or afterthe date of enactment, without regard to whether regulations havebeen issued.No later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the Commis-sioner shall redetermine the eligibility of any child receiving bene-fits on the date of enactment who would lose eligibility under theseprovisions.Benefits of current recipients will continue until their redeter-mination. Should a child be found ineligible, their benefits will endfollowing redetermination.No later than January 1, 1997, the Commissioner must notiirindividuals whose eligibility for SSI benefits will terminate.The Commissioner must report to Congress within 180 days re-garding progress made in implementing the SSI children's provi-sions.The Commissioner shall submit final regulations to the Com-mittees of jurisdiction of Congress for their review at least 45 daysbefore they become effective.Senate amendmentIdentical to the House bill, except that benefits of current re-cipients will continue until the later of July 1, 1997, or the dateof redetermination. The Senate amendment also includes languagewhich authorizes and appropriates $300 million to remain availablefor fiscal years 1997\u20141999 for the Commissioner to conduct con-tinuing disability reviews (CDRs) and redeterminations.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment withmodification to authorize additional administrative funding forSSA: $150 million for fiscal year 1997 and $100 million for fiscalyear 1998, to conduct SSI CDRs and redeterminations. The fundingof CDRs and redeterminations will follow the usual appropriationprocess, except that the amounts above a base funding level willnot be subject to discretionary caps. 3317. ELIGIBILITY REDETERMINATIONS AND CONTINUING DISABILITYREVIEWSPresent lawCurrent law specifies that the Commissioner must reevaluateunder adult disability criteria the eligibility of at least one-third ofSSI children who turn age 18 in each of the fiscal years 1996, 1997,and 1998 (the CDR must be completed before these children reachage 19) and report to Congress no later than October 1, 1998.House billAt least once every 3 years the Commissioner must conductCDRs of children receiving SSI benefits. For children who are eligi-ble for benefits and whose medical condition is not expected to im-prove, the requirement to perform such reviews does not apply (un-less the Commissioner decides otherwise). At the time of review theparent or guardian must present evidence demonstrating that therecipient is and has been receiving appropriate treatment for herdisability.The eligibility for all children qualifying for SSI benefits mustbe redetermined using the adult criteria within 1 year after turn-ing 18 years of age. The review will be considered a substitute forany other review required under the changes made in this section.The \"minimum number of reviews\" and the \"sunset\" provisions ofsection 207 of the Social Security Independence and Program Im-provements Act of 1994 are eliminated.A review must be conducted 12 months after the birth of achild whose low birth weight is a contrib.iting factor to the child'sdisability. At the time of review, the parent or guardian mustpresent evidence demonstrating that the recipient is and has beenreceiving appropriate treatment for his disability.Senate amendmentIdentical to House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.8. ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTSDisposal of Resources for Less Than Fair Market ValuePresent lawNo provision.House billThe bill delays eligibility for any child applicant whose parentsor guardians, in order to qualif' a child for benefits, dispose of as-sets for less than fair market value within 36 months of the dateof application. The provision stipulates that any assets in a trustin which the child (i.e., parent or representative payee) has controlshall be considered assets of the child and subject to the 36-month\"look-back\" rule. The delay (in months) is equal to the amount ofassets divided by the SSI standard benefit. This provision is effec-tive 90 days after the date of enactment. 332Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment (i.e.,no provision).Treatment of Assets Held in TrustPresent lawNo provision. Under current operating policy, a trust is notconsidered a resource if the SSI recipient does not have the legalauthority to access trust assets for his or her own food, clothing,or shelter.House billStipulates that in determining the resources of an individualunder the age of 18, a revocable trust (i.e., the person has legal ac-cess to the assets of the trust) must be considered a resource avail-able to the individual. In the case of an irrevocable trust, if thereare any circumstances under which payment from the trust couldbe made to or for the benefit of the individual, then such paymentsare to be considered as resource available to the individual. TheCommissioner of Social Security may waive these provisions if theCommissioner determines, on the basis of criteria prescribed in reg-ulations, that such application would be an undue hardship on theindividual.Any earnings of, or additions to the principal of the trustwould be considered income if they are available to the individual.Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows Establish AccountPresent lawNo provision.House billRequires the representative payee (i.e., the parent) of an indi-vidual under the age of 18 to establish an account in a financialinstitution for the receipt of past-due SSI payments if the lump-sum payment amounts to more than 6 times the maximum month-ly SSI payment (including any State supplement). A representativepayee shall use the funds in the account for the following expenses:education or job skills training; personal needs assistance; specialequipment or housing modifications related to the child's disability;medical treatment; appropriate therapy or rehabilitation; or anyother item or service that the Commissioner determines is appro-priate. 333Once the account is established the representative payee maydeposit any past-due benefits owed to the recipient and any otherfunds representing an SSI underpayment provided the amount ismore than the maximum monthly SSI benefit payment.The funds in these accounts would not be counted as a re-source and the interest and other earnings on the account wouldnot be considered income in determining SSI eligibility.Senate amendmentIdentical to House provision, except allows rather than man-dates the representative payee to use the funds for allowable ex-penses.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.9. REDUCTION IN CASH BENEFITS PAYABLE TO INSTITUTIONALIZED IN-DWIDUALSWHOSEMEDICAL COSTS ARE COVERED BY PRIVATE IN-SURANCEPresent lawFederal law stipulates that when individuals enter a hospitalor other medical institution for which more than half of the bill ispaid by the Medicaid program, their monthly SSI benefit is reducedto $30 per month. This personal needs allowance is intended to payfor small personal expenses, with the cost of maintenance and med-ical care provided by the Medicaid program.House billChildren in medical institutions whose medical costs are cov-ered by private insurance would be treated the same as childrenwhose bills are currently paid by Medicaid (that is, their monthlySSI cash benefit would be reduced to $30 per month).Senate amendmentIdentical to House bill.Conference bill.10.

INSTALLMENT PAYMENT OF LARGE PAST-DUE SSI lawNo provision.House billIf an individual is eligible for past-due benefits (after any with-holding for reimbursement to a State for interim assistance) in anamount which exceeds 12 times the maximum monthly benefit pay-able to an eligible individual (currently $470) or couple (currently$705) (plus any State supplementary payments), benefits will bepaid in 3 installments made at 6-month intervals. The first andsecond installments may not exceed 12 times the maximum month-ly benefit payable. Installment caps may be extended by certaindebt (food, clothing, shelter, or medically necessary services, sup-plies, or equipment, or medicine) or the purchase of a home. In-stallment payments shall not apply to individuals whose medicalimpairment is expected to result in death in 12 months or for anindividual who is ineligible and is likely to remain ineligible for thenext 12 months.Senate amendmentIdentical to House bill.Con ference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.12. RECOVERY OF SSI OVERPAYMENTS FROM SOCIAL SECURITYBENEFITSPresent lawGenerally, when an overpayment of Social Security benefits ismade, recovery shall be made by adjusting future payments or byrecovering the overpayment from the individual.House billIf the Commissioner is unable to recover the overpaymentthrough future payment adjustments or direct recovery, the Com-missioner may decrease any OASI or SSDI payment to the individ-ual or their estate. As a result of this action, no individual may be-come eligible for SSI or eligible for increased SSI benefits.Senate amendmentNo provision (due to Senate rule).Conference agreementThe conference agreement Senate amendment (i.e.,no provision).13.

REPEAL OF MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLETO OP'rIONAL STATE PROGRAMS FOR SUPPLEMENTATION OF SSIPresent lawSince the beginning of the SSI program, States have had theoption to supplement (with State funds) the Federal SSI payment.Subsequently, Congress passed section 1618 of the Social SecurityAct which in effect requires States to maintain such optional pay-ments or lose eligibility for Medicaid funds. The purpose of section1618 of the Social Security Act was to encourage States to passalong to SSI recipients the amount of any Federal SSI benefit in-crease. Section 1618 allows States to comply with the \"pass along/maintenance of effort\" provision by either maintaining their Statesupplementary payment levels at or above March 1983, levels or bymaintaining their supplementary payment spending so that totalannual Federal and State expenditures will be at least equal towhat they were in the prior 12-month period, plus any Federalcost-of-living increase, provided the State was in compliance forthat period.House billRepeals the maintenance of effort requirements in Section1618 applicable to optional State programs for supplementation ofSSI benefits, effective on the date of enactment.Senate amendmentNo provision, due to Senate rule.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment (i.e.,no provision).Subtitle D-\u2014Studies Regarding Supplemental Security IncomeProgram15.

The report isdue May 30 of each year.Senate amendmentIdentical to the House bill, except stipulates the inclusion ofhistorical and correct data on prior enrollment by public assistancerecipients.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill, modified bythe Senate amendment.16. STUDY OF DISABILITY DETERMINATION PROCESSPresent lawNo provision.House billWithin 90 days of enactment, the Commissioner must contractwith the National Academy of Sciences or another independent en-tity to conduct a comprehensive study of the disability determina-tion process for SSI and SSDI. The study must examine the valid-ity, reliability and consistency with current scientific standards ofthe Listings of Impairments cited above. The study must also ex-amine the appropriateness of the definitions of disability (and pos-sible alternatives) used in connection with SSI and SSDI, and theoperation of the disability determination process, including the ap-propriate method of performing comprehensive assessments of indi-viduals under age 18 with physical or mental impairments. TheCommissioner must issue interim and final reports of the findingsand recommendations of the study within 18 months and 24months, respectively, from the date of contract for the study.Senate amendmentNo provision, due to Senate rule.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment (i.e.,no provision).17.

STATE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENTSERVICESPresent lawStates are required to establish paternity for children born outof wedlock if they are recipients of AFDC or Medicaid, and to ob-tain child and spousal support payments from noncustodial parentsof children receiving AFDC, Medicaid benefits, or foster care main-tenance payments. States must provide child support collection orpaternity determination services to persons not otherwise eligibleif the person applies for services. Federal law requires States to co-operate with other States in establishing paternity (if necessary),locating absent parents, collecting child support payments, and car-rying out other child support enforcement functions. In cases inwhich a family ceases to receive AFDC, States are required to pro-vide appropriate notice to the family and continue to provide childsupport enforcement services without requiring the family to applyfor services or charging an application fee.House billStates must provide services, including paternity establish-ment and establishment, modification, or enforcement of supportobligations, for children receiving benefits from the Temporary As-sistance for Needy Families block grant (TANF), foster care main-tenance payments, Medicaid, and any child of an individual whoapplies for services. States must enforce support obligations withrespect to children in their caseload and the custodial parents ofsuch children. States must also make child support enforcementservices available to individuals not residing within the State onthe same terms as to individuals residing within the State. Statesare not required to provide services to families if the State deter-mines, taking into account the best interests of the child, that goodcause and other exceptions exist. The provision also makes minortechnical amendments to section 454 of the Social Security Act. 339When a family ceases to receive benefits from the TANF blockgrant, States are required to provide appropriate notice to the fam-ily and continue to provide child support enforcement serviceswithout requiring the family to apply for services or charging anapplication fee.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.3. DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONSPresent lawFederal law requires that child support collections be distrib-uted as follows: First, up to the first $50 in current support is paidto the AFDC family (a \"disregard\" that does not affect the family'sAFDC benefit or eligibility status). Second, the Federal and Stategovernments are reimbursed for the AFDC benefit paid to the fam-ily in that month. Third, if there is money left, the family receivesit up to the amount of the current month's child support obligation.Fourth, if there is still money left, the State keeps it to reimburseitself for any arrear\u00e0ges owed to it under the AFDC assignment(with appropriate reimbursement of the Federal share of the collec-tion to the Federal government). If no arrearages are owed theState, the money is used to pay arrearages to the family; such mon-eys are considered income under the AFDC program and would re-duce the family's AFDC benefit.To receive AFDC benefits, a custodial parent must assign tothe State any right to collect child support payments. This assign-ment covers current support and any arrearages that accumulatedbefore the family began receiving public assistance, and lasts aslong as the family receives AFDC.Some States are required to provide monthly supplementalpayments to AFDC recipients who have less disposable income nowthan they would have had in July 1975 because child support ispaid to the child support agency instead of directly to the family.States required to make these supplemental payments are often re-ferred to as \"fill-the-gap\" States. These States pay less assistancethan their full need standard, and allow recipients to use child sup-port income to make up all or part of the difference between thepayment made by the State and the State's need standard.House billSeveral changes in the distribution rules under current law aremade by this section. The $50 passthrough to families on AFDC isended. In addition, distribution law is changed so that, beginningOctober 1, 1997, collections on arrearages that accumulated during.the period after the family leaves welfare are paid to the State ifthe money was collected through the ta'c intercept and to the fam-ilyif collected by any other method. Distribution law is also changed so that beginning on October ]., 2000,arrearages that ac- 340cumulated during the period before the family went on welfare arepaid to the State if the money was collected through the tax inter-cept and to the family if collected by any other method. (Note:These new distribution rules require the assignment rules for pre-welfare arrearages to be changed so that families can be paid be-fore States if the money was collected by a method other than thetax intercept; this change in assignment rules was made in TitleI and will appear in Section 408(a)(3)(B) of the revised Social Secu-rity Act.)By October 1, 1998, the Secretary must present a report to theCongress concerning whether post-assistance arrearages have helped mothers avoid welfare and about the effectiveness of thenew distribution rules.All assignments of support in effect when this proposal is en-acted must remain in effect.Several terms, including \"assistance from the State\", \"Federalshare\", and \"State share\" are defined.If States retain less money from collections than they retainedin fiscal year 1995, States are allowed to retain the amount re-tained in fiscal year 1995.If a State follows a \"fill-the-gap\" policy as outlined above, thatState can continue to distribute funds to the family up to theamount needed to fill the gap. The provision also clarifies the rela-tionship between gap payments and both the $50 passthrough andthe State hold harmless provision.Senate amendmentSame, except Senate adds provision that stipulates that in thecase of a family receiving assistance from an Indian tribe, the Statedistribute any support collected in accordance with any cooperativeagreement between the State and the tribe.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with the modification that the House accepts theSenate provision on Indian tribes.4. PRIVACY SAFEGUARDSPresent lawFederal law limits the use or disclosure of information concern-ing recipients of Child Support Enforcement Services to purposesconnected with administering specified Federal welfare programs.House billStates must implement safeguards against unauthorized use ordisclosure of information related to proceedings or actions to estab-lish paternity or to establish or enforce child support. These safe-guards must include prohibitions on release of information wherethere is a protective order or where the State has reason to believea party is at risk of physical or emotional harm from the otherparty. This provision is effective October 1, 1997. 341SenateamendmentSame.ConferenceagreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.5.

STATE CASE REGISTRYPresent lawFederal law requires that wage withholding be administeredby a public agency capable of documenting payments of supportand tracking and monitoring such payments.Federal law requires that child support orders be reviewed andadjusted, as appropriate, at least once every three years.House billStates must establish an automated State Case Registry thatcontains a record on each case in which services are being providedby the State agency, as well as each support order established ormodified in the State on or after October 1, 1998.The Registry may be established by linking local case registriesof support orders through an automated information network.The registry record will contain data elements on both parents,such as names, Social Security numbers and other uniform identi-fication numbers, dates of birth, case identification numbers, andany other data the Secretary may require.Each case record will contain the amount of support owed'under the order and other amounts due or overdue (including inter-est or late payment penalties and fees), any amounts that havebeen collected and distributed, the birth date of any child for whom 342the order requires the provision of support, and the amount of anylienimposed by the State.The State agency operating the registry will promptly estab-lish, maintain, update and regularly monitor case records in theregistry with respect to which services are being provided underthe State plan. Establishing and updating support orders will bebased on administrative actions and administrative and judicialproceedings and orders relating to paternity and support, as wellas on information obtained from comparisons with Federal, State,and local sources of information, information on support collectionsand distributions, and any other relevant information.The State automated system will be used to extract data forpurposes of sharing and matching with Federal and State databases and locator services, including the Federal Case Registry ofChild Support Orders, the Federal Parent Locator Service, andTemporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid agencies,as well as for conducting intrastate and interstate information com-parisons.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.7. COLLECTION ANDDISBURSEMENTOF SUPPORT PAYMENTSPresent lawNo provision, but States may provide that, at the request of ei-ther parent, child support payments be made through the childsupport enforcement agency or the agency that administers theState's income withholding system regardless of whether there isan arrearage. States must charge the parent who requests childsupport services a fee equal to the cost incurred by the State forthese services, up to a maximum of $25 per year.House billBy October 1, 1998, State child support agencies are requiredto operate a centralized, automated unit for collection and disburse-ment of payments on child support orders enforced by the childsupport agency and payments on orders issued after December 31,1993 which are not enforced by the State agency but for which in-come is subject to withholding. The specifics of how States will es-tablish and operate their State Disbursement Unit must be out-lined in the State plan.The State Disbursement Unit must be operated directly by theState agency, by two or more State agencies under a regional coop-erative agreement, or by a contractor responsible directly to theState agency. The State Disbursement Unit may be established bylinking local disbursement units through an automated informationnetwork if the Secretary agrees that the system will not cost more,take more time to establish, nor take more time to operate than asingle State system. All States, including those that operate a 343linked system, must give employers one and only one location forsubmitting withheld income.The Disbursement Unit must be used to collect and disbursesupport payments, to generate orders and notices of withholding toemployers, to keep an accurate identification of payments, topromptly distribute money to custodial parents or other States, andto furnish parents with a record of the current status of supportpayments (but States are not responsible for records that predatepassage of this legislation). The Unit shall use automated proce-dures, electronic processes, and computer-driven technology to themaximum extent feasible, efficient, and economical.The Disbursement Unit must distribute all amounts payablewithin 2 business days after receiving money and identifring infor-mation from the employer or other source of periodic income, if suf-ficient information identiiring the payee is provided. The Unit mayretain arrearages in the case of appeals until they are resolved.States must use their automated system to facilitate collectionand disbursement including at least:(1) transmission of orders and notices to employers within2 days after receipt of the withholding notice;(2) monitoring to identify missed payments of support; and(3) automatic use of enforcement procedures when pay-ments are missed.It is the sense of Congress that in establishing a centralizedunit for the collection of support payments, a State should choosethe method of compliance which best meets the needs of parents,employers, and children.This section of the proposal will go into effect on October 1,1998. States that process child support payments through localcourts can continue court payments until September 30, 1999.Senate amendmentSame, except Senate uses the term \"wages\" rather than \"in-come\" throughout this section. Senate amendment does not includethe provision that States are not responsible for records that pre-date passage.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with the modification that the term \"income\" rath-er than \"wages\" is used throughout this section. In addition, theHouse \"sense of the Congress\" language was deleted.8. STATE DIRECTORY OF NEW HIRESPresent lawIn general, no provision. Section 1128 of the Social SecurityAct is an antifraud provision which excludes individuals and enti-ties that have committed fraud from participation in medicare andState health care programs. Section 1128A pertains to civil mone-tary penalties and describes the appropriate procedures and pro-ceedings for such penalties. 344House billState plans must include the provision that by October 1, 1997States will operate a Directory of New Hires.Establishment. States are required to establish a State Direc-tory of New Hires to which employers and labor organizations inthe State must furnish a report for each newly hired employee, un-less reporting could endanger the safety of the employee or com-promise an ongoing investigation or intelligence mission as deter-mined by the head of an agency. States that already have new hirereporting laws may continue to follow the provisions of their ownlaw until October 1, 1998, at which time States must conform toFederal law.Employer Information. Employers must furnish to the StateDirectory of New Hires the name, address, and Social Securitynumber of every new employee and the name, address, and identi-fication number of the employer. Multistate employers that reportelectronically or magnetically may report to the single State theydesignate; such employers must notifr the Secretary of the nameof the designated State. Agencies of the U.S. Government must re-port directly to the National Directory of New Hires (see below).Timing of Report. Employers must report new hire informationwithin 20 days of the date of hire. Employers that report new hireselectronically or by magnetic tape must file twice per month; re-ports must be separated by not less than 12 days and not morethan 16 days.Reporting Format and Method. The report required in this sec-tion will be made on a W\u20144 form or the equivalent, and can betransmitted magnetically, electronically, or by first class mail. Thedecision of which reporting method to use is up to employers.Civil Money Penalties on Noncomplying Employers. Stateshave the option of setting a civil money penalty which shall be notless than $25 or $500 if, under State law, the failure is the resultof a conspiracy between the employer and employee.Entry of Employer Information. New hire information must beentered in the State data base within 5 business days of receiptfrom employer.Information Comparisons. By May 1, 1998, each State Direc-tory of New Hires must conduct automated matches of the SocialSecurity numbers of reported employees against the Social Securitynumbers of records in the State Case Registry being enforced bythe State agency and report the name, address, Social Securitynumber, and the employer name, address, and identification num-ber on matches to the State child support agency.Transmission of Information. Within 2 business days of theentry of data in the registry, the State must transmit a withhold-ing order directing the employer to withhold wages in accord withthe child support order. Within 3 days, the State Directory of NewHires must furnish employee information to the National Directoryof New Hires for matching with the records of other State case reg-istries. The State Directory of New Hires must also report quar-terly to the National Directory of New Hires information on wagesand unemployment compensation taken from the quarterly reportto the Secretary of Labor now required by Title III of the Social Se-curity Act. 345Other Uses of New Hire Information. The State child supportagency must use the new hire information to locate individuals forpurposes of establishing paternity as well as establishing, modify-ing, and enforcing child support obligations. New hire informationmust also be disclosed to the State agency administering the Tem-porary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, UnemploymentCompensation, Food Stamp, SSI, and territorial cash assistanceprograms for income eligibility verification, and to State agenciesadministering unemployment and workers' compensation programsto assist determinations of the allowability of claims. State andlocal government agencies must participate in quarterly wage re-porting to the State employment security agency unless the agencyperforms intelligence or counterintelligence functions and it is de-termined that wage reporting could endanger the safety of the em-ployee or compromise an ongoing investigation or intelligence mis-sion. States may disclose new hire information to agencies workingunder contract with the child support agency.Disclosure to Certain Agents. States using private contractorsare allowed to share information obtained from the Directory ofNew Hires with private entities working under contract with theState agency. Private contractors must comply with privacy safe-guards.Senate amendmentSame, except under \"Other Uses of New Hire Information\"Senate Amendment has no provision allowing States to share infor-mation with agencies working under contract with the State.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with the modification that the House provision al-lowing private entities working under contract with child supportagencies access to child support information is included.9. AMENDMENTS CONCERNING INCOME WITHHOLDINGPresent lawSince November 1, 1990, all new or modified child support or-ders that were being enforced by the State's child support enforce-ment agency have been subject to immediate income withholding.If the noncustodial parent's wages are not subject to income with-holding (pursuant to the November 1, 1990 provision), such par-ent's wages would become subject to withholding on the date whensupport payments are 30 days past due. Since January 1, 1994, thelaw has required States to use immediate income withholding fornearly all new or modified support orders, regardless of whether aparent has applied for child support enforcement services. Thereare two circumstances in which income withholding does not apply:(1) one of the parents argues, and the court or administrative agen-cy agrees, that there is good cause not to do so, or (2) a writtenagreement is reached between both parents which provides for analternative arrangement. States must implement procedures underwhich income withholding for child support can occur without theneed for any amendment to the support order or for any further ac- 346tion by the court or administrative entity that issued the order.States are also required to implement income withholding in fullcompliance with all procedural due process requirements of theState, and States must send advance notice to each nonresidentparent to whom income withholding applies (with an exception forsome States that had income withholding before enactment of thisprovision that met State due process requirements). States mustextend their income withholding systems to include out-of-Statesupport orders.House billStates must have laws providing that all child support ordersissued or modified before October 1, 1996, which are not otherwisesubject to income withholding, will become subject to income with-holding immediately if arrearages occur, without the need for judi-cial or administrative hearing. State law must also allow the childsupport agency to execute a withholding order through electronicmeans and without advance notice to the obligor. Employers mustremit to the State Disbursement Unit, in a format prescribed bythe Secretary, income withheld within five working days after thedate such amount would have been paid to the employee. Employ-ers cannot take disciplinary action against employees subject towage withholding. All child support orders subject to income with-holding, including those which are not part of the State W-D pro-gram; must be processed through the State Disbursement Unit. Inaddition, States must notifr noncustodial parents that income with-holding has commenced and inform them of procedures for contest-ing income withholding. Employers must follow the withholdingterms and conditions stated in the order; if the terms and condi-tions are not specified employers should follow those of the Statein which the obligor lives. The section includes a definition of in-come to be used in interstate withholding and several conformingamendments to section 466 of the Social Security Act.Senate amendmentSame, except employers must remit income withheld to theState disbursement unit within 7 rather than 5 days. There arealso minor wording differences in the rules relating to income with-holding. There is also a difference in the House and Senate defini-tions of income.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with the modifications that employers are given 7days rather than 5 days to remit withheld income and that theHouse definition of income is followed. With respect to this provi-sion, \"timely-paid\" is demonstrated by postmark, or in the case ofelectronic payment, the date the electronic transmission is provento have been initiated by the employer.10. LOCATOR INFORMATION FROM INTERSTATE NETWORKSPresent lawNo provision. 347House billAll State and the Federal Child Support Enforcement agenciesmust have access to the motor vehicle and law enforcement locatorsystems of all States.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.11. EXPANSION OF THE FEDERAL PARENT LOCATORSERVICEPresent lawThe law requires that the Federal Parent Locator Service(FPLS) be used to obtain and transmit information about the loca-tion of any absent parent when that information is to be used forthe purpose of enforcing child support. Federal law also requiresdepartments or agencies of the United States to be reimbursed forcosts incurred in providing requested information to the FPLS.Information Comparisons and Other Disclosures. Upon re-quest, the Secretary must provide to an \"authorized person\" (i.e.,an employee or attorney of a child support agency, a court with ju-risdiction over the parties involved, the custodial parent, the legalguardian, or the child's attorney) the most recent address and placeof employment of any nonresident parent if the information is con-tained in the records of the Department of Health and HumanServices or can be obtained from any other department or agencyof the United States or of any State. The FPLS also can be usedin connection with the enforcement or determination of child cus-tody, visitation, and parental kidnapping. Federal law requires theSecretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-ices to enter into an agreement to give the FPLS prompt access towage and unemployment compensation claims information usefulin locating a noncustodial parent or his employer.Fees. \"Authorized persons\" who request information fromFPLS must be charged a fee.Restriction on Disclosure and Use. Federal law stipulates thatno information shall be disclosed if the disclosure would contravenethe national policy or security interests of the United States or theconfidentiality of Census data.Quarterly Wage Reporting. The Secretary of Labor must pro-vide prompt access by the Secretary of HHS to wage and unem-ployment compensation claims information and data maintained bythe Labor Department or State employment security agencies.House billThe purposes of the Federal Parent Locator Service are ex-panded. For the purposes of establishing parentage, establishingsupport orders or modifring them, or enforcing support orders, theFederal Parent Locator Service will provide information to locateindividuals who owe child support or against whom an obligationis sought or to whom such an obligation is owed. Information in the 348FPLS includes Social Security number, address, name and addressof employer, wages and employee benefits (including informationabout health care coverage), and information about assets anddebts. The provision also clarifies the statute so that parents withorders providing child custody or visitation rights are given accessto information from the FPLS unless the State has notified the Sec-retary that there is reasonable evidence of domestic violence orchild abuse or that the information could be harmful to the custo-dial parent or child.The Secretary is authorized to set reasonable rates for reim-bursing Federal and State agencies for the costs of providing infor-mation to the FPLS and to set reimbursement rates that State andFederal agencies that use information from the FPLS must pay tothe Secretary.Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders. Establisheswithin the FPLS an automated registry known as the Federal CaseRegistry of Child Support Orders. The Federal Case Registry con-tains abstracts of child support orders and other information speci-fied by the Secretary (such as names, Social Security numbers orother uniform identification numbers, and State case identfficationnumbers) to identifr individuals who owe or are owed support, orfor or against whom support is sought to be established, and theState which has the case. States must begin reporting this informa-tion in accord with regulations issued by the Secretary by October1,1998.National Directory of New Hires. This provision establisheswithin the FPLS a National Directory of New Hires containing in-formation supplied by State Directories of New Hires. When fullyimplemented, the Federal Directory of New Hires will contain iden-tifying information on virtually every person who is hired in theUnited States. In addition, the FPLS will contain quarterly datasupplied by the State Directory of New Hires on wages and Unem-ployment Compensation paid. The Secretary of the Treasury musthave access to information in the Federal Directory of New Hiresfor the purpose of administering section 32 of the Internal RevenueCode and the Earned Income Credit. The information for the Na-tional Directory of New Hires must be entered within 2 days of re-ceipt, and requires the Secretary to maintain within the NationalDirectory of New Hires a list of multistate employers that chooseto send their report to one State and the name of the State so elect-ed. The Secretary must establish a National Directory of NewHires by October 1, 1997.Information Comparisons and Other Disclosures. The Sec-retary must verify the accuracy of the name, Social Security num-ber, birth date, and employer identification number of individualsin the Federal Parent Locator Service with the Social Security Ad-ministration. The Secretary is required to match data in the Na-tional Directory of New Hires against the child support order ab-stracts in the Federal Case Registry at least every 2 working daysand to report information obtained from matches to the State childsupport agency responsible for the case within 2 days. The informa-tion is to be used for purposes of locating individuals to establishpaternity, and to establish, modifr, or enforce child support orders.The Secretary may also compare information across all components 349of the FPLS to the extent and with the frequency that the Sec-retary determines will be effective. The Secretary will share infor-mation from the FPLS with several potential users including Stateagencies administering the Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami-lies program, the Commissioner of Social Security (to determine theaccuracy of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income),and researchers under some circumstances.Fees. The Secretary must reimburse the Commissioner of So-cial Security for costs incurred in performing verification of SocialSecurity information and States for submitting information on NewHires. States or Federal agencies that use information from FPLSmust pay fees established by the Secretary.Restriction on Disclosure and Use. Information from the FPLScannot be used for purposes other than those provided in this sec-tion, subject to section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (con-fidentiality and disclosure of returns and return information).Information Integrity and Security. The Secretary must estab-lish and use safeguards to ensure the accuracy and completenessof information from the FPLS and restrict access to confidential in-formation in the FPLS to authorized persons and purposes.Federal Government Reporting. Each department of the U.S.must submit the name, Social Security number, and wages paidthe employee on a quarterly basis to the FPLS. Quarterly wage re-porting must not be filed for a Federal or State employee perform-ing intelligence or counter-intelligence functions if it iS determinedthat filing such a report could endanger the employee or com-promise an ongoing investigation.Conforming Amendments. This section makes several conform-ing amendments to Titles III and 1V of the Social Security Act, tothe Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and to the Internal RevenueCode. Among the more important are that: State employment secu-rity agencies are required to report quarterly wage information tothe Secretary of HHS or suffer financial penalties and that privateagencies working under contract to State child support agenciescan have access to certain specified information from IRS recordsunder some circumstances.Requirement for Cooperation. The Secretaries of HHS andLabor must work together to develop cost-effective and efficientmethods of accessing information in the various directories re-quired by this title; they must also consider the need to ensure theproper and authorized use of wage record information.Senate amendmentSame, except under \"Information Comparisons and Other Dis-closures\" the Senate amendment drops the requirement that theSocial Security Administration must determine the accuracy ofpayments under the Social Security and SSI programs.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with the modification that the agreement followsthe Senate provision dropping the requirement that the Social Se-curity Administration determine the accuracy of Social Securityand SSI payments. 35012. COLLECTION AND USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS FOR USE INCHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENTPresent lawFederal law requires that in the administration of any law in-volving the issuance of a birth certificate, States must require eachparent to furnish their Social Security number for the birthrecords. The State is required to make such numbers available tochild support agencies in accordance with Federal or State law.States may not place Social Security numbers directly on birth cer-tificates.House billStates must have procedures for recording the Social Securitynumbers of applicants on the application for professional licenses,commercial driver's licenses, occupational licenses, and marriage li-censes. States must also record Social Security numbers in therecords of divorce decrees, child support orders, and paternity de-termination or acknowledgment orders. Individuals who die willhave their Social Security number placed in the records relating tothe death and recorded on the death certificate. There are severalconforming amendments to title II of the Social Security Act.Senate amendmentSame, except difference in conforming amendment to Social Se-curity Act.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.Subtitle C\u2014Streamlining and Uniformity of Procedures13. ADOPTION OF UNIFORM STATE LAWSPresent lawStates have several options available for pursuing interstatechild support cases including direct income withholding, interstateincome withholding, and long-arm statutes which require the useof the court system in the State of the custodial parent. In addition,State use the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act(URESA) and the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Sup-port Act (RURESA) to conduct interstate cases. Federal law im-poses a Federal criminal penalty for the willful failure to pay past-due child support to a child who resides in a State other than theState of the obligor. In 1992, the National Conference of Commis-sioners on State Uniform Laws approved a new model State law forhandling interstate child support cases. The new Uniform Inter-state Family Support Act (UIFSA) is designed to deal with deser-tion and nonsupport by instituting uniform laws in all 50 Statesthat limit control of a child support case to a single State. This ap-proach ensures that only one child support order from one court orchild support agency will be in effect at any given time. It alsohelps to eliminate jurisdictional disputes between States that areimpediments to locating parents and enforcing child support orders 351acrossState lines. As of February 1996, 26 States and the Districtof Columbia had enacted UIFSA.House billBy January 1, 1998, all States must have enacted the UniformInterstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) and any amendments offi-cially adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uni-form State Laws before January 1, 1998, and have the proceduresrequired for its implementation in effect. States are allowed flexi-bility in deciding which specific interstate cases are pursued byusing UIFSA and which cases are pursued using other methods ofinterstate enforcement. States must provide that an employer thatreceives an income withholding order follow the procedural rulesthat apply to the order under the laws of the State in which thenoncustodial parent works.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with additional clarifying provisions that confereesagreed to include at the request of the National Conference of Com-missioners of Uniform State Laws. The Commissioners asked con-ferees to make two changes in House and Senate provisions. Morespecifically, conferees agreed to drop language in the section on in-come withholding in interstate cases and to insert replacement lan-guage approved by the Commissioners. This provides specific in-structions to employers for rules to follow in processing interstatecases. Employers following these instructions are also providedwith legal immunity.14. IMPROVEMENTS TO FULL FAITH AND CREDIT FOR CHILD SUPPORTORDERSPresent lawFederal law requires States to treat past-due support obliga-tions as final judgments that are entitled to full faith and creditin every State. This means that a person who has a support orderin one State does not have to obtain a second order in anotherState to obtain support due should the debtor parent move fromthe issuing court's jurisdiction. P.L. 103-383 restricts a State court's ability to modify a support order issued by another Stateunless the child and the custodial parent have moved to the Statewhere the modification is sought or have agreed to the modifica-tion.House billThe provision clarifies the definition of a child's home State,makes several revisions to ensure that full faith and credit lawscan be applied consistently with UIFSA, and clarifies the rules re-garding which child support orders States must honor when thereis more than one order. 352Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.15. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT IN INTERSTATE CASESPresent lawNo provision.House billStates are required to have laws that permit them to send or-ders to and receive orders from other States. The transmission ofthe order itself serves as certification to the responding State of thearrears amount and of the fact that the initiating State met all pro-cedural due process requirements. In addition, each respondingState must, without requiring the case to be transferred to theirState, match the case against its data bases, take appropriate ac-tion if a match occurs, and send the collections, if any, to the initi-ating State. States must keep records of the number of requeststhey receive, the number of cases that result in a collection, andthe amount collected. States must respond to interstate requestswithin five days.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.16. USE OF FORMS IN INTERSTATE ENFORCEMENTPresent lawNo provision.House billThe Secretary of HHS, in consultation with State child supportdirectors and not later than October 1, 1996, must issue forms thatStates must use for income withholding, for imposing liens, and forissuing administrative subpoenas in interstate cases. States mustbe using the forms by March 1, 1997.Senate amendmentSame, except minor differences in wording.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. 35317. STATE LAWS PROVIDING EXPEDITED PROCEDURESPresent lawStates must have procedures under which expedited processesare in effect under the State judicial system or under State admin-istrative processes for obtaining and enforcing support orders andfor establishing paternity.Federal regulations provide a number of safeguards in expe-dited cases, such as requiring that the due process rights of theparties involved be protected.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of1974 supersedes any and all State laws. Under ERISA a noncusto-dial parent's pension benefits can only be garnished or withheld ifthe custodial parent has a qualified domestic relations order. Simi-larly, a pension plan administrator is obligated to adhere to medi-cal support requirements only if the custodial parent has a quali-fied medical child support order.House billStates must adopt a series of procedures to expedite both theestablishment of paternity and the establishment, enforcement,and modification of support. These procedures must give the Stateagency the authority to take the following actions, subject to dueprocess safeguards, without the necessity of obtaining an orderfrom any other judicial or administrative tribunal:(1) ordering genetic testing in appropriate cases;(2) issuing subpoenas to obtain information necessary toestablish, modif' or enforce an order, with appropriate sanc-tions for failure to respond to the subpoena;(3) requiring all entities in the State (including for-profit,nonprofit, and governmental employers) to provide informationon employment, compensation and benefits of any employee orcontractor in response to a request from the State IV\u2014D agencyor the IV\u2014D agency of any other State, and to sanction failureto respond to such request;(4) obtaining access to a variety of public and privaterecords including: vital statistics, State and local tax records,real and personal property, occupational and professional li-censes and records concerning ownership and control of cor-porations, partnerships and other business entities, employ-ment security records, public assistance records, motor vehiclerecords, corrections records, and, subject to the nonliabiity ofthese private entities and the issuance of an administrativesubpoena, information in the customer records of public utili-ties and cable TV companies, and records of financial institu-tions;(5) directing the obligor or other payor to change the payeeto the appropriate government entity in cases in which supportis subject to an assignment or to a requirement to pay throughthe State Disbursement Unit;(6) ordering income withholding in certain IV\u2014D cases;(7) securing assets to satisfy arrearages: by intercepting orseizing periodic or lump sum payments from States or localagenciesincluding Unemployment Compensation, workers' 354compensation, judgements, settlements, lottery winnings, as-sets held by financial institutions, and public and private re-tirement funds; by attaching and seizing assets held in finan-cial institutions; by attaching public and private retirementfunds; and by imposing liens to force the sale of property; and(8) increasing automatically the monthly support due to in-clude amounts to offset arrears.Expedited procedures must include the following rules and au-thority applicable with respect to proceedings to establish paternityor to establish, modifr, or enforce support orders:(1) Locator Information and Notice. Parties in paternityand child support actions must file and update informationabout identity, address, and employer with the tribunal andwith the State Case Registry upon entry of the order. The tri-bunal can deem due process requirements for notice and serv-ice of process to be met in any subsequent action upon deliveryof written notice to the most recent residential or employer ad-dress ified with the tribunal.(2) Statewide Jurisdiction. The child support agency andany administrative or judicial tribunal have the authority tohear child support and paternity cases, to exert Statewide ju-risdiction over the parties, and to grant orders that have State-wide effect; cases can also be transferred between local juris-dictions without additional filing or service of process.Except to the extent that the provisions related to expeditedprocedures are consistent with requirements of the ERISA qualifieddomestic relations orders and the qualified medical child supportorders, the expedited procedures do not alter, amend, modifr, inval-idate, impair or supersede ERISA requirements.The automated systems being developed by States are to beused, to the maximum extent possible, to implement expedited pro-cedures.Senate amendmentSame, except for a modification that alters the nonliability ofentities that share information with child support officials andeliminates the reference to administrative subpoenas.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment except that the agreement included the House pro-vision strengthening the nonliability of entities that share informa-tion with child support officials.Subtitle D\u2014Paternity Establishment18. STATE LAWS CONCERNING PATERNITY ESTABLISHMENTPresent lawEstablishment Process Available from Birth Until Age 18. Fed-eral law requires States to have laws that permit the establish-ment of paternity until the child reaches age 18.

If no objection is made, the test resultsmust be admissible as evidence of paternity without the need forfoundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.Presumption of Paternity in Certain Cases. Federal law re-quires States to implement procedures which create a rebuttableor, at State option, conclusive presumption of paternity based ongenetic testing results indicating a threshold probability that thealleged father is the father of the child.Default Orders. Federal law requires States to implement pro-cedures that require a default order to be entered in a paternitycase upon a showing of service of process on the defendant and anyadditional showing required by State law.House billEstablishment Process Available from Birth Until Age 18.States are required to have laws that permit paternity establish-ment until at least age 18 (or a higher limit at State option) evenin cases that were previously dismissed because a statute of liniita-tions of less than 18 years was then in effect.Procedures Concerning Genetic Testing. The child and all otherparties, unless good cause provisions are met, must undergo ge-netic testing upon the request of a party if the request is supportedby a sworn statement establishing a reasonable possibility of par-entage or nonparentage. When the tests are ordered by the Stateagency, States must pay the costs, subject to recoupment at Stateoption from the father if paternity is established. Upon the requestand advance payment by the contestant, States must seek addi-tional testing if the original test result is contested.Voluntary Paternity Acknowledgement. 356(1) Simple Civil Process. States must have procedures that cre-ate a simple civil process for voluntary acknowledging paternityunder which benefits, rights, and responsibilities of acknowledge-ment are explained to unwed parents before the acknowledgementis signed.(2) Hospital Program. States must have procedures that estab-lish a paternity acknowledgement program through hospitals.(3) Paternity Services. States must have procedures that re-quire the agency responsible for maintaining birth records to offervoluntary paternity establishment services.

States must develop their own voluntary acknowl-edgment form but the form must contain all the basic elements ofa form developed by the Secretary. States must give full faith andcredit to the forms of other States.Status of Signed Paternity Acknowledgement.(1) Inclusion in Birth Records. States must include the nameof the father in the record of births to unmarried parents only ifthe father and mother have signed a voluntary acknowledgementof paternity or a court or administrative agency has issued an adju-dication of paternity.(2) Legal Finding. States must have procedures under which asigned acknowledgement of paternity is considered a legal findingof paternity unless rescinded within 60 days or the date of a judi-cial or administrative proceeding to establish a support order.(3) Contest. States must have procedures under which a pater-nity acknowledgment can be challenged in court only on the basisof fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden ofproof on the challenger.Bar on Acknowledgement Ratification Proceedings. No judicialor administrative proceedings are required or permitted to ratify apaternity acknowledgement which is not challenged by the parents.Admissibility of Genetic Testing Results. States must have pro-cedures for admitting into evidence accredited genetic tests, unlessany objection is made in writing within a specified number of days,and if no objection is made, clarifying that test results are admissi-ble without the need for foundation or other testimony.Presumption of Paternity in Certain Cases. States must havelaws that create a rebuttable or, at State option, conclusive pre-sumption of paternity when results from genetic testing indicate athreshold probability that the alleged father is the father of thechild.Default Orders. A default order must be entered in a paternitycase upon a showing of service of process on the defendant and anyadditional showing required by the State law.No Right to Jury Trial. State laws must state that parties ina contested paternity action are not entitled to a jury trial.In addition to all the above provisions that strengthen similarprovisions of current law, the Committee report contains a numberof new provisions that have no direct parallel in current law. Theseinclude: 357Temporary Support Based on Probable Paternity. Upon motionof a party, State law must require issuance of a temporary supportorder pending an administrative or judicial determination of par-entage if paternity is indicated by genetic testing or other clear andconvincing evidence.Proof of Certain Support and Paternity Establishment Costs.Bills for pregnancy, childbirth, and genetic testing must be admis-sible in judicial proceedings without foundation testimony andmust constitute prima facie evidence of the cost incurred for suchservices.Standing of Putative Fathers.

COOPERATION BY APPLICANTS FOR AND RECIPIENTS OF TEMPORARYFAMILY ASSISTANCEPresent lawAFDC applicants andrecipientsarerequiredto cooperate with the State in establishing the paternity of a child and in obtainingchild support payments unless the applicant or recipient is foundto have good cause for refusing to cooperate. Under the \"goodcause\" regulations, the child support agency may determine that itis against the best interests of the child to seek to establish pater-nity in cases involving incest, rape, or pending procedures for adop-tion. Moreover, the agency may determine that it is against thebest interest of the child to require the mother to cooperate if it isanticipated that such cooperation will result in the physical or emo-tional harm of the child, parent, or caretaker relative.House billIndividuals or their children who apply for or receive public as-sistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF) program or the Medicaid program must cooperate, as de-termined by the State child support agency, with State efforts toestablish paternity and establish, mothf, or enforce a supportorder. State procedures must require both that applicants and re-cipients provide specific identifring information about the otherparent and that applicants appear at interviews, hearings, andlegal proceedings, unless the applicant or recipient is found to havegood cause for refusing to cooperate. States must have \"good cause\"exceptions and they must take into account the best interests ofthe child. The definition of good cause, and the determination ofgood cause in specific cases, can be accomplished by the State agen-cy administering TANF, child support enforcement, or Medicaid.States also must require the custodial parent and child to submitto genetic testing. States may not require the noncustodial parentto sign an acknowledgement of paternity or relinquish the right togenetic testing as a condition of cooperation. The State child sup-port agency must notify the agencies administering the TANFBlock Grant and Medicaid programs if noncooperation is deter-mined.Senate amendmentSame, except imposes a penalty for noncooperation. If it is de-termined that an individual is not cooperating, and the individualdoes not qualify for any good cause or other exception, then theState must deduct not less than 25 percent of the Title IV\u2014A assist-ance that otherwise would be provided to the family of the individ-ual; and the State may deny the family any Title IV\u2014A assistance.The Senate amendment also has references to Title XV not foundin the House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment except that the Senate penalty of 25 percent is in-cluded.

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES AND PENALTIESPresent lawIncentive Adjustments to Federal Matching Rate. The Federalgovernment reimburses approved administrative expenditures ofStates at a rate of 66 percent. In addition, the Federal governmentpays States an incentive amount ranging from six percent to 10percent of both AFDC and non-AFDC collections.Conforming Amendments. No provision.Calculationof IV\u2014D Paternity Establishment Percentage.States are required to meet Federal standards for the establish-ment of paternity. The major standard relates to the percentage ob-tained by dividing the number of children in the State who areborn out of wedlock, are receiving AFDC or child support enforce-ment services, and for whom paternity has been established by thenumber of children who are born out of wedlock and are receivingAFDC or child support enforcement services. To meet Federal re-quirements, this percentage in a State must be at least 75 percentor meet the following standards of improvement from the precedingyear: (1) if the State paternity establishment ratio is between 50and 75 percent, the State ratio must increase by 3 or more percent-age points from the ratio of the preceding year; (2) if the State ratiois between 45 and 50, the ratio must increase at least 4 percentagepoints; (3) if the State ratio is between 40 and 45 percent, it mustincrease at least 5 percentage points; and (4) if the State ratio isbelow 40 percent, it must increase at least 6 percentage points. Ifan audit finds that the State's child support enforcement programhas not substantially complied with the requirements of its StateSplan, the State is subject to a penalty. In accord with this penalty,the Secretary must reduce a State's AFDC benefit payment by notless than 1 percent nor more than 2 percent for the first failure tocomply; by not less than 2 percent nor more than 3 percent for thesecond consecutive failure to comply; and by not less than 3 percentnor more than 5 percent for third or subsequent consecutive failureto comply.House billIncentive Adjustments to Federal Matching Rate. The Sec-retary, in consultation with State child support directors, must de-velop a proposal for a new incentive system that provides addi-tional payments to States (i.e., above the base matching rate of 66percent) based on performance and report details of the new sys-tem to the Committees on Ways and Means and Finance by March1, 1997. The Secretary's new system must be revenue neutral. Thecurrent incentive system remains effective for fiscal years begin-ning before 2000.Conforming Amendments. Conforming amendments are madein Sections 458 of the Social Security Act.Calculationof IV\u2014D Paternity Establishment Percentage.States have the option of calculating the paternity establishmentrate by either counting only unwed births in the State IV\u2014D case-load or by counting all unwed births in the State. The IV\u2014D pater- 360mty establishment percentage for a fiscal year is equal to: (1) thetotal number of children in the State who were born out-of-wedlock,and who receive services under Part A or, at State option, Part D,and for whom paternity is acknowledged or established during thefiscal year, divided by (2) the total number of children born out-of-wedlock who receive services under Part A or E or, at State option,Part D. The Statewide paternity establishment percentage is simi-lar except that all out-of-wedlock births in the fiscal year in theState are in the denominator and all paterrnties established are inthe numerator. The requirements for meeting the standard are thesame as current law except the 75 percent rule is increased to 90percent. States with a paternity establishment percentage of be-tween 75 percent and 90 percent must improve their performanceby at least two percentage points per year. The noncompliance pro-visions of the child support program are modified so that the Sec-retary must take overall program performance into account.Senate amendmentSame, except minor wording difference in amendment of Sec-tion 452(g)(2).Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.22. FEDERAL AND STATE REVIEW AND AUDITSPresent lawStates are required to maintain a full record of child supportcollections and disbursements and to maintain an adequate report-ing system.The Secretary must collect and maintain, on a fiscal year basis,up-to-date State-by-State statistics on each of the services providedunder the child support enforcement program. The Secretary is alsorequired to evaluate the implementation of State child support en-forcement programs and conduct audits of these programs as nec-essary, but not less often than once every 3 years (or annually ifa State has been found to be out of compliance with programrules).House billStates are required to annually review and report to the Sec-retary, using data from their automatic data processing system,both information adequate to determine the State's compliancewith Federal requirements for expedited procedures and timelycase processing as well as the information necessary to calculatetheir levels of accomplishment and rates of improvement on theperformance indicators in the proposal.The Secretary is required to determine the amount (if any) ofincentives or penalties. The Secretary must also review State re-ports on compliance with Federal requirements and provide Stateswith recommendations for corrective action. Audits must be con-ducted at least once every 3 years, or more often in the case ofStates that fail to meet Federal requirements. The purpose of the 361audits is to assess the completeness, reliability, and security ofdata reported for use in calculating the performance indicators andto assess the adequacy of financial management of the State pro-gram.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.23.

AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING REQUIREMENTSPresent lawFederal law (P.L. 104\u201435) requires that by October 1, 1997,States have an operational automated data processing and infor-mation retrieval system designed to control, account for, and mon-itor all factors in the support enforcement and paternity determina-tion process, the collection and distribution of support payments,and the costs of all services rendered.The automated data processing system must be capable of pro-viding management information on all W\u2014D cases from initial re-ferral or application through collection and enforcement. The auto-mated data processing system must also be capable of providing se-curity against unauthorized access to, or use of, the data in suchsystem. To establish these automated data systems, the Federalgovernment provided States with a 90 percent matching rate forthe costs of development. This enhanced matching money expiredon October 1, 1995.House billStates are required to have a single Statewide automated dataprocessing and information retrieval system which has the capacityto perform the necessary functions and with the required fre- 362quency, as described in this section. The State data system mustbe used to perform functions the Secretary specifies, including con-trolling and accounting for the use of Federal, State, and localfunds and maintaining the data necessary to meet Federal report-ing requirements in carrying out the program. The system mustmaintain the requisite data for Federal reporting, calculate theState's performance for purposes of the incentive and penalty provi-sions, and have in place systems controls to ensure the complete-ness, reliability, and accuracy of the data.To promote security of information, the State agency musthave safeguards to protect the integrity, accuracy, and complete-ness of, and access to and use of, data in the automated systemsincluding restricting access to passwords, monitoring of access toand use of the system, conducting automated systems training, andimposing penalties for unauthorized use or disclosure of confden-tial data. The Secretary must prescribe final regulations for imple-mentation of this section no later than 2 years after the date of theenactment of this Act.The statutory provisions for State implementation of Federalautomatic data processing requirements are revised to providethat, first, all requirements enacted on or before the date of enact-ment of the Family Support Act of 1988 are to be met by October1, 1997. The requirements enacted on or before the date of enact-ment of this proposal must be met by October 1, 1999. The October1, 1999 deadline will be extended by one day for each day by whichthe Secretary fails to meet the 2-year deadline for regulations. TheFederal government will continue the 90 percent matching rate for1996 and 1997 in the case of provisions outlined in advanced plan-ning documents submitted before September 30, 1995; the en-hanced match is also provided retroactively for funds expendedsince expiration of the enhanced rate on October 1, 1995. For fiscalyears 1996 through 2001, the matching rate for the provisions ofthis section will be 80 percent.The Secretary must create procedures to cap payments toStates to meet the new requirements at $400,000,000 over 6 years(fiscal years 1996\u20142001) to be distributed among States by a for-mula set in regulations which takes into account the relative sizeof State caseloads and the level of automation needed to meet ap-plicable automatic data processing requirements.Senate amendmentSame, except that requirements enacted after the Family Sup-port Act must be met by October 1, 2000 (rather than October 1,1999). Also, a difference in wording about payments in fiscal year1998.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. 36325. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (AND FUNDING OF PARENT LOCATORSERVICE)Present lawAnnual appropriations are madeto cover the expenses of the Administration for Children and Families, which includes the Fed-eral Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). Among OCSE'sadministrative expenses are the costs of providing technical assist-ance to the States.House billThe Secretary can use 1 percent of the Federal share of childsupport collections on behalf of families in the Temporary Assist-ance for Needy Families program the preceding year to providetechnical assistance to the States.

SIMPLIFIED PROCESS FOR REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT OF CHILDSUPPORT ORDERSPresent lawA child support order legally obligates noncustodial parents toprovide financial support for their child and stipulates the amountof the obligation and how it is to be paid. In 1984, P.L. 98\u2014378 re-quired States to establish guidelines for establishing child supportorders. In 1988, P.L. 100\u2014485 made the guidelines binding onjudges and other officials who had authority to establish supportorders. P.L. 100\u2014485 also required States to review and adjust indi-vidual child support orders once every three years under some cir-cumstances. States are required to notify both resident and non-resident parents of their right to a review.House billStates must review and, as appropriate, adjust child supportorders at the request of the parents. In the case of orders being en-forced against parents whose children are receiving benefits underTitle IV\u2014A of the Social Security Act, States may also review theorder at their own option. No proof of change of circumstances isneeded to initiate the review. States may adjust child support or- 365ders by either applying the State guidelines and updating theaward amount or by applying a cost of living increase to the order.In the latter case, both parties must be given 30 days after noticeof adjustment to contest the results. States may use automatedmethods to identifi orders eligible for review, conduct the review,identifi orders eligible for adjustment, and apply the appropriateadjustment to the orders based on the threshold established by theState. States are required to give parties one notice of their rightto request review and adjustment, which may be included in theorder establishing the support amount.Senate amendmentMajor differences in the review and adjustment provisions; theHouse makes reviews optional while the Senate retains mandatory3-year reviews of IV\u2014A cases as under current law; also other dif-ferences in wording.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. The compromise provision preserves the manda-tory review every 3 years if parents request a review but allowsStates some flexibility in reviewing child support cases in theirwelfare caseload.29. FURNISHING CONSUMER REPORTS FOR CERTAIN PURPOSESRELATING TO CHILD SUPPORTPresent lawThe Fair Credit Act requires consumer reporting agencies toinclude in any consumer report information on child support delin-quencies provided by or verified by a child support enforcementagency, which antedates the report by 7 years.House billThis section amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In responseto a request by the head of a State or local child support agency(or a State or local government official authorized by the head ofsuch an agency), consumer credit agencies must release informa-tion if the person making the request makes all of the followingcertifications: that the consumer report is needed to establish anindividual's capacity to make child support payments or determinethe level of payments; that paternity has been established or ac-knowledged; that the consumer has been given at least 10 days no-tice by certified or registered mail that the report is being re-quested; and that the consumer report will be kept confidential,will be used solely for child support purposes, and will not be usedin connection with any other civil, administrative, or criminal pro-ceeding or for any other purpose.

AUTHORITY TO COLLECT SUPPORT FROM FEDERAL EMPLOYEESPresent lawFederal law allows the wages of Federal employees to be gar-nished to enforce legal obligations for child support or alimony.Federal law provides that moneys payable by the United States toany individual are subject to being garnished in order to meet anindividual's legal obligation to provide child support or make ali-mony payments. An executive order issued on February 27, 1995establishes the Federal government as a model employer in pro-moting and facilitating the establishment and enforcement of childsupport. Under the terms of the Executive Order, all Federal agen-cies, including the Uniformed Services, are required to cooperatefully in efforts to establish paternity and child support and to en-force the collection of child and medical support. All Federal agen-cies are to review their wage withholding procedures to ensure thatthey are in full compliance. Beginning no later than July 1, 1995,the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must publishannually in the Federal Register the list of agents (and their ad-dresses) designated to receive service of withholding notices forFederal employees. Federal law states that neither the UnitedStates nor any disbursing officer or government entity shall be lia-ble with respect to any payment made from moneys due or payablefrom the United States pursuant to the legal process. Federal lawprovides that money that may be garnished includes compensationfor personal services, whether such compensation is denominatedas wages, salary, commission, bonus, pay, or otherwise, and in-cludes but is not limited to, severance pay, sick pay, incentive pay-ments, and periodic payments. Includes definitions Authorities:(1) Federal employees are subject to wage withholding andother actions taken against them by State child support enforce-ment agencies.(2) Federal agencies are responsible for the same wage with-holding and other child support actions taken by the State as ifthey were a private employer.(3) The head of each Federal agency must designate an agentand place the agent's name, title, address, and telephone numberin the Federal Register annually. The agent must, upon receipt ofprocess, send written notice to the individual involved as soon aspossible, but no later than 15 days, and to comply with any noticeof wage withholding or respond to other process within 30 days.The agent also must respond to any order, process, or interrogatoryabout child support or alimony within 30 days after effective serv-ice of such requests.(4) Current law governing allocation of moneys owed by a Fed-eral employee is amended to give priority to child support, to re- quire allocation of available funds, up to the amount owed, among child support claimants, and to allocate remaining funds to otherclaimants on a first-come, first-served basis. 368(5) A government entity served with notice of process for en-forcement of child support is not required to change its normal payand disbursement cycle to comply with the legal process.(6) Similar to current law, the U.S., the government of the Dis-trict of Columbia, and disbursing officers are not liable for childsupport payments made in accord with this section; nor is any Fed-eral employee subject to disciplinary action or civil or criminal li-ability for disclosing information while carrying out the provisionsof this section.(7) The President has the authority to promulgate regulationsto implement this section as it applies to Federal employees of theAdministrative branch of government; the President Pro Temporeof the Senate and Speaker of the House can issue regulations gov-erning their employees; and the Chief Justice can issue regulationsapplicable to the Judicial branch.(8) This section broadens the definition of income to include, inaddition to wages, salary, commissions, bonus pay, allowances, sev-erance pay, sick pay, and incentive pay, funds such as insurancebenefits, retirement and pension pay (including disability pay if theveteran has waived a portion of retirement pay to receive disabilitypay), survivor's benefits, compensation for death and black lungdisease, veteran's benefits, and workers' compensation; but to ex-clude from income funds paid to defray expenses incurred in carry-ing out job duties; amounts owed to the U.S. or used to pay Federalemployment taxes, fines, or forfeitures ordered by court martial;and amounts withheld for tax purposes, for health insurance or lifeinsurance premiums, for retirement contributions, or for life insur-ance premiums.(9) This section includes provision makes severalconforming amendments to Title W\u2014D of the Social Security Actand Title 5 of the United States Code.Military Retired and Retainer Pay. The definition of \"court\" inthe Armed Forces title of the U.S. Code (title 10) is amended to in-clude an administrative or judicial tribunal of a State which iscompetent to enter child support orders, and clarifies the definitionof \"court order.\" The Secretary of Defense is required to send with-held amounts for child support to the appropriate State Disburse-ment Unit. The provision also clarifies that military personnel whohave never been married to the parent of their child are under ju-risdiction of the State child support program and the terms of sec-tion 459 of the Social Security Act.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. 36933.

ALIENS WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED ALIENS INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALPUBLIC BENEFITSPresent lawCurrent law limits alien eligibility for most major Federal as-sistance programs, including restrictions on, among other pro-grams, Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families with De-pendent Children, housing assistance, and Food Stamps programs.Current law is silent on alienage under, among other programs,school lunch and nutrition, the Special Supplemental Food Pro-gram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Head Start, mi-grant health centers, and the earned income credit. Under the pro-grams with restrictions, benefits are generally allowed for perma-nent resident aliens (also referred to as immigrants and green cardholders), refugees, asylees, and parolees, but benefits (other thanemergency Medicaid) are denied to nonimmigrants (or aliens law-fully admitted temporarily as, for example, tourists, students, ortemporary workers) and ifiegal aliens. Benefits are permitted under AFDC,SSI,unemploymentcompensation,andnon- emergency Medicaid to other aliens permanently residing in theUnited States under color of law (PRUCOL).House billNoncitizens who are \"not qualified aliens\" (generally, illegalimmigrants and nonimmigrants such as students) are ineligible forall Federal public benefits, with limited exceptions for emergencymedical services, emergency disaster relief, immunizations andtesting and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases, com-munity programs necessary for the protection of life or safety, cer-tain housing benefits (only for current recipients), licenses and ben-efits directly related to work for which a nonimmigrant has beenauthorized to enter the U.S, and certain Social Security retirementbenefits protected by treaty or statute.Federal public benefits include: any grant, contract, loan, pro-fessional license or commercial license, and any retirement, wel-fare, health, disability, food assistance, unemployment or similarbenefit provided by an agency or appropriated funds of the UnitedStates.Senate amendmentSimilar to House, except that the exception for communicablediseases is limited to treatment of the disease itself and must betriggered by a finding by HHS that testing and treatment of a par-ticular disease is necessary to prevent its spread.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.The allowance for treatment of communicable diseases is verynarrow. The conferees intend that it only apply where absolutelynecessary to prevent the spread of such diseases. This is only astop-gap measure until the deportation of a person or persons un- 380lawfully here. It is not intended to provide authority for continuedtreatment of such diseases for a long term.The allowance for emergency medical services under Medicaidis very narrow. The conferees intend that it only apply to medicalcare that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical treat-ment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or in-tensive care unit. The conferees do not intend that emergency med-ical services include pre-natal or delivery care assistance that isnot strictly of an emergency nature as specified herein.The intent of the conferees is that title I, part A of the Elemen-tary and Secondary Education Act would not be affected by section401 because the benefit is not provided to an individual, household,or family eligibility unit.3. LIMITED ELIGIBILITY OF QUALIFIED ALIENS FOR CERTAIN FEDERALPROGRAMSPresent lawWith the exception of certain buy-in rights under Medicare, im-migrants (or aliens) lawfully admitted for permanent residence areeligible for major Federal benefits, but the ability of some immi-grants to meet the needs tests for SSI, AFDC, and food stampsmay be affected by the sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions dis-cussed below. Refugees, asylees, and parolees also generally are eli-gible. Benefits are permitted under AFDC, SSI, unemploymentcompensation, and nonemergency Medicaid to other aliens perma-nently residing in the United States under color of law (PRUCOL).House billLegal noncitizens who are \"qualified aliens\" (i.e., permanentresident aliens, refugees, asylees, aliens paroled into the UnitedStates for a period of at least 1 year, and aliens whose deportationhas been withheld) are ineligible for SSI, Medicaid, and food stampbenefits until they attain citizenship, with exceptions noted below.States are given the option of similarly restricting Federal cashwelfare and Title XX benefits for qualified aliens, with the excep-tion of those who are receiving benefits on the date of enactmentas described below.Refugees, asylees, and aliens whose deportation has been with-held are excepted for 5 years after being granted their respectivestatuses. Also excepted are legal permanent residents who haveworked (in combination with their spouse and parents) for at least10 years, and noncitizens who are veterans or on active duty ortheir spouse or unmarried child.To allow individuals time to adjust to the revised policy, other-wise restricted aliens who are receiving SSI, food stamps, cash wel-fare, Medicaid or Title XX benefits on the date of enactment wouldremain eligible for at most 1 year after enactment. However, if areview determines the noncitizen would be ineligible if enrollingunder the revised standards for SSI, Medicaid, and food stamps(for example, because the noncitizen failed to qualify under the ref-ugee or work exemptions) such benefits would cease immediately.States have the option of ending cash welfare and social servicesbenefits for current recipients after January 1, 1997. 381Senate amendmentSimilar to House bifi, except that Medicaid is included amongthe programs subject to State option rather than a blanket bar.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.4. FWE-YEARLIMITEDELIGIBILITY ALIENS FOR FEDERALMEANS-TESTED PUBLIC BENEFITPresent billThe proposal restricts most Federal means-tested benefits (in-cluding SSI, food stamps, cash welfare, Medicaid, and title XX so-cial services benefits) for permanent resident aliens who arriveafter the date of enactment for their first 5 years in the UnitedStates. Programs that are not restricted to legal noncitizens arriv-ing in the future include emergency medical services, non-cashemergency disaster relief, school lunch and child nutrition benefits,immunizations and testing and treatment for symptoms of commu-nicable diseases, foster care and adoption payments under parts Band E of Title W of the Social Security Act, community programsfor the protection of life or safety, certain elementary and second-ary education programs, Head Start, the Job Training PartnershipAct, and higher education grants and loans.Exceptions are made for refugees, asylees, aliens whose depor-tation is being withheld, and noncitizens who are veterans, on ac-tive duty, or the spouse or unmarried child of such an individual.Senate amendmentExcepted programs are similar to the House with the followingdifferences:(1) benefits under Head Start Act and the Job TrainingPartnership Act are not excepted;(2) the exception for foster care and adoption assistance islimited to Part E of Title W of the Social Security Act;(3) the exception for testing and treatment of commu-nicable diseases is more limited and must be triggered by afinding by HHS that detection and treatment of a particu'ardisease is necessary to prevent its spread; and(4) includes an exception for education assistance under ti-tles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Service Act.Excepted classes are similar to House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and Senateamendment as follows. (1) The definition of Federal Means TestedPublic Benefit (defined as \"a public benefit (including cash, medi-ca1, housing, and food assistance and social services) of the FederalGovernment in which the eligibility of an individual, household, orfamily eligibility unit for benefits, or the amount of such benefits,or both are determined on the basis of income, resources, or finan- 382cia! need of the individual, household, or unit\") was deleted due tothe Byrd rule. It is the intent of conferees that this definition bepresumed to be in place for purposes of this title. (2) Regarding ex-cepted programs, the conference agreement follows the House billon testing and treatment of communicable diseases and by addingHead Start and the Job Training Partnership Act as excepted pro-grams; the conference agreement adds refugee and entrant assist-ance as an excepted program; and the conference agreement followsthe Senate amendment by adding education assistance under titlesIII, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Services Act as an exceptedprogram.5. NOTIFICATION AND INFORMATION REPORTINGPresent lawNotification. Under regulation, individual advance written no-tice must be given of an intent to suspend, reduce, or terminateSSI benefits.Information Reporting. AFDC and SSI restrict the use or dis-closure of information concerning applicants and recipients to pur-poses connected to the administration of needs-based Federa' pro-grams.House billEach Federal agency that administers an affected programshall post information and provide general notification to the publicand to program recipients of changes regarding eligibility.Agencies that administer SSI, housing assistance programsunder the United States Housing Act of 1937, or block grants fortemporary assistance for needy families (the successor program toAFDC) are required to furnish information about aliens they knowto be unlawfully in the United States to the Immigration and Natu-ralization Service (INS) at least four times annually and upon INSrequest.Senate amendmentSimilar to House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.Subtitle B\u2014Eligibility for State and Local Public BenefitsPrograms6. ALIENS WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED ALIENS OR NONIMMIGRANTSINELIGIBLE FOR STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC BENEFITSPresent lawUnder Plyler vs. Doe (457 U.S. 202 (1982)), States may notdeny illega' alien children access to a public elementary educationwithout authorization from Congress. However, the narrow 5\u20144 Su-preme Court decision may imply that illega' aliens may be deniedat least some State benefits and that Congress may influence theeligibility of illega' aliens for State benefits. Many, but not all, 383State general assistance laws currently deny illegal aliens means-tested general assistance.House billIllegal aliens are ineligible for all State and local public bene-fits, with limited exceptions for emergency medical services, emer-gency disaster relief, immunizations and testing and treatment forsymptoms of communicable diseases, and programs necessary forthe protection of life or safety. States may, however, pass lawsafter the date of enactment that speci& that illegal aliens may beeligible for certain State or local benefits that otherwise would bedenied under this section.Senate amendmentSimilar to House bill, except that the exception for commu-nicable diseases is more limited and must be triggered by a findingby HHS that testing and treatment of a particular disease is nec-essary to prevent its spread.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.No current State law, State constitutional provision, State ex-ecutive order or decision of any State or Federal court shall providea sufficient basis for a State to be relieved of the requirement todeny benefits to ifiegal aliens. Laws, ordinances, or executive or-ders passed by county, city or other local officials will not allowthose entities to provide benefits to illegal aliens. Only the affirma-tive enactment of a law by a State legislature and signed by theGovernor after the date of enactment of this Act, that referencesthis provision, will meet the requirements of this section.The phrase \"affirmatively provides for such eligibility\" meansthat the State law enacted must speci that illegal aliens are eligi-ble for State or local benefits. Persons residing under color of lawshall be considered to be aliens unlawfully present in the UnitedStates and are prohibited from receiving State or local benefits, asdefined, regardless of the enactment of any State law.The conference agreement provides that no State or local gov-ernment entity shall prohibit, or in any way restrict, any entity orofficial from sending to or receiving from the INS information re-garding the immigration status of an alien or the presence, where-abouts, or activities of illegal aliens. It does not require, in and ofitself, any government agency or law enforcement official to com-municate with the INS.The conferees intend to give State and local officials the au-thority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence,whereabouts, or activities of illegal aliens. This provision is de-signed to prevent any State or local law, ordinance, executiveorder, policy, constitutional provision, or decision of any Federal orState court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communica-tion between State and local officials and the INS. The confereesbelieve that immigration law enforcement is as high a priority asother aspects of Federal law enforcement, and that illegal aliens donot have the right to remain in the United States undetected andunapprehended. 3847. STATE AUTHORITY TO LIMIT ELIGIBILITY OF QUALIFIED ALIENS FORSTATE PUBLIC BENEFITSPresent lawUnder Graham v. Richardson (403 U.S. 365 (1971)), Statesmay not deny legal permanent residents State-funded assistancethat is provided to equally needy citizens without authorizationfrom Congress.Currently, there is no Federal law barring legal temporaryresidents (i.e., nonimmigrants) from State and local needs-basedprograms. In general, States are restricted in denying assistance tononimmigrants where the denial is inconsistent with the termsunder which the nonimmigrants were admitted. Where a denial ofbenefits is not inconsistent with Federal immigration law, however,States have broader authority to deny benefits and States often dodeny certain benefits to nonimmigrants. Also, aliens in most non-immigrant categories generally may have difficulty qualifying formany State and local benefits because of requirements that they beState \"residents.\"House billStates are authorized to determine the eligibility of \"qualifiedaliens,\" nonimmigrants, and aliens paroled into the United Statesfor less than 1 year for any State or local means-tested public bene-fit program. Noncitizens receiving State and local benefits on thedate of enactment would remain eligible for benefits until January1, 1997.Exceptions to State authority to deny benefits are made for ref-ugees, asylees and aliens whose deportation has been withheld (for5 years), permanent resident aliens who have worked in the UnitedStates (in combination with their spouse or parents) for at least 10years, and noncitizens who are veterans or on active duty or theirspouse or unmarried child.Senate amendmentSimilar to House bill, except that under Byrd rule the defini-tion of \"State public benefits\" (sec. 2412(c)) is deleted.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. The conference agreement does not include a defi-nition of State public benefits in this section because the definitionwas dropped due to the Byrd rule. However, it is the intent ofHouse and Senate conferees that the following definition be usedby States in carrying out the authority granted by this section:\"STATE PUBLIC BENEFITS DEFINED.\u2014The term 'State public bene-fits' means any means-tested public benefits of a State or politicalsubdivision of a State under which the State or political subdivisionspecffies the standards for eligibility, and does not include any Fed-eral public benefit.\" 385Subtitle C\u2014Attribution of Income and Affidavits of FEDERAL ARIBUTION OF SPONSOR'S INCOME AND RESOURCES TOALIENPresent lawFederal Benefits. In determining whether an alien meets themeans test for AFDC, SSI (except in cases of blindness or disabilityoccurring after entry), and food stamps, the resources and incomeof an individual who ified an affidavit of support (\"sponsor\") for thealien (and the income and resources of the individual's spouse) aretaken into account during a designated period after entry. Sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions were added to these three programs inpart because several courts have found that affidavits of support,under current practice, do not obligate sponsors to reimburse gov-ernment agencies for benefits provided to sponsored aliens. Seebelow.Amounts of Income and Resources Deemed. While the offsetformulas vary among the programs, the amount of income and re-sources deemed under AFDC, SSI, and Food Stamps is reduced bycertain offsets to provide for some of the sponsor's own needs.Length of Deeming Period. For AFDC and Food Stamps, spon-sor-to-alien deeming applies to a sponsored alien seeking assistancewithin 3 years of entry. Through September 1996, sponsor-to-aliendeeming applies to a sponsored alien seeking SSI within 5 years ofentry, after which the deeming period reverts to 3 years.Review Upon Reapplication. Regulations implementing thefood stamp program expressly require providing information on asponsor's resources as part of recertification.Application. No provision.House billFederal Benefits. During the applicable deeming period (see\"Length of Deeming Period\" below), the income and resources of asponsor and the sponsor's spouse are to be taken into accountunder all Federally-funded means-tested programs (with the excep-tion of the programs below) in determining the sponsored individ-ual's neediness. Excepted programs are emergency medical serv-ices, emergency disaster relief, school lunch and child nutrition as-sistance, immunizations and testing and treatment for symptoms ofcommunicable diseases, certain programs that protect life, safety,or public health, certain foster care and adoption assistance, HeadStart, Job Training Partnership Act programs, certain elementaryand secondary education programs, and higher education grantsand loans.Amounts of Income and Resources Deemed. The full incomeand resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse are deemedto be that of the sponsored alien.Length of Deeming Period. Deeming extends until citizenship,unless the noncitizen has worked for at least 10 years in the Unit-ed States (either individually or in combination with the nonciti-zen's spouse and parents).Review Upon Reapplication. Whenever a sponsored noncitizenis required to reapply for benefits under any Federal means-tested 386public benefits program, the agency must review the income andresources deemed to the sponsored noncitizen.Application. For programs that already deem income and re-sources on the date of enactment, the changes in this section applyimmediately; other programs must implement changes requiredwithin 180 days after the date of enactment.Senate amendmentFederal Benefits. Under the Byrd ruk, the definition of \"Fed-eral means-tested program\" (sec. 2403(c)(1)) is deleted.Otherwise similar to House bill, with differences in exceptionsto Federal means-tested programs noted above for the 5-year bar.Amounts of Income and Resources Deemed.

The conferees intend that it only apply where absolutelynecessary to prevent the spread of such diseases. This is only astop-gap measure until the deportation of a person or persons un-lawfully here. It is not intended to provide authority for continuedtreatment of such diseases for a long term.The allowance for emergency medical services under Medicaidis very narrow. The conferees intend that it only apply to medicalcare that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical treat-ment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or in-tensive care unit. The conferees do not intend that emergency med-ical services include pre-natal or delivery care assistance that isnot strictly of an emergency nature as specified herein.9. AUTHORITY FOR STATES TO PROVIDE FOR AIThIBUTION OF SPON-SOR'S INCOME ANDRESOURCESTO THE ALIEN WITH RESPECT TOSTATE PROGRAMSPresent lawThe highest courts of at least two States have held that theSupreme Court decision barring State discrimination against legalaliens in providing State benefits without Federal authorization(Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971)) prohibits State spon-sor-to-alien deeming requirements for State benefits.House billState and local governments may, for the deeming period thatapplies to Federal benefits, deem a sponsor's income and resources(and those of the sponsor's spouse) to a sponsored individual in de-terniining eligibility for and the amount of needs-based benefits.State and local governments may not require deeming for the fol-lowing State public benefits: emergency medical services, emer- 387gency disaster relief, school lunch and child nutrition assistance,immunizations and testing and treatment for symptoms of commu-nicable diseases, foster care and adoption payments, and certainprograms to protect life and safety.Senate amendmentSimilar to House bill, except that the exception for commu-nicable diseases is limited to testing and treatment of the diseaseitself and must be triggered by a finding by the chief State healthofficial that it is necessary to prevent spread of the disease.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill.10. REQUIREMENTS FOR SPONSOR'S AFFIDAVIT OF SUPPORTPresent lawIn General. Administrative authorities may request an affida-vit of support on behalf of an alien seeking permanent residencypursuant to regulation. Requirements for affidavits of support arenot specified by statute.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien who islikely tO become a public charge may be excluded from entry unlessthis restriction is waived, as is the case for refugees. By regulationand administrative practice, the State Department and the Imnii-gration and Naturalization Service permit a prospective permanentresident alien (also immigrant or green card holder) who otherwisewould be excluded as a public charge (i.e., because of insufficientmeans or prospective income) to overcome exclusion through an af-fidavit of support or similar document executed by an individual inthe United States commonly called a \"sponsor.\" It has been re-ported that roughly one-half of the aliens who obtain legal perma-nent resident status have had affidavits of support filed on theirbehalf.Various State court decisions and decisions by immigrationcourts have held that the affidavits of support, as currently con-stituted, do not impose a binding obligation on the sponsor to reim-burse State agencies providing aid to the sponsored alien.Forms. No statutory provision. The Department of Justice is-sues a form (Form 1\u2014134) that complies with current sponsorshipguidelines.Notification of Change of Address. There is no express require-ment under current administrative practice that sponsors informwelfare agencies of a change in address. However, a sponsoredalien who applies for benefits for which deeming is required mustprovide various information regarding the alien's sponsor.Reimbursement of Government Expenses. Various State courtdecisions and decisions by immigration courts have held that theseaffidavits, as currently constituted, do not impose a binding obliga-tion on the sponsor to reimburse State agencies providing aid tothe sponsored alien.Definitions.

No provision.Benefits Not Subject to Reimbursement. No provision.House billIn General. The proposal provides that when affidavits of sup-port are required, they must comply with the following:Affidavits of support must be executed as contracts that are le-gally enforceable against sponsors by Federal, State, and localagencies with respect to any means-tested benefits (with exceptionsnoted below) paid to sponsored aliens before they become citizens.Affidavits of support must be enforceable against the sponsorby the sponsored alien.Reimbursement shall be requested for all Federal, State orlocal need-based programs with the exceptions noted below.To qualify to execute an affidavit of support, an individualmust meet the revised definition of sponsor below.Governmental entities that provide benefits may seek reim-bursement up to 10 years after a sponsored alien last receives ben-efits.Sponsorship extends until the alien becomes a citizen.Forms. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Sec-retary of State and the Secretary of HHS, shall formulate an affi-davit of support within 90 days after enactment, consistent withthis section.Notification of Change of Address. Until they no longer are p0-tentially liable for reimbursement of benefits paid to sponsored in-dividuals, sponsors must notify the Attorney General and theState, district, territory or possession in which the sponsored indi-vidual resides of any change of their address within 30 days ofmoving. Failure to notify may result in a civil penalty of up to$2,000 or, if the failure occurs after knowledge that the sponsoredindividual has received a reimbursable benefit, of up to $5,000.Reimbursement of Government Expenses. If a sponsored alienreceives any benefit under any means-tested public assistance pro-gram, the appropriate Federal, State, or local official shall requestreimbursement by the sponsor in the amount of such assistance.Thereafter the official may seek reimbursement in court if thesponsor fails to respond within 45 days of the request that thesponsor is willing to begin repayments. The official also may seekreimbursement through the courts within 60 days after a sponsorfails to comply with the terms of repayment. The Attorney Generalin consultation with the Secretary of HHS, shall prescribe regula-tions on requesting reimbursement. No action may be brought laterthan 10 years after the alien last received benefits.Definitions. A \"sponsof' is a citizen or an alien lawfully admit-ted to the United States for permanent residence who petitionedfor immigration preference for the sponsored alien, is at least 18years of age, and resides in any State.A \"Means-Tested Public Benefits Program\" is a program ofpublic benefits of the Federal, State or local government in whicheligibility for or the amount of, benefits or both are determined onthe basis of income, resources, or financial need.Effective Date. The changes regarding affidavits of supportshall apply to affidavits of support executed no earlier than 60 days 389or later than 90 days after the Attorney General promulgates theform.Benefits Not Subject to Reimbursement.

EARNED INCOME CREDIT DENIED TO INDIVIDUALS NOTAUTHORIZED TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES[No'rE.\u2014For further description of this and additional earnedincome credit provisions, see Title IX: Miscellaneous below.]Present lawCertain eligible low-income workers are entitled to claim a re-fundable credit of up to $3,556 in 1996 on their income tax return.The amount of the credit an eligible individual may claim dependsupon whether the individual has one, more than one, or no qualify-ing children and is determined by multiplying the credit rate bythe taxpayer's earned income up to an earned income amount. Themaximum amount of the credit is the product of the credit rate andthe earned income amount. For taxpayers with earned income (oradjusted gross income (AGI), if greater) in excess of the beginningof the phaseout range, the maximum credit amount is reduced bythe phaseout rate multiplied by the amount of earned income (or 393AGI, if greater) in excess of the beginning of the phaseout range.For taxpayers with earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess ofthe end of the phaseout range, no credit is allowed.In order to claim the credit, an individual must either have aqualifying child or meet other requirements. A qua1ifring childmust meet a relationship test, an age test, an identification test,and a residence test. In order to claim the credit without a qualify-ing child, an individual must not be a dependent and must be overage 24 and under age 65.To satisfy the identification test, individuals must include ontheir tax return the name and age of each qualifying child. For re-turns filed with respect to tax year 1996, individuals must providea taxpayer identification number (TIN) for all qualifying childrenborn on or before November 30, 1996. For returns filed with respectto tax year 1997 and all subsequent years, individuals must pro-vide TINs for all qualifying children, regardless of their age. An in-dividual's TIN is generally that individual's social security number.The Internal Revenue Service may summarily assess addi-tional tax due as a result of a mathematical or clerical error with-out sending the taxpayer a notice of deficiency and giving the tax-payer an opportunity to petition the Tax Court. Where the IRSuses the summary assessment procedure for mathematical or cleri-cal errors, the taxpayer must be given an explanation of the as-serted error and a period of 60 days to request that the IRS abateits assessment. The IRS may not proceed to collect the amount ofthe assessment until the taxpayer has agreed to it or has allowedthe 60-day period for objecting to expire. If the taxpayer files a re-quest for abatement of the assessment specified in the notice, theIRS must abate the assessment. Any reassessment of the. abatedamount is subject to the ordinary deficiency procedures. The re-quest for abatement of the assessment is the only procedure a tax-payer may use prior to paying the assessed amount in order to con-test an assessment arising out of a mathematical or clerical error.Once the assessment is satisfied, however, the taxpayer may file aclaim for refund if he or she believes the assessment was made inerror.House billIndividuals are not eligible for the credit if they do not includetheirtaxpayer identification number (and, ifmarried,their spouse's taxpayer identification number) on their tax return. Solelyfor these purposes and for purposes of the present-law identifica-tion test for a qualilring child, a taxpayer identification number isdefined as a social security number issued to an individual by theSocial Security Administration other than a number issued undersection 205(c)(2)(B)(i)(II) (or that portion of sec. 205(c)(2)(B)(i)(III)relating to it) of the Social Security Act (regarding the issuance ofa number to an individual applying for or receiving Federally fund-ed benefits).If an individual fails to provide a correct taxpayer identifica-tion number, such omission will be treated as a mathematical orclerical error. If an individual who claims the credit with respectto net earnings from self-employment fails to pay the properamount of self-employment tax on such net earnings, the failure 394will be treated as a mathematical or clerical error for purposes ofthe amount of credit allowed.Senate amendmentSimilar to House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.TITLE V: CHILD PROTECTION BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS ANt) FOSTERCARE,ADOPTIONASSISTANCE, ANDINDEPENDENTLIvING PROGRAMSSubtitle A\u2014Child Protection Block Grant Program and FosterCare, Adoption Assistance, and Independent Living ProgramsPresent lawUnder current law, there are at least 36 programs designed tohelp children who are victims of abuse or neglect. These programsaddress the child protection issue by supporting abuse reportingand investigation; abuse prevention; child and family assessment,preservation, and support; foster care; adoption; and training of so-cial workers, foster parents, judges, and others. These programscan be divided into two general categories. The first are entitle-ment programs under jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways andMeans and the Finance Committee, nearly all of which provide un-limited funding for foster and adoption maintenance payments, ad-ministrative costs, and training. The two exceptions are the FamilyPreservation and Support Program which provides capped entitle-ment funds to help States provide services that keep families to-gether and prevent abuse, and the Independent Living programwhich provides capped entitlement funds to help children in fostercare make the transition to living on their own. The second groupof programs are appropriated programs. These programs are small-er and, except the Child Welfare Services Program, are generallyunder the jurisdiction of the Economic and Educational Opportuni-ties Committee and the Labor and Human Resources Committee.House billThe House provision retains all the open-ended entitlementprograms to ensure that States have adequate resources to helpabused children that must be removed from their homes. The pro-vision also combines the two capped entitlement programs andmany of the smaller programs into two block grants that will sim-plify administration, promote flexibility, and increase efficiency.Working in conjunction with the Committee on Economic and Edu-cational Opportunity, the Ways and Means Committee has createda block grant that is identical to a block grant created by the Op-portunities Committee. Across the two Committees, a total of 11programs are combined into the new block grant structure.

ELIGIBLE STATESPresent lawTo be eligible for funding under Title N\u2014B and N\u2014E, Statesmust have State plans, developed jointly with the Secretary underTitle N\u2014B, and approved by the Secretary under Title N\u2014E. In ad-dition, to receive funds under the Child Abuse Prevention andTreatment Act (CAPTA), States must comply with certain require-ments including submission of a State plan.States must have a child welfare services plan developed joint-ly by the Secretary and the relevant State agency which providesfor single agency administration and which describes services to beprovided and geographic areas where services will be available.The State plan also must meet many other requirements, such assetting forth a 5-year statement of goals for family preservationand family support and assuring the review of progress towardthose goals. For foster care and adoption assistance, States mustsubmit for approval a Title N\u2014E plan providing for a foster careand adoption assistance program and satisfying numerous require-ments. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA)requires States to have in effect a law for reporting known and sus-pected child abuse and neglect as well as providing for prompt in-vestigation of child abuse and neglect reports, among many otherrequirements.To receive funding under Title N\u2014B and N\u2014E of the Social Se-curity Act, States must comply with certain procedures for removalof children from their families when necessary, must develop caseplans for each child that are reviewed at least every 6 months andcontain specified information, and must establish specific goals forthe maximum number of eligible children who will remain in fostercare for more than 24 months.Under Title N\u2014B, for fiscal years beginning on or after April1, 1996, State plans must provide assurances that:(1) the State has completed an inventory of all childrenwho, before the inventory, had been in foster care under theresponsibility of the State for six months or more, which deter-mined: (i) the appropriateness of, and necessity for, the fostercare placement; (ii) whether the child could or should be re-turned to the parents of the child or should be freed for adop-tion or other permanent placement; and (iii) the services nec-essary to facilitate the return of the child or the placement ofthe child for adoption or legal guardianship;(2) the State is operating to the satisfaction of the Sec-retary: (i) a statewide information system on children who areor have been in foster care in the last year; (ii) a case reviewsystem for each child receiving foster care under the super-vision of the State; (iii) a service program designed to help chil-dren return to families from which they have been removed; orbe placed for adoption; (iv) a preplacement preventive serviceprogram designed to help children at risk remain with theirfamilies; and(3) the State has reviewed State policies and procedures ineffect for children abandoned at birth; and is implementing (or,will implement by October 31, 1996) such policies or proce- 397dures to enable permanent decisions with respect to the place-ment of such children to be made expeditiously. (For fiscalyears beginning before April 1, 1996, these standards were in-centive finding requirements that States had to meet to re-ceive their full Title N\u2014B allotment, and were known as sec-tion 427 protections.)Title N\u2014E State plans must provide that reasonable effortswill be made prior to the placement of a child in foster care to pre-vent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from her homeand to make it possible for the child to return to her home.Title W\u2014E State plans must provide that, where appropriate,all steps will be taken, including cooperative efforts with StateAFDC and child support enforcement agencies, to secure an assign-ment of any rights to support of a child receiving foster care main-tenance payments under Title W\u2014E.House billAn \"Eligible State\" is one that has submitted to the Secretary,not later than October 1, 1996, and every 3 years thereafter, a planwhich has been signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the State.The plan must outline the State's Child Protection Program andprovide several certifications regarding the nature of its child pro-tection program.A State plan must thoroughly describe the State Child Protec-tion Program by describing State activities and procedures to beused for:(1) receiving and assessing reports of child abuse or ne-glect;(2) investigating such reports;(3) with respect to families in which abuse or neglect hasbeen confirmed, providing services or referral for services forfamilies and children where the State makes a determinationthat the child may safely remain with the family;(4) protecting children by removing them from dangeroussettings and ensuring their placement in a safe environment;(5) providing training for individuals mandated to reportsuspected cases of child abuse or neglect;(6) protecting children in foster care;(7) promoting timely adoptions;(8) protecting the rights of families, using adult relativesas the preferred placement for children separated from theirparents if such relatives meet all relevant standards; and(9) providing services aimed at preventing child abuse andneglect.The State plan must also certify that the State:(1) has in effect laws that require reporting of child abuseand neglect;(2) has in effect procedures for the immediate screening,safety assessment, and prompt investigation of child abuse orneglect reports;(3) has in effect procedures for the removal and placementof abused or neglected children; 398(4) has in effect laws requiring immunity from prosecutionunder State and local laws for individuals making good faithreports of suspected or known cases of child abuse or neglect;(5) has in effect no later than 2 years after enactment,laws and procedures affording individuals an opportunity toappeal an official finding of abuse or neglect;(6) has in effect procedures for developing and reviewingwritten plans for the permanent placement of each child re-moved from the family that: specify the goal for achieving apermanent placement for the child in a timely fashion; ensurethat the plan is reviewed every 6 months; and ensure that in-formation about the child is gathered regularly and placed inthe case record.(7) has in effect a program to provide independent livingservices to 16\u201419 year old youths (and, at State option, youthsup to age 22) who are in the foster care system but have nofamily to support them. (Under the proposal, States also willcontinue to receive capped entitlement grants for IndependentLiving services as under current law.)(8) has in effect procedures or programs (Or both) to re-spond to reports of medical neglect of disabled infants;(9) has quantitative goals of the State child protection pro-gram;(10) will comply with respect to fiscal years beginning onor after April 1, 1996, with the same child protection standardsas under current law. Standards related to abandoned childrenmust be met by October 1, 1997;(11) will make reasonable efforts to prevent the placementof children in foster care and to make it possible for the childto return home. Each State must also certify that it providesservices for children and families where maltreatment hasbeen confirmed but the child remained with the family;(12) will take all appropriate steps, including cooperativeefforts, to secure an assignment to the State of any rights tosupport on behalf of each child receiving foster care mainte-nance payments; and(13) has in effect requirements for disclosure of recordsonly to specified individuals and entities, and provisions thatallow for public disclosure of findings or information aboutcases of child abuse or neglect that have resulted in a child fa-tality or near fatality (except that such disclosure shall not in-clude identifying information about the individual initiating areport of suspected child abuse or neglect).The Secretary of HHS must determine whether the State planincludes the required materials and certifications (except materialrelated to the certification of State procedures to respond to report-ing of medical neglect of disabled infants). The Secretary cannotadd new elements beyond those listed above.Senate amendmentThe amendment does not change current law, except to requirethat the State plan for foster care and adoption assistance providefor the protection of the rights of families, using adult relatives asthe preferred placement for children separated from their parents 399where such relatives meet the relevant State child protectionstandards (see item 8).Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment witha modification to delete the proposed amendment dealing withadult relative preferences.3. GRANTSTOSTATES FOR CHILD PROTECTIONPresent lawTitle N\u2014B of the Social Security Act contains both discre-tionary and capped entitlement funding for helping States provideassistance to troubled families and their children. Of capped enti-tlement funding for family preservation and support, 1 percent isreserved for Indians. For child welfare services under Title N\u2014B,$325 million is authorized annually. For family preservation andsupport services, $225 million is authorized in fiscal year 1996;$240 million in fiscal year 1997; and $255 million in fiscal year1998. State allotments for child welfare services are based on theState's child population and per capita income. State allotments forfamily preservation and support are based on the number of chil-dren in the State receiving Food Stamps. Funds must be used for:\"protecting and promoting the welfare of children * * * preventingunnecessary separation of children from their families * * * restor-ing children to their families if they have been removed * * * fa.r.ily preservation services ** * community-basedfamily support services to promote the well-being of children and families and toincrease parents' confidence and competence.\"For-profit foster care providers are not eligible for Federalfunding under Title 1V\u2014E.Section 1123 of the Social Security Act requires the Secretaryto establish by regulation a new Federal review system for childwelfare which would allow penalties for misuse of funds. Regula-tions are expected to be published during the summer of 1996.(This provision would not be affected by the House proposal.)House billThe block grant contains both entitlement and appropriatedfunds. From the entitlement funds, each eligible State must receivefrom the Secretary an amount equal to the State share of the ChildProtection Block Grant amount for the fiscal year (see below). Aset-aside is provided for Indians equal to 1 percent of the entitle-ment money flowing into the block grant.Each eligible State is also given funds equal to the State shareof the authorization component of the block grant that is appro-priated each year. Indians are given 0.36 percent of the appro-priated money flowing into the block grant. Funds for the author-ization component of the block grant under this section are not toexceed $325 million each year. No funds from the block grant canbe used to pay for foster care or adoption maintenance payments.The term \"child protection amount\" means: $240 million for year 1999; million for fis-cal year 2001; $286 million for fiscal year 2002.The term \"State share\" means the qualified child protection ex-penses of a State divided by the sum of the qualified child protec-tion expenses of all of the States. The term \"qualified State expend-iture\" means Federal grants to the State under the Child WelfareServices Grant and the Family Preservation and Support ServicesGrant in fiscal year 1994 or the average of 1992\u201494, whichever isgreater. In determining amounts for fiscal years 1992 through1994, the Secretary shall use information listed as actual amountsin the Justification for Estimates for Appropriation Committees ofthe Administration for Children and Families for fiscal years 1994through 1996.A State to which funds are paid under this section may use themoney in any manner the State deems appropriate to accomplishthe purposes of this part, but the funds must be expended not laterthan the end of the immediately succeeding fiscal year.For-profit, foster care facilities are eligible to receive fundsfrom the block grant.Under the terms and conditions of the block grant, States aresubject to several penalties:(1) For misuse of funds. If an audit determines that anyamounts provided to a State have been spent in violation ofthis part, the Secretary must reduce the grant otherwise pay-able for the next fiscal year by the amount of the misspentfunds, plus 5 percent of the grant;(2) For failure to maintain effort. If States fail to maintainState spending equal to State expenditures under Part B ofTitle IV in fiscal year 1994, the Secretary must reduce thegrant payable under this section by an amount equal to theprevious year's shortfall in maintenance of effort. A penalty of5 percent of the State grant must also be imposed. States mustmaintain 100 percent of prior effort in fiscal years 1997 and1998; and 75 percent in fiscal years 1999 through 2002;(3) For failure to submit report. If the Secretary deter-mines that the State has not submitted mandatory adoptionand foster care data reports within 6 months of the end of thefiscal year, the Secretary must reduce by 3 percent the amountof the State's block grant. If the report is submitted before theend of the immediately succeeding fiscal year, the Secretaryshall rescind the penalty.Except in the case of failure to maintain effort, the Secretarymay not impose a penalty if the determination is made that theState has reasonable cause for failing to comply with the require-ment. Further, a State must be informed before any penalty is im-posed and be given an opportunity to enter into a corrective compli-ance plan. The provision includes a series of deadlines for submis-sion of such corrective compliance plans and review by the Federalgovernment. No quarterly payment can be reduced by more than25 percent; penalty amounts above 25 percent must be carried for-ward to subsequent quarters.Each territory is entitled to receive from the Secretary for anyfiscal year an amount equal to the total obligations due to the terri-tory under the Social Security Act for fiscal year 1995. 401Except as expressly provided in this Act, the Secretary may notregulate the conduct of States under this part or enforce any provi-sion of this Act.Senate amendmentThe amendment does not change current law, except that itwould amend the definition of \"child care institution\" to include for-profit providers (see item 6).Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.4. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTINGPresent lawIn 1986, Congress established the National Advisory Commit-tee on Adoption and Foster Care Information to assist HHS in de-signing a new comprehensive nationwide data collection systemwith full system implementation expected to be completed by Octo-ber 1991. However, final regulations were not issued until Decem-ber 1993 with the first transmission of data due May 1995. AllStates are now participating in the Adoption and Foster Care Anal-ysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). HHS is currently analyzingthe first datasets transmitted from the States. The final rules re-quire semi-annual reporting on all children in foster care. The datacollection is child and case specific and is intended to yield a semi-annual snapshot of child welfare trends. It is also intended to yieldinformation that will enable policymakers to \"track\" children incare and find out the reasons why children enter foster care, howlong children stay in foster care, and what happens to childrenwhile in foster care as well as after they leave foster care.In 1993, Congress authorized enhanced funding of 75 percentfor both the AFCARS system and for several additional functionsnot originally envisioned as part of AFCARS capability. These newfunctions included electronic data exchange within the State, auto-mated data collection on all children in foster care, collection andmanagement of information necessary to facilitate delivery of childwelfare services and to determine eligibility for such services, casemanagement, case plan development and monitoring, and informa-tion security. Enhanced funding of 75 percent for this second datasystem, which HHS calls the Statewide Automated Child WelfareInformation System (SACWIS), expires on October 1, 1996.House billThe House provision leaves unaltered the current State datareporting system on child protection. The enhanced funding rate of75 percent for the Statewide Automated Child Welfare InformationSystem (SACWIS) is extended for 1 additional year, through fiscalyear 1997.Senate amendmentSame. 402Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.5. FUNDING FOR STUDIES OF CHILD WELFAREPresent lawSec. 426 authorizes discretionary funding for child welfare re-search and demonstration projects. No funds were appropriated in1996.House billThe Secretary is entitled to receive, for each of fiscal years1996 through 2002, $6 million to conduct a national study basedon random samples of children who are at risk of child abuse orneglect, and $10 million for other research.Senate amendmentThe amendment does not change current law.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill. The confereesrecommend that the Secretary, in conducting the random samplestudy, require that the study have a longitudinal component andyield data that is reliable at the State level for as many States asshe determines is feasible. The conferees also recommend that theSecretary carefully consider selecting the sample from cases of con-firmed abuse or neglect and follow each case for several years whileobtaining information on, among other things, the type of abuse orneglect involved, the frequency of contact with State or local agen-cies, whether the child involved has been separated from the fam-ily, and, if so, under what circumstances, the number, type, andcharacteristics of out-of-home placements of the child, and the aver-age duration of each placement.6. DEFINITIONSPresent lawThe term \"child care institution\" means a licensed nonprofitprivate or public facility which accommodates no more than 25 chil-dren. The term does not apply to detention facilities, forestrycamps, training schools, or centers for delinquent children.House billSame as present law, except the word \"nonprofit\" is deleted.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House and the Sen-ate amendment. 4037. CONFORMING AMENDMENTSPresent lawHouse billThis section makes a series of technical and conformingamendments to the Social Security Act and the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1986.Senate amendmentThe amendment redesignates section 1123 (42 U.S.C. 1320a\u2014la) the second place it appears as section 1123A.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.Chapter 2\u2014Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and IndependentLiving Programs8. CHANGES IN TITLE W\u2014E OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTPresent lawTitle IV\u2014E Foster Care and Title IV\u2014E Adoption Assistance areintended to help States finance foster care and adoption assistancemaintenance payments, administration, child placement services,and training related to foster care and adoption assistance.The purpose of the Title W\u2014E Independent Living Program isto help older foster children make the transition to independent liv-ing.House billThe most notable feature of House action on Title IV\u2014E is thatall the entitlement programs remain intact. In addition, the Houseretains the provision of current law that guarantees Medicaid cov-erage for children who receive maintenance payments from eitherthe foster care or adoption programs. On the other hand, the Houseprovision does change current law in three ways.First, the current law guarantee of eligibility for foster careand adoption maintenance payments for children eligible for theAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was dis-rupted because the AFDC statute was completely rewritten to giveStates the authority to establish their own welfare programs. Toensure that the eligibility of poor children for maintenance pay-ments continues, the House provision guarantees eligibility for allchildren from families that would have been eligible for the AFDCprogram as it existed in each State on the day before enactmentof this legislation.Second, the House provision allows States to use private for-profit foster care facilities. The House believes that States shouldbe allowed to use private child care organizations because they arefully capable of providing quality services. States are responsiblefor ensuring that children are in safe and reliable care whether itis provided by public or private entities. The House can see no rea-son to automatically refuse participation by an entire sector of thechild caring community. 404Third, the House provided enhanced funding for the StatewideAutomated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS) becauseautomation is a vital part of providing quality child protection serv-ices. The House has investigated progress by the States in creatingSACWIS and has found that several States are now ready to beginactual implementation and that as many as half the States can beexpected to have operational systems by next year if funding re-mains available. Thus, the House is extending the enhanced fund-ing rate of 75 percent to encourage States to invest money in theseimportant systems.Senate amendmentThe amendment amends Title W\u2014E to in the definition of \"child care institutions\" (see item 6). Theprovision also amends Title W\u2014E to require that the State plan forfoster care and adoption assistance provide for the protection of therights of families, using adult relatives as the preferred placementfor children separated from their parents where such relativesmeet the relevant State child protection standards.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment witha modification to delete the proposed amendment dealing withadult relative preference.Chapter 3\u2014Miscellaneous9. SECRETARIAL SUBMISSION CONFORMING AMENDMENTSPresent lawNo provision.House billNot later than 90 days after the date of enactment, the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services must submit to Congress alegislative proposal providing for technical and conforming amend-ments required by the changes made in this subtitle of the pro-posal.Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.10. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING TIMELY ADOPTION OFCHILDRENPresent lawNo provision.House billThis section expresses the sense of Congress that too manyadoptable children are spending too much time in foster care, that 405States must take steps to increase the number of children who areadopted in a timely manner, and that States could achieve savingsif they offered incentives for the adoption of special needs children,among other provisions.Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference TRANSITION RULESPresent lawNo provision.House billThe changes made in this subtitle will be effective on or afterOctober 1, 1996. Provisions that authorize and appropriate fundsin fiscal year 1996 for research and court improvements, and cer-tain technical and conforming amendments are effective upon en-actment. The proposal establishes transition rules for pendingclaims, actions and proceedings, and closing out accounts for pro-grams that are terminated or substantially modified.Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.Subtitle and Family Services Block GrantPresent law No provision.House billThe block grant and associated activities under Subtitle B areunder the jurisdiction of the Economic and Educational Opportuni-ties Committee in the House and the Labor and Human ResourcesCommittee in the Senate. The Child and Family Services BlockGrant created by Subtitle B consolidates the following programsinto a single block grant: The Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-ment Act, the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act, adoption opportu-nities under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adop-tion Reform Act, the family support centers under the McKinneyHomeless Assistance Act, and the Temporary Child Care and CrisisNurseries Act. The Child and Family Services Block Grant has thesame State plan and certification requirements as the Child Protec-tion Block Grant created by Subtitle A. The two Block Grants alsohave the same data collection and reporting requirements for childabuse incidence data and for the implementation of foster care andadoption tracking systems. The Child and Family Services BlockGrant is authorized at $230 million for fiscal year 1996 and \"suchsums as may be necessary\" are authorized for fiscal year 1997 406through fiscal year 2002. Title II of the Child and Family ServicesBlock Grant provides that funds be available for research, dem-onstrations, training and technical assistance to better protect chil-dren from maltreatment. Funds under this block grant also will es-tablish a National Clearinghouse for Information Relating to ChildAbuse, provide demonstration grants for the development of inno-vative programs, provide technical assistance to States to assistwith child abuse investigation and the termination of parentalrights proceedings, and provide training for professionals in relatedfields. For these Title II activities, 12 percent of the $230 millionprovided for this Block Grant is authorized of which 40 percentmust be available for demonstration projects. The Missing Chil-dren's Assistance Act and the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990are both reauthorized.Senate amendmentNo provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows TITLE AND REFERENCESPresent lawNo Title: Child Care and Development Block Grant Amend-ments of 1996. Unless otherwise specified, references should beconsidered as made to the Child Care and Development BlockGrant Act of 1990.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows Sen-ate amendment.2. GOALSPresent lawNo provision.House billThis section establishes the following goals for the Child Careand Development Block Grant:(1) to allow each State maximum flexibility in developingchild care programs and policies that best suit the needs ofchildren and parents within the State;(2) to promote parental choice in making decisions on thechild care that best suits their family's needs; 407(3) to encourage States to provide consumer information tohelp parents make informed child care choices;(4) to assist States in providing child care to parents tryingto become independent of public assistance; and(5) to assist States in implementing the health, safety, li-censing and registration standards established in State regula-tions.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ENTITLEMENTAUTHORITYPresent lawThe authorization of appropriations for the Child Care and De-velopment Block Grant expires at the end of fiscal year 1995. Ap-propriations in fiscal year 1996 are $935 million. (Sec. 658B of theCCDBG Act)[Note.\u2014In addition to appropriated funds, entitlement fundsare available for the Child Care Block Grant under the AFDCChild Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care pro-grams authorized by Title W\u2014A of the Social Security Act.]House billAuthorization of Appropriations. There are authorized to be ap-propriated $1,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 through2002. (Additional mandatory funding will be provided for child careunder the Social Security Act so that a total of $22 billion will beprovided for child care over the 7-year period fiscal years 1996\u20142002.)Child Care Entitlement. The proposal establishes a single childcare block grant and State administrative system by adding man-datory funds to the existing Child Care and Development BlockGrant (CCDBG). Specifically, one discretionary and two mandatorystreams of fi.mding will be consolidated in a reconstituted CCDBG.a. State General Entitlement. From the stream of entitlementfi.mding, each State will receive the amount of funds it received forchild care under all of the entitlement programs currently underTitle W\u2014A of the Social Security Act (AFDC Child Care, Transi-tional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in fiscal year 1994, infiscal year 1995, or the average amount in fiscal years 1992through 1994, whichever is greater. This source of funds will pro-vide States with approximately $1.2 billion for child care each yearbetween 1997 and 2002.b. Remainder. The mandatory fimds remaining after the allo-cation to Indians (see below) and the State General Entitlement(see above) will be distributed among the States based on the for-mula currently used in the Title W-A At-Risk Child Care Grant.Specifically, funds will be distributed based on the proportion of thenumber of children under age 13 residing in the State to the num- 408ber of all of the Nation's children under age 13. States must pro-vide matching funds at the fiscal year 1995 State Medicaid rate toreceive these funds and must maintain spending at their fiscal year1994 or 1995 level, whichever is greater, under the Title N\u2014A childcare programs. The money available to States through this sourceof funds for fiscal years 1997 through 2002, respectively, will be:$0.76 billion, $0.86 billion, $0.96 billion, $1.16 billion, $1.36 billion,and $1.51 billion.If a State does not use its full portion of funds, the remainingportion will be redistributed to other States according to section402(i) of the At-Risk Child Care Grant (as such section was in ef-fect before October 1, 1995). Thus, each State applying for these re-maining funds will receive the percentage of funds that equals thepercentage of children under age 13 residing in that State of allchildren under age 13 residing in all the States that apply forfunds. The Secretary must determine whether States will use theirentire portion of funds no later than the end of the first quarterof the subsequent fiscal year.c. Appropriation. Total child care funds under this proposalwill equal $22 billion for child care over the 7-year period fiscalyears 1996\u20142002, including both the $15 billion in mandatoryfunds discussed above and $7 billion in discretionary funds. Undercurrent law for the three existing AFDC-related child care pro-grams, $1.1 billion in mandatory funds will be spent in fiscal year1996. In addition, a total of $13.85 billion in mandatory fundswould be authorized for child care in fiscal years 1997\u20142002, start-ing at $2.0 billion in fiscal year 1997 and rising to $2.7 billion infiscal year 2002. Finally, as stated earlier, $1 billion will be author-ized annually in discretionary funds for the Child Care and Devel-opment Block Grant.d. Indian Tribes. One percent of all funds under the section areprovided to Indian tribes.Use of Funds. Funds shall only be used to provide child careassistance. Amounts received by a State, based on the amounts re-ceived in previous years, shall be available for use by the Statewithout fiscal year limitation. All funds from both mandatory anddiscretionary sources must be transferred to the lead agency underthe Child Care and Development Block Grant and integrated intothe State child care programs.Not less than 70 percent of the total amount of mandatoryfunds received by the State in a fiscal year must be used to providechild care assistance to families that are receiving assistance undera State program, families that are attempting to transition off pub-lic assistance, and families at risk of becoming dependent on publicassistance.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and Senateamendment, with a modification. The Secretary shall reserve notless than 1 percent and not more than 2 percent of the total 409amount appropriated (both mandatory and discretionary) in eachfiscal year for payments to Indian tribes and tribal organizations.4. LEAD AGENCYPresent lawThe Chief Executive Officer of a State is required to designatean appropriate State agency to act as the lead agency in admin-istering financial assistance under the Act. (Sec. 658D of theCCDBG Act)House billThe proposal requires States to identif' a lead agency to ad-minister all the child care funds received under the Act, includingfunds received through other \"governmental or nongovernmental\"agencies (instead of other \"State\" agencies). States must ensurethat \"sufficient time and statewide distribution of the notice\" begiven of the public hearing on the development of the State plan.This section strikes language in current law specifying issues thatmay be considered during consultation with local governments ondevelopment of the State plan.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.5. APPLICATION ANDPLANPresentlawStates are required to prepare and submit to the Secretary anapplication that includes a State plan. The initial plan must covera 3-year period, and subsequent plans must cover 2-year periods.Required contents of the plan include designation of a lead agency;outline of policies and procedures regarding parental choice of pro-viders, summary of policies that guarantee unlimited parental ac-cess, parental complaints, and consumer education; and overview ofpolicies that ensure compliance with State and local regulatory re-quirements, establishment of and compliance with health and safe-ty requirements, and review of State licensing and regulatory re-quirements.In addition, the State plan must provide that all funds will beused for child care services, and that 25 percent of funds will bereserved for activities to improve the quality of child care and toincrease the availability of early childhood development and before-and after-school child care. (Sec. 658E of the CCDBG Act)State plans must also assure that payment rates will be ade-quate to provide eligible children with equal access to child care ascompared with children whose families are not eligible for sub-sidies, and must assure that the State will establish and periodi-cally revise a sliding fee scale that provides for cost sharing byfamilies that receive child care subsidies. 410House billThe proposal requires the State plan to cover a 2-year period.States must provide a detailed description of procedures to be usedto assure parental choice of providers. Instead of \"providing assur-ances,\" States must \"certifr\" that procedures are in effect withinthe State to ensure unlimited parental access to the families pro-viding care to children and to ensure parental choice of child careprovider; the proposal also requires that the State plan provide adetailed description of such procedures. Instead of \"providing assur-ances,\" a State must \"certify\" that it maintains a record of parentalcomplaints and requires the State to provide a detailed descriptionof how such a record is maintained and made available. The pro-posal changes the consumer education part of the State plan to re-quire assurances that the State will collect and disseminate consumer education information. States must certify that they havein effect child care licensing requirements and provide a detaileddescription of the requirements and how they are enforced. Thisprovision does not require that licensing requirements be appliedto specific types of child care providers.States must \"certifr\" that procedures are in effect to ensurethat child care providers receiving funds under this Act complywith applicable State or local health and safety requirements. TheSecretary is required to develop minimum standards for Indiantribes and tribal organizations receiving assistance.The proposal eliminates review of State licensing and regu-latory requirements, notification to the Department of Health andHuman Services(HHS) when standardsarereduced,and supplementation. The proposal also eliminates the requirementthat unlicensed providers be registered. The House decided to re-tain a current law requirement that all States establish health andsafety standards. The House provision does not specifr the particu-lar standards that must be established, but all States must haverequirements on prevention and control of infectious diseases (in-cluding immunizations), building and physical premises safety, andminimum health and safety training.A summary of the facts relied upon by the State to determinethat payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access to childcare must be included in the State plan. Funds must be used forchild care services, for activities to improve the quality and avail-ability of such services, and for any other activity that the Statedeems appropriate to realize the goals specified above. The pro-posal deletes the current law requirement that States reserve 25percent of funds for activities to improve the quality of child careand to increase availability of early childhood development andbefore- and after-school care. States may spend no more than 5 per-cent on administrative costs.States must spend a substantial portion of the amounts avail-able to provide child care to low-income working families who arenot working their way off welfare or are at risk of becoming welfaredependent. However, States first must comply with requirementthat at least 70 percent of mandatory funds must be used for wel-fare or at-risk families. States must demonstrate how they willmeet the child care needs of welfare and at-risk families. 411SenateamendmentSame, except the Senate maintains current law (which re-quires States to \"provide assurances\" that child care providers re-ceiving funds under this Act comply with applicable State or localhealth and safety requirements).Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill with a modi-fication. The provision requires States to \"certify' that health andsafety requirements are in effect within a State applicable to childcare providers.Nothing in the legislation either prohibits or requires States todifferentiate between federally subsidized child care and nonsub-sidized child care regarding the application of specific standardsand regulations. The cap of 5 percent on administrative costs is in-cluded in both the House and Senate passed bills. To help Statesimplement this provision, the Department of Health and HumanServices should issue regulations, in a timely manner and prior tothe deadline for submission of State plans, that define and deter-mine true administrative costs, as distinct from expenditures forservices. Eligibility determination and redetermination, prepara-tion and participation in judicial hearings, child care placement,the recruitment, licensing, inspection, reviews and supervision ofchild care placements, rate setting, resource and referral services,training, and the establishment and maintenance of computerizedchild care information are an integral part of service delivery andshould not be considered administrative costs.6. ACTWITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILD CAREPresentlawAs stated above, 25 percent of State allotments must be re-served for activities to improve child care quality and to increasethe availability of early childhood development and before- andafter-school child care. Section 658G specifies how these funds areto be used. Of reserved funds, States are required to use no lessthan 20 percent for improving the quality of care, including re-source and referral programs, making grants or loans to assist pro-viders in meeting State and local standards, monitoring of compli-ance with licensing and regulatory requirements, training of childcare personnel, and improving compensation for child care person-nel. (Sec. 658G of the CCDBG Act).House billA State that receives child care funds must use at least 4 per-cent of all funds received (both mandatory and discretionary) foractivities designed to provide comprehensive consumer education toparents and the public, for activities that increase parental choice,and for activities designed to improve the quality and availabilityof child care.Senate amendmentSame. 412Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.7. REPEAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND BEFORE- ANDArrER-SCHOOL CARE REQUIREMENTPresent lawStates are required to use no less than 75 percent of funds re-served for quality improvement for activities to expand and conductearly childhood development programs and before- and after-schoolchild care.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENTPresent lawThe Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is re-quired to coordinate HHS and other Federal child care agencies, tocollect and publish a list of State child care standards every 3years, and to provide technical assistance to States. The Secretarymust also review, monitor, and enforce compliance with the Actand the State plan by withholding payments and imposing addi-tional sanctions in certain cases. (Sec. 6581 of the CCDBG Act)House billThis section strikes the current law requirement that the Sec-retary withhold further payments to a State in case of a finding ofnoncompliance until the noncompliance is corrected. Instead, theSecretary is authorized, in such cases, to require that the State re-imburse the Secretary for any improperly spent funds, or the Sec-retary may deduct from the administrative portion of the State'ssubsequent allotment an amount equal to or less than the misspentfunds, or a combination of such options.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment. 413 9.PAYMENTSPresentlawPayments received by a State for a fiscal year may be ex-pended in that fiscal year or in the succeeding 3 fiscal years. (Sec.658J of the CCDBG Act)House billThe bill replaces the word \"expended\" with \"obligated\". How-ever, the bill contains a drafting error. A provision that would havestruck \"3 fiscal years\" and inserted \"fiscal year\" was Senate amendment contains the same drafting error.Conference agreementThe conference agreement corrects a previous drafting error bystriking fiscal years\" and inserting \"fiscal year\".10.ANNUALREPORT AND AUDITSPresent lawStates must prepare and submit to the Secretary every year areport specifring how funds are used; presenting data on the man-ner in which the child care needs of families in the State are beingfulfilled, including information on the number of children served,child care programs in the State, compensation provided to childcare staff, and activities to encourage public-private partnershipsin child care; describing the extent to which affordability and avail-ability of child care has increased; summarizing findings from a re-view of State licensing and regulatory requirements, if applicable;explaining any action taken by the State to reduce standards, if ap-plicable; and describing standards and health and safety require-ments applied to child care providers in the State, including a de-scription of efforts to improve the quality of child care. (Sec. 658Kof the CCDBG Act)House billThe title of the section is changed from \"Annual Report andAudits\" to \"Reports and Audits.\" States must collect on a monthlybasis, and report to HHS on a quarterly basis, the following infor-mation on each family receiving assistance:(1) family income;(2) county of residence;(3) the gender, race, age of children receiving benefits;(4) whether the family includes only one parent;(5) the sources of family income, including:(a) the amount obtained from employment, includingself-employment;(b) cash assistance or other assistance under Part A;(c) housing assistance;(d) food stamps; and(e) other public assistance; 414(6) the number of months the family has received benefits;(7) the type of care in which the child was enrolled (familyday care, center, own home);(8) whether the provider was a relative;(9) the cost of care; and(10) the average hours per week of care.Twice each year, the State must submit the following aggre-gate data to HHS:(1) the number of providers separately identified in accordwith each type of provider that received funding under thissubchapter;(2) the monthly cost of child care services and the portionof such cost paid with assistance from this Act by type of care;(3) the number of payments by the State in vouchers, con-tracts, cash, and disregards from public benefit programs bytype of care;(4) the manner in which consumer education informationwas provided and the number of parents who received it; total number (unduplicated) of children and familiesserved.Senate amendmentSame.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.11.

Remaining funds are allocated to the States based onthe States' proportion of children under age 5 and the number ofchildren receiving free or reduced-price school lunches, as well asthe States' per capita income. Any portion of a State's reallotmentthat the Secretary determines is not needed by the State to carryout its plan for the allotment period must be reallotted by the Sec-retary to the other States in the same proportion as the originalallotments. (Sec. 6580 of the CCDBG Act)House billSet-asides for the Territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organi-zations are maintained, except that the Trust Territory of the Pa-cific Islands is deleted from the set-aside for Territories. Indiantribes are provided with a 1 percent set-aside of all funds, both en-titlement and appropriated, authorized by this section each year.Under some circumstances, and with approval from the Secretary,Indian tribes are authorized to use a portion of their ffinds for ren-ovation and construction of child care facilities. Within the overallblock grant for social programs provided to the territories, each ter-ritory is authorized to spend whatever portion they choose of theircapped amount on child care (for additional details see item 79 ofTitle I). Allotments to States were described in item 3 above.Senate amendmentSame as the House bill except the Indian tribes are providedwith a 3-percent set-aside for child care.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill with a modi-fication.

The definition of \"relative child careprovider\" is revised by adding great grandchild and sibling (if theprovider lives in a separate residence) to the list of eligible relativeproviders and the requirement that relatives providing care be reg-istered is struck. Relative providers are required to comply withany applicable requirements governing child care provided by a rel-ative, rather than State requirements.

In addition, if theindividual is head of household and fails to comply with one of theabove-noted conditions or voluntarily quits a job without goodcause, the entire household is ineligible. [Sec. 6(d)(1)] 458Duration of Ineligibility/Household Ineligibility. Disqualifica-tion periods for failure to meet work/training conditions of partici-pation are (1) 2 months or until compliance (whichever is first) formost failures and (2) 90 days in the case of a voluntary quit.

Makes ineligibility for failure to complywith workfare requirements explicit and covered by new (seebelow) duration of ineligibility rules. Adds a condition making allindividuals (in addition to heads of household) ineligible if they vol-untarily quit a job without good cause. Lack of adequate child care,as an explicit good cause exemption for refusal to participate in anemployment or training program, is removed. [Sec. 10251Duration of Ineligibility/Household Ineligibility. Establishes new mandatory minimum disqualification periods for individualsfailing to comply with any work/training condition of participation.For the first violation, individuals are ineligible until they fulfillwork/training conditions, for 1 month, or for a period (determinedby the State) not to exceed 3 months\u2014whichever is later.

[Sec. 10251Administration. In establishing cases of good cause, voluntaryquit, and reduction of work effort, the Secretary determines themeaning of the terms. States determine the meaning of other termsrelated to work/training conditions of participation and the proce-dures for making compliance decisions, but cannot make deter-minations that are less restrictive than a comparable one under theState's family assistance block grant (TANF) program. [Sec. 10251Senate conference agreement adopts the provisions that are to both bills. [Sec. 8151 45917.

The State may lower the age of thechild for not more than 3 years. [Sec. 816]18. EMPLOYMENT ANDTRAININGPresent lawPrograms. States must operate employment and training pro-grams for nonexempt food stamp recipients and place a minimumproportion of those covered in a program component. Program com-ponents can range from job search or education activities to workexperience/training and workfare assignments.Work experience/training program components must limit as-signments to projects serving a useful public purpose, use the priortraining/experience of assignees, not provide work that has the ef-fect of replacing others, and provide the same benefits and workingconditions provided others.States and political subdivisions also may operate workfareprograms under which nonexempt recipients may be required toperform work in return for the minimum wage equivalent of theirhousehold's monthly food stamp allotment. Workfare assignmentsmay not replace or prevent the employment of others and mustprovide the same benefits and working conditions provided others.The total hours of work required of a household under an em-ploymentItraining program (including workfare) cannot exceed theminimum wage equivalent of the household's monthly allotment.Monthly participation in an employmentItraining program requiredof any household member cannot exceed 120 hours (when added toother work). And workfare hours (when added to other work) can-not exceed 30 hours a week for a household member.Under employment and training programs for food stamp re-cipients, States must provide or pay for transportation and othercosts directly related to participation (up to $25 a month for eachparticipant) and necessary dependent care expenses (in general, up 460to local market rates). Under workfare program, States must reim-burse participants for transportation and other costs directly relat-ed to participation (up to $25 a month for each participant). [Sec.6(d)(4) and sec. 20]Funding. To support employment and training programs forfood stamp recipients, States receive a formula share of requiredspending of $75 million a year. Each State's share is based on itsshare of nonexempt recipients and its. share of those placed in em-ployment/training program components. [Sec. 16(h)]In addition, States receive a 50 percent match for any addi-tional administrative or participant support costs. [Sec. 16(h)]House billPrograms. Revises the existing requirements for State-operatedemployment and training programs for food stamp recipients:makes clear that work experience is a purpose of employ-ment and training programs;requires that each component of an employment/trainingprogram be delivered through a \"statewide workforce develop-ment system,\" unless the component is not available locallythrough the system;expands the existing State option to apply work/trainingrequirements to applicants to include all work/training require-ments, not only job search;removes specific Federal rules governing job search compo-nents (i.e., those tied to rules in the AFDC program);removes provisions for employment/training componentsrelated to work experience requiring that they be in publicservice work and use recipients' prior training/experience;removes specific Federal rules as to States' authority to ex-empt categories and individuals from employment/training re-quirements, giving States full latitude to determine exemp-tions;removes a requirement to serve volunteers;removes the requirement for \"conciliation procedures\" forresolving disputes involving participation in employment/train-ing programs;limits employment and training funding provided by thefood stamp program for services to family assistance blockgrant (TANF) recipients to the amount used by the State forAFDC recipients in fiscal year 1995; andremoves provisions for Federal performance standards onStates. [Sec. 1027]Funding. Provides for required Federal spending of increasingamounts for employment and training programs: $79 million in fis-cal year 1997, $81 million in 1998, $84 million in 1999, $86 millionin 2000, $88 million in 2001, and $90 million in 2002. State alloca-tions are based on a \"reasonable formula\" (determined by the Sec-retary) that gives consideration to each State's population of per-sons subject to the new work requirement (see item 25). [Sec. 1027]Provides that the 50 percent match for additional administra-tive costs can include costs for case management/casework to facili-tate the transition from economic dependency to self-sufficiencythrough work. [Sec. 1027] 461Deletes a requirement for a report from the Secretary on modi-fring Federal employment and training program payments toStates to reflect their effectiveness in carrying out employment andtraining programs. [Sec. 10271Senate amendmentPrograms. Same provisions. [Sec. 11261Funding. Same provisions, except that required Federal spend-ing is $85 million a year for fiscal years 1997\u20142002.

[Sec. 817]19.FOODSTAMP ELIGIBILITYPresent lawThe income and resources of aliens ineligible under FoodStamp Act provisions are counted as available to the remainder ofthe household, less a pro rata share for the ineligible alien. [Sec.6(f)]House billPermits States the option to count all of the income and re-sources of an alien ineligible under Food Stamp Act provisions asavailable to the remainder of the household. [Sec. 1066]Senate amendmentSame provision, with technical differences. [Sec. 1127]Conference agreementThe conference agreement adopts the Senate provision. [Sec.818]20. COMPARABLE TREATMENT FOR DISQUALIFICATIONPresent lawHouseholds penalized for an intentional failure to comply witha Federal, State, or local welfare program may not, for the durationof the penalty, receive an increased food stamp allotment becausethe welfare payment has been reduced. [Sec. 8(d)]Persons are exempt from food stamp work/training conditionsof participation if they are currently subject to and complying withAFDC or unemployment insurance work registration requirements.Failure to comply with an AFDC/unemployment insurance workregistration requirement that \"is comparable to\" a food stamp workrequirement results in disqualification as if the food stamp require-ment had been violated. [Sec. 6(d)(2)]House billIf an individual is disqualified for failure to perform an actionrequired under a Federal, State, or local law relating to means-tested public assistance, the State agency is permitted to imposethe same disqualification for food stamps. 462If a disqualification is imposed under the family assistanceblock grant (TANF) rules, States are permitted to use the TANFrules and procedures to impose the same disqualification for foodstamps.Permits individuals disqualified from food stamps because offailure to perform a required action under another public assist-ance program to apply for food stamps as new applicants after thedisqualification period has expired, except that a prior disqualifica-tion under food stamp program work/training rules must be consid-ered in determining eligibility.Requires States to include in their State plans the guidelinesthey use in carrying out food stamp disqualification for failure toperform another program's required action(s). [Sec. 1028]Removes the requirement that an AFDC/unemployment insur-ance work requirement be \"comparable\" to a food stamp require-ment to bring on disqualification from food stamps.

After the date of enactment, no nonexempt indi-vidual may be eligible for food stamps for more than 3 months dur-ing which the individual does not (1) work at least 20 hours a week(averaged monthly), (2) participate in and comply with a \"work pro-gram\" for at least 20 hours a week (as determined by the Stateagency), or (3) participate in a workfare program. A work programis defined as a program under the Job Training Partnership Act,a Trade Adjustment Assistance Act program, or a program of em-ployment and training operated or supervised by a State or politi-cal subdivision that meets standards approved by the Governor (in-cluding a Food Stamp Act employment and training program),other than job search or job search training. [Sec. 1033]General Exemptions. The new work requirement does notapply to (1) those under 18 or over 50, (2) those who are medicallycertified as physically or mentally unfit for employment, (3) parentsor other household members with the responsibility for a depend-ent child, (3) those otherwise exempt from work registration re-quirements (e.g., those caring for incapacitated persons), and (4)pregnant women. [Sec. 1033]Other Provisions. On a State agency's request, the Secretarymay waive application of the new work requirement to any groupof individuals if the Secretary determines that the area where theyreside (1) has an unemployment rate over 10 percent or (2) doesnot have a sufficient number of jobs to provide them employment.The Secretary must report the basis for any waiver to Congress.[Sec. 1033]Senate amendmentRequirement. No nonexempt individual may be eligible for foodstamps if, during the preceding 12-month period, the individual re-ceived food stamp benefits for 4 months or more while not (1) work-ing at least 20 hours a week (averaged monthly), (2) participatingin and complying with a \"work program\" for at least 20 hours aweek (as determined by the State agency), or (3) participating inand complying with a workfare program. A work program is de-fined as in the House bill, with a technical difference. [Sec. 1133]General Exemptions. Same provisions. [Sec. 1133]Other Provisions. Provisions for unemployment-rate and job-availability waivers are the same as in the House bill, except thatthe Secretary must respond to a State agency request within 15days. [Sec. 1133] 465The disqualification imposed under the new work requirementceases to apply if, during a 30-day period, an individual works 80hours or more, participates in and complies with a work program(defined above) for at least 80 hours, or participates in and com-plies with a workfare program. After regaining eligibility, the indi-vidual again is subject to the new work requirement, except thata new 12-month period begins. [Sec. 1133]State agencies may exempt an individual from the new workrequirement: (1) by reason of \"hardship\" or (2) for up to 2 months(in any 12-month period), if the individual participates in and com-plies with a job search or job search training program under theFood Stamp Act's employment and training program provisionsthat requires an average of at least 20 hours a week of participa-tion. The fiscal year average monthly number of individuals partici-pating because of a hardship exemption may not exceed 20 percentof the fiscal year average number of individuals receiving foodstamps who are not exempt from the new work requirement be-cause of the general exemptions or waivers (noted above). [Sec.11331Provides for a transition to the new work requirement. Priorto 1 year after enactment, administrators would not \"look back\" afull 12 months; they would look back only to the date of enactment.[Sec. 1133]Conference agreementThe conference agreement adopts the provisions that are com-mon to both bills: General Exemptions and provisions for waiversin cases of high unemployment and lack of sufficient jobs. With re-spect to the provisions in disagreement, the conference agreementadopts the Senate provisions with an amendment:No nonexempt individual may be eligible for food stamps if,during the preceding 36-month period, the individual received foodstamp benefits for 3 months or more while not (1) working at least20 hours a week (averaged monthly), (2) participating in and com-plying with a work program for at least 20 hours a week (as deter-mined by the State agency), or (3) participating in and complyingwith a workfare program. A work program is defined as in theHouse bill. Receipt of benefits while exempt (including participa-tion under the additional 3-month eligibility provision describedbelow) or covered by a waiver would not count toward an individ-ual's basic 3-month eligibility period.Individuals denied eligibility under the new work rule wouldregain eligibility if, during a 30-day period, the individual (1) works80 or more hours, (2) participates in and complies with the require-ments of a work program for 80 or more hours (as determined bythe State agency), or (3) participates in and complies with the re-quirements of a workfare program. After having met this 30-daywork/training requirement, the individual could remain eligible fora consecutive period of 3 months without working at least 20 hoursa week or participating in an employment/training or workfare pro-gram. For example, if an individual works 20 hours a week for atleast 30 days and then loses a job, the individual could retain foodstamp eliibiity for 3 consecutive months without working or beingin a traimnglworkfare program. 466But individuals could not take advantage of this provision foran additional 3 months of eligibility, while not working or in anemployment/training or workfare program, for more than a single3-month period in a 36-month period. Individuals regaining eligi-bility also would remain eligible as long as they continued to meetrequirements to work at least 20 hours a week or participate in atraining/workfare program.Transition provisions are included that provide that the 36-month period established by the new work requirement will not in-clude any period before the earlier of the date the State notifies re-cipients (through means such as individual notices at certification,recertification, otherwise, mass mailings, media announcements, orotherwise) about the new work requirement or 3 months after en-actment.[Sec. 824]26. ENCOURAGEMENT OF ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER SYSTEMSPresent lawRules for EBT Systems. State agencies, with the Secretary'sapproval, may implement on-line electronic benefit transfer (EBT)systems for delivering food stamp benefits. No State may imple-ment or expand an EBT system without prior approval from theSecretary. States are responsible for 50 percent of EBT systemcosts. The Secretary's regulations for approval must include (1)standards that require that, in any 1 year, the operational cost ofan EBT system does not exceed costs of prior issuance systems and(2) system security standards. [Sec. 7(i)]Regulation E. The Federal Reserve Board has ruled that, as ofMarch 1997 (and with some minor modifications), its \"RegulationE\" will apply to EBT systems. Regulation E provides certain pro-tections for consumers using cards to access their accounts.

Provides that States must implementEBT systems (on-line or off-line) before October 1, 2002, unless theSecretary waives the requirement because a State agency faces un-usual barriers to implementation. States are encouraged to imple-ment an EBT system as soon as practicable. [Sec. 1034]Subject to Federal standards, permits State agencies to procureand implement an EBT system under the terms, conditions, anddesign the agency considers appropriate. Adds a new requirementfor Federal procurement standards and deletes the requirement forthe Secretary's prior approval.

ISec. 1034]Deletes the requirement that EBT systems be cost neutral inany one year. [Sec. 1034]Adds a requirement that regulations regarding the replace-ment of benefits and liability for replacement under an EBT systembe similar to those in effect for a paper food stamp issuance sys-tem. [Sec. 1034]Permits State agencies to collect a charge for replacing EBTcards by reducing allotments. [Sec. 1034]Permits State agencies to require that EBT cards contain aphotograph of one or more household members and requires that,if a State requires a photograph, it must establish procedures toensure that other appropriate members of the household and au-thorized representatives may use the card. [Sec. 1034]Declares it the sense of Congress that States operate EBT sys-tems that are compatible with other States' systems. [Sec. 1034]Regulation E. Provides that Regulation E will not apply to anyEBT system, established under, or administered by, State or localgovernments, distributing needs-tested benefits. [Sec. 1091]Anti-tying Restrictions. Provides that a company may not sellor provide EBT services, or fix or vary the consideration for suchservices, on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain,or not obtain, some additional point-of-sale service from the com-pany or any affiliate.

However,States must comply with the following food stamp rules:requirements governing issuance procedures;the requirement that benefits be calculated by subtracting30 percent of household income (as determined by State-estab-lished, not Federal, rules under the simplified program option)from the maximum food stamp benefit;the bar against counting food stamp benefits as income orresources in other programs; 482requirements that State agencies assume responsibility foreligibilitycertification and issuance of benefits and keeprecords for inspection and audit;the bar against discrimination by reason of race, sex, reli-gious creed, national origin, orpolitics;requirements related to submission and approval of plansof operation and administration of the food stamp program onIndian reservations;limits on the use and disclosure of information about foodstamp households;requirements for notice to and fair hearings for aggrievedhouseholds (or comparable requirements established by theState);requirements for submission of reports and other informa-tion required by the Secretary;the requirement to report illegal aliens to the INS;provisions for the use of certain Federal and State datasources in verifying eligibility;requirements to ensure that households are not receivingduplicate benefits; andrequirements for the provision of social security numbersas a condition of eligibility and for their use by State agencies.Households may not receive benefits under a simplified pro-gram unless the Secretary determines that any household with in-come above 130 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines is ineli-gible for the program.The Secretary must determine whether a simplified program isincreasing Federal costs above costs incurred in operations for thefiscal year prior to implementation, adjusted for changes in partici-pation, the income of participants not attributable to public assist-ance, and the cost of the thrifty food plan. The determination ismade for each fiscal year, not later than 90 days after the end ofthe year.If the Secretary determines that there has been a cost in-crease, the State must be notified within 30 days. If a State doesnot then submit or carry out a \"corrective action\" plan approved bythe Secretary to prevent increased Federal costs, approval of theState's simplified program is terminated, and the State is ineligiblefor further operation of a simplified program.States opting for a simplified program must include in theirState plans the rules and procedures to be followed, how they willaddress the needs of households with high shelter costs, and a de-scription of the method by which they will carry out their qualitycontrol obligations.

Also provides that (1) the Secretary will determine whethera simplified program is increasing Federal costs, (2) States will notbe required to collect information on households not in the sim- 483plified program in cost increase determinations, and (3) the Sec-retary may approve \"alternative accounting periods\" in making costdeterminations. [Sec. 1160]Conference agreementThe conference agreement adopts the House provision with anamendment providing that: (1) only households in which all mem-bers receive TANF benefits may receive benefits under a simplifiedprogram, (2) the Secretary will determine whether a simplified pro-gram is increasing Federal costs, (3) States will not be required tocollect information on households not in the simplified program incost increase determinations, and (4) the Secretary may approve a!-ternative accounting periods in making cost determinations. In ad-dition, the conference agreement adopts an amendment that pro-vides that a simplified program may include households in which1 or more members are not TANF recipients, if approved by theSecretary. The conferees encourage the Secretary to work withStates to test methods for applying a single set of rules and proce-dures to households in which some, but not all, members receivecash welfare benefits under State rules. [Sec. 854]55. STATE FOOD ASSISTANCE BLOCK GRANTPresent lawNo provision.House billEstablishes an optional food assistance block grant.

States electing a block grant would receivethe greater of: (1) the amount received for benefits in fiscal year1994 (or the 1992\u20141994 average) plus (2) the amount received foradministration in fiscal year 1994 (or the 1992\u20141994 average).States electing a block grant and then terminating their optionmay not again elect a block grant.Block grant funding may only be used for food assistance toneedy persons and administrative costs for providing the assist-ance\u2014so long as not more than 6 percent of total funds expended(other than State funds not otherwise required to be spent) areused for administrative costs and limits on carryover funds are fol-lowed. While States have control over most features of their blockgrant program, certain rules specified in law must be followed: pro-visions for notice and hearing for those aggrieved; bars against re-ceipt of benefits in more than 1 jurisdiction, benefits for fleeing fel-ons, and benefit for aliens otherwise barred under Federal law; pri-vacy and nondiscrimination safeguards; and quality control re-quirements of the Food Stamp Act.

APPROPRIATION BY STATE LEGISLATURESPresent lawAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures,there are six States in which under court rulings of interpretationsof State constitutions, certain Federal funds are controlled by theExecutive branch rather than the State legislature. (An examplewould be action on funds when the legislature is out of session.)These States are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, NewMexico, and Oklahoma.House billThe proposal stipulates that funds from certain Federal blockgrants to the States are to be expended in accordance with the lawsand procedures applicable to the expenditure of the State's own re-sources (i.e.,appropriated through the State legislature in allStates). This provision applies to the following block grants: tem-porary assistance to needy families block grant, the optional Statefood assistance block grant, and the child care block grant. Thus,in the States in which the Governor previously had exclusive con-trol over Federal block grant funds, the State legislatures nowwould share control through the appropriations process. However,States would continue to spend Federal funds in accord with Fed-eral law. 490Senate amendmentIdentical provision.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment.2.

Deny earned income credit to individuals not authorized to beemployed in the United States[NOTE.\u2014For additional discussion of this provision, refer to Title N: Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits for Aliens, above.]Present lawIn general. Certain eligible low-income workers are entitled toclaim a refundable credit on their income tax return. The amountof the credit an eligible individual may claim depends upon wheth-er the individual has one, more than one, or no qualifying childrenand is determined by multiplying the credit rate by the individ-ual's 1earnedincome up to an earned income amount. The maxi-mum amount of the credit is the product of the credit rate and theearned income amount. For individuals with earned income (or ad-justed gross income (AGI), if greater) in excess of the beginning ofthe phaseout range, the maximum credit amount is reduced by thephaseout rate multiplied by the amount of earned income (or AGI,if greater) in excess of the beginning of the phaseout range. For in-dividuals with earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of theend of the phaseout range, no credit is allowed.The parameters for the credit depend upon the number ofqualifying children the individual claims. For 1996, the parametersare given in the following table: TwooroIi-No (percent)Phaseout endsFor years after 1996, the credit rates and the phaseout rateswill be the same as in the preceding table. The earned incomeamount and the beginning of the phaseout range are indexed forinflation; because the end of the phaseout range depends on thoseamounts as well as the phaseout rate and the credit rate, the endof the phaseout range will also increase if there is inflation.In order to claim the credit, an individual must either have aqualifying child or meet other requirements. A qualifying childmust meet a relationship test, an age test, an identification test,and a residence test. In order to claim the credit without a qualifr-ing child, an individual must not be a dependent and must be overage 24 and under age 65.To satisfr the identification test, individuals must include ontheir tax return the name and age of each qualifying child. For re-turns filed with respect to tax year 1996, individuals must provide'In thecase ofa married individual who files a joint return with his or her spouse, the incomefor purposes of these tests is the combined income of the couple. 495a taxpayer identification number (TIN) for all qualifring childrenborn on or before November 30, 1996. For returns filed with respectto tax year 1997 and all subsequent years, individuals must pro-vide TINs for all qualifying children, regardless of their age. An in-dividual's TIN is generally that individual's social security number.An individual with qualifring children may elect to receive aportion of the credit on an advance basis by furnishing an advancepayment certificate to his or her employer. For such an individual,the employer makes an advance payment of the credit at the timewages are paid. The amount of advance payment allowable in ataxable year is limited to 60 percent of the maximum credit avail-able to an individual with one qualifring child.Mathematical or clerical errors. The Internal Revenue Servicemay summarily assess additional tax due as a result of a mathe-matical or clerical error without sending the taxpayer a notice ofdeficiency and giving the taxpayer an opportunity to petition theTax Court. Where the IRS uses the summary assessment procedurefor mathematical or clerical errors, the taxpayer must be given anexplanation of the asserted error and a period of 60 days to requestthat the IRS abate its assessment. The IRS may not proceed to col-lect the amount of the assessment until the taxpayer has agreedto it or has allowed the 60-day period for objecting to expire. If thetaxpayer ifies a request for abatement of the assessment specifiedin the notice, the IRS must abate the assessment. Any reassess-ment of the abated amount is subject to the ordinary deficiencyprocedures. The request for abatement of the assessment is theonly procedure a taxpayer may use prior to paying the assessedamount in order to contest an assessment arising out of a mathe-matical or clerical error. Once the assessment is satisfied, however,the taxpayer may file a claim for refund if he or she believes theassessment was made in error.House billIndividuals are not eligible for the credit if they do not includetheir taxpayeridentification number (and,if married,their spouse's taxpayer identification number) on their tax return. Solelyfor these purposes and for purposes of the present-law identifica-tion test for a qualifring child, a taxpayer identification number isdefined as a social security number issued to an individual by theSocial Security Administration other than a number issued undersection 205(c)(2)(B)(i)(II) (or that portion of sec. 205(c)(2)(B)(i)(III)relating to it) of the Social Security Act (regarding the issuance ofa number to an individual applying for or receiving Federally fund-ed benefits).If an individual fails to provide a correct taxpayer identifica-tion number, such omission will be treated as a mathematical orclerical error. If an individual who claims the credit with respectto net earnings from self-employment fails to pay the properamount of self-employment tax on such net earnings, the failurewill be treated as a mathematical or clerical error for purposes ofthe amount of credit allowed.Effective date. The provision is effective for taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 1995. 496Senate amendmentThe provision in the Senate amendment is identical to that inthe House bill.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill and the Sen-ate amendment with a modification to the effective date. The con-ference agreement is effective with respect to returns the due datefor which (without regard to extensions) is more than 30 days afterthe date of enactment of this Act.B. Change disqualified income test for earned income creditPresent lawFor taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, an mdi-vidual is not eligible for the earned income credit if the aggregateamount of \"disqualified income\" of the taxpayer for the taxableyear exceeds $2,350. This threshold is not indexed. Disqualified in-come is the sum of:(1) interest (taxable and tax-exempt),(2) dividends, and(3) net rent and royalty income (if greater than zero).House billNo provision.Senate amendmentFor purposes of the disqualified income test for the earned in-come credit, the following items are added to the definition of dis-qualified income: capital gain net income and net passive income(if greater than zero) that is not self-employment income.The threshold above which an individual is not eligible for thecredit is reduced from $2,350 to $2,200, and the threshold is in-dexed for inflation after 1996.Effective date. The provision generally is effective for taxableyears beginning after December 31, 1995. For individuals who, asof June 26, 1996, had made an election to receive the current-yearcredit on an advance basis, the provision is effective for taxableyears beginning after December 31, 1996.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.C. Modify definition of adjusted gross income used for phasing outthe earned income creditPresent lawFor taxpayers with earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excessof the beginning of the phaseout range, the maximum earned in-come credit amount is reduced by the phaseout rate multiplied bythe amount of earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of thebeginning of the phaseout range. For taxpayers with earned income(or AGI, if greater) in excess of the end of the phaseout range, nocredit is allowed. 497House billNo provision.Senate amendmentThe provision modifies the definition of AGI used for phasingout the earned income credit by including certain nontaxable in-come and by disregarding certain tax-exempt interest, and(2) nontaxable distributions from pensions, annuities, andindividual retirement arrangements (but only if not rolled overinto similar vehicles during the applicable rollover period).The losses disregarded are:(1) net capital losses (if greater than zero),(2) net losses from trusts and estates,(3) net losses from nonbusiness rents and royalties, and(4) net losses from businesses, computed separately withrespect to sole proprietorships (other than in farming), soleproprietorships in farming, and other businesses.For purposes of item (4), above, amounts attributable to a busi-ness that consists of the performance of services by the taxpayeras an employee are not taken into account.Effective date. The provision generally is effective for taxableyears beginning after December 31, 1995. For individuals who, asof June 26, 1996, had made an election to receive the current-yearcredit on an advance basis, the provision is effective for taxableyears beginning after December 31, 1996.Conference agreementThe conference agreement modifies the definition of AGI usedfor phasing out the earned income credit by disregarding certainlosses. The losses disregarded are:(1) net capital losses (if greater than zero),(2) net losses from trusts and estates,(3) net losses from nonbusiness rents and royalties, and(4) 50 percent of the net losses from businesses, computedseparately with respect to sole proprietorships (other than infarming), sole proprietorships in farming, and other businesses.For purposes of item (4), above, amounts attributable to a busi-ness that consists of the performance of services by the taxpayeras an employee are not taken into account.Effective date. Same as the Senate amendment provision.D. Suspend inflation adjustments for earned income credit forindividuals with no qualifying childrenPresent lawTo claim the earned income credit, an individual must eitherhave a qualifring child or meet other requirements. In order toclaim a credit without a qualifying child, an individual must not bea dependent and must be over age 24 and under age 65.The earned income amount and the beginning of the phaseoutrange are indexed for inflation; because the end of the phaseoutrange depends on these amounts as well as the phaseout rate and 498the credit rate, the end of the phaseout range will also increase ifthere is inflation.House billNo provisionSenate amendmentIn the case of individuals with no qualif'ing children there willbe no adjustment for inflation after 1996 to the earned incomeamount or the beginning of the phaseout range.Effective date. The provision is effective for taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 1996.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill (no provision).11.

This applies to cash in-come from any source, including means-tested benefit programs.However, the housing programs take no account of noncash income.Thus, if food stamp benefits decline, housing benefits are unaf-fected.House billNo provision.Senate amendmentProvides that there be no reduction in public or assisted hous-ing rents in response to a tenant's reduced income resulting fromnon-compliance with welfare or public assistance program require-ments; permits reduction where State or local law limits the periodduring which benefits may be provided.Conference agreementThe conference agreement follows the House bill (no provision).13.

I urge s1pportfor the rule in order that we mightsend this legislation on to the Presi-dent swiftly, since he now has decidedhe is going to sign this vital piece oflegislation.Mr. Speaker, in March 1995. I calledup the rule that provided for consider-ation of the first welfare reform bill.Sixteen months, two bills,and twoPresidential vetoes later we stnd of enacting com-prehensive, compassionate welfare re-form legislation.Throughout the passionate debate onthis subject we have held firm n ourprinciples to enact a reform to tIie Na-tion's welfare system which reuireswork, which imposes time limits onbenefitsforwelfarerecipients.and which allows for innovative State solu-tions to help the underprivileged in ourcommunities. We have not deartedfrom these principles throughotit theconfusing dialog with the Pre$ident.These principles are embodied *n theconference agreement before the $ousetoday.Mr. Speaker, these principles ae notimplemented in a vacuum. Th con-ference package addresses concerns as-sociated with a radical overhaul of theNation's welfare programs.First and foremost, it should b madeperfectly clear that this bill taks careof unfortunate people who are diabled,and able-bodied people are takeii careof as well on a temporary basis, but thekey word is temporary. Alter beingtaken care of on a limited basis, thesepeople are going to have to go to work.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe legislation contains valuable re-forms to the food stamp program. de-signed to curb fraud and abuse and re-quiring work for those food stamps.The agreement authorizes $22 billionin child care funding over the next 6years, which is more than $3 billionover current law.Finally,thelegislationcontains tough measures to crack down on dead-beat dads who abrogate their moral re-sponsibility to their children; and. Mr.Speaker. in contrast to the bold andhonest proposals that Congress has putforward to reform welfare, the Presi-dent has acted with characteristic te-merity.The alleged welfare reform that theClintonadministrationsaysithas achieved is in actuality a fraud. It justis not there, and the savings show it.The President asserts that he hasachieved a degree of welfare reform bygranting waivers from his bureaucratsfor States to experiment in this area.The reality is that we have heard tes-timony on this floor from State afterState that the waiver process is thatthoughtful and experimental governorsmust troop to Washington DC, hat inhand, and request permission to reformlow-income programs at home. Thewaiver request is then subject to end-less debate by bureaucrats and subjectto negotiation and even change by theFederal departments involved.Mr. Speaker, my State of New Yorkhas several waiver requests pending forlow-income programs, and New Yorkcertainly needs flexibility for budg-etarypurposes,and weare, beingstonewalled by this administration be-cause none of those waivers have beengranted in a State that is overburdenedwith welfare problems today. Thank-fully. this Byzantine procedure will berelegated to the dust bin of historyupon enactment of this legislation. Thecitizens of the States, in whom I havethe utmost confidence. will be finallyfree to use local solutions to help low-income familiesintheirneighbor-hoods.Mr. Speaker, I was raised to treat theless fortunate in our society with com-passion. as most Americans are. Theway to effect change for those who suf-fer in poverty is certainly not addi-tional handouts and entrapment in thecurrent cycle of dependency that hasbred second- and third- and now fourth-generation welfare recipients. Rather,we should emphasize welfare as a tem-porary boost from despair to the senseof self-worth inherent in work.Mr. Speaker, that is what we cughtto be doing, that is what we can dohere today. This legislation gives thesingle moms and kids, who are the vastmajority of welfare recipients, an op-portunity to escape a life of relying ongovernment benefits. A vote againstthis package is a vote to deny kids onwelfare hope to escape a life of welfaredependency.Mr. Speaker, this House will todayonce again pass comprehensive welfarereform by a wide bipartisan margin.H9393The Senate is likely to do the same be-fore we recess this Friday. I sincerelyhope the President lives up to his an-nouncement a few minutes ago andagrees with the bipartisan majoritiesin both houses of Congress and over-whelrning publicsentiment and hesigns the legislation into law. If he does, the status quo goes out the win-dow, and finally, we are going to dosomething about thisever.ever-in- creasing welfare load in our country.I strongly urge passage of the bill.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance ofmy time.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield4 minutes to from Wash-ington [Mr. MCDERMOTt').(Mr. McDERMOTT' asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, westarted this Congress with the major-ity indicating that they were going tofollow new procedures, and they madea big show of all the rules changes wewere going to have, but here we areramming through the biggest change ofpolicy toward children in this countrywith a bill that has been in our handsfor a little more than 12 hours.This 1,200- or 1,500-page bill was de-livered to the Members of Congress lastnight at 1 o'clock in the morning. Allthat is being characterized as partisanfighting out here is basically a resist-ance to having something like thisrammed through the Congress with alot of good rhetoric wrapped around it,but the facts belie what is being said.Now. the gentleman from New York[Mr. SOLOMON] has started to debatethe bill and said this is a bill aboutwork, but if my colleagues take thisbill, and they go to page 80 under sec-tion 415, it is the section called waiv-ers, and if my colleagues can wadethrough this language, and I will readit for them:Except as provided in subparagraph (B), ifany waiver granted to a State under section1115 of this Act or otherwise which relates tothe provision of assistance under a Stateplan under this part (as in effect on Septem-ber 30, 1996) is in effect as of the date of theenactment of the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of1996, the amendments made by the PersonalResponsibility and Work Opportunity Rec-onciliation Act of 1996 (other than by section103(c)of the Personal Responsibility andWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of1996) shall not apply with respect to theState before the expiration.Let me tell my colleagues what thatmeans. That means that in 43 Statesthereisno requirement for work.Every bit of work requirement in thisbill is a fraud because with that waiveron page 80, section 415, we allow anyState who has a waiver now in effect,and there are 43 of them in, if they arein effect, they can waive the work re-quirements.0 1400.There are only seven places in theUnited States making up 5 percent ofthe welfare load; that is Alaska, Idaho. H9394Rhode Island, Kansas. Kentucky, NewMexico. and Nevada that do not havewaivers. If we read that section fur-ther, all they have to do is get a waiverfromtheFederal Government andthose seven States can be out. There isno requirement for work in this bill,because they write all the perfect lan-guage, spend50 pages saying work,work, work, and then at the bottom,they give a waiver. If there is a waiver,Mr. Speaker, in their State, their Statedoes not have to provide ajob.Let me tell the Members what it islike in Washington State, because Iknow the situation there. We have100,000 people on public assistance. Wehave125.000people who have beendrawing unemployment benefits. Thatis 225.000 people in the State of Wash-ington who do not have work.If tomorrow, with this bill passed.every one of them showed up and said,\"I want a job.\" the State of Washing..ton could say. \"We do not have any re-sponsibility for you. We have a waiver.The State of Washington has a waiv-er.\" Even if they were going to be re-sponsible. even if the State of Washing-ton said, \"We really care about these225,000 people and their families.\" lastyear, and the State of Washington,Members have to remember, is the fifthmost rapidly growing State economi-cally. We are at the top in this coun-try. In our State last year we provided44,000 new jobs.Mr. Speaker I urge people to voteagainst this bill. It is bad. It is a fraud.Mr. SOLOMON. I yield myself suchtime as I may consume.I am a little concerned, Mr. Speaker.I want to take just a minute to tell thegentleman, I think he is on the Com-mittee on Ways and Means. As a mat-ter of fact, at 12 o'clock last night thisreport was filed. There were those of uswho were here and saw to it that thereport was delivered to the minority atthat hour. However, earlier in the day,in the morning yesterday, this reportwas complete and given to the minor-ity. I do not know why the gentlemanfrom Washington did not see it. Hisown staff on the Committee on Waysand Means had possession of this re-port, so the gentleman should havedone his due diligence and he wouldhave had that information.Mr. Speaker, let me just say onething about the work requirements. Iam a little concerned with the bill, be-cause it has been watered down somuch. As a matter of fact, when thebill left this House we had a familycap, which meant young girls that con-tinue to have baby after baby afterbaby could not just continue to havemore and more and more welfare bene-fits given to them. Unfortunately, thatwas dropped. A phrase was put in thatwould allow States to opt in, or rather,would allow States to opt out, as op-posed to opting in.Let. me tell the Members what hap-pens in a State like New York State.where we have had for years now theCadillac of welfare programs and theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSECadillac of Medicaid programs, where-by New York State has exercised theiroption to opt in for all of these variousprograms above and beyond the basecoverages for welfare and Medicaid.In our State. we do not stand anychance of being able to change thatlaw, so if we had arranged to havethem be able to opt in. as opposed toopt out, then we could have expectedsome real change. So I am concernedabout that, but we will live to fightthat battle another day.Mr.Speaker,asthegentleman'sPresident is saying. this is a work-for-welfare program.I am surprised tohear the gentleman from Washingtontry to refute that.Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to the gen-tleman from Michigan.Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank thechairman of the committee for yieldingto me.Mr. Speaker, I know there has beensome issue raised regarding the waiversfor the work requirement. The waiversare all drawn more strictly than cur-rent law. I think that is an importantpoint to make. The waivers that havebeen given by the administration aremore strict than current law. The cur-rent waivers do not apply to the per-centage work requirement in the legis-lation. I think that is another impor-tant point to make. I thank the gen-tleman for yielding to me.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas[Mr. COLEMAN).(Mr. COLEMAN asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman from Massachusetts foryielding me this time.Mr. Speaker. I think it is importantto point out, regardless of the politicsof welfare reform, the issue ought to bewhat does the bill do. Regardless ofwhether or not a past President or asitting President would sign or veto abill, it should have nothing to do withthe legislative branch priority and pre-rogative to pass good legislation.Mr. Speaker,Iknow many haveworked long and hard on this bill andothers like it over the past year and ahalf and longer. In fact, the discussionof welfare reform has been debatedsince I came here 14 years ago. I needto say, however, to my colleagues thatit is not enough to play the politicswith welfare reform that we are at-tempting to do today.I certainly do not intend to supportwelfare reform and then go home andapplaud myself and tell people, are younot proud we have welfare reform? Wehave to look at what we are doing tochildren. More than I million childrenwill be thrown off the welfare rolls.What kind of Nation is it that says.We care about what is in front of yourname:Documentedchild.undocu-July 31, 1996mented child, poor child, rich child\"?What difference does that make to agreat Nation? I submit to the Members,it should make none. All of us here inthis country understand that we oughtto care for children regardless of theirstation in life, regardless of the coun-try from which they came. To suggestthat we should do this in this legisla-tion is plain wrong.I know all of the 50 States are great-ly benevolent. By the way, that re-minds me, why did we take over thisprogram in the 1960's in the first placeup here at the Federal level? As I re-call. we had a patchwork, quiltwork of50 different programs, some good to thepoor, some bad to thepoor, someharsh, causing people, of course, to mi-grate from State to State. based uponthe benefits that they or their childrencould receive during tough economictimes.This legislation also does not dealwith tough economic issues the way itshould.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, it givesme great pleasure to yield 5 minutes tothe distinguished gentleman from NewYork [Mr. RANGEL).(Mr. RANGEL asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, let methank the gentleman from Massachu-setts IMr. MOAKLEY] for giving me anopportunity to speak out on this. I amgoing to say what is on everybody'smind. It isjust so close to the election,I suppose. on both sides of the aisle weget blinded about substance in our con-cern as to what is it that the pollstersreally want.A lot of concern has been in theWhite House and on the Hill as towhether or not the President wouldbreach his promise to change welfareas we know it. I would think that thechairman of the Committee on Rules,notwithstanding how diligently the Committee on Rules has worked onthis legislation, would have to agreethat there is no urgency in terms ofMembers understanding the work thatwas done in conference. This is not anunusual thing, unless it has somethingto do with the fact that we are goinginto recess, and that this will be a po-litical issue back home.Other than that, it seems to me if weare talking about millions of children,children who would be Democrat, Re-publican,Christians,Jews,black, white, Americans, and certainly thelesser among us. that all of us wouldwant to make certain that we aredoing the right thing: and really, noteven push the President into making ahasty decision, when at least the lastposition he took was that he appre-ciated the direction in which the legis-lation was going and he saw some im-perfections which could be worked out.But it was he who said that he want-ed to change welfare as we know it.What is welfare? What is this obsessionabout putting people to work? Every..one agrees if you are able to work, you July 31, 1996shouldbeworking. Every taxpayershould be angry and annoyeI to findpeople slipping back on theij respon-sibilities and not working.Are we talking about just women, orare we talking about women \u00b6hat havechildren? I pause, because it is not arhetorical question. The bills that Iknow of say aid for dependent children.I think what we are saying. I 'ould sayto the gentleman from New York [Mr.SOLOMONI, is that that child will beheld responsible for any concuct thatwe politically do not like aout themother.We are going even further, rot as faras the gentleman would like, but Ithink even the President agrees withthe gentleman's posture, that f after 5years or 4 or 3 or 2 or whatever theGovernors decide. I think the minimumis 2 years, that if for any reascn at all.there are no jobs available, aid if themother played by the rules, signed up,went into training, did all of the Amer-ican things in order to show that shewanted to maintain her digrity, shewanted her family not to stay on wel-fare, she wanted to go into the privatesector and contribute, if all :of thosethings are established, it is mp under-standing it really does not nake anydifference. Playing by the rules doesnot make adifference,inelection years, because we said it does 9ot makeany difference what the heck you havetried to do; the question is. are youworking.Quite frankly,Ibelieve that themother could vote with her fet if shedoes not like the situation employ-ment-wise.I am mean enough to bewith you. I am a politician. too. Myproblem is the child. What did 1he childhave to do with the fact that the moth-er wanted to work, did not want towork, jobs were there, jobs v'ere notthere? Do Members know whal the po-litical question is? The Reptiblicanswill throw 2 million people, children,into poverty, and my Presidnt willonly throw 1 million into poverty.Mr. Speaker, I do not want tQ get in-volved in religion around here, butthere is not a denomination of peoplethat do not believe that the hejpless ofthis country\u2014just being an Anericanmeans you are supposed to help them.You do not send a 2-year-old cFild or a2-month-old child out to get a job.Someone has to be responsible Some-one has to be responsible for th*t child.Do not ask the child for its identifica-tion, and ask whether or not it s a cit-izen. Do not ask the child whether, bychoice, the mother is a bum. Do notask the child what the unemploymentstatistics are. As Americans we believein taking care of our children.This is a political bill. It should notbe passed into law. It should not bepassed here. The President should notsign itif you do shove it dc4wn histhroat.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, ryield2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from Jacksonville,FI.. Mrs. TILLIE FOWLER, who has been a realleader in this effort.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE(Mrs. FOWLER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend her re-marks.)Mrs. FOWLER. Mr.Speaker,the American welfare system was intendedto be a safety net for those who fall onhard times. Unfortunately, it has be-come an overgrown bureaucracy whichperpetuatesdependencyanddenies people the chance to live the Americandream.I am pleased the President has justannounced that he would sign the Re-publican welfare bill. We knew when itgot this close to the election thisPr\u00e9sident would choose the path of po-litical expediency, as he always does.But this legislation is not about savingmoney, it is about saving hope and sav-ing lives while reforming a broken sys-tem and while preserving the safetynet.This bill encourages work and inde-pendence and discourages illegitimacy.I urge my colleagues to vote for fair-ness, compassion, and responsibility.and pass a conference agreement onH.R. 3437.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia, the Honorable GEORGE MILLER,the ranking member on the Committeeon Resources.(Mr. MILLER of California asked andwas given permission to revise and ex-tend his remarks.)Mr.MILLERofCalifornia.Mr. Speaker, today is a serious and sadday. Not only are we presented with awelfare bill by the Republicans that forthe first time in history does a greatdeal of harm to children in this coun-try, but we have learned in the last fewminutes that the President of the Unit-ed States. Mr. Clinton, now says thathe will sign that bill.This is a President who, along withthe First Lady, have spent much oftheir public life trying to help chil-dren. Now he says he will sign a billthat, for the first time, knowingly, heknowingly, he has been presented theevidence by his own Cabinet, he hasbeen presented the evidence by theUrban Institute and others, that willknowingly put somewhere around 1 million children who are currently notinto poverty. into poverty.Almost half of those children are infamilies that are working. where peo-ple get up and they go to work everyday. But at the end of the year, theyare poor. This bill puts, those childreninto poverty. That cannot be a properpurpose of the U.S. Congress, and thatcannot be a proper endorsement for thePresident of the United States.0 1415It is against the interest of our chil-dren. 'Yes, this program was startedmany years ago to try and save thechildren. For many. many years wehave lifted those children out of pov-erty, not as well as we have done forthe seniors, but it was a national goal.This bill now for the first time, againknowingly. the evidence is in front ofH9395us, and yet we are being asked to makea decision to reverse that trend and toonce again put children into poverty.They can lose their benefits under thiswith nobody having offered their par-ents a chance to work or requiringthem to do so, because in the 11th hourthose same Governors who boastedabout their desire to put people towork came in and got loopholes putinto this bill so they do not have tomeet the very standards that they saidthey were prepared to change this pro-gram from welfare to work.So how did they achieve the budgetsavings, then? They achieved the budg-et savings by going after children. bygoing after women. I grew up, and Ithink most people in this country be-lieve that when you said women andchildren first, what you were saying isyou wanted to care for those individ-uals.This legislation suggests thatthey will be the first to be harmed andthat is what this legislation allows.I appreciate all of the theory in thelegislation, but the fact of the matteris every time that the pedal meets theroad here, what we see is that in factthey are sacrificed. These children nowpay to provide the $60 billion in savingsthat the majority says that they want.We cannot allow that to happen. thisPresident should be demanding thatthis bill simply do no harm to thosechildren. You can get all of the welfarereform you want and still do no harmto the children. But unfortunately thisPresident has joined the Republicansnow in making the children the veryvictims of the system he said he want-ed to reform.ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPOREThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HEFLEY). The Chair will make a briefstatement in clarification of his re-sponse to the parliamentary inquirypropounded by the gentleman fromPennsylvania [Mr. WELDONI during theconsideration of House Resolution 492.In that response, the Chair merelyintended to indicate that, in the discre-tion of the Chair, the objection by thegentlewoman from Connecticut underrule XXX was not then a dilatory mo-tion.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker. in response to the pre-vious speaker for whom I have a greatdeal of respect, he came to this bodyabout 20 years ago and I do not knowwhat experience he had in previousgovernment, but when he is critical ofthe Governors of these States, I look atmy own Governor. Gov. George Pataki.He is probably one of the most knowl-edgeablepeopleinAmericatoday about what it means about jammingthings down the throats that we dohere in Washington, sending it back tothe States and local government.George Pataki was a town mayor be-fore he became a State assemblyman inthe lower house and then before he be-came a State senator and now Governor. Believe me, he knows what un-funded mandates mean to a State like H9396ours where we have seen job after jobafter job chased out of our State be-cause wejust could not afford to do thethings for busmess and industry thatwere necessary because of the terriblewelfare burden. That is all changingnow and it will change with the adop-tion of this legislation. We are onceand for all going to be able to let thosepeople who have the experience, thosepeople down at the local levels of gov-ernment who have to deal with the wel-fare recipients day in and day out, letthem come up with the solutions. Thatis what this debate is all about.Mr. Speaker. I yield 2 minutes to thegentlewoman from Columbus. OH Elvis.PRYCE], a member of the Committee onRules.Ms. PRYCE. Mr. Speaker. I thank thedistinguished chairman of the RulesCommittee for yielding me this time. Irise in strong support of this fair ruleto bring about real welfare reform.Mr. Speaker, a generation ago, Amer-icans began a much-celebrated war onpoverty in the hope of creating a GreatSociety. But nearly 30 years and morethan $5 trillion later, what we are leftwith is a failed welfare system that hasdeprived hope, diminished opportunity,and literally destroyed precious lives.Our country, and the future genera-tions of Americans who will lead her,deserve a better system.Today we will consider a conferencereport that replaces a welfare systemdebilitated by strict Federal controlwith a system based on innovation andflexibility at the State and local level.Instead of promoting dependency andillegitimacy,thisconferenceagree- ment is built on the dignity of workand the enduring strength of families.By taking the Federal bureaucracy outof welfare, this legislation promotescreative solutions closer to home andoffers a real sense of hope to the trulyneedy and the less fortunate.Mr. Speaker, despite the commentswe will hear today, this is a compas-sionate bill. Helping those who by nofault of their own have fallen on hardtimes is the right thing to do. This billresponds to that in the finest Americantradition. But when we help peoplethat are able-bodied, when we justhand them a check. those people whomake little or no effort to help them-selves, we risk destroying the Amer-ican spirit and undermining our soci-ety at large.Thisconferenceagreementrep- resents a true bipartisan attempt tochange welfare as we know it. I hope the President will not shy away againfromthishistoricopportunityfor change.In closing. Mr. Speaker, I urge mycolleagues to have the courage to setaside the status quo, to think of thechildren and families of this Nationand to embrace real reform. I urge a'yes\" vote on both sides of the aisle forthis rule and the conference report.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker. I yield2\u00bd minutes to the gentlewoman fromFlorida [Mrs. MEEK].CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE(Mrs. MEEK of Florida asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendher remarks.)Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker.both times I have risen, I have risen instrong opposition to the rule and I willbe doing so, I feel. to the conference re-port.Mr. Speaker, I do not think manypeople in this Congress really under-stand the effects of welfare.I think that the system should be reformed. Iam sure that there are many peoplewho still abuse this system. We havenot yet changed to any great extentthe enforcement, to be sure. that peo-ple who do not deserve welfare are on itand those who are abusing it get pun-ished for being so.Mr. Speaker. I contend that this con-ference report does not meet the needsof the people they are hoping that itwill meet. We are still going to havehungry children. children who are nottaken care of by their States. I servedas a State legislator. We still did notgive matching funds for the funds thatthe Federal Government gave us. Nowthat we are cutting the funds, are theygoing to do any better? My answer isno.The real world will teach everyone inthis. Congress that you are hurtingchildren. It seems to me that you aredoing it deliberately because many ofus have said to you and shown you evi-dence that it is going to do it. 0MB hasdone it. Several agencies with whomyou have great credibility have shownthe same. It permits the States to ex-periment with our children in order tosave $40 to $60 billion in Federal funds.Why save it when you are losing yourmain human resources. your children?Almost one-third of these cuts comefrom mistreating the children of immi-grants. Do you feel that the legal im-migrantchildreninthiscountry should be treated any less? Would youwant your children to be treated anyless than when they go down to gethealth care and they tell them theycannot be treated because their parentshave been here 16 years or more payingtaxes into the American Government,their sons and daughters have gone towar for this country? Are you going tosay to those children, No, you can't getany more treatment. Go to the State.Go to the county. When they get to thecounties and they get to the States,there is no money. I have been thereand I know there is none.The Republican majority Is going toban food stamps and SSI for some chil-dren, particularly those that are dis-abled and those that are poor. It barsMedicaid for legal immigrants. Is thatgoing to make them any less ill be-cause we are barring it in this billwhich we are using here in a vacuum?We have done perhaps no impactstudy. We do not know how this isgoing to impact on States like Floridaand California. I say, Mr. Speaker, thatthis is wrong and that the Republicanmajority should realize what they aredoing. Otherwise in the end the peoplewill speak. and I hope they do.July 31, 1996Mr. Speaker, I nse in strong billion\u2014come treating the chil-dren of immigrant more harshly than otherchildren.The Republican majority bans food starnpsandsupplernentalsecuntyincome paymentsfor virtuallyafllegal immigrants. The bill barsMedicaidfor legal elderlyor disabled.Theseimmigrants the Republican majoritywants topenalize arelegallyhere. They played by the rules. They meet every require-ment of the law. They live and work hard; theypay taxes; they serve in the military. They willnot vanish simply because the majority passesthis bill.What will happen is that these costs nowpaid by the Federal Governrnent will be un-fairly shifted to States like Florida, and coun-ties like Dade, that have a high number oflegal imrnigrants.Let me give the House a concrete idea ofhow unfair this bill really is. My own State ofFlorida estimates that it will lose more than$300 million a year in Federal funds becauseof this bill.Who ends up paying? My constituents inDade County and the State of Florida.Thebillinstructs States to deny schoollunchesto undocumented immigrants. Thechairman of the Dade County School Boardsays that one-quarter of the children in theDade schools were born in a foreign country.The Dade County schools would have to coi-led information from every single childin order to determine which ones can get sub-sidized lunches. The Republican majority istrying to balance the budget and cut taxes forthe wealthy by creating local paperwork andhigher local taxes.It is wrong and it is unfair for the RepublicanmajoritytoforceState andlocalgovern- ments\u2014meaning our taxpayers back home\u2014to pay for legal irnmigrant residents who are inthis country because they complied with theirnmigration laws thatprevious Congresseshave enacted. Iurge rny cofleagues to vote against thisrule and against the conference report.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker. I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker. one of my colleaguesjust approached me, and they said theyhope the American people that mightbe watching on C-SPAN would ask thequestion of all of us: Are you satisfiedwith the status quo?That seems to be what I hear fromthe other side of the aisle. even thoughthe President is going to sign this bill,that they are satisfied with the statusquo. The people I represent are not sat-isfied with that status quo.Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to thegentleman from Erie, PA [Mr. ENG-LISI-I], one of the outstanding freshmanMembers of this body.Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr.Speaker. I rise in strong support of thisrule and in strong support of this con-ference report. the most sweeping wel-fare reform legislation this country hasseen since the Great Society. July31, 1996AsFranklinDelanoRoosevelt warned in the late 1930's, giving perma-nent aid to anyone destroys them. Bycreating an underclass culture of pov-erty.dependency,and violence, wehave been destroying the very peoplewe have been claiming to help. Howmany more families will be trapped inthe current welfare system while wewaste time in Washington?I am delighted to see that th Presi-dent has indicated he may support thisconference report, which will -equirefor the first time ever able-bodid we!-fare recipients to work for thei bene-fits.Every family receiving welfaremust work within 2 years or lose bene-fits, and lifetime benefits are imitedto 5 years.This is a balanced, mainstream ap-proach that links welfare rights to per-sonal responsible behavior. I urge theHouse to adopt this rule and ay thegroundwork for passage of this con-ference report.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to thegentlemanfromSanibel,FL[Mr.GOSSI.(Mr. GOSS asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend is re-marks.)Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker, Irise in strong support of this rule and this billbecause we all know that the er of biggovernment is indeed over.Mr.Speaker,Ithank my friend, the distin-guished chairman of the Rules Committee, foryielding me this time. The wisdom of SOLOMONhas been ingreat demand these 'ast fewdays, and once again he has deliverd a fairand workab'e rule to this body. Our RulesCommitteelaboreddiligentlyyesterdayevening and this morning to acconmodateboth the strong desire of the majority Qf Amen-cans thatwe end welfare as we know it\u2014andthe legitimate effortsthathave been underwayamong Members of Congress and the admin-istration to negotiate a llnal product. or thatreason, we brought tworules,in ordet to givethe conferees as much time as possible tocomplete their work while getting welfare re-form to the President this week. This rule a-lows the House to consider a milestoie bill\u2014one that lays to rest 30 years of big.govem-ment policies that have cost $5.5 trillion butfailed to win the war on poverty. I mist say Iam disturbed by the hand-wringing ani dema-goguery that is emanating from some mem-bers of the minority. Their assurances thatthey do want to reform welfare, but qieyjustdon't want to do it in this way, nng qJite hol-low. Remember that they had the opportunitywhen they controlled both Housesof Con-gress andtheWhite House for 2 years\u2014anopportunity they refused to capitaIize on.

If those in the minoritysucceedin their carefully orchestrated attemptto delay enactment of this bill.I suspct theyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEwillhave to answer to their constituents for de-nying poor Americansafighting chance tobreak out of poverty and become productivemembers of this society. Mr.Speaker, this leg-islation unleashes the creativity of our Statestosolveproblems orpovertyathome.ttunshacklesthem from the burdens of costlyand micromanaging Federal regulation\u2014whileproviding significant resources for children andjobprograms. It allows those precious Federaldollars that are so desperately needed by ourNation's poor to bypassthegrossly inefficientFederal bureaucracy. And it emphasizes workfor those who can,alongwith compassion forthose whocan't.This is abalancedbill\u2014andit's time for the defenders of the status quo toget with the program and heed the words ofthe President. Support this rule and the bill.Mr.MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker. the chairman of theRules Committee just said if people areopposed to this rule and this bill thatthey are for status quo. That is abso-lutely incorrect.The people who are opposed to thisbill are opposed to it because it putsanother I million children into povertyand does not go far enough.Mr. Speaker. I yield 3 minutes to thegentleman from Indiana [Mr. ROEMER].(Mr. ROEMER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. ROEMER. Mr. Speaker, this bill,this conference report that we willsoon vote on, represents the biggestchange to our social policy in the last60 years. We have moved from the NewDeal to the New Frontier to the GreatSociety, and now hopefully to the fairdeal.Where have we gone in this debateover the last year? We started withH.R. 4, a bill that I think was terriblefor this Nation and for our children.that was mean to our children, thatwas unfair to the people that we want-ed to give skills to go to work, thatwas not fair to our parents who hadchildren home from child care. Thatbill has been vastly changed. Just re-cently we voted for a bill to come outof the House, and 30 of us Democratsvoted to move the process along andimprove the billin the Senate andHouse conference, where it has beenimproved, and I will vote to supportthis conference.President Clinton deserves credit forhis willingness to sign this bill, and hedeserves praise for his determinationto change previous billsthat weremean to children and that did not givethe resources to our workers to stay offwelfare.Let us move forward in a bipartisanway to continue to modify what can bea better and better bill, through Execu-tive order, through legislative change,and through bipartisan work. Let usmarch forward together. Democratsand Republicans, to change the statusquo and move to the fair deal for ourtaxpayers. and for those recipients ofwelfare and those children that arebeing raised from generation to genera-tion in welfare. We can work together.H9397We can and must work together for therecipients of welfare and for the tax-payers of this country.Again. President Clinton will signthis bill, according to all the reports,and he has indicated a willingness towork in a bipartisan way. I am gladthat the President changed the firstbill, H.R. 4. I am glad that the Presi-dent vetoed those initialbills thatwere mean to children and were notfair to get people permanently off wel-fare.I hope to continue to work acrossthis middle aisle, Democrats and Re-publicans, reaching out to join handsand to claim back a system for the tax-payer and the American people and ourchildren, so that we do have the big-gest change in social policy in the last60 years, moving from the New Deal tothe fair deal for our taxpayers.0 1430Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume tosay that my good friend from Boston,MA, Mr. MOAKLEY, made the statementthat he is not for the status quo but heis opposed to this bill. We hear that somany times, but, but, but, but, but. No-body is ever ready to put themselves onthe line for welfare reform. Today wehave it.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to thegentleman from Claremont. CA, Mr.DAVIDDREIER, mygood friend andmember of the Committee on Rules.(Mr. DREIER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise instrong support of this rule and the con-ference report. The gentleman fromNew York [Mr. SOLOMON] isabsolutelyright when he says that it is very easyto find things in this measure which wedo not all support.I admit I have some concerns aboutsome provisions as they impact myState of California. But the fact of thematter is. ending welfare as we know itis what the President said that hewanted to do when he was a candidateback in 1992. My friend, the gentlemanfrom Illinois [Mr. MANzULLOJ, just re-minded me that it has gotten to thepoint where a Republican Congress hasbeen able to do what a DemocraticCongress did not do in the first 2 yearsof the Presidents term, and that is endwelfare as we know it.So we have finally gotten to thepoint where we are looking at the factthat over the last 3 decades we have ex-pended $5.3trillion on welfare pay-ments of all kinds and we have seen thepoverty rate move from 14.7 percent to15.1 percent. So everyone. Democratsand Republicans alike,as the gen-tleman from New York fMr. SOLOMON]justsaid, and the gentleman from Mas-sachusetts (Mr. MOAKLEY], our friendfrom south Boston, acknowledges hedoes not want to support the statusquo and we must change the welfaresystem.Now, earlier today. when the chair-man of the Subcommittee on Human H9398Resources, the gentleman from Florida[Mr. SHAW), was before the Committeeon Rules, he talked about the fact thatwe will most likely, in the 105th Con-gress. need to make some sort of modi-fication to this measure, but if we de-feat this conference report there willbe no welfare reform.We have gotten a measure, and thePresident has finally gotten to thepoint where he has agreed to sign it.That is why, as my friend, the gen-tleman from Indiana[Mr. ROEMER].said, we need to move ahead with bi-partisan support so we can try ourdarnedest to address a system which isbroke.There are many more things thatneed to be done. Entitlement reform issomething that is important, so thatwe are not simply, as many are label-ing this thing, attacking those who areless fortunate. We need to realize thatthis measure is designed not just tohelp those taxpayers who are shoulder-ing the responsibility but also to do ev-erything we can to help people get outof that generational cycle of depend-ence.Support the rule and support the con-ference report.Mr. MOAKLEY, Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.It has been referred to some peopleon my side as being for the status quo.Two weeks ago we voted for the Tan-ner-Castle bill, which was a reform bill.It had much more reform than this. Soit is not that we are for the status quo.We want a real reform bill. This is notit.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to thegentlewomanfromNorthCarolina[Mrs. CLAYTON].Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Speaker, I thinkthat the conference report will passand. therefore, there will be reform be-cause the majority of our Memberstruly think they are reforming the wel-fare system. But reforming the welfaresystem means that we would have pro-visions in there that would ensure wewere decreasing dependency. we wouldencourage work and we would be sup-portive to families.Those kind ofstructures are not present.I know everyone has good intentions,and certainly reform is because we aretrying to reduce a big deficit. becausewe know already the amount of moneywe spend on welfare is really insignifi-cant to the total amount that wespend. If we wanted to reduce the budg-et, we would be reforming other things.Like the gentleman has just said, enti-tlements would be that issue.Hopefully, we can understand thatthose of us who will vote against thisare really making a statement. We careabout children too much to rob Paul topay Peter. We are not willing to robchildren of their opportunity and theirfuture in order to provide other peoplean opportunity to live.Also we say we are about teenagepregnancy prevention, and yet thisHouse last month had the opportunityjust to appropriate $30 million to pre-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEvent teenage pregnancy. We know overa half million young people becomepregnant every year. We spend annu-ally $6.5 billion, yet we will not put asmall amount of money to encourageyoung people to do the positive behav-ior activity so they will not lead a lifeof dependency.We say we want to decrease depend-ency. We want to give kids steppingstones. but we put these stumblingblocks in their way. Mr. Speaker, thisis not supportive of children, and I giveno bad intents to anyone. but this con-ference bill. and I hope I am wrong, Ihope I am wrong. I hope, indeed, mil-lions of children do not suffer. but Icould not vote in good conscience for abill that I am not assured of that.Reform means encouraging youngpeople for support, decreasing depend-ency and making provisions for work.Vote against this conference bill.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1minute to the gentleman from Egan,IL, Mr. DON MANZULLO, an outstandingMember.(Mr. MANZULLO asked and was given permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, in thelast 31 years this country has spentover $5.4 trillion on the welfare system,and what do we have to show for it? Wehavegenerationaftergenerationlocked in a seemingly endless cycle ofdestitution and poverty. They are thelost forgotten statistics, dependent ontheFederalentitlementtrapthat strips them of their dignity, destroysfamilies, damages our work ethic, anddestroystheself-esteemofthose trapped in the system.Cruelty is allowing this destructivesystem to continue. By passing thiswelfare reform bill we will restore hopeand opportunity by making work, andnot welfare, a way of life.Our current welfare system has notonly failed those in the system, but ithas also failed those who have beensupporting it. the hard working tax-payer. It has failed the forgotten Amer-ican, the one who gets up in the morn-ing, packs a lunch, sends the kids off toschool. That person is working harderthan ever to make ends meet, and thetypical American family is paying over$3,400 a year in taxes for welfare pay-ments to perpetuate a failed system.Mr. Speaker. we should pass this billand pass it swiftly.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield2\u00bd minutes to the gentlewoman fromKansas [Mrs. MEYERS), one of the trulyoutstanding Members of this body, whois retiring at the end of this year. Shehas been such a great Member, and weare going to miss her.(Mrs. MEYERS of Kansas asked andwas given permission to revise and ex-tend her remarks.)Mrs. MEYERS of Kansas. Mr. Speak-er,I thank the gentleman for thosecomments.Mr. Speaker. I support this rule andurge my colleagues to support it. ThePersonal Responsibility Act is a goodJuly 31, 1996start toward reforming our welfare sys-tem. Because of the block grant. theentitlement nature of the program isended.We ask able-bodied people between 18and 50 who receive food stamps to dosome work for their benefits. We re-form the SSI program to help stopmonthly checks from going to pris-oners and checks that were going tohealthy children. And we finally tellrecent immigrants that the promise ofAmerica does not automatically in-clude a welfare check.But many issues remain unaddressed,and I believe the most serious is theever-increasing illegitimacy rate.In 1994. one-third of our children wereborn into homes where no father everlived. And by the year 2000. 80 percentof minority children and 40 percent ofall children in this country will be bornout of wedlock.Unfortunately. the conference reportdoes nothing to require that fathers beidentified.States who currently donothing to identify fathers can con-tinue to do nothing. and those Stateswho continue to reward teenage preg-nancy can continue to do so.Finally, there is no effort to enforcea family cap, even though we knowthat the family cap has reduced a dropin additional children in New Jersey,where it is now statewide policy.To repeat, this bill is a good start.but I believe we cannot reform our wel-faresystemuntilweaddressthe growth in illegitimacy. The link be-tween our ever-increasing illegitimacyrates and the growth in AFDC rolls arenot casual. They are cause and effect.Why is it too much to ask that chil-dren have two responsible adults asparents? Sadly. we continue to encour-age the opposite.A previous speaker said that the costof welfare was very modest in thiscountry. The cost of AFDC alone, I amnot talking about SSI or illegal aliensor legal aliens or anything else, just.AFDC, is $70 billion a year because it is$16 billion a year AFDC. it is one- fourth of Medicaid, half of food stamps,about a third of housing plus all of thetraining and day care programs. It isbetween $70 and $80 billion a year.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, minute to the gentleman from Penn-sylvania [Mr. FATrAH).Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Speaker, I rise inopposition to the rule. This rule andthis bill, this conference committee, isbuilt on the biggest lie that has everbeen told to the American people, andthat is that we are spending too muchas a country to help poor people.There is no calculation that any le-gitimate analysis of a Federal budgetwould tell us that we spent $5 trillionon the war on poverty. It is all made upout of whole cloth. It includes itemslike the Pell grants and all kinds ofother programs, and education. TheAFDC payments are about a little more than one penny out of every dol-lar that this Government spends tohelp poor children. July3l. 1996We havegotteneverybody convincedthatweare spending just on poor people, and now wehaveconvinced them thatSpeaker GINGRICH and the Republican majorityare corning to help these poor children,that this isjust a major effort to reallyhelp poor children, and cutting $60 bil-lion is just the best way to help themfind their way to the American dream.This rule, this conference committee,the Washington Post in itseditorial today said it was a bad idea. They saidit was a defining moment of where thiscountry was headed. And there will beMembers who will come to 1he floortoday. because they want tO be re-elected and will vote for it, but outinto the future there will be ays thatthey will truly regret that the did riothave the courage to stand up and op-pose this hideous proposal.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield Iminute to the former governor: of Dela-ware. MIKECASTLE,one of the peoplethat probably knows best aLout thereal problems or how this ouht to bedealt with, and who knows that one ofthe reasons the welfare system in thiscountry has failed miserably i becausewe inside the beltway have trid to dic-tate back to the States and local gov-ernments.Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, 1 thankthe gentleman for yielding ne thistime.Mr. Speaker, I support the -ule aridthe bill. We stand today at a historicdivide, a defining moment that sepa-rates the past from the future, onewhichpitspersonalresporsibility.work, and State flexibility aginst thelargely failed welfare policies and prac-tices of the past. Today marks a turn-ing pqint for all of us, the Congress,our constituents, and perhaps riost im-portantly, those welfare recipients.I am pleased that the bipartian Cas-tle-Tanner reform proposal Fas pro-vided some very positive charges andprovisions that will help shame welfarereform for the better. Perhaps he mostimportant provision we helpeI retainwas current law on guaranteeiig Med-icaid eligibility to all welfare recipi-ents and those who may be e1gible inthe future. Also, the food stmp op-tional block grants and the child wel-fare block grants were dropped, thusretaining minimum Federal standardsand preserving these nationaj safetynets.On balance, we have achieved whatwe can all support. With this legisla-tion we have finally begun the processby which America's underclass problemcan be solved, and break a generationalcycle and culture of dependercy andpoverty.Congress is now the shepherd of wel-fare reform, not the President, nd it isup to us to review and impro'4'e uponthis proposal.I,for one, stand readyand committed to revisit it, if need be,to make sure welfare reform is doing towork.Mr.Speaker, we stand today at a historic di-vide, a defining moment that separates theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSEpastfrom the future; one which pits personalresponsibibty,work,andStateflexibilityagainstthe largelyfailed welfarepolicies andpracticesof the past. Today marks a tumingpoint for all of us\u2014the Congress, our constitu-ents, and perhaps most importantly, thosewelfare recipients.Just as our Nation was formed, we standready to forward a bold experiment in reform-ing our Nation's welfare system. But like mostexperiments, we will most certainly have to re-visit our decisions. Though we have tried,there may not be enough resources for dill-dren's care, or to adequately fund the workprogram that is the centerpiece of this legisla-tionThere mostlikelywiUbe economicdowntums that force Govemors and the Con-gress to reevaluate. States may require moreflexibility in meeting the stringent work require-ments. There are innumerab'e potential pit-falls.As a coauthor of the bipartisan Castle-Tan-ner welfare reform proposal, JolN TANNERandhave helped forward some very positivechanges and provisions that will help shapereform welfare for the better.Perhaps themost importantprovisionIhelped retain was current law on guaranteeingMedicaid eligibilitytoallwelfare recipients,and those who may be eligible in the future.The food stamp optional block grant and thechild welfare block grant were dropped, thusretaining minimum Federal standards and pre-serving these national safety nets.Protecting children in families that lose cashassistance is a high priority. Although I wouldhave preferred mandatory in-kind assistanceafter a 5-year time limit on cash assistance, Iam mostly satisfied that a provision could beadded that would ensure that States can uti-lizeFederal funds from the social servicesblock grant for the care of the child. Further-more, we were successful in ensuring that ahigher State maintenance of effort on Statespending could be included in the conferencereport. We also were successful in includinglanguage that would require that Congress re-view in 3 years the work program to ensure itssuccess. Last, Castle-Tanner has had a mod-eratng impact on the burdens that the nonciti-zen provisions will put on our Nation's futurecitizens,primarilyinthe health care area.While Castle-Tanner included stronger protec-tions for children and families under the cashblock grant, increased funding for the weffare-to-work programs, significantly smaller foodstamp cuts, and tesssevereimmigrant cuts,its fingerprints can be readily identifiable onthis conference report.Nevertheless,onbalance,wehaveachieved what we all can support: with thislegislation, we have finally begun the processby which America's underclass problem canbe solved, and break a generational cycle andculture of dependency and poverty.This is not a perfect experiment, but thenexperiments usuafly aren't. Congress is nowthe shepard of welfare reform\u2014not the Presi-dent\u2014and it is up to us to review and improveupon this proposal. I, for one, stand ready andcommitted to revisot this as it is implemented,and as we gain empirical evidence that our ef-fort can be successfu' in making work paymore than welfare. And only then will we betruly able to say that we have \"ended welfareas we know it.\" It's worth taking some risks toend t.H9399Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker. I yield1 minute to the gentleman from SouthCarolina IMr. CLYBURN].Mr.CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I risetoday in opposition to the conferenceagreement. Being a slightly better op-tion than the House passed version ofthe bill does not mean this is a goodpiece of legislation.Welfare should be a temporary tran-sition from welfare to work. Unfortu-nately this is1996, an election year,and we have entered thesilly season.\"Rather than being a constructive de-bate, the welfare reform debate has be-come, for the most part silly talk ofbudgetary savings and time limits\u2014nothelping those in need of assistancelearn how to help themselves.I think the designers of this legisla-tion have forgotten a valuable lesson:If you give a man a fish, you feed himfor a day but if you teach that manhow to fish, he can feed himself for alifetime.This conference report would consistof a check for 2 years and then a re-quirement for work programs for only50 percent of families receiving welfarepayments\u20146 years from now.The Republicans have forgotten theparable about feeding a family for alifetime but instead have decided thatit is much cheaper to write a check toa welfare family than provide the nec-essary training to ensure that anothercheck never has to be written to thatfamily.And under the guise of welfare re-form even these checks are becomingsmaller. Under the 1-louse passed ver-sion of this conference agreement theaverage annual cut per food stamphousehold in South Carolina would be$265, and this cut would grow to $394 by2002. Under the Senate version of thebill, food stamp households in SouthCarolina standtoloseeven more.While it is not clear what the actualcut would be for South Carolina fami-lies under the conference agreement, itis clear that my State's most vulner-able households would be between theproverbial rock and a hard place withlittle or no hope of any training to helpthem lift themselves permanently outof poverty.With the talk of personal responsibil-ity being tossed around. I find it ironicthat at the same time our Nation'smost vulnerable families are being re-quired to do more for themselves, ourStates are being asked to do even less.In this conference agreement, unlikethe Tanner-Castle substitute bill I sup-ported earlier this month, States arerequired to spend only 75 percent ofwhat they spent in 1994 in return for ablock grant check from the FederalGovernment. At the same time, it isprojected that as a result of this legis-lation 8.170 children in my state ofSouth Carolina will be pushed intopvoerty.I urge my colleagues not to supportthis agreement. Although it may bethe lesser of two evils, it is not the bestwe can do nor is it the best we can af-ford to do. H94000 1445Mr. HALL of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, Iyield1minute to the gentlewomanfrom Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEEJ.(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas askedand was given permission to revise andextend her remarks.)Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.Speaker, the politic thing to do todayis to get in the well of the House andhit your gavel down and say I amagainst the deadbeat on welfare, and Iam right with you for welfare reform.As America watches those of us whohave a difference of opinion, we willget castigated and accused as support-ing those who would not work. But Icome today to oppose this rule.I hope that those who have goodwilland understand what America is all about will realize that I believe in wel-fare reform but I do not believe in put-ting 1 million children in the streets. Ido not believe in a weak work programwhere States will not have the work togive to those who are on welfare. I donot believe in a shortened contingencyfund so that, when the 5 years comes,those who have not been able to bridgethemselves out of welfare will not havethe support that they need.I do not believe in sending legal im-migrants into war, but yet when theyneed a helping hand this Nation willsay you can fight for us but we do nothave any support for you and your chil-dren. I do not believe in dispossessingthe disabled. I do not believe in deny-ing SSI benefits to 300,000children.Oh, we could be politic today andmany will do that. But it does not mat-ter to me because there are people inthis country who need our help. This isa bad welfare reform. Vote against it.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues wantto take child abuse out of the welfarefamilies, the best thing to do is tobring these people up out of the pov-erty system and given them meaning-ful jobs. That is what this legislation ismeant to do.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to thegentleman from Florida (Mr. WELDONJ,someone I am very proud of because hegave up a very lucrative medical prac-tice to come here and try to do some-thing for America.Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speak-er,Ithank the distinguished gen- tleman for yielding, and it has been apleasure for me to be here and advocatebr the people in my district, who havebeen calling out for welfare reform formany years.Mr. Chairman, they know that thecurrent welfare system is broken. Thepeople in my district know that therate of poverty has not decreased sincewelfare has been enacted. The averagestay on welfare is 13 years, and todayillegitimacy rates among many welfarefamilies approach 50 percent.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong supportof the bill, and strong support of thisrule. H.R. 734 will truly finally end wel-fare as we know it.it did not take a Republican Congressto end welfare as we know it. This billCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEmakes welfare a helping hand, not alifetime handout. It places 5-year lim-its on collecting AFDC benefits. Forhardship cases States can exempt 20percent of their case load from the 5-year limit, and able-bodied people mustwork after 2 years or lose their bene-fits.It cuts taxpayer financed welfare fornoncitizensandfelons.Itreturns power and flexibility to the States. Itends numerous redundancies within thewelfare system by giving block grants.to the States and rewards States formoving families from welfare to work.It seeks to halt the rising illegit-imacy rates. Moms are encouraged forthe first time to identify the father orrisk losing benefits by as much as 25percent. It increases efforts to makedeadbeat dads pay child support. Andthese, of course, are men who fatherchildren but then have shirked their fi-nancial responsibility for caring forthem.It gives cash rewards to the top fiveStates who make the most successfulimprovement in reducing illegitimacy.As we know, fatherlessness is hnked tohigh juvenile crime rates, high drugabuse rates, and declining educationalperformance. Support the rule and sup-port the bill.Mr.Speaker, in- vestment? Therateof andcrime continues torun rampant. Current programs have encourageddependency, trapped people in unsafe hous-ing, and saddled the poor with rules that areantiwork and antifamily. Clearly, those trappedin poverty and the taxpayers deserve better.This bill overhauls our broken welfare sys-tem. This plan makes sure welfare is not away of life; stresses work not welfare; stopswelfare to felons and most noncitizens; re-stores power and flexibility to the States; andoffers States incentives to halt the rise in ille-gitimacy.By imposing a 5-year lifetime limit for col-lecting AFDC, this bill guarantees that welfareis a helping hand, not a lifetime handout. Rec-ognizing the need for helping true hardshipcases, States would be allowed to exempt upto 20 percent of their caseload from the 5-yearlimit. Inaddition,H.R. 3734 forthefirst timeever requires able bodied welfare recipients towork for their benefits. Those who can workmust do so within 2 years or lose benefits.States will be required to have at least 50 per-cent of their welfare recipients working by2002. To help families make the transitionfrom welfare to work, the legislation provides$4.5 billion more than current law for chiIdcare.Under this bill future entrants into this coun-try will no longer be eigibIe for most welfareprograms during their first 5 years in the Unit-ed States. Felons will not be eligible for wet-fare benefits, and State and local jails will begiven incentives to report felons who are skirt-ing the rules and receiving welfare benefits.July31, 1996Our current system has proven that the one-size-fits-allwelfare system does not work.H.R. 3734 will give more power and flexibilityto the States by ending the entitlement statusof numerous welfare programs by block grant-ing the money to the States. No longer willStates spend countless hours filling out the re-quired bureaucratic forms hoping to receive awaiver from Washington to implement theirwelfare program. States Will also be rewardedfor moving families from welfare to work.Finally, this bill addresses the problem of il-legitimacy in several ways. H.R. 3734 author-izes a cash reward for the five States mostsuccessfulinreducingiflegitimacy.Italso strengthens child support enforcement provi-sions and requires States to reduce assist-ance by 25 percent to indwiduals who do notcooperate in establishing paternity. Lastly, thisbill mandates an appropriation grant of $50million annually to fund abstinence educationprograms combating teenage pregnancy andillegitimacy.The sad state of our current welfare systemand the cycles of poverty and hopelessness itperpetuates are of great concern to me. I be-lieve ths bill goes to the heart of reforming thewelfare system by encouraging and helping in-dividualsinneed become responsible forthemselves and their family. I wholeheartedlysupport thisbi!l because it makes welfare ahelping hand in times of troub'e, not a handout that becomes a way of life. Itruly believe-that this reform will give taxpayers a better re-turn on their investment in helping those inneed.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Maine(Mr.LONGLEY], another outstandingnew Member of this body. I particu-larly like him because he is a formerMarine.(Mr. LONGLEY asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. LONGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I wantto compliment the gentleman fromNew York (Mr. SOLOMON], chair of theCommittee on Rules, and also membersof the committee for bringing this im-portant legislation to the floor, bring-ing this rule to the floor. This has beendelayed far too long.This is a bill that s about childabuse. It is drug abuse. t is crime andviolence and the fact that, for toomany Americans who are trapped inthis system, the American dream hasbecome the American nightmare.I do not argue with the fact that thewelfare system is a hand in need tothose who need it. But for too many ithas become a prison. This is aboutwomen and children who are sufferingunder this system as well as the socialworkers and the law enforcement offi-cers who are forced to deal with theramifications of the aspects of the sys-tem that do not work.Mr. Speaker, for too long we havebeen delaying this. We have delayedthis vote for most of the day. The factof the matter is that welfare reform isat the door. It has been knocking for 'July31. 1996almost 30 years, and it isfinllyhere today. This afternoon,hopefully,it will be voted on and we will send it toa President who will endorse I think that is a tremendous accomplishmentfor the people of this country.I would also say it is a first tep. Thesystem has become so comple4 betweenthe different aspects of service and howthey are available to help people, thateven the people running th systemhave difficulty understanding it, let alone those who have need for assist-ance. So. it is a first step in the direc-tion of reform, in the directio of pro-viding an American dream for moreAmericans and getting rid of t'ie Amer-ican nightmare.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1minute to the gentleman from Texas[Mr. SMITH). an outstanding Memberwho has dealt with the imthigrationproblem in this country.Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Irise in strong support of the rule andthe Personal Responsibility Act. Wel-fare has harmed our children, families.and taxpayers. It has created culture of dependency that saps people's desireto better their lives. And welfare hasunderminedAmerica'slongtandingimmigration policy.America has always welcoitied newcitizens with the energy and commit-ment to come to our shores t build abetter future. We've always ensuredthat immigrants are self-reliant\u2014\u2014notdependent on American taxpayers forsupport. Since1917, noncitiz\u00e9ns whohave become public charges after theyenter the United States have teen sub-ject to deportation.Welfare undermines this policy andharms immigrants. Rather than pro-moting hard work, welfare teripts im-migrants to come to Americ to liveoff the American taxpayer. NoncitizenSSI recipients have increased 580 per-cent over the past 12 years, nd willcost billion tiie cruelwelfare trap. It ensures that sponsors.not taxpayers, will support new immi-grants who fall on hard times.Just asdeadbeat dads should support the chil-dren they bring into this world, dead-beat sponsors should support tIe immi-grants they bring into our country.I urge my colleagues to support thisrule and vote for this bill.Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Savan-nah, GA [Mr. KINGSTON].Mr.KINGSTON.Mr.Sp$ker.I thank the gentleman from New Yorkfor yielding.It is we have hea-d fromthe Democrats a number reascns whythey are not going to support this billtoday. One of their reasons was theyhave not had time to look at it I am arelatively new Member of Congress. Ihave been here 4 years. We have beendebating welfare for 4 years. know that for a fact. I have been here. If theyhave not read the bill by now ad haveCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEnot been following the debate, that isnot the fault of the Republican Con-gress.The second reason they say that isthat welfare does not cost that much.If you add in all the Federal Govern-ment welfare programs, the cost is $345billion, which is ore than we spend ondefense. I am not sure what they con-sider money if $345 billion is not. Wespent $5 trillion since LBJ's Great So-ciety programs, and that is enoughmoney. That is more than we spent onWorld War II.The final reason they are saying isthat it is cruel to children. Nothing ismore cruel than having a welfare sys-tem that traps children in poverty,that makes children and families breakup, that makes them live in housingprojects where the dad cannot be athome, where there is high drug use,where there are teenage dropout ratesand teenage drug abuse. I do not seewhy they think that is compassion.Our program sends $4 billion more onchild care than the Democrat proposal.And that is using their frame of think-ing that is more compassion than whatthey have. Welfare reform is familyfriendly. Welfare should not be a lifestyle. It should be something that soci-ety gives people a temporary helpinghand, not a permanent handout, not ahammock forever to swing in but atemporary safety net so that peoplecan get back into the socioeconomicmainstream and enjoy the Americandream just like the rest of us.Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by re-minding my colleagues of one very im-portant fact. Today 9 million childrendepend upon Aid to Families With Dependent Children fortheir survival.When we are talking about reformingwelfare, we are talking about these 9million American children,and weneed to be very, very careful on whatchanges we make.Mr. Speaker, this is not to say that Iam opposed to welfare reform. In fact,I am very much in favor of welfare re-form. I have seen too many childrengrowing up surrounded by violence. Ihave seen too many fathers completelyabandon their responsibilities. And Ihave seen too many single mothers toodejected and overwhelmed to look forjobs.These days being poor is not what itused to be. It used to be that familiesstuck together. It used to be if youworked hard enough you could supportyour family. But. Mr. Speaker, unfor-tunately times have changed.I agree with the editorial in the Au-gust 12 issue of the New Republic whichsays that, although our current welfaresystem may not have created the cur-rent underclass, it certainly sustainsit. I agree that welfare reform is one ofthe most important issues that we cantake up in this Congress. Todays Bos-ton Globe says that under this bill.poverty will grow with welfare done onthe cheap. We need to be very careful.H9401Mr. Speaker, how we change AFDC andnot do it on the cheap.This bill. Mr. Speaker, is not the wayto do it.I hoped that after this billcame out of conference, I would be ableto support it. But after looking at it, Icannot because, Mr. Speaker, I cannotvote for a bill that will push 1 millionadditional children below the povertylevel. I cannot vote for a bill that maynot guarantee health care to poor chil-dren and a conference committee thatcuts food stamps. I cannot vote for abill that will provide no protection forbad times. If there is a recession, rnil-lions of people will be completely des-titute. And, Mr. Speaker. I cannot votefor a bill that allows States to take atleast one-half of their Federal moneyand spend it on something other thanchildren.ThisGingrichwelfarebill.Mr. Speaker. is too tough on children. It isweak on work, and it is soft on dead-beat parents. Mr. Speaker, as I said,two out of every three people on wel-fare is a child, and we have a respon-sibility to those children. We have a re-sponsibility to make sure that underno circumstances whatsoever wiil theybe hurt. We have a responsibility. Mr.Speaker,to make surethattheir health and their safety is placed farabove any jockeying for political ad-vantage.So I urge my colleagues to opposethis rule and oppose the conferencecommittee bill and I yield back thebalance of my time.0 1500Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker. I yieldmyself the balance of my time.Mr. Speaker, didIhear the gen-tleman right when he said, the Ging-rich welfare bill? Is that not strange? Ithought it was the Gingrich-Clintonwelfare biil, because the President hasjust announced he is going to sign thebill. Mr. Speaker. coileagues, I wouldjust say to you. what is compassionateabout locking poor people into a life-time of welfare dependency? That iswhat this debate is all about. If you arereally sincere, if you really care aboutpoor people in America, do somethingfor them. Change the status quo whichhas failed miserably.I see my good friend. the gentlemanfrom Texas IMr. STENHOLMJ, sittingover here. came here with me 18 yearsago. He came before the Committee onRules about an hour or so ago and hesaid, JERRY. this a bipartisan bill. Hesaid, we Democrats have had input toit. It is a compromise. It is a step inthe right direction.Mr. Speaker, what I was hearing is.no more ifs, ands and buts. This is thecompromise. This is the step in theright direction we need to move in.Let us vote for this bill now. Vote forthe rule and the bill and let us get onwith trying to change the welfare sys-tem in America for the good of thepoor.Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balanceof my time. and I move the previousquestion on the resolution.

Mr. Speaker. I yield 4minutes to the gentleman from Kansas[Mr. ROBERTS), the distinguished chair-man of the Committee on Agriculture.(Mr. ROBERTS asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman for yielding time to me.and I thank my colleagues for their re-luctant attention.Mr. Speaker, in a year that has beendescribed by many as one of gridlockand finger-pointing and wheel-spinningand even-numbered year partisan rhet-oric. we are about to achieve a remark-able accomplishment. This House andthe Senate. and now finally the Presi-dent, have responded to the Americanpublic. Simply put, this conference re-port represents real accomplishment,real welfare reform.We urged the President to sign thisconference report. He has. There aregood reasons why. Seventy-five percentof the food stamp reforms in this con-ferencereportrepresentthesame things that were proposed by this ad-ministration. I do not care whether weare talking about budget savings, thework requirement, the program sim-plification, the tougher penalties forfraud and abuse, or keeping the pro-gram at the Federal level as we gothrough the welfare reform transition.We have tried to work with the admin-istration. We have donethat. ThePresident will sign the bill.Mr. Speaker, this road has not beeneasy. We have been working in thisHouse for 18 months. The very firsthearing held by me in the Committeeon Agriculture was on fraud and abuse,and the critical and urgent need for re-form of the Food Stamp Program. Thenew Inspector General at the Depart-ment of Agriculture showed a video-tape of organized crime members trad-ing food stamps for cash, and eventu-ally using that cash for drugs and guns.That tape made national news. and itconfirmed the suspicions of many tax-payers and citizens.Following that hearing. our late col-league and dear friend, the chairman ofthe subcommittee. Bill Emerson, heldfour extensive hearings and formulatedthe principles that guided the reformthat is now before us.First. the original Republican planwas to make sure thatas we gothrough welfare reform, no one wouldH9403go hungry. that we would keep a re-formed Food Stamp Program as a safe-ty net so food can and will be providedwhile States are undergoing this tran-sition.Second. we wanted to eliminate asmuch paperwork and redtape and regu-lation as possible. We wanted to har-monizethewelfareandtheFood Stamp Program -requirements. This billdoes that.Third. having seen the program costssoar from $12 to $27 billion in 10 years.regardless of how the economy has per-formed, we wanted to take the programoff of automatic pilot. We have donethat.Fourth. the food stamps must not bea disincentive to work. In this bill,able-bodied participants,those fromages of 18 to 50 with no dependents. nokids. no children. only the able-bodied,these folks, less than 2 percent of thoseon food stamps, they must work in pri-vate sector jobs and not be rewardedfor not working.Fifth. after hearing firsthand fromthe Inspector General, we tightenedthe controls on waste and abuse. Westopped the trafficking with increasedand tough penalties.Mr. Speaker, these principles do rep-resent real reform of the Food StampProgram. All are incorporated in theconference agreement. I urge my col-leagues to vote \"yes.\"I want to thank my colleagues for atremendous team effort. more espe-cially the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.KASICH),moreespeciallythegen- tleman from GOODLING]. underscored three times. thegentleman from Florida [Mr. SHAw].who said the work we have accom-plished is significant. We have true re-form. We have a real welfare reformbill. But now the work really starts.This bill is not perfect. We have a lotahead of us and a lot of challenges. Iurge a \"yes\" vote on the conference re-port.Mr. Iyield2 minutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Tennessee [Mr. TANNER].(Mr. TANNER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker.I am happy today for several reasons.I think Congress has come together withthe administration to take a step for-ward on certainly what is a pressingnational social problem. That is wel-fare reform. We started out, as the pre-vious speaker said, almost 2 years agoto try to bring together somethingthat could be signed and enacted intolaw so we could actually change thesystem that is broken, according to ev-eryone who has observed it. and actu-ally do something about it now.I want to thank the gentleman fromFloridaIMr.SHAwl,the gentlemanfrom to H9404thank the gentleman from Delaware.MIKE CASTLE. who came together withme to put together something thatwould be bipartisan so we could get offof this partisan gridlock that we havebeen suffering from.Mr. Speaker, in our motion to in-struct conferees we asked for two orthree things: One, a safety net for kids.That has been accomplished with Med-icaid and food stamps. The safety net isthere for children. The unfunded man-date problem has been partially takencare of, with the States being allowedto continue with waivers, and also be-jcause the Medicaid situation is intact,there will not be a lot of costs trans-ferred to county hospitals across ourcountry,. We also asked that savings goto the debt. That has not been accom-plished, but as the previous speakersaid, we will continue to work on that.The most important difference be-tween the conference agreement andthe two bills that have previously beenvetoed, in my judgment. is that we pro-tect innocent children. This bill nolonger treats a 4-year-old child like heor sheisa 24-year-old irresponsibleadult. To me that was critical. That isnot a part of welfare reform. That isjust compassionate public policy. Thisbill has done that.I once again thank the Republicanconferees for their hard work, the gen-tleman from Florida [Mr. SHAw] andothers. I also urge a \"yes\" vote. Let usmake this a red letter day.Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I yield suchtime as she may consume to the gen-tlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. ROu-(Mrs. ROUKEMA asked andwas given permission to revise and extendher remarks.)Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Speaker, I risein support of this legislation, and wantto associate myself with the statementof the chairman of the Committee onAgriculture, the gentleman from Kan-sas [Mr. ROBERTS), particularly as itapplied to the Food Stamp Program.My opposition and stated principle inthe last round of this bill before itwent to conference was expressing aconcern of what it did to innocent chil-dren in that regard. I rise in support. Ithas been corrected, and I support theconference agreement.Mr. Speaker, as someone who has ad-vocated a \"tough love\" approach towelfare reform legislation. this goes along way toward reforming our brokenwelfare system as we return the systemtoits original purpose\u2014a temporarysafety net, not a way of life.Furthermore, as a pioneer in the bat-tle to also reform our child support en-forcement system. I am very pleased tosee that the reforms I have been push-ing for almost 4 years now\u2014which rep-resent the heart and soul of the U.S.Interstate Commission on Child Sup-port's final report\u2014have been includedin the package before us today.Ensuring that these child support en-forcement reforms were included in this bill acknowledges what I've beenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEsaying for years: Effective reform ofour interstate child support enforce-ment laws must be an integral compo-nent of any welfare reform plan thatthe 104th Congress sent to PresidentClinton.Research has found that somewherebetween 25 and 40 percent of welfarecosts go to support mothers and chil-dren who fall onto the welfare rollsprecisely because these mothers arenot receiving the legal. court-ordered.support payments to which they arerightfully entitled.With the current system spendingsuch a large portion of funding onthese mothers, children are the firstvictims, and the taxpayers who have tosupport these families are the last vic-tims.The plan before us also puts teethinto the laws that require unwed moth-ers to establish paternity of their chil-dren at the hospital. thereby laying thegroundwork for claiming responsibilityfor their actions and families.The core of the welfare reforms in-corporated into this bill are clearly de-fined work requirements for welfarebeneficiaries\u2014whichisessentialto moving people off of the welfare rolls\u2014strict time limits\u2014thereby giving wel-fare recipients a strong incentive tofind a job\u2014and more flexibility forStates to design welfare programs thatfit the needs of their people.In addition, this welfare reform planprotects the safety net for children byincluding a rainy day fund to help thefamilies in States suffering from reces-sion or economic downturns.The enhanced flexibility that Stateswill receive under this plan is meritori-ous, provided that the safety net ismaintained in order to protect familieswho truly need temporary assistance\u2014not a lifetime of handouts generationafter generation.For example. while I support the con-cept of giving States more flexibilityin designing their own welfare pro-grams. I am very pleased to see thatthis bill contains strong maintenanceof effort provisions which will requireStates to continue their commitmentto the Nation's safety net.Under no circumstances should ablock grant reform allow States tosimply administer welfare or any otherprogram using only Federal moneys\u2014this bill avoids that problem with itstough maintenance of effort language.I was very distressed by the fact thatHouse version of this bill opened a sig-nificant loophole in the Food StampProgram by giving States the option ofusing block grants for this critically-important aspect of our Nation's safetynet.Given that I was deeply concernedabout giving a blank check to the Gov-ernors for the Food Stamp Programwould result in innocent children goinghungry. I opposed the House plan lastweek.But again I am very pleased to seethat, once again, the Senate has savedthe House of Representatives from it-July31. 1996self by rejecting this proposal, and suc-cessrully retaining its position on thisissue in the final bill.Additionally,thislegislation doestake a modest step in the right direc-tion by allowing States to use theirown money, or social services blockgrant funds\u2014to provide families onwelfare with vouchers\u2014instead of cashbenefits\u2014to pay for essential servicesneeded by the family, that is, medicine,baby food, diapers, school supplies\u2014if aState has terminated the family's cashbenefits as part of its sanction pro-gram.This is the right thing to do becauseeven if a welfare recipient is playing byall of the rules and has not found ajobwhen the time limits become effective,the use of vouchers for services playsan important role in helping the familyand its children keep their head abovethe water-line.There should be no question that wemust enact strong welfare reform legis-lation this year. The American peopleare correctly demanding that we re-store the notion of individual respon-sibility and self-reliance to a systemthat has run amok over the past 20years.Although I have strongly supportedsome welfare reforms that have beendescribed as \"tough love\" measures forseveral years now, I want to reiteratethat my goal has always been to re-quire self-reliance and responsibility,while ensuring that innocent childrendo not go hungry and homeless as a re-sult of any Federal action.Finally, I am most supportive of theimprovements the conference gave tothe Medicaid Program. This is an en-lightened and -humane response to gen-uine medical needs.Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect.But. it represents the first major re-form of our broken-down welfare sys-tem in generations. We have been givena historic opportunity that I hope andtrust we will not squander. We owe noless to our children.I urge my col-leagues to join me in voting for finalpassage of this monumental reformpackage.Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker. I yield my-self such time us I may consume.(Mr. CAMP asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-port of the conference agreement.Today,the Congress is againpresentedwith theopportunity to adopt meaningful wel-fare reform. Over the past 19 months, my col-leagues andIhave written,debated, andadopted proposals to reform our current wel-fare system. Our efforts,however,were twicevetoed by the President.Since launching the war on poverty in 1965,over $5 trillion has been spent to eliminatepoverty in America. Some 31 years later anddespite billions and billions of dollars, povertyin America has worsened and our childrengrow and mature in an environment with littlehopeand opportunity.The proposal before us today reforms a wel-fare system that has trapped millions in a July31, 1996cycleof poverty. Our current welfar! systempunishes rewrding ir-responsibility, illegitimacy and destroiing self-esteem. For too long, the Federal Governmenthas defended the current system and turnedaway as millions of families and children be-carne trapped in a cycle of despair, depend-ence, and disappointment.Thisbillaccomplishesseveralimportantgoals. First,it time limits weUare to 5 years.The Federal and State governments have anob'igation to assist those in need but our cur-rent system has become a way of life insteadof a temporary helping hand for those expen-encing hard times.Second, our bill requires work. Th Wash-ington welfare system has also robbd recipi-ents of their self-esteem by merely prbviding acheck. This proposal requires each recipient towork for their benefits, thereby instlIing thepride of employment and allowing eah recipi-ent to earn a paycheck. This sense of accom-plishment and independence increases the in-dividuaJ's self-esteem and often influences thechildren who can see firsthand the b'nefits ofa strong work ethic. For those contnuing toexpenence hard times, however, the bill allowsStates to exempi up to 20 percent of the wel-fare caseload from the time limit.Most importantly our bill helps thos familiesand individuals working to improve thir lives.We provide more funding for child care thancurrent law and more than requested by thePresident. This funding is extremely importantin allowing families to work while nsuringtheir children receive the proper care. We alsoprotect our children by ensuring eligibility forMedicaid. For those families moving from wel-fare to work, we conlinue assistanceso Iheydon'l have to worry about losing helth carecoverage if their incomes increase.Compassionisnot the sole property ofWashington and our billcreates a Federal-State partnership in meeting the need of wel-fare recipients. States will have the pover andopportunity to design and implement new in-novative programs that best meel the needs ofresidents.I urge my colleagues to support theconference report.Mr.Speaker, I askunanimo.scon- sentthatthe gentleman from E'lorida[Mr. SHAW) be allowed to control thetime and to yield.The SPEAKER pro tempor (Mr.RIGGS).Isthere objection to the re-quest of the gentleman from Michigan?There was no objection.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I rield 1 minutetothegentlewoman fromWashington [Ms. DUNN), a meffiber ofthe Committee on Ways and Means.Ms. DUNN of Washington. Mr. Speak-er, this is a good bill. I am very leasedthat the President has announcd thathe is going to sign this bill. I want tocommend Members on both sides of theaisle for their hard work. W haveworked for a long time to put good bill together. ITothose who are concerned with pro-tecting the children, so were we. Wespent a lot of time, a lot of thoiight. alot of effort on protecting the chldren.We have come up with a bill that in thechild care portion of the bill providesover $4billion more tohelp1 thosemothers who are trying to get of wel-fare into the workplace. with th peaceCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEof mind to know their children will betaken care of, $4 billion more than inthe current welfare system.On the child support portion of thelegislation, where we all know that inthis Nation today $34 billion are owed,ordered by the court to be paid to cus-todial parents, we have tightened upthis system. Those children are oftenthe children that go on welfare\u201430 per-cent of their parents leave the State toavoid paying money to support theirown flesh-and-blood children. We havesolved this problem. So it is my greatjoy to say support this bill, and thanksfor all the help.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\u00bdminutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from California [Ms. WOOLSEY).(Ms. WOOLSEY asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend her re-marks.)Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, we allagree that the welfare system does notwork for the welfare recipients and forthe taxpayers. The challenge we face aslawmakers is to improve the system sowe can invest in getting families offwelfare andinto jobs that pay aliveable wage, and also to answer the\"what ifs\". What if a mother on wel-fare cannot find a job? What if she isnot earning enough to take care of herfamily? What if she cannot find childcare for her 6-year-old?Unfortunately, this conference reportwill not ensure families can live on thejobs that they get, that they will earna liveable wage, and this conferencehas made sure that it does not answerour \"what ifs .Itkicks families off ofassistance, even if parents are tryinghard to find a job. It does not even in-vest in the education and training par-ents need to get jobs that pay an ac-tual liveable wage.Even though the House and Senateagreed that single parents with kidsunder 11 should not leave their childrenhome alone if there is no child care,the majority went ahead without dis-cussion and lowered that age to under6.0 1545How many of my colleagues wouldleave their 6-year-old home alone?I ask my colleagues. do not take thisvote lightly. Do not leave any child be-hind. The lives of millions of childrenare at stake. It will be too late tomor-row if the what-ifs are not answeredtoday.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker,I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Penn-sylvania IMr. chairmanof the Committee on Economic andEducational Opportunities.(Mr. GOODLING asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Speaker, as Ihave said many times, you cannot fixsomething, you cannot change some-thing unless you first admit it is bro-ken and first admit that you need tochange it.Finally, both sides of theaisle came forward and indicated thatH9405we do have abroken system, thatwe have as a matter of fact put millions ofAmericans into a bind and took awaytheiropportunitytoeverhavea chance at the American dream.Now, the tough part then came as tohow do you fix it. Of course we had dif-fering opinions. Our committee startedout with the idea that welfare must bea safetynet,not a way of life; theremust be a very clear emphasis on workarid on getting those on welfare intowork. There must be a strong measureto stop abuses of the system. We needto return power and flexibility to theStates. Welfare should not encourage,it should discourage destructive per-sonalbehavior that contributes so clearly not only to welfare dependencebut to a host of social problems.Mr. Speaker, this is a good, balancedwelfare reform bill. We have been verygenerous in providing money for childcare. We have protected the nutritionprogram. We have established strongwork requirements. And we have the births andabsentee fathers.Mr. all thosewho have worked so hard to bringabout this welfare reform effort. I wantto especially mention from the Com-mittee on Economic and EducationalOpportunities,thegentlemanfrom California IMr. CUNNINGHAM] the gen-tleman from Delaware IMr. CASTLE)the [Mr. HuTCHINSON) the gentleman from Mis-souri IMr. TALENT], and the gentle-woman from Kansas IMrs. MEYERS). Istrongly support the legislation. I urgeall to vote for it because at long lastwe move forward in transforming wel-fare to a program of work and oppor-tunity.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker,I yield 2minutes to the gentleman permission revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I risein support of this conference report. Indoing so,Iwant to pay particularthanks to the gentleman from Florida[Mr. SHAW) for making this an inclu-sive conference, at least from the per-spective of those of us on this side ofthe aisle, and also the gentleman fromLouisiana [Mr. MCCRERY] and the gen-tleman from Delaware IMr. CASTLE).They have been very good to workwith, at least in listening to those of uson this side of the aisle who had majorproblems with previous bills before theHouse and thought we had constructivesuggestions of how to make it better.We were listened to. and many of theproposals we made are included, ofwhich we are grateful.To those that suggest that somehowthe State waivers portion of this iscontrary to the best interest of thework programs of somehow guts workrequirements. I only suggest that theyread the bill. Read the language whichisavailable, and they will see. Far H9406from gutting it. it makes it much moreworkable.For States like mine. Texas. Utah.Michigan. and others that have alreadybegun experimenting with work pro-grams, this bill, I believe, allows thoseStates and all of us who are interestedin making this bill work as we say wewish it to, it allows the flexibility toallow States to experiment, to do pilotprojects and pilot programs. In thiscase itis already happening in myState.Some of the concerns that we hadwith unfunded mandates, they havebeen alleviated as best as can be pos-sible under a conference report. Forthat we are grateful. In the area ofhealth care providers,protection ofchildren, this is moved in the directionthat we feel is much, much more pref-erable than the bill that originallypassed the House.While this welfare reform conferencereport is far from perfect, it is clearlypreferable to continuing the currentsystem and preferable to welfare legis-lation considered earlier.For these reasons I support the wel-fare reform conference report. I am ex-tremely pleased that the President hasagreed to sign it, and I commend thosewho have worked so hard for so long inorder to bring us to this day.Mr. Speaker, while some of the commentsI've heard this afternoon have tended towardthe hyperbolic, it truly is the case that the im-portance of what we are doing today shouldnot be minimized. When this welfare reformproposal is signed into law, the status quo willbe fundamentally changed.This kind of change does not happen bychance. More people thanI can mention de-serve credit, but inaddition to the obviousleadershipofPresidentClinton,ChairmanSHAW, and other members of the leadership,I want to express my thanks for the bipartisanefforts of MIKE CASTLE, JOHN TANNER, JOHNCHAFEE,SANDY LEVIN, NANCY JOHNSON, andothers.One of the major reasons Iopposed pre- vious w&fare reform proposals, and specifi-cafly the bill that was most recently before theHouse, was because of the restrictionsitwould have placed on the State of Texas. Ear-lier this year I worked extensively with Gov-emor Bush and the White House to obtain ap-proval of the Texas welfare waiver which in-cludes the best plans of our State for movingpeople from welfare to work.PresidentClintonalreadyhas approvedwaivers allowing 41 States to implement inno-vative programs to move welfare recipients towork. The House's welfare reform bill wouldhave restricted those State reform initiativesby imposing work mandates that are less flexi-ble than States are implementing. Over 20.States wou'd have been required to changetheir work programs to meet the mandates inthat earlier House bill or face substantial pen-alties from the Federal Government.The conference report now allows Statesthat are implementing welfare waivers to goforward with those efforts. Specifically,theconference report allows those States to countindividuals who are participating in State-au-thorzed work programs in meeting the workparticipation rates in the bill, even work pro-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEgrams which otherwise do not meet the Fed-eral mandates in the bill.I know that some of my colleagues on myside of the aisle have been critical of the Statewaiver provisions included in this conferencereport.I must respectfully and forcefully dis-agree with that sentiment and say that in vir-tually all cases, I think that conversations withofficials from their own States would lead themto supporting this waiver provision.I am convinced that these various Stateplans are precisely the best experiments fordetermining how to put people to work. Frank-ly,Ithink the State plans generally are morerealistic about the work requirements and aremore solidly grounded in the possible, ratherthan the hypothetical.Some of us around here have gotten carriedaway with our rhetoric about being tough onwork by getting into a bidding war over whocan have work requirements that sound tough-er. Our rhetoric about being tough on workhas led us to impose work requirements in thisbill that virtually no State can implement.The only work requirements that are mean-ingful are the work requirements that actuallycan be met by States. When I have said thatprevious welfare reform bills were weak onwork,Ihave meant that the bills would notgive States the resources to put we'fare recipi-ents into work.The mandates inthebillpassed by theHouse would force States such as Texas tomake changes in the plans passed by theState legislature or face severe penalties fromthe Federal Govemment.The important State waiver change includedin the conference report gives States nec-essary additionalflexibilityinimp'ementing programs to move welfare recipients to workeven if they don't meet the mandates in thisbill.The additional flexibility that this bill gives toStates in developing work programs will re-duce the pressure on States to cut benefits orrestricteligibilityfor assistanceinorder to meet the work requirements of the biH. TheCongressional Budget Office has reported thatStates would be forced to tighten eligibility forassistance to needy families or by reducingthe size of benefits in order to offset the un-funded mandate in the work programs. Mem-bers who are concerned about the impact thatwelfare reform will have on children shouldstrongly support giving States this flexibilityand reducing the unfunded mandates.Despite some reservations I have about thisconference report, Ibelieveitis critical thatweflare reform be enacted this year. Failure todo so will signal yet another wasted oppor-tunity to make critically needed reforms. Weshould enact this conference report and fix thecurrent system now, moving towards a systemthat better promotes work and individual re-sponsbility.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\u00bdminutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Nevada (Mr. ENSIGN], avalued member of the Subcommitteeon Human Resources of the Committeeon Ways and Means.(Mr. ENSIGN asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the chairmanfor yielding me the time. and I thankhim for all the work he has done on be-half of the welfare recipients in thecountry.July 31, 1996Mr. Speaker. today is truly independ-ence day for welfare recipients. It isthe first day to redefine compassion inAmerica. In Las Vegas, we have a pro.gram known as Opportunity Village. Itis an incredible program for the men-tally disabled.Itis a public-privatepartnership. The primary premise forthe program is that it is compassionateenough to care enough about mentallydisabled people to where the commu-nity works together to find these peo-ple jobs.It is an incredible situation to walkdown there and to see the joy thatthese people have in being able to workevery day so that they do not become adrain on society. They feel good aboutthemselves. Today is the first day wel-fare recipients are going to start feel-ing good about themselves, and thechildren are going to start feeling goodabout their parents.My mom. when I was young, was di-vorced, supporting threekids, withvery little money, just virtuafly nochild support. I watched her every sin-gle day get up and go to work. Shetaught me a work ethic that has car-ried through my entire life with myselfand my brother and sister. We haverobbed that of welfare families. Thisbill starts giving that work ethic backto the American people.The Wall Street Journal did a poll.Ninety-five percent of all presidents ofcompanies had their first job by thetime they were 12 years of age. Com-passion, work ethic, today; vote forthis bill. It is a good bill for America,and today is a great day for America.Mr. SABO. Mr. yield1 minute tothe WATERS).Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker. somedaymore politicians will approach toughdecisions such as welfare reform withmore care and integrity. This is notthatday.Someday politicianswill place children above politics. This isnot that day. Someday politicians willplace truth above personal gain. This isnot that day.Too many Democrats and Repub-licans will run for reelection on this so-called welfare reform legislation. Thetruth is this bill does nothing to trainmothers for work, to develop jobs, tohelp recipients become independent.This bill is welfare fraud. not welfarereform. This bill penalizes poor work-ing families and will drive more chil-dren into poverty. Only time will re-veal the shame of what happened thisday, and only history will record theblatant lack of courage to simply dothe right thing.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker,I yield1 minute tothe distinguished gentle-woman from Florida (Mrs. MEEK].(Mrs. MEEK of Florida asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendher remarks.)Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker,let no one fool you. This bill is notabout reforming welfare.Itisnot about that. It is about saving moneyand trying your very best to influence July31, 1996the American public that we hive bal-anced the budget.I would not mindthis. I want to see welfare refoim. Butthis is not the way to do it. What weare doing hereishurting children.Every time I stand here, I talI aboutthat. These are all children. Tie con-ference report did much worse than theSenate. You allow the States, and Icome from a State that will, 'ou areallowing a State to cut 25 percent oftheir 1994 spending levels withOut anypenalty. When the Florida legslaturegets ready to cut, they are going to cutthis particular program. The patents ofchildren ages 6 to 11 will have 1o workwithout assurance of child car at all.Who is going to take care of the chil-dren? Are they going to run all overthe world and get into troubl? Yes.The transfer of funds from tranfer as-sistance to work, the Senate bill didbetter than that. The conference billallows them to divert funds.I am hoping that people listen to thisbill because what this conference billdoes is worse than the Senate I?ill andit should not be passed. Mr. Speaker.this is a travesty to the American pub-lic.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker,I yield 2minutes to the gentlewoman guished member of the Committee onWays and Means.Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman from Florida foryielding me the time and conmendhim on his extraordinary leadershipnow over 4 years in getting this bill tothe President.Mr. Speaker, this bill is aboul work,responsibility, hope, and opportunity. Iwish I had the time here today to an-swer some of the concerns tht havebeen raised about day care and jbs andall of those things. I think this bill ad-dresses them. But I would like to dis-cuss two issues that have not rceivedmuch attention but are integral to ourunderlying goal of helping families be-come self-sufficient: Child suppprt en-forcement and Medicaid.First. I am very pleased to say thatthisbillretainscurrenteligibilitystandards for families on Medicid. Allfamilies now on Medicaid will cdntinueto get Medicaid. Furthermore, all fami-lies in the future that meet today's cri-teria will continue to get Medicaideven if their State redefines their wel-fare program with more constrictedcriteria.Regarding the Medicaid tratisitionperiod, under current law when a fam-ily leaves the welfare rolls to work,they are guaranteed 1year's ransi-tional Medicaid benefit. In the future,this will be absolutely true. We :retaincurrent law in this regard. Medicl cov-erage is often one of the bigget bar-riers to families leaving welfare, espe-cially since lower paying jobs ae lesslikelytohaveemployer-prvidedhealth coverage. By keeping the ransi-tion period policy constant, we are ena-bling families to go to work withoutworrying about losing their rredicalbenefit.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSESecond, this bill contains landmarkchildsupportprovisions. Todayin America 3.7 million custodial parentsare poor; of those 3.7 million, fullythree-quarters receive no child support.Of those who have child support ordersin place. which is only 34 percent of thewomen, only 40 percent receive thepayment they should receive. This iscatastrophic for women and children.and this bill fixes that system, an enor-mous advance for women and childrenand a way off welfare.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker,I yield1 the distinguished Florida [Mrs. THURMANJ.Mrs. THURMAN. I thank the gen-tleman Minnesota for yielding methis time.Mr. Speaker,Irise today to con-gratulate my friends from the otherside of the aisle for their wisdom inadopting the position of the bipartisanCastle-Tanner coalition in maintainingtheFederalcommitmenttofood stamps.My colleagues were right to elimi-nate the optional block grant thatwould have forced States to turn awayhungry families with children. Theywere right to modify the Kasich foodstamp amendment in favor of a provi-sion that provides assistance to laid-offand downsized workers.Of course,Istill believe it wouldhave been more beneficial if this billrealized that people who cannot findjobs still need to eat. But my col-leagues have come a long way, and it issignificant improvement over the firstattempt at welfare reform. I am happythat my friends from the other side ofthe aisle listened to us and made theseimportant changes along with otherssuch as Medicaid coverage and vouch-ers. I look forward to the opportunityfor us to continue in a bipartisan spiritto look at the future of these programsand to ensure that people that we aretrying to help to get to work are ableto do so.My colleagues so aptly put in a provi-sion so that we do a review every 3years. We need to make sure we followthrough with that.Mr. SHAW.

Mr. Speaker. as rep-resentatives of the people we do not getas many opportunities as we would liketo do sbmething that would truly helpimprove the lives of the people weserve. This bill presents us with justsuch an opportunity. This conferencereport is more than just a prescriptionfor much needed welfare reform, how-ever. It is what I hope will be the firststep in our bipartisan efforts to im-prove the public assistance programson which disadvantaged families de-pend.Afterall,welfare as we know itmeans more than AFDC. It includesH9407food stamps, housing assistance andenergy assistance, and it includes med-ical assistance. That is right. For mil-lions of Americans, Medicaid is wel-fare. That is because income assistancealone is not sufficient to meet thepressing needs of disadvantaged fami-lies.For States, too, Medicaid is welfare.In fact, it makes up the largest shareof State public assistance funding. As ashare of State budgets. Medicaid is fourtimes larger than AFDC.0 1600If President Clinton does the rightthing and signs this welfare reform billinto law, Medicaid will still be caughtup in the choking bureaucratic redtape of Federal control, and that iswhy the Medicaid Program must be re-structured if States are to fully suc-ceed in making public assistance pro-grams more responsible and effective.Mr. Speaker.I commend my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle fortheir commitment to true welfare re-form, and I look forward to continuingour efforts to making all sources ofpublic assistance work better for thosewho need a helping hand up.Mr. SABO.

Mr. Speaker, Irisein strong opposition tothisdead)y and Draco-nian pieceofgarbagewhichwill do nothing toreform conditions of poverty and unem-ploynlent sufferedby ourNation's most vulner-able.As I listen to the debate on the floor of thisbody today, Ifelt compelled to thefloortoday,letus bec'ear\u2014atitscore, this bill unravels a 60-yearguaranteeof a basic human safety net for ourNation's poorest and most vulnerable childrenand theh families.The President and many Members of the104th Congress have decided to cut welfareasthey know it\u2014to children, immigrants andthe poorest Americans\u2014but they have left in-tact welfare aswe know it\u2014welfareto Ameri-ca's largest corporations. We cannot and mustnot balance the budget on the backs of theleast ofthese.Mr. Speaker, Ihave heard Members on thisfloor urge supportofthis deadly measure,cloaking its defense in terms like 'This is forthe good of the poor.\" How can this be any-thing but bad for the poor,whenwe know thatin my Home State of Illinois alone, 55,800 chil-dren willbe pushedbelowthe poverty line asaresult of this bill, and 1.3 million children willbe similarlyimpactednationwide.Please know, Mr. Speaker, that Iwill notjoin demopublicans andrepublicratsinthismean-spiritedattackyoucan rest assuredthatIwiU work to continue to provide equalprotection under the law for our Nation's poor,our disabled, our immigrants and our children.Posturingtoughonwelfaremothersisviewed asgoodpolitics at east by a press H9408corpsthat admires cynicism.

Mr. Speaker.Iyield1 minute to the distinguished gentle-womanfromNewYorkLMrs.MALONEY].Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, thisconference report is dangerous and un-realistic. I do not believe the Americanpeople will tolerate a policy of endingsupport, toasingle mom who hasplayed by the rules, tried to find ajobfor 2 years and could not.Our unemployment rate is over 5 per-cent, and that does not include mil-lions of welfare recipients. This con-ference report does not require theGovernment to create jobs. The resultwill be the worlds wealthiest nationputting families out on the street tofend for themselves. Will we toleratedestitution and call it reform?Republicans say the States will solvethese problems. Already Philadelphia,as reported yesterday in the paper, hasstopped providing shelter beds for sin-gle homeless people due to Federal andState welfare cuts. I am not predictingthat Republican welfare reform willput people out on the street. I am pointing out that it already has.Oppose this conference report.Mr. SHAW.

Everyonetalks about this in a very draconiansense. I believe this is opportunity forwomen. for children. in some instancesfor men. and for families. It is oppor-tunity because we are going to takepeople who have not had a true chanceto live the American life in terms ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtheir education and background and wearegivingthem that is member for yielding methis time.Mr. Speaker, 2 years and you are outis not a bad proposition in and of itself,but in this bill it relies on that tried-and-true adage if you give a man a fishyou may feed him for a day, if youteach a man how to fish he may feedhimself for a lifetime.In this bill. Mr. Speaker. only 50 per-centofthose2-years-and-you-are-outerscanreasonablyexpectany chance at training. In this era of per-sonalresponsibility,thislegislationasks our most vulnerable citizens to domore, but our States are being requiredto do less.Mr. Speaker. this is not the best wecan do. and it is not the best we can af-ford.

No one should get something fornothing, and if the American peopleare going to be generous with their taxdollars, they should get something inreturn.Mr. Speaker. this legislation providesresponsible reform through the threemain goals we started with: State flexi-bility,personalresponsibility,and work.

The Urban Institutetells us that over a million childrenwill be put into poverty as a result ofthis legislation. We are told by our ownRepublican Congressional Budget Of-fice that it is underfunded insofar asthe work requirements.If indeed we want our people on wel-fare to go to work, is it not fair to ex-pect that there will be dollars there toprovide them jobs. not to cut themadrift after 2 years without any cashsupport whatsoever?That is what the consequence of thisbill will do. It will force people out onthe streets, literally. with no cash as-sistance whatsoever and without thepromise of any assistance in findingjobs.The women on welfare want to work.Look at any study that has been is-sued. These studies tell us that over 60percent of the young mothers on wel-fare are out there looking for jobs andhalf of them do find them and they getoff welfare. These people who say thatthe women stay there 13 years on wel-fare are simply not telling the truth.Mr. SHAW.

The welfare bill will really re-form and empower the States to be cre-ative in solving their own problems andit will help end the cycle of dependencyand poverty, which really truly helpsmillions of children with a decent ful-filling future.As a former mayor. I know firsthandthese ideas work because we had pilotprograms in our area where we weremoving people out of public housingand into home ownership and off ofwelfare with child care help and reallygiving them their dignity back again.It is a sin not to help someone whogenuinely,trulyneedsthathelp through no fault of their own, but it isalso a sin to help people who do notneed help.

I remainconcerned that funding for job trainingmay not be adequate yet, and hat mayneed to be addressed in the futire.A lot of us have worked hard to im-prove the various welfare refprm pro-posals we have considered.

That is not the debate.But not everybody in the Congresswants to shift the cost from FederalGovernment to local government.We usually ask ourselves as law-makers to look before we leap. I do notthink we have done that here on thewelfare reform bill. We have asked tobe quoted by Governors, but Governorsdo not administerwelfare, commu-nities do. Counties and cities do. Hasanyone asked the mayors and countysupervisors? Well, I did.In California we are going to shift230,000 people who are legal residents ofthe United States who are disabled.They are cut off. They live in our com-munity. Where are they going to go?What will this bill do to help them?This bill goes on. It hurts the peoplein our neighborhoods, people who go toschool with our children. What can wedo with a bill that hurts children, thathurts the disabled, that hurts the el-derly? In the Congress of the richestNation in the world, what we can do isvote \"no\" on this bill and say we cando a better job.We want welfare reform, but a wel-fare reform bill that just plows theproblem on the community is not re-form at all. I ask for a \"no' vote.Mr. Speaker, I insert the followingmaterial for the RECORD:COUNTY OFSANTA CRUZ.HEALTH SERVICES AGENcY,SantaCruz, denyingeligibilityfor federal pro-grams legal immigrants.Hon. House of Representatives. Washington, DC.DEARCO.iGREssMANFARR: On behalf ofSanta Cruz County. we are asking for yourassistance and intervention in deleting fromH.R. 3507 and 5. 1795, requirements whichdeny eligibility for federal programs to legalimmigrants. These two bills are moving for-ward under the heading of welfare reformand in their present form, are expected tosave the Federal government $23 billion overseven years. At least $9 billion of this totalwould be achieved by eliminating services tolegal immigrants in California. Santa CruzCounty with less than 1% of the states popu-lation, because of its population history. de-pendence on agriculture and demographics.expects an adverse financial impact far inexcess of its population share.While the federal budget will experiencesome relief, the budgets of local govern-ments, especially over-taxed budgets such asSanta Cruz's.willbe severely impacted.These important issues demand thoughtful.coordinated planning and implementation toassure the least negative impact on thosetaxpayers who fund local government sex-v-ices and those residents who look to localgovernment for care.H9409These two legislative proposals, regardlessof their noble intent, will savage local gov-ernment and cause severe personal and soci-etal disruption, For these reasons, we urgethat you oppose these measures as long asthey contain these unacceptable provisionswhich deny eligibility for FAJu: We are writ-mg to convey major concerns raised by themost recent proposed welfare legislation cur-rently being considered by CongreSs.SERVICESFOR ACED AND DISABLED LEGALIMMIGRANTSDenying Federal benefits to legal immi-grants disproportionately harms Californiacommunities. Over 230,000 non.citizen legalimmigrants currently receive SSI in Califor-nia, excluding refugees. This aid is providedto the aged. blind and disabled, who couldnot support themselves by going to work iftheir SSI benefits ended. Under H.R. 3507.SSI and Food Stamps would be denied tonon-citizens already legally residing in Cali-fornia as well as to new legal entrants, un-like the inmigration reform legislation cur-rentlyunder considerationinCongress. which permits continued benefits for exist-ing legal residents.The proposed bar on 551 and Food Stampsfor all legal immigrants, and the denial ofother Federal means-testel programs to newlegal entrants for their first five years in thecountry would have a devastating effect onCalifornia's counties, which are obligated tobe the providers of last resort. It is estimated that these proposed changes would re-sult in costs of $9 billion to California'scounties over a seven-year period. At a mini-mum, the very elderly, those too disabled tobecome citizens and those who become dis-abled after they arrive inthis country should be exempted from the prohibition onSSI\u2014if for no other reason than to lessen tocounties the indefensible cost of shiftingcare from the Federal government to localtaxpayers for a needy population admittedunder U.S. immigration laws.PROTECTION OF CHILDRENWhile we agree that welfare dependenceshould not be encouraged as a way of life, itis essential in setting time limits on aid thatadequate protections be provided for chil-dren once parents hit these time limits.Some provision must be made for vouchersor some other mechanism by which the essential survival needs of children such asfood can be met. The Administration hassuggested this sort of approach as a means ofensuring adequate protection for childrenwhose parents hit time limits on aid.California's child poverty rate was 27 per-centfor1992 through1994,substantially above the national rate of 21 percent. H.R. 4,which was vetoed by the President. wouldhave caused an additional 1.5 million chil-dren to become poor. Though estimates havenot been produced for HR. 3507. it is likelythat it also would result in a significant ad-ditional number of children falling below thepoverty level.ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR CHILD CAREFunds provided for child care are essentialto meet the needs of parents entering the 'H9410 State option tobarcurrentStates maynutdisaimbiatelegal SSLFamily-based immigrants).

Mr. Speaker, I yield I minute to the distinguished geotlemanfrom California [Mr. RIGGS].Mr. RIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank thegentleman for yielding me ths timeand for his hard work on this very his-toric and very important legislation.This legislation curtails food stampfraud, it limits the access of iesidentaliens to welfare programs, which justmight persuade some visitors to ourcountry who did not come here o workto return home, but, more importantly,it is another step in the proces of de-volving or sending social servics backto the States and getting contrbl backin the hands of local managers who arecloser to the problems of the poor.It addresses a fundamental fairnessissue in American society, and that isthe resentment of working indi1vidualstowardable-bodiedindividuals whorefuse to get off the dole. Most impor-tantly, in my mind, it addre$es theproblem of welfare dependen4y andwelfare pathologyinthiscountry. which has soaring rates of familydisintegration, illegitimacy in Amer-icansociety,andtheothercon- sequences, like youth crime.This is indeed an historic day in thisbody and a very, very important pieceof legislation, in my view the mst im-portant legislation we will enac in the104thCongress.01615Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker. 1 yieldmyself 1 minute.Mr. Speaker, let me say firs9 of allthat there are some good things in thislegislation that could have and shouldhave become law without being tied tothe rest of this fundamentally flawedpackage. The President has made amistake in endorsing this legislationand the Congress will make a mistakein passing it.Essentially. Mr. Speaker, this legis-lation reduces assets that we need tohelp those who are the most vulnerablein our society. Seventy percent of allthe people on welfare are infants andchildren. The rest are so disabled oneway or another, and they cannot makea go of it. This bill reduces their assets.reduces the assets of the people who weare trying to help to improve and bet-ter their situation.For some reason that we do not thor-oughly understand, the bottom three-fifths of all the people in the UnitedStates have not made any progress inthe last 20 years. economically speak-ing. The bottom one-fifth have lost 18percent of their resources that areavailable to-them. This bill further ex-acerbates that problem and will hurtinfants and children. It should not be-come law. It should be vetoed.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I yield 1\u00bdminutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Connecticut [Mr. SIIAYS].a member of the Committee on theBudget.Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I thank thegentleman for yielding.Mr. Speaker, politicians are electedby adults to represent the children. Weneed to save our children from crip-pling national debt. Government debt.We need to make sure that our trustfunds, like Medicare, are there for ourchildren. And most importantly, weneed to enable, we need to help ourchildren become independent citizensof this great and magnificent country.This bill helps to transform our care-taking, social and corporate welfarestate into a caring opportunity society.I extend tremendous admiration tothegentlemanfromFlorida.[Mr. SHAW] for not giving into those whowanted to weaken the bill so that itwould end up not doing anything. Wehave a caring bill that does this. In thefinal analysis. it is not what you do foryour childrenbut what you havetaught them to do for themselves thatwillmake them successful humanbeings.It ends this caretaking society andmoves toward a caring society wherewe teach our children and the adultswho raise our children how to grow theseeds, how to have the food.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker. I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from NewYork [Mr. RANGEL].(Mr. RANGEL asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. RANGEL. Mr.Speaker, whattime is it? It is time for us to get onwith our conventions. We better get onwith the Democratic Convention andRepublican Convention. What do wewant to say that we are for? Reform.What is a nagging sore in everyone'sproblem? Welfare. People who do notwork.What is the bill all about? Well, thebill is supposed to be to protect chil-dren.

There is nothing to tell theGovernors what to do. and they will bethe losers in the long run, but not asbad as the children. They can do whatthey want with immigrants and withlittle kids because for 60 years we havesaid there is a safety net for children.But not before this election.Who won? Bob Dole? Oh. yes. he saidit already. He shoved this one down thePresidents throat. Three strikes andthe President would have been out sohe wins because what the heck, heforced the issue.And whoisanother winner? MyPresident. He is a winner. He has re-moved this once again. Everything youcome up with, my President says. oh.no you do not. And so here again he isa winner.So when we look at it, this is a bigpolitical victory. The Democrats arehappy in the White House. The Repub-licans are happy because they madehim do it. The Governors are happy.They begged for the opportunity to doit their way after all. They are closerto the problem. And the only losers wehave now are the kids.The got no one there to protectthem. The religious leaders came out.Obviously they are not as highly reg-istered as some other people, but theysaid do not do this to our children.They' are the weakest. They cannotvote. If my colleagues do not like theirmothers and their fathers and theirneighborhoods, then get involved ineducation and job training and makethem work. But there are winners andlosers and the kids are the losers.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I yield 3minutestothedistinguishedgen- tleman from Texas [Mr. ARCHER]. thedistinguished chairman of the Commit-tee on Ways and Means.Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman for yielding.Mr. Speaker. the only way we canchange people's behavior is by chang-ing the system. Franklin Rooseveltwarned that giving permanent aid toanyone destroys them. By creating aculture of poverty and a culture of vio-lence, we have destroyed the very peo-ple we are claiming to help. Can anyserious person of poverty by $5 trillion on welfare. more thanwe have spent on all the wars that wehave fought in this century. And wehave lost the war on poverty. With thisbill. we can begin to win the war.We need to come to the realizationthat dollars alone will not solve theproblem. We need to give unemployedpeople hope and equip them for work sothey will be better able to help them-selves. As our colleague. the gentlemanfrom Oklahoma, J.C. WATTS. says, theyare eagles waiting to soar.Today we will ask those now receiv-ing welfare to make a deal with theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtaxpayer. We will provide you withtemporary help to get you through thehard times and we will help you feedyour family and get the training youneed, and in exchange. we ask that youcommit yourself to find a job and moveback into the economy.I am pleased to see that the Presi-dent has finally agreed tojoin us in ourfight to overhaul the broken-down wel-fare system. It has been a long, ardu-ousroadsince1988whenRonaldReagan first made the effort to dosomething about work fare and finallywe are here.Mr. President, the poor have sufferedlong enough and now we have the op-portunity to change it all and help thehard-working taxpayers as well.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut [Mrs. KENNELLY].Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, weall can be proud of the record thatmany of us have in working on this billto protect children. Eight months agowe had a welfare conference report onthe floor that would have blocked fos-ter care or would have made foster carea block grant. and also food stamps.Today's legislation retains the Federalguarantee for these services.Eight months ago we had Federalwelfare legislation on this floor thatwould have cut severely disabled chil-dren by 25 percent. Today we do nothave that flawed two-tiered system.Eight months ago we considered leg-islation that would have denied mil-lions of Americans Medicaid becausethey lost welfare eligibility. Today'slegislation, the legislation before us,guarantees continual health coveragefor those who are currently entitled tothese services.Eight months ago we voted on legis-lation that would have underfundedchild care. This bill has $4.5 billion init for child care.I am not suggesting the legislation isperfect. Most legislation is not perfect.But I predict we will be back on thisvery floor finding more answers andbetter answers than we have today. Ifthat is there, I will be involved in thesechanges. But today we have to decide ifthis legislation as a whole representsan improvement over the status quo.My answer is: Yes. it does.While some of the changes here beingsuggested pose risks, so does the cur-.rent system. Welfare is clearly broken,offering more dependence than oppor-tunity. We can vote today to at leastbegin to transform the welfare system.Today we can begin welfare reform,those of us who have worked hard overthe months to make the bill, workingwith those who have had the bill. Wenow have the bill. We should vote forthe bill and get on with welfare reform.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker. I yield 2minutes to the gentleman from Texas[Mr. DELAYJ, the distinguished Repub-lican whip.Mr. DELAY. Mr. Speaker. I am verypleased to hear that President Clintonhas endorsed the welfare bill that willJuly31, 1996pass the House today. Clearly. the timehas come to end welfare as we know it.The welfare system as we know it hasbeen a disaster. The only thing greatabout the Great Society was the greatharm it has caused our children.With this bill, Mr. Speaker. we makecommonsense changes long requestedby the American people.Common sense dictates that able-bodied people work.Common sensedictates that onlyAmericans should receive welfare bene-fits in this country.Common sense dictates that incen-tives to keep families together.Common sense dictates that welfareshould not be a way of life.Now liberal Democrats will vainlychallenge these simple truths, and eventhe President could not help himselfand has challenged some of these truths, but time and experience hasproven them wrong. Welfare has notworked for the people it was supposedto help. Everybody knows that fact.Now is the time to change that system.Some well-meaning people will onceagain make the claim that welfare re-form is mean-spirited. Well, I disagree.We reform welfare not out of spitebut out of compassion. We change thissystem not because we want to hurtpeople, but because we want to helppeople help themselves. And we changethis system not to throw children intothestreets, but to give children agreater chance to realize the Americandream and still maintain a safety netfor those truly in need.Mr. Speaker. I am proud of this Con-gress for the great work on this his-toric legislation. and I am pleased thatPresident Clinton has agreed to finallylive up to his campaign promise.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield Iminute to the gentleman from NewYork [Mr. NADLER].(Mr. NADLER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, sadly, itseems clear that this House today willabdicate its moral duty and knowinglyvote to allow children to go hungry inAmerica. Sadly, our President, a mem-ber of the Democratic Party, the partyof Franklin Roosevelt and John Ken-nedy and Lyndon Johnson, will signthis bill.Doesthisbillallocatesufficientfunds to provide employment for peo-ple who want to work? No.Does this bill provide adequate childcare so parents can leave their childrenin a safe environment and earn a liv-ing? No.Does thisbillensure that peopleleaving welfare can take their kids to adoctor when they get sick?

No. July31, 1996Mr.Speaker.Iknowthat scapegoating poor children ispoliti- cally popular this year. but it is not right. We must stand up for ou coun-try's children. I urge my colleagues toreject this immoral legislation.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2minutes to the gentleman froxr Geor-gia [Mr. LEWIS].Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker.the bill we are considering today is abad bill.I willvoteagainst it and Iurge all people of conscience 1o voteagainst it. It is a bad bill becaus it pe-nalizes children for the actions f theirparents. This bill. Mr. Speaker, willput Imillion more children into pov-erty. How, how can any person of faith.of conscience vote for a bill tha puts amillion more kids into poverty. Whereis the compassion, where is the sense ofdecency, where is the heart of t1is Con-gress. This bill is mean, it is bae, it isdownright low down.We are a great nation. We put a manon the Moon. We have learned to flythrough the air like a bird and swimlike afishin the sea.

Mr. Speaker. the statusquo is gone.The current system does no meetthe American values of work, oppor-tunity, responsibility, and family.We have been wrestling for a longtime with what should replace i.The key always has been the 4inkageof welfare to work, within a cefinitetime structure, and with sensitivity toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEthe children of the parent who needs tobreak out of a cycle of dependency. forherlhis good, for the child's and for thetaxpayer.The challenge has been to find a newbalance, that combines State flexibil-ity with national interest.The first two bills vetoed by thePresident failed to address effectivelywork and dealt insensitively with chil-dren.If the AFDC entitlement was goingto be replaced by a block grant\u2014whichwasalreadybeginningtohappen through Federal waivers\u2014after the ve-toes we successfully pressured the Re-publican majority to make substantialimprovements in day care. health care,benefits for severely disabled childrenand to retain the basic structure of fos-ter care, food stamps and the schoollunch program.In a word, this is a different bill thanthose vetoed by the President.The bill before us is at its very weak-est in two areas essentially unrelatedto AFDC\u2014food stamps and legal mimi-grants. Reform was needed in theseareas, but surely not punishment nor amere search for dollars, as was true ofthe majority's approach.The question is whether the defectsin those areas should sink changes inour broken welfare system.On balance, I believe it is better toproceed today with reforms in the wel-fare system. with a commitment to re-turn on a near tomorrow to the defectsin this bill.I hope in the next session there willbe a Congress willing to address theselegitimateconcernswithPresident Clinton.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30seconds to the distinguished gentlemanfrom Louisiana [Mr. HAYES], a valuedmember of the Committee on Ways andMeans.Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, folks athome simply wonder if they can tellthe difference between a disabled vet-eran from a real war and someone whohas become disabled because of a fakewar on poverty, converting food stampsinto drugs. why cannot the Govern-ment. They want to know, if they cantell the difference between a youngwoman whose husband has walked outon them. leaving them a child with norecourse, and a teen who becomes preg-nant because of a system that rewardsit, why cannot the Government?Today this body answers that it cantell the difference. The Senate can tellthe difference. And I am very pleasedto understand that the President isgoing to sign the bill that allows peo-ple at home to at least know we havethatjudgment to make that difference,Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to thegentleman from Maryland [Mr. HOYER].(Mr. HOVER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise insupport of the bill.America'swelfare system is at odds with thecore values Americans believe in: Responsibil-H9413ity, work, opportunity, and family. Instead ofrewarding andencouragingwork, it does littletohelp people find jobs, andpenalizes thosewho go to work. Instead of strengthening fami-lies and instilling personal responsibility, thesystem penalizes two-parent families, and letstoo many absent parents off the hook.Insteadofpromotingself-sufficiency,theculture of welfare offices seems tocreateanexpectation order forwelfare reform to be successful, individualsmust accepttheresponsibility of working andproviding for their families.tn the instanceswhere benefits are provided, they must be tiedtoobhgations.Wemustinvest our resourcesonthose whovaluework andresponsibility.Moreover, we must Support strict requirementswhich move people from dependence to inde-pendence.

H9414Asrecently as last week, the House Repub-licanbilleliminated the guarantee of foodstamps for poor children and assistance forchildren who had been neglected or abused. Iam p?eased that thisbill prohthits the blockgrants which dismantle food stamp and childprotection assistance.Like many Americans, Icontinue to haveconcems about some of the provisions in thisbU. We must be certain that both the Federaland State govemments live up to their respon-sibilities to protect children who may lose as-sistance through no fault of their own.

The cuts in thisbill will diminish the quality of life ofchildren in poor families in Americaand will have a devastating impact onthe economy of our cities.Food and nutrition cuts will result inincreasedhunger.Localgovernmentwill be forced to pay for the FederalGovernment's abdicationofrespon-sibility. How can a country as great asAmerica ignore the needs of America'sinfants and children who are born intopoverty?The Bible tells us that to minister tothe needs of God's children is an act ofworship; to ignore those needs is to dis-honor theGodwho made them.Mr. Speaker, let us not go Mr. Speaker. I yieldsuch timeas hemayconsume to' thegentlemanfromNewYorklMr.TOWNS).(Mr.TOWNS and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, vote no onthis painandshame that we are inflict-ing on young people, a garbage bill.This agreement along with the other vetoedwelfare bills amount to nothing short of a rofl-call of pain and shame that will be dumped onthose Americans who are clearly in need of asocial service safety net.And to add to that pain, legal immigrants willbear 40 percent of the cuts in welfare eventhough they make up only 5 percent of thepopulation receiving welfare benefits.No one is satisfied with the way welfare pol-icy is constructed or practiced. The FederalGovemment doesn't like it; the local adminis-trators don't likeit; the social workers don'tlike it; the majority of the taxpayers don't likeit and the recipients don't like it. There is nodoubt that the welfare system in this countryneeds to be changed. Clearly reform is nec-essary. However, the overall scope of the pro-posed reforms will victimize those Americansmost in need of assistance.I urge a \"no\" vote on this conference agree-ment.Mr.GIBBONS. gentlewoman from Flor-ida [Ms. BROWN].Ms.BROWNofFlorida. Mr. Speaker.this was a bad House bill, a bad Senatebill and the conference report did notfix it. It is still bad.You can judge a great society by howit treats its children,its seniorciti- zens. This bill guts our future. I urgemy colleagues to vote against it.Mr. Speaker,Iriseto oppose this con-ference report. The House welfare reform billwas a bad bill, the Senate bill was a bad billand the conference report does not fix it. Thislegislation is so bad that it can't be fixed.This bill will have a horrible impact on thechildrenin my State.InHonda,atleast235,000 children would be denied benefitsunder this legislation. In Florida alone, 48,000would be pushed deeper into poverty. Childrenwill be hungrier if this bill becomes law.In Florida, 111,926 chi'dren would be deniedaid in the year 2005 because of the 5 yearJuly 31, 1996time limit. In Flonda, 42,714 babies would bedenied cash aid in the year 2000 becausethey were bom to families already on welfare.In the year 2000, 80,667 children in Flondawoutd be denied benefits if the State froze itsspending on cash assistance at the 1994 lev-els.In addition to the travesty this bill does toour children, this bill wiH pull the rug out fromunder our seniors -who are egal immigrants.For a State like Florida whose population hassuch a large number of legal immigrants, theimpact will be extremely high.There is another troubling aspect of this billwe need to look at No victim of domestic vio-lence, no matter how abused nor how des-perate, could know that if she left her abusivespouse, that she would be able to re'y uponcash assistance for herself or for her chil-dren\u2014even for a short period of time until shewas able to secure employment.Ihave always believed that the sign of agreat society is how well it treats its most vul-nerable\u2014children and seniors. Our childrenare America's future. This bill prevents the fu-ture generation from meeting its potential tocontribute to American society and insteaddooms today's poor children to deeper povertyand no chance to take their place as productive members of our society.Mr.SHAW.Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self 3 minutes.Mr. Speaker, I come over here to dosomething I have never done before;that is, to trespass on the Democratside.I hope that they will give metheirunderstandinginmydoing so, be-cause I do not do it out of smugness orarrogance. I do it out of coming to-gether.We have heard a lot of name calling.a lotofrhetoric, a lot of sound bitesthat we have heard all through this de-bate. We have come down a long roadtogether.It was inevitable that thepresent welfare system was going to beputbehindus.Today we need to bring to closure anera of a failed welfare system. I saythat and I say that from this side oftheaisle becauseI know that theDemocrats agree with the Republicans.This is not a Republican bill that weare shoving down your throats. We aregoingtogetalot of Democratic sup-porttoday.I thinkthe larger the sup-port, the more chance there is for thistoreally work and work well.The degree of the success that we aregoingto have isgoing to be a victoryforthe oneanotherandto cometogether tosolve the problemsofthe poor.Without vision, the wehave not had vi-sion inour welfaresystem nowformany.many years. It has been allowedto sit stagnant. We have piled layeruponlayerof humanity on top of each.other. We have paid people not to getmarried. We have paid people to havechildren out of marriage. We have paidpeople not to work.This is self-destructive behavior. Weknow that. 'We all agree with that. July31, know we have heard marIy, manyspeakers: My friend,the gnt1emanfrom Georgia.

And I canstand here and say it is not a perfectbill, but it is as good as this Congresscan do. It is as good as we can come to-gether.We have included the Govrnors inbalancing out their interests and inseeing what they have been successfulwith and how they feel that :they canbe successful. We have talked to manyof the Members on the Democtats' side.and to my Republican colleag.ies I say.we are not through. We hav4 anotherlong road ahead of us. We need to getto a technical corrections bill as we seeproblems arise within this bil that weare going to be passing today.It was unexpected to hear that thePresident was going to endorse this billand announced his signature \u00b6f it.

Ithink that ifwewould have startedworking together in a bipartisn spirit.we could have had a better b1l today.and we could have gotten here a littlebit sooner. But I thank the gentlemanvery much for the way in which he hasprovided leadership on this issue.I know it has been heartfelt, and I knowhe has worked very, very hard.01645Mr. Speaker. I support the conferencereport because I think it is ixnportantthat we return welfare to whet it wasoriginally intended to be. and that is atransitionaltemporary proramto help those people that are in reed. Thecurrent system does not do that. Wecannot defend the current system.But let me make it clear to, my col-leagues. the bill before us is far bet-ter bill than the bill that ws origi-nally brought forward by th Repub-licans 2 years ago, the bill that was ve-toed twice by the President. We have a better bill here today.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEIt is a bill that provides for majorimprovement in child support enforce-ment. something all of us agreed to;provides protective servicesfor our children, which was not in the originalbill: provides health insurance to peo-ple coming off of welfare, somethingthat is very important; day care serv-ices, another important ingredient thatpeople are going to get off welfare towork. Food stamps are in much bettercondition than the bill that was vetoedby the President. There is a Federalcontingency fund in case of a downturnof our economy, and we have mainte-nance of effort requirements on ourStates so we can assure that there arecertain minimum standards that aremet in protecting people in our society.The bottom line is that this bill isbetter than the current system.It could have been better, and I regret that. I am not sure there is enoughresources in this bill to make sure thatpeople get adequate education and jobtraining in order to find employment,and I look forward to working with thegentleman from Florida [Mr. SI-lAw] tomake sure that this becomes a reality.But I do urge my colleagues to sup-port the conference report because bot-tom line: It is far better than the cur-rent system.Yes, we are going to take a risk toget people off of welfare to work. butthe current system is not fair either tothe welfare recipient or the taxpayer.This conference report is far better,and I urge my colleagues to support it.Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield thebalance of my time to the distin-guished gentleman from Ohio [Mr. KA-SICHJ, chairman of the Committee onthe Budget.The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McINNIs) The gentleman from isrecognized for 5\u00be minutes.Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I wouldlike to congratulate the gen-tleman from Florida [Mr. SI-lAw] for hisrelentlessness in being able to pursuewelfare reform and he deserves thelion's share of the credit, along withthe gentleman from Texas [Mr. AR-CEJERI, who has done an outstandingjob. and although I do not see him onthe floor, our very able staff director,Ron Haskins, who has probably livedwith this bill for about a decade, feel-ing passionately about the need to re-form welfare.As my colleagues know, it was prettyamazing today to watch the Presidentof the United States come on televisionand say that he was going. in fact. tosign this welfare bill. The reason whyit is so amazing today is that becausethe American people, during all of myadult lifetime. have said that theywant a system that will help peoplewho cannot help themselves, but theywant a system that is going to ask theable-bodied to get out and begin towork themselves. This has been de-layed and put off, with a million ex-cuses as to why we could not get itdone.I just want to suggest to my friendswho are in opposition, and I respectH9415their opposition: many of them just didnot talk; many of them were not ableto talk, as they were beaten in the civilright protests in this country. I respecttheir opposition. But the simple fact ofthe matter is that this program waslosing public support.Mr. Speaker. the cynicism connectedto this program from the folks who getup and go to work every day for a liv-ing. and I do not mean the most fortu-nate, I mean those mothers and fatherswho have had to struggle for an entirelifetime to make ends meet, they havenever asked for food stamps, the havenever asked forwelfare. they havenever asked for housing, and they arestruggling. They are counting theirnickels. They do not take the bustransfer because it costs a little extramoney. and they walk instead so theycan save some more money to educatetheir children. These people were be-comingcynical,theywerebeing poisoned in regard to this system, andthey were demanding change.Mr. Speaker, we all know here. as wehave watched the Congress. the historyof Congress over the decades, thatwhen the American people speak, wemust deliver to them what they want.They said they wanted the Vietnamwar over. It took a decade. but theygot it, and public cynicism and lack ofsupport was rising against this pro-gram. It was necessary to give the peo-ple a program they could support.But I also want to say that the Amer-ican people have never, if I could be sobold as to represent a point of view,have never said that those who cannothelp themselves should not be helped.That is Judio-Christianity, somethingthat we all know has to be rekindled.Our souls must once again become at-tached to one another, and the peopleof this country and Judeo-Christianitysiad it is a sin not to help somebodywho needs help, but it is equally a sinto help somebody who needs to learnhow to help themselves.But I say to my friends who opposethis bill:This is about the best of us. This isabout having hopes and dreams. After40 or 50 years of not trusting one an-other in our neighborhoods and havingto vacate our power and our authoritytothecentral government, tothe Washington bureaucrats. this is nowabout reclaiming our power, it is aboutreclaiming our money, it is about re-claiming our authority. it is about re-building our community. it is about re-building our families, it is about ce-menting our neighborhoods, and it isabout believing that allof us canmarch to that State capitol. that all ofus can go into the community organi-zations and we can demand excellence,we can demand compassion, and thatwe can do it better.We marched 30. 40 years ago becausewe thought people were not beingtreated fairly. and we march today forthe very same reason. What I wouldsay, and maybe let me take it back andsay many of my friends marched. I was H94 16tooyoung. but I watched, and I respectit. What I would suggest at the end ofthe day, however, is that we all aregoing to have to stand up for those whoget neglected in reform, but franklythis system is going to provide farmore benefits, far more hope, restorethe confidence in the American peoplethat we have a system that will helpthose that cannot help themselves andat the same time demand somethingfrom able-bodied people who can. It will benefit their children, it will helpthe children of those who go to work.America isa winner inthis. ThePresident of the United States has rec-ognized that. He has joined with thisCongress, and I think we have a bipar-tisanefforthere to move Americadown the road towards reclaiming ourneighborhoods and helping America.And I would say to my friends, wewill be bold enough and humble enoughwhen we see that mistakes are beingmade, to be able to come back and fixthem; but let us not let these obstaclesstand in the way of rebuilding this pro-gram based on fundamental Americanvalues. Support the conference report.Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. Speaker, Irise in sup-port of this welfare reform conference report.This bill is far from perfect, but it does moveus down the road toward reforming the welfaresystem to help families in need.I have long advocated and agree with provi-sions requinng work and encouraging self-suf-ficiency and personal responsibility.Thislegislationis an improvement overmore extreme earlierbills.Itincludes nec-essary provisions which I and others fought forduring the last 2 years because they are im-portant to working families, children, and fast-growing states such as Texas. Itprovidessome transitionalhealth carebenefits andchild care assistance.Itretains the Federalguarantee and nutritional assist-ance for children.Iteliminates the Repub-licans' proposal to raise taxes on working fam-ilies by cutting the eamed income tax credit. Itprovide a safety net, albeit minimal, for highgrowth states such as Texas, Florida, andCalifornia and for recessions. Itlets Statesgive noncash vouchers to families whose wel-fare eligibility has expired, so they can buy es-sentials for children. None of these provisionswere contained in previous so-called welfarereform.While I am supporting this legislation, I amtroubled by the elimination of benefits for legalimmigrants who haveparticipatedintheworklorce and paid taxes. Harris County, TX,whichIrepresent, currently faces a measlesepidemic. Future prohibitions on Medicaid forsuch instances would result in the State andcounty facing tremendous cost increases. Ihave no doubt that Congress will be forced torevisit this issue in part at the behest of Statesas we may be creating huge unfunded man-dates. Unfortunately, while this bill containsmany positive reforms which I support, it alsocontains many misguided provisions for whichthe only motivation is monetary, not public p01-icy.Mrs.FOWLER. Mr. Speaker, the Americanwelfare system was intended to 'be a safetynet for those who fall on hard times. Unfortu-nately, it has become an overgrown bureauc-racy which perpetuates dependency and de-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEniespeople a real chance to live the Americandream.I am pleased that President Clinton has justannounced he would sign the Republican wel-fare bill. We knew that when it got this closeto the election, this President would choosethe path of political expediency, as he alwaysdoes.This legislation is not about saving money,it is about saving hope and saving lives, whilereforming a broken system and preserving thesafety net.Thebillencourages work and independ-ence, and discourages illegitimacy. Iurge mycolleagues to vote for fairness, compassion,and responsibility. Pass the conference agree-ment on H.R. 3437.Mrs. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, Istrongly support the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Actof 1996 (H.R.3734). This landmark piece of welfare reformlegislation emphasizes responsibility and com-passion. It provides a helping hand and not ahandout. Amencans today want a future filledwith hope. Parents want to be able to takecare of themselves and their children. Theywant to teach their kids how to take responsibility for their lives.Thislegislationreverses welfare as weknow it. Today, the average length of stay forfamilies on welfare in 13 years. The cycle ofdependency must stop.Congress' welfarereform legislation alsohas tough work requirements. Families mustwork within 2 years or lose their benefits.Work is the beginning of dignity and personalresponsibility. Single mothers who desire towork but cannot leave their children homealone will be provided with child care assist-ance. In fact, the Personal Responsibility andWork Opportunity Act provides $14 billion inguaranteed child care funding.Two parent families are encouraged throughthis plan. It takes two people to make a baby.Strong patemity requirements and tough childsupport measures ensure that deadbeat par-ents will take responsibility for their actions.This welfare reform package is estimated tosave the American taxpayers $56.2 billionover the next 6 years. Itis a balanced ap-proach that gives the States more autonomyand flexibility in crafting solutions. The Per-sonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Actprornotes work while also guaranteeing fami-lies adequate child care, medical care, andfood assistance. It is compassionate while pro-moting the dignity of Amencans through anhonest days work. Iurge my colleagues tosupport this bill.Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,I rise today to speak out against a great injus-tice,aninjusticethatisbeing committedagainst our Nation'schildren,defenseless,nonvoting, children, I am refening agreement on H.R. 3734, thePersonal ResponsibUity and Work OpportunityAct.We speak so often in this House about farmily values and protecting children. At the sametime however, my colleagues on the other sideof the aisle, have presented a welfare reformbill that will effectively eliminate the Federatguarantee of assistance for poor children inthis country for the first time in 60 years andwill push millions more children into poverty.A recent study by the Urban Institute esti-mated that the w&fare legislation passed bythe House would increase the number of chil-July 31, 1996dren in poverty by 1.1 million, or 12 percentThe analysis estimated that families on wel-fare would lose, on average, about $1,000 ayear once the billis fully implemented. Morethan a fifth of American families with childrenwould be affected by the legislation.This partisan legislation isantifamily andantichild. The Republican bill continues to beweak on work and hard on families. Withoutadequate funding for education, training, childcare and employment, most of our Nation'spoor will be unable to avoid or escape thewelfaretrap.Even before the adoption ofamendments increasing work in committee,the Congressional Budget Office [CBOJ esti-mated that the Republican proposal is some$9 billion short of what would be needed in fis-cal years 1999 through 2002 to provide ade-quate money for the States to carry out thework program.Furthermore, the increase in the minimumworkhoursrequirement,withoutacommemsurate increase in child care funding,will make it almost impossible for States toprovide child care for families making the tran-sition from welfare to work. True welfare re-form can never be achieved and welfare de-pendency will never be broken, unless we pro-vide adequate education, training, child care,and jobs that pay a living wage.I am particularly concerned that, like theHouse bill, the conference agreement prohibitsusing cash welfare block grant funds to pro-vide vouchers for children infamilies whohave been cut off from benefits because of the5-year limit. We must not abandon the chil-dren of families whose benefits are cut off. Wemust continue to ensure that they will be pro-vided for and not punished for the actions oftheir parents.Many more children will be hurt by the billsdenial of benefits to legal immigrants. Low-income lega! immigrants would be denied aidprovided under major programs such as SSIand food stamps. States would also have theoption of denying Medicaid tolegal immi-.grants. They would also be denied assistanceunder smaller programs such as meals-on-wheels to the homebound elderly and prenata!care for pregnant women. Under this bill, near-ly half a million current elderty and disabledbeneficiaries who are legal immigrants wouldbe terminated from the SSI Program. Similarly,the Congressional Budget Office estimatedthat under the House bill, which is similar totheconferenceagreement,approximately140,000 low-income legal immigrant childrenwho would be eligible for Medicaid under cur-rent law would be denied it under this legisla-tion. Most of these children are likely to haveflno other health insurance. I cannot be'ieve wewould pass legislation that would result ineven one more child being denied health carethat could prevent disease and illness.This bill also changes the guideline underwhich nonimmigrant children qualify for bene-fits under the SSI Program.As a result,the CBO estimates that by2002, some 315,000 low-income disabled chil-dren who would qualify for benefits under cur-rent law would be denied SSI. This represents22 percent of the children that would quahfyunder current law. The biD would reduce thetotal benefits the program provides to disabledchildren by more than $7 billion over 6 years.Mr.Speaker,mandatorywelfare-to-workprograms can get parent off welfare and intojobs, but only if the program is well designed July3l, 1996and is given the resources to be uccessfuI.The GOP bill is punitive and wronheaded. Itwill not put people to work, it will put them onthe street. Any restructuringof te welfaresystem must move people away frdm depend-ency toward Facilitating jobtraining,guaranteed child care, and health iflsurance atan affordable price.We cannot expect to reduce our welfarerollsif we do not provide the women of thisNation the opportunity to better \u00b6hemselvesand their families through job training and edu-cation,if we do not provide them' with goodquality child care and, most importantly, if wedo not provide them with a job.Together, welfare programs make up thesafety net that poor children and their familiesrely on in times of need. We must not allowthe safety net to be shredded. We must keepour promises to the children of this Nation. Wemust ensure that in times of need they receivethe health care, food, and generI servicesthey need to survive. I urge my coleagues tooppose this dangerous legislation and to liveup to our moral responsibility to help the poorhelp themselves.Mr. BLILEY. Mr. Speaker, it is wih pleasurethat I take this opportunity to address the wel-fare reform conference report before us today.This measure will do exactly what fts namepromises: promote personal resporsibility andwork opportunityfor disadvantaged Ameri-cans. More important,itwill replace the de-spar of welfare dependency with the pride ofindependence.This measure is critical to welfare reform ini-tiatives taking place in the States. In my State,the Virginia Independence Progra, has al-ready helped Iwo-thirds of all eligible welfarerecipients find meaningful jobs and restorehope to their lives.This legislation will enable Virgiria to con-tinueitshighly successfth statewide reformprogram. And it wiU allow other States to cre-ate similar initiatives\u2014without having to wastetime and money seeking a waive from theFederal Government.I am also proud of the role that the Com-merce Committee has played in crafting thislandmark initiative. Pdthough the Mdicaid re-form plan designed by the Nation's Republicanand Democrat Governors is not a part of thislegislation, the conference report dces includeimportant Medicaid provisions.In particular, the conference report guaran-tees continued coverage for all those who areeligible under the current AFDC Ffrogram. Italso ensures that eligible children Will not losethe health coverage they need. And it requiresadult recipients to comp'y with work require-ments in order to remain eligible fo Medicaidbenefits.Mr. Speaker,I would like to close by con-gratulating all those who helped to hape thishistoric measure. It deserves our ftll support.and it should be signed by the President.Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Speaker, today thisbody will take a large step in makin9 sweepingreform in our welfare system. By passing thewelfare reform agreement, we mov\u00f3 toward asystem that emphasizes work and independ-ence\u2014a new systemthatrepreentsrealchange and expanded opportunity. Althoughthis bill is not perfect, it is our best chance inyears to enact welfare reform that representsan opportunity to improve the curreit system.Sadly, our current system hurts the verypeople itis designed to protect by perpetuat-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEInga cycle of dependency. For those stuck onwelfare, the system is not working. It is clearthat we cannot and should not continue withthe status quo. The status quo has fosteredan entire culture of poverty. Our current sys-tem does little to help poor individuals movefrom welfare to work.It is clear the best antipoverty program is ajob. To that end, this bill encourages work. Itrequires welfare recipients to work after 2years and imposes a 5-year lifetime limit onwelfare benefits. The bill tums Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children [AFDC] into a blockgrant program, allowing States to create theirown unique welfare programs to best servetheir residents. The bill maintains health carebenefits for those currently receiving Medicaidbecause of their AFDC eligibility and provides$14 billion for child care so parents can go towork without worrying about the health andsafety of their children.In addftion, thisbillpreserves the eamed income tax credit whichhas been successful in helping working fami-lies.Mr. Speaker, I voted against the Republicanwelfare reformbill when it was before thisHouse. That bill represented a drastic depar-ture from the actual intent of welfare\u2014to helpthe most vulnerable in our society in their timeof need. The House bill eliminated the safetynet of Medicaid and food stamps for manychildren. It was mean in spirit and should nothave passed. The conference agreement thatis before us today, however, is much morereasonable. Children will have the guaranteeofhealth care coverage through Medicaideven as their parents transition to work. Fur-ther, unlike the House bill, States will not beable to opt out of the Federal Food StampProgram. The conference agreement is a farbetterbill than the measure passed by theHouse. It is a bold, yet compassionate step inhelping foster independence.I am pleased the President has indicated hewill sign this bill into law. I applaud the Presi-dent\u2014who has worked on this issue for years,even before it was politically fashionable\u2014forcontinuing to insist that the bill be improvedbefore signing it into law. While the Presidentand I agree that this bill is by no means per-fect,it is a good starting point We can be9inthe process of moving toward a system thatencourages and rewards work for all able-bod-ied citizens.Mr. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-tion to this antifamUy, antichidren bill. Thereare so many parts of this bill that should con-cern us.Icould stand here all day and de-scribe, in detail, how this bill falls short of ourshared goal of welfare reform.For example, consider the effects on ourNations most unfortunate children. I say un-fortunate because these children are beingsacrificed by election year politics simply be-cause they came from poor families. Their a-ready difficult 'iveswill be made impossibledue to food stamp reductions, loss of SSJ as-sistance, and no guarantee of Federal assist-ance when time runs out for them and theirfamilies. The effect will be to drown an addi-tional 1.1 million children in poverty.LikeIsaid,Icould go on and on. But, Iwon't waste your time discussing what we aDknow: that block grants aren't responsive to achanging economy and inadequate child-careprovisions make welfare-to-work a very difficultjourney. Iwill tell you what this so-cafled reform wiflmean to California, and how my State is beingH94 17asked to absorb 40 percent of the proposedcuts. Why? Because Califomia is home to thelargest immigrant population inour countryand this bill denies regal immigrants Federalassistance.It does not take much to do themath and understand the consequences of de-nying food stamps, supplemental security in-come, or Medicaid to our 'egal immigrant pop-ulation. There are no exceptions for childrenor the elderly, regardless of the situation.The needs of these taxpaying, legal resi-dents willnot vanish because the FederalGovernment looks the other way. The childrenwill still be hungry, the elderly will still get sick,and the disabled will stilt have special needs.Someone will have to provide these services,and ft will be our cities and counties who areforced to pick up the tab. And for California.the bill will be approximately $9 biflion over 7years.My district of Los Angeles County is hometosome 3millionforeign-bomresidents.County officials estimate that denying SSI to'egal immigrants could cost the county asmuch as $236 million per year in general reliefassistance. More importantly, this translatesinto no Federal assistance for the elderly ordisabled children.These costs would continue to rise with thelossof Medicaid coverage forlegal immi-grants. More than 830,000 legal immigrants inCalifornia wou'd lose Medicaid coverage, in-duding 286,000 children. persons millionto 7.4million.Under thisbill,these people would turn tocounty hospitals for care. And the costs of thatcare will be shifted-to local govemments al-ready operating on shoe string budgets. In LosAngeles County, this could mean as much as$240 million per year.To say this is unfair is an understatement.Legal residents, who play by the rules andcontribute over $90 billion a year in taxes, donot deserve this. They deserve what theyearn; to be treated with the same care andprovided with the same services enjoyed bythe rest of the tax-paying community.encourage my colleagues to oppose theseshort-sighted cuts and unfair rule changes:Say no to a bad deai and vote against this re-port.Mr. ORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased torise in support of this welfare reform bill. Icommend this Congress for creating a flexiblereform bill that will allow Utah and other inno-vative States to continue their successful wel-fare reform efforts.My greatest concerns during the course ofthe welfare reform debate have been to trans-form the system to a work-based system, toensure that States like Utah have the flexibilityto continue their successful reform efforts, andto protect innocent children.I have worked dill-gently with colleagues on both sides of theaisle to craft a billthat accomplishes thesegoals, and I arn pleased to say that Congresshas finally passed a bill that achieves them.I am extremely pleased that this bill containsa provision that allows Utah to continue itssuccessful welfare reform efforts. Under thebill that passed the House 2 weeks ago, Utahwould have had to change its program to meetthe restrictive Federal requirements containedin the bill. Moreover, CBO estimated that theeartierbillimposed $13 billionin unfundedcosts on States unless they restricted eligibilityor decreased assistance to those in need. H9418 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEBoth the National Governors' Association and tinuing the current system and preferable tothe State of Utah expressed concerns about welfare legislation considered earlier this Con-these unfunded costs.I worked with rnembersgress.

We wilt work to ensure that States willcontinue to have thisflexibility when theirwaivers expire if the State plan is successful.Anotherkeygoal we havemaintainedthroughout the debate is protecting innocentchildren. The earlier House bill would havetreated a 4-year-old child the same as a 24-year-old deadbeat by prohibiting States frornusing block grant funds to provide vouchersafter the tirne lirnit for benefits to the parentshad expired. The conference report reversesthis extreme position. Inaddition, the con-ference report rnoderates the irnpact of thefood stamp cuts on children by maintaing aguaranteed status for children and by increas-ing the housing deduction to $300 a month forfamilies with children.Third, we have been concerned about theimpact of health coverage to individuals andpayments to health providers as a result ofwelfarereform. The Housebilleffectivelywould have denied Medicaid to thousands ofindividuals, removing $9 billion of Medicaid as-sistance from the health care system and re-suiting in a cost shift to health care providersthat would affect the cost,availability, andquality of care of to everyone. While the cor-rection is less than we had hoped, the con-ference report effeclively reduces this costshift to health care providers by more thanhalf. The conference report also contains lan-guage very similar to the Castle-Tanner billcontinuing current Medicaid eligibility rules forAFOC-related populations, ensuring that noone loses health care coverage as a result ofwelfare reforrn.As we began by saying, this conference re-port is far frorn perfect and we continue tohave concerns about the irnpact of severalprovisions. Although the report provides Stateswith additional flexibility in irnplernenting workprograms, the work provisions in the bill stillmay impose unfunded rnandates on Statesthat will make it rnore difficult to rnove welfarerecipients to work. Given the unfunded rnan-datesinthebill,the provisions penalizingStates for failing to rneet participation rates byreducing funding to the State are counter-productive. The contingency fund in the con-ference report, while rnuch stronger than thecontingency fund in H.R. 4, will not be suffi-cient to respond to a severe national or re-gional recession.The conference report contains a require-ment that Congress review the irnpact of thebill 3 years. This review process will allowCongress to make a nurnber of changes thatwe feel certain will be necessary to fulfill suc-cessful welfare reform.Despite these reservations, we believe thatit is critical that welfare reform be enacted this.year. Failure to do so will signal yet anotherwasted opportunity to rnake critically needed July 31, 1996reforms.We should enact this conference re-port and fix the current system now, movingtoward a system that better promctes workand individuai responsibility.Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, as I was readingthe papers this momingnoticed some stonesthat daimed that this welfare reform proposalis not such a big change\u2014that its snificancehas been overrated. That aH sides ae comingto a consensus and it's not such a big dealafter all.In the short term, that's how it ma look. Butin the long term, we are making a furdamentaIchange to the status quo\u2014we've gore beyondquestioning the failed po'icies of the past\u2014weare implementing a whole new approach. Weare beginning to replace the welfare state withan opportunity society.Ideas have consequences and ad ideashave bad consequences. The Great Societyapproach may have been well-intentioned, butthe impact was tragic. We have dne dis-service to those who have failen int the wel-fare trap. The incentives have beenall wrongand the logic backward.We need a welfare system that saves fami-lies,rather than breaking them. nd thatswhat this bill does.Our welfare system has deprived people ofhope, diminished opportunity and destroyedlives. Go into our inner cities and you will finda generation fed on food stamps bi1d starvedof nurturing and hope.You'll met youngteens in their third pregnancy. You'll meet fa-therless children. You'll talk to sixth graderswho don't know how many inches are in afoot. And you'll talk to first-graders ,ho don'tknow their ABC's.It's time for Washington to learn from itspast mistakes. It's time to reform our welfaresystem, to encourage families to stay togetherand to put recipients back to work.That's what our plan does. Four years ago,President Clinton promised to end welfare aswe know it, andI am pleased that he hascommitted to sign our bill into law.Our plan calls for sweeping chili supportenforcement. We end welfare for tPiose whowon't cooperate on child support. We strength-en provisions to establish patemity. We forceyoung men to reaiize they will be required toprovide financial support for their children byrequiringStates to establish an utomatedState registry to track child support informa-tion.One of the key elements of our Welfare re-form bill is ending fraudulent welfare paymentsto pnsoners and illegalimmigrant\u2014saving$22 billion.Each year, millions of taxpayer dollars are il-legally sent to pnsoners in State andlocal jailsthrough the Supplemental Security IncomeProgram. In nfamois \"Free-way Killer\"William Bonin illegally collectedSSI benelits for San Quen-tin's death row.Thisbillremoves the Washingon-basedintermeddling and bureaucratic micr4manage-ment that has resulted in welfare programsthat build a welfare population but do not re-lieve the suffering of those who are poor. Wedo not want to maintain the poor, w want totransform them. That's exactly whth this billwou'd do.Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, today we will legislation to radically change oyr welfaresystem. We willhear the fun-damentalprinciples that should gcvem theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEwaywe help those truly in need. And while Iagree with those who say our welfare systemmust work better for the American people, weneed to remember that something much moreprofound than rhetoric is at stake.There is no denying that we should encour-age work and parental responsibility. And Ihave long argued that States and locaiitiescan deliver some services better than we canat the Federal level. But, there are also otherprinciples that we need to remember when wediscuss wetfare.We need to remember that the safety netfor vulnerable people is fundamentally impor-tant to our society. There has long been wide-spread support among Arnencans of all politi-cai views that the Govemment should helppeople who are too sick, too old or too youngtohelp themseIves\u2014particuarly when theydon't have families who can take care of them.This is why the safety net was developed inthe first place and has had the continued sup-port of Republicans such as Richard Nixonand Ronald Reagan as well as Democrats.I congratulate the Republican majority for itsattempts to reform welfare, but Ibelieve thislegislation fails in many ways. Simply labelingthis bill welfare reform cannot disguise the tactthat it shreds the national safety net for mu-lions of vulnerable people.The Urban Institute has estimated that 1.1million children will be pushed into poverty be-cause of this legislation. More than a fifth ofAmerican families with children wifl be hurt byit. They also note that aimost haif of the fami-lies affected by this bill are already employed.The provision to cut off food stamps after 3months for unemployed people without de-pendents is unprecedented and unnecessarilyharsh. These are some of the most vulnerablepeople in our country. Under this measure,even if they are trying to find work, if theydon't succeed they will go hungry.And, personally, I find the treatment of legalimmigrants mystifying. My parents were immi-grants. They, like many others, came to thiscountry, worked hard, and contributed to theircommunity. Today's immigrants are no dif-ferent. They come to this country, they workhard, and they pay taxes.If they should failupon hard times, why shouldn't we help themjust like we help each other? Under the termsof thisbill we aren't allowed to help them.They lose food stamps and SSI even if theyhave been paying taxes and living legally inthis country for years. And new immigrants willbe denied Medicaid.Equally as disturbing as this bill's reductionin its Federal commftment to a nationai safetynet is the pressure it puts on States to reducetheir commitments to help vulnerable people.The reduction in State match set by the billand the flexibility to shift 30 percent of basicblock grant moneys to other uses will exacer-bate pressures within State governments topulltheir own resources out of these pro-grams. That combined with the cuts tn Federaldollars will lead to a sharp reduction in re-sources available for needed services andbenefits.The logical end result of au these inter-actions is significant cost-shifting to local gov-ernments. Because of the deep cut in Federalresources and potential reductions in Statesupport, localities will need to spend more oftheir own funds to help move people from wel-fare to work and to provide needed serviceswhile that process is occurring. Many local of-H9419ficials induding the Republican mayor of NewYork, Rudolph Giuliani, have expressed aiarmat the hundreds of millions of dollars in addi-tional costs their cities and residents will haveto bear. Clearly, this will mean higher propertytaxes for working families all over the country.We should reform our welfare system. Butwe must do itin a way that does not simpcyshift costs and that does not abandon thesafety net for people who are truly in need.Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this bill badly failsthat test and Amenca will be the worse for it.We can and should do better.Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I condemn both theprocess and the substance of the Republicanconference agreement onwelfare. As the104th Congress draws to a close, the Repub-lican majority has not wavered from its auto-cratic role of this institution nor from its viciousindifference to our Nation's poor and infirm.Like my other Democratic cofleagues, I wassystematically denied any meaningful role onthat conference. The time and location of con-ference negotiations have been a closely-h&dsecret among Republicans. This most anti-democratic process is an affront to the peopleof the 1st Congressionai District of Missouriwho send me here to represent their concernson au matters of political discourse. Time andtime again, this new Republican majority hasinterfered with my ability to fully represent theinterests of my constituents.As a matter of policy and substance, thisconference report is an evil charade. From theoutset,Ihad little expectation that the finalproduct of the conference would mean reason-able, viable, and compassionate welfare re-form. After all, both the House and Senate biHcontained unreaiistic work requirements, woe-ful funding for meaningful workfare, and thevery rea' nsk of throwing millions of childreninto poverty.The Republican majority has no real interestin truly reforming welfare. Then real objectiveis to steal $60 billion from antipoverty andantihunger programs in order to help financetheir tax cuts and other gifts to the wealthy\u2014Robin Hood in reverse. I can think of no moredesperate, shameful act than to use the poor,especially children and the elderly, in a gameof polftical chicken.Mr. Speaker,I cannot in good consciencesupport a welfare reform bill that will punishthose who, through no fault of their own, musttum to their Govemment for help in times ofneed.Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, Iproudlyrise to support the conference report for H.R.3734, the Personai Responsibility and WorkOpportunity Act.As chairman of the House Subcommittee onEarly Childhood, Youth and Families, as aformer teacher and coach, and as a dad, I un-derstand the need to take into account theneeds and interests of children. I cannot imag-ine a policy that is crueler to children than thecurrent welfare system. Certainly it was bomof the good intention to help the poor. But inthe name of compassion, we have unleashedan unmitigated disaster upon America. To-day's welfare system rewards and encouragesthe destruction of families, and childbirth out ofwedlock. It penalizes work and leaming. It poi-sons our communfties and our country withgeneration after generation of welfare depend-ency.It robs human beings of hope and lifeand any opportunities at the Amencan Dream.n the name of compassion, and with goodintentions, the welfare status quo is mean and H9420extremeto children. It is mean and extreme tofamilies.Itis mean and extreme to the hard-working Americans who foot the bill.Thus, without a doubt, we must replace thismean, extreme, and failed system of welfaredependency with work, hope, and opportunity.We can and must do better as Amencans.And we will, by adopting thss compassionate,histonc 'egislation.Our measure makes welfare a way up, nota way of life.ft replaces Washington-knows-best with local control and responsibility. It re-places a system that rewards illegitimacy anddestroys families, with a family-friendly fightingchance at the American Dream.Now, President Clinton promised in his 1992campaign to end welfare as we know it. Healso made several other promises, includingstarting hs administration with middle classtax rehef. Unfortunately, the President has notkept his promises. He raised taxes. And twice,he has vetoed legislation tofulfillhis ownpromise to end welfare. The President whopledged to end welfare as we know it hastwice vetoed legislation to end welfare for ille-gal aliens.Let me speak for a moment about illegalaliens.Illegalimmigrationisbreakingourtreasury,burdeningCaflfomia,andtryingAmerica's patience. It is wrong for our welfaresystem to provide lavish benefits for personsn America in violation of our laws.I am proud that the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Act ends welfare for il-legal aliens.It ends eligibility for Govemmentprograms for illegal aliens.It ends the tax-payer-funded red carpet for illegal aliens. Ourplan is to send a clear message to those whojump our borders, violate our laws, and residein America illegally: Go home. Stop freeload-ing off of hard-working American taxpayers.Let me address the matter of legal immi-grants. America is a beacon of hope and op-portunity for the world. That is why we con-tinue to have the most generous system oflegal immigration that history has ever known.It is in America's interest to invite those whowant to work for a better life, and have a fight-ing chance at the American Dream. But wewill not support those who come to America tobe dependent upon our social safetynet.Thus, our legislation places priority on helpingAmerican citizens first, and represents the val-ues held by Americans.For we are determined to liberate familiesfrom welfare dependency and get them workand a chance at the American Dream. We un-derstand that for many single parents, childcare can make the difference between beingable to work or not. That's why or bill providesmore and better child care, with less bureauc-racy and redtape, and more choices and re-sources for parents striving for a better life.Here are the facts: This conference reportprovides $22billionforchildcare over 7years. That amounts to $4.5 billion over cur-rent law, and $1.7 billion more than PresidentClinton's plan recommends. And we dramati-cally increase resources for child care qualityimprovement. By investing inqualitychildcare, we provide more families the opportunityto be free from welfare dependency and tostrive for the American Dream.In the end, this blI is what is about the bestof America. We are a compassionate people,united by common ideals of freedom and op-portunity. The great glory of this land of oppor-tunityistheAmericanDream.FamiliesCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtrappedby welfare, and especially their chil-dren, have had this dream deferred. We cando better. And we do, through this legislation,because this is America. I urge the adoption ofthe conference report on H.R. 3734.Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like tojoin in supporting the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of1996. As representatives of the people, we donot get as many opportunities as we wouldlike to do something that will truly help im-prove the lives of the people we serve.This bill presents us with just such an op-portunity.The landmark welfare reform plan before ustoday will bring education, training, and jobs tolow-income Americans. It will replace welfaredependence with economic self-reliance. Andit will create more hopeful futures for the chil-dren of participants.This conference report is more than just aprescription for much-needed welfare reform.It is what I hope will be the first step in our bi-partisan efforts to improve the public assist-ance programs on which disadvantaged fami-lies depend.Last February, the Nation's Republican andDemocrat Governors unanimous'y endorsedwelfare and Medicaid reform plans. And al-though the conference report before us todaywill give States the tools they need to improvetheir public assistance programs, our work isnot done.After aD, welfare as we know it means morethan AFDC. ft includes food stamps, housing,assistance, and energy assistance. And it in-cludes medical assistance.That's right\u2014for millions of Americans, Med-icaid is welfare. That is because income as-sistance alone is not sufficient to meet thepressing needs of disadvantaged families.For States, too, Medicaid is welfare. In fact,it makes up the largest share of State publicassistance funding. As a share of State budg-ets, Medicaid is four times larger than AFDC.If President Clinton does the right thing andsigns this welfare reform bill into law, Medicaidwill still be caught up in the choking bureau-cratic redtape of Federal control. That is whythe Medicaid program must be restructured ifStates are to fully succeed in making publicassistance programs more responsive and ef-fective.I commend my colleagues on both sides ofthe aisle for their commitment to true welfarereform. And Ilook forward to continuing ourefforts to making all sources of public assist-ance work better for those who need a helpinghand up.Thank you.Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, today's vote isabout change. Today we begin the move froma status quo that no one approves of to a re-formed and improved welfare system. Our cur-rent welfare system traps too many families ina cycle of dependency and does little to en-courage or help such individuals find employ-ment. Both welfare recipients and taxpayerslose if the status quo is maintained. Ihave repeatedly stated that meaningfulwelfare reform should move recipients to workand protect children. Just 2 weeks ago, I sup-ported a bipartisan welfare plan, authored byRepublican Representative Michael Castle andDemocraticRepresentativeJohnTanner,which I believe met these goals.The conference agreement on H.R. 3734 isnot perfect, but it is a good first step into anJuly 31, 1996era of necessary welfare reform. This legisla-tion contains many useful and necessary im-provements over the previous welfare propos-als put forth by the Republican majonty. Infact, this legislation has moved several stepscloser to the Castle-Tanner bill.The agreement ensures that low-incomemothers and children retain their Medicaid eli-gibility; provides increased child care funding;removes the optional food stamp block grant;removes the adoption and foster care blockgrant; and allows States to use a portion oftheir Federal funding to provide assistance tochildren whose families have been cut off wel-fare because of the 5-year time limit.While thislegislation attempts toprotectchildren from the shortcomings and failures oftheir parents, it does not fulfill all of my goalsfor welfare reform. I am concemed that H.R.3734 failsto provide adequate Federal re-sources for States to implement work pro-grams, nor does it contain adequate resourcesfor States and individuals in the event of a se-vere recession.Inaddition, the legislation makes cuts infood stamps for unemployed individuals willingto work and contains legal immigrant provi-sions that will deny access by legal immigrantchildren to SS!, food stamps, and other bene-fits. These concerns should be rectified by thisand subsequent Congresses. I am committedtorealizingthisgoal, and therefore, Iampleased that the President plans to proposelegislation to repeal many of these provisions.Furthermore, several States are currentlyworking on plans to reform their welfare re-form systems. We must ensure that these ef-forts are accommodated bythis legislation.This is the first Repubbcan proposal whichadequately acknowledges the need to protectchildren, while emphasizing work. Rhode Is-land, through the work of a coalition of Stateofficials,businessleaders,andadvocacygroups, has crafted a welfare reform plan thatalso accomplishes these goals. Should H.R.3734 prove detrimental to Rhode Island or thechildren of Rhode Island, Iwill work to makenecessary changes to further strengthen theNation's welfare reform efforts.Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, Iriseinstrong support of this conference report. De-spite the slanderous accusations by the advo-cates of the current welfare state, our welfarereform plan is compassionate and humane,two adjectives rarely used to describe the cur-rent welfare program.Our welfare reform plan ends weliare as away of life and gives back welfare recipientstheirself-worth.Byreplacingwelfarewithwork, current recipients will reatize that theyhave talents in which to make a productiveand self-reliant life. They are so used to thegovemment providing for them that they neverbelieved they could provide for themselvesand their families.We know this transition isn't going to be.easy; nothing worth having is easy. That iswhy our welfare reform plan continues govern-ment assistance as long as they are making agood-faith effort to be a productive member ofsociety.We separate from bona fide eligible welfarecandidates those who have been convicted ofa felony or those that refuse to become citi-zens. For too ?ong, those that have been try-ing to make their own way but are suppressedby the big thumb of govemment have beenrepresented by those welfare recipients that July31, 1996makethe headlines. By denying convicted fel-ons and noncitizens taxpayer-funded assist-ance we take away the scourge previous'y as-sociated with all we'fare benefits. We create anew benevolent programandtherefore a posi-tive and refreshing atmosphere for its recipi-ents.Along with increased sense of self-worththat necessarily comes with a pay check thatisn't a donation comes a greater sense of per-sonal responsibility. Our reform pronotes se'f-responsibility in an attempt to half riing illegit-imacy rates. Once we diminish ilIegiimacy wecan truly end the cycle of dependeny createdby our current welfare state.As a condition for benefit eligibility, a mothermust identify the father. This will ensure thatsingle parents get the support they need andremind fathers that their children is their re-spon sibiIitj, not the State's.Our welfare reform plan gives power andflexibility back to the States. I think this is theprovision that gives the proponents of the cur-rent welfare state the most heartbum. Theblock grants give the power and flexibility onceenjoyed by big government advocates to ourNation'sGovernors andState leislatures.Non longer will Washington power brokers beable to dictate who gets and how nuch theyget. Rather, those who know the solutions fortheir unique challenges won't have t wait forbureaucratic approval to put their prgrams inaction.Mr. Speaker, not only is this reform plan his-tonc, ii is futuristic. This plan ends welfare aswe know it and helps us see a society whichencourages all of us members to be produc-tive and self-reliant.Mr. FRANKS of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker,this welfare reform conference bill brings usone step ctoser to fixing a welfare system thathas been broken and in need of major repairs.We have had a welfare system that hascaused generations of American citizens tolive in poverty and become consuned by acondilion of hopelessness and depair.

What we have here is a rush to thefloor. We're told an agreement on a con-ference committee report to H.R. 3734 wasmade near midnight last night. I haven't seenthe conference report and don't know what'sin the conference agreement. I read what's inthe National Joumal's Congress Daily/A.M.editionandtheCongressionalQuarterly'sHouseActionReportsConference Sum-mary.\" The Congressional Quarterly ActionReportindudesthedisclaimerthattheyhaven't seen the conference agreement reporteither, but prepared a moming briefing any-way, using information provided by committeestaff. Well, excuse me.I don't consider it appropriate to rely only onsome nebulous statement written by someonewho hasn't read the report before casting myvote on behalf of my constituents. I want tohave a copy of the legislation available andthat's why we have the rule that we don't voteon a conference agreement the same day illsreported.In my 23 years in the Congress, Ihavebeen accustomed to reading and studying leg-islation before I cast my vote on behalf of theSeventh District ofIllinois, a responsibility Itake vety seriously. The House has rules gov-eming debate, rules designed to keep us fromrushing to judgment. Those rules dictate thatwe don't vote on conference reports the sameday they are filed so that we have tirne tostudy the provisions. That's why there is atwo-thirds majority vote requirement to over-tum that rule.So why are we being asked to waive thetime requirement and go immediately to a voteon this conference report? We are told we willhave 1 hour of debate on the rule that will giveus 1 hour of debate to consider a special ruletowaivethetwo-thirdsvoterequirement.Why? Because once again the Gingrich Re-publicans are trying to force legislation throughthe process without adhering to the safe-guards established to protect the Americanpeople and the legislative process.object to this rule and urge my colleaguesto defeat thisrule so that America has achance to look at what we are being asked toapprove as new changes, major revisions real-ly,in the provisions and control of public as-sistance programs that provide a safety net forthe needy and vulnerable among us. I owe itto my constituents to study legislation andweigh the measure before casting my vote forthem. Let's get back to reasoned debate, let'sfollow the rules, just like we are going to askthe recipients of the benefils provided or de-nied under this bill to follow. Let's stop chiang-ing the rules asitsuits the desires of theGingrich Republicans. I urge my colleagues todefeat this motion to change the rules. I yieldback the balance of my time.Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there isperhaps no more urgent issue in Americatoday than ending welfare dependency.In place of a welfare program built aroundwelfare checks, we need a program builtaround helping people get paychecks. Weneed to move people toward work and inde-pendence. And we need to be tough on workand protective of children.H9421When the work on welfare reform startedlast year, the Republican proposals were weakon work, tough on kids, and the President wasright to veto them.Unfortunately, the bill before us today, whilea significant improvement on the earlier ver-sions, still falls short in both regards.On work, the bill is, in fact, too weak, for itunderfunds employment assistance by $13 bil-'ion. According to the Congressional BudgetOffice, a $13 billionshortfallis a guaranteethat no State can meet the employment re-quirements in this bill. So we have missed anopportunity to make these poor families sell-supporting.On children, the bill is, in fact, too weak inits child care provisions; il is too harsh in themanner children are punished for the failuresof their parents; and it is far too extreme in itspotential to push an additional 1million chil-dren into poverty.Iam also deeply concemed by the fun-damental premise of this legislation. There aremany Governors, in many States, who todayare sincerely committed to using a welfareblock grant to raise the well-being and qualityof life of people within their States. And aslisten to them, I hear a haunting echo of a sit-uation which occurred some years ago whenmany well-intended State legislators, myselfincluded, voted to transition the mental'y ill inOregon into mainstream society. The conceptseemed solid,as thewelfareblock grant seems to many Govemors. But when the1980's recession hit Oregon, the commilmentswe made to the mentally ill\u2014similar in somany ways to the commitment the Govemorstoday are making to their welfare recipients\u2014simply came undone. And today, many yearslater, the mentally ill of Oregon still live on thestreets, and Oregon's neighborhoods and localgovemments are struggling under the burdenof serving this neglected population.This, Mr. Speaker, is what Ifear we facewhen the next recession rumbles through thisland. When times get tough, and resourcesgrow scarce, and the contingency funds aredrawn down, who will be hurt the most? Willft be our schools? Our ports? Our highwayfunds? Our economic competitiveness pro-grams? Or willit be those who are strugglingto find a route out of poverty?Ifearwithoutadequate planning,safe-guards, standards, and funding, welfare reformwiH likewise tum into a nightmare not Just forthe poor, but for the people in our communityill-equipped to deal with the consequences ofanother experiment that backfires.Mr. POSHARD. Mr. Speaker. I rise in sup-port of this conference agreement on welfarereform. This is truly an important moment inmy legislative career and in the history of theHouse.Itrust our judgement today will bepren wise in years to come.Ihave supported welfare reform with mywork and with my votes during this session. Ivoted for the bill proposed by my colleaguefrom Georgia, Congressman DEAL, and for thebill most recently proposed by a bipartisan co-alition led by Congressmen CASTLE and TAN-NER.By voting for those bills, and opposing thebills which were passed but vetoed by thePresident, we have been able to move towarda sensible middle ground, a tough yet humanebill which is worthy of our support. Iwill enterinto the RECORD at this point a number of im-prements which helped earn my support forthis legislation. H9422Unlike theHousebill,the ConferenceAgreement forces states wanting to transferfunds between block grants to transfer thosefunds specifically into child care and socialservices block grants.The Agreement allows states the flexibil-ity to implement pilot welfare programs likethe one being put into place in Illinois. [Apart of the Castle-Tanner Plan) However.states many use federal funds to providevouchers and health and food stamp benfitsto children through the five year time limi-tation mandated in thebill.After that. states have the option of continuing benefitsin the form of a voucher.The Conference Agreement provides addi-tional flexibility in meeting the work re-quirements by allowing states that are im-plementing plans under federal waivers tocount individuals who are participating inwork programs under the waiver in meetingthe work participation rates in the bill, evenif the hours of work or the definition of workin the state plan do not meet the mandatesin the bill.The Agreement does not include the Houseprovision that would have prohibited statesfrom using block grant funds to make cashpayments to families that have an additionalchild while on welfare.Unlike the Housebill,the ConferenceAgreement does not give states the option toreceive food assistance in the form of a blockgrant, instead of under the regular FoodStamp program. The bill retains the currentFood Stamp program. [A major part of theCastle-Tanner PlansThe Conference Agreement decreased theamount cut from the Food Stamp programby $2.3billion.(The Agreement cuts theFood Stamp program by $23.3 billion over sixyears.)Tightens SSI eligibility criteria to restricteligibility to children who meet the medicallistings. However. individualized functionalassessment and references to maladaptivebehavior are repealed. [Criteria contained inCastle-Tanner Plans All children meetingmedical listings will be eligible for SSI bene-fits.The House bill restricted Food Stamps ben-efits for able-bodied, unemployed adults whohave no dependent and who are between theages of 18 and 50\u2014limiting Food Stamp bene-fits for this group to three months over theirlifetime up to age 50. The Agreement pro.vides such individuals with Food Stamps forthree months Out of every three years withthe possibility of another three months with-in that period. IMoved closer to the Castle-Tanner Plan)Under the agreement,all familiescur- rently receiving welfare and Medicaid bene-fits will continue to be eligible for the Med-icaid program. In addition, there is a oneyear transition period for Medicaid for thosetransitioning into the workiorce.The Conference Agreement does not denyMedicaid benefits for legal immigrants retro-actively and applies the ban on benefits forfive years instead of until citizenship tolegal immigrants.The Agreement retains the current FamilyPreservation and Support program. which isa preventive program designed to teach im-proved parenting skills before a child mustbe removed to foster care. The House billwould have replaced the program with ablock grant.The Agreement includes $500 million morethan the House bill for a fund to rewardstates that are effective in moving peoplefrom welfare to work, preserving two-parentfamilies. and reducing the out-of-wedlockbirths.Icome from a rural area. I know times canbe tough. But I also grew up on a farm whereCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEweworked for everything we ever had, andwherewe took care of each other. Most of thepeopleIrepresent in the 19th district havesimilar backgrounds. They know that jobs canbe lost or families can break apart and that weneed to look after our neighbor. But they alsowant that neighbor to take responsibility fortheir behavior and for them to look for work ifthey're able.This billhelps us respect those old-fash-ioned traditions in a modem world. It helps usmove people from welfare to work, helps ussave money in the program, and gives thestates the flexibility to meet the needs of theirpeop'e.We should be prepared to revisit this bill ifin fact children are left behind as some criticsfear. But today, we should embrace this pro-posal with courage and faith, confident that weare changing not only the construct but alsothe culture of welfare.Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in supportof reforming the welfare system. As the Amer-ican people know, the current welfare systemis in desperate need of reform. For public aidrecipients trapped inthe System, for thosewho exploit the welfare system, and for thetaxpayers who foot the bills, an overhaul ofwelfare in America is a high priority.The fundamental problem with our currentsystem is that for many people welfare be-comes more than a helping hand; it becomesa way of life. For some who enroll in the pn-mary welfare program, Aid to Families withDependent Children [AFDC), welfare becomesa trap they cannot escape. Some are afraid tolose the health benefits they receive throughMedicaid. Others are unable to secure childcare to enable them to go to work. We musteliminate these baniers and chart a clear pathfor welfare recipients to go after a paycheckinstead of a welfare check. Welfare should beviewed as temporary assistance, not a life-style.Ibelieve welfare benefits should be cut offfor recipients who areunwillingto pursuework, education or training.I also believe wemust strengthen childsupport enforcement.Billions of dollars rn child support payments gouncollected each year. By establishing pater-nity at birth and pursuing deadbeat parents,we can reduce the number of families impov-erished by the failure of non-custodial parentsto fulfill their financial responsibilities.The legislationbefore the House todaymakes many of the changes needed to reformthe welfare system. Itwill move peop'e fromwelfare to work, andit provides child carefunding and Medicaid to help people make themove from a welfare check to a paycheck. Itmaintainsnutrftionalguarantees. Anditin-cludes child support provisions to press dead-beat parents to meet their responsibilities sotheir children do not end up on welfare.This legislation is better than the Gingrichbill which I opposed 2 weeks ago. The Ging-richbill eliminated the Federal guarantee ofnutntional assistance. The Gingrich bill deniedMedicaid to legal immigrants. The Gingrich billdenied benefits to children born to parents onwelfare. And the Gingrich billdid not allowStates to provide vouchers for children whentheir parents exceeded time limits. The legisla-tion before us today does not include any ofthese problems.This legislation is also far better than theGingrich billI opposed last year. Last year'sGingrich bill would have block-granted and re-July 31, 1996duced funding for the nutrition program forWomen, Infants and Children; school lunchesand breakfasts; and the Child and Adult CareFood Program. It would have eliminated thecritical nutrition, education and health servicesthat are an important part of the WIC pro-gram's effectiveness in increasing the numberof healthy births. It would have eliminated theassurance of food assistance for many chil-dren, leaving rnany of them without enoughfood to eat. And it would have eliminated theassurance of sound nutrition standards forthese programs.Last year's Gingrichbillalso would haveebminated the guarantee of Medicaid cov-erage for millions of women and children onAFDC. It would have terminated most Federalday care programs and replaced them with ablock grant to States. It would have cut overafichild care funding and caused many familiesto be denied day care assistance. Without daycare, many parents would be forced to quit.their jobs and enter the welfare system. It alsowould have eliminated many of the health andsafety standards that have previously been re-quired of day care providers receiving Federalfunds, and put many childrens lives at risk.And it would have cut funding for foster care.adoption assistance, child abuse preventionandtreatmentandrelatedservices,andturned these programs over to the States in ablock grant. Today'sbilldoes not containthese enormous flaws.The legislation before the House today is farfrom perfect.It has significant problems thatmust be corrected, and Iwilt work with thePresident to ensure that these problems areeffectively addressed. Isupport effective re-quirements on the sponsors of legal immi-grants who apply for benefits, but I do not be-lieve that people who live legafly in our coun-try should be treated unfairly. The legislationbefore the House today is unfair to legal immi-grants who play by the rules and cont\u00f1bute tothe progress of our country, just as all of ourancestors have done. And the legislation be-fore us today cuts nutritional assistance toodeeply, which will be harmful to children andmay force some working families to continueto choose between paying the rent and puttingfood on the table.Iwill vote for the legislation that is now be-fore the House because it makes many of thechanges that must be made to change welfarefrom a way of life to a helping hand. And I willwork with the President to correct the prob-lems in this legis'ation that have nothing to dowith welfare reform.Mr. FAZIO of Califomia. Mr. Speaker, I riseto express my support for the conference-agreement before us and to voice my grati-tude to the rnany members of the DemocraticCaucus who have worked long and hard overthe last 2 years on this difficult issue.These members, including XAViER BECERRA,LYNN WOOLSEY, JOHN TANNER, CHARLIE STEN-HOIM, SANDY LEVIN, BOB MATSUI, MARTINSABO, and many, many others, have worked:long and hard to improve the welfare reformbill that we are considering today. They haveincreased the awareness of their colleaguesand have worked for a whole range of im-provements which have moderated some ofthe bill's original provisions. Itru'y appreciatetheir efforts.While this conference agreement isn't per.fect, it represents a step in the right directhn.This agreement acknowledges the view that- July31, 1996welfareshould be a second chance for thosein need, not a way of life.This agreement sets a 5-year time limit onreceiving benefits, includes tough welfare-to-work requirements, and allows States to de-cide how best to meet the needs of their citi-zens.I am pleased to see that the conferenceagreement moved toward the Presidents posi-tion on a number of important issues, espe-cially the removal of a provision that wouldhave allowed States to opt out of the foodstamp program. This will help keep the nutri-tional safety net intact for our kids. In addition,I am pleased that strong child support enforce-ment provisions have been included inthisagreement.The agreement that we're voting on today isthe first step toward a much-needed overhaulof our welfare system. It stresses both fiscaland personal responsibility and it breaks thecycle of dependence.Iurge my colleagues to support this con-ference agreement.Mr. STOKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-tion to H.R. 3734, the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Act, a bill which woulddramatically overtiaul our Nation's welfare sys-tem.On July 18, 1996,I joined wilh 170 of mycolleagues to show my staunch opposition toH.R. 3734. After reviewing the product of theconference committee, my position remainsunchanged.During this session of Congress, our Repub-lican colleagues assured us a family friendlyCongress. They promised us that our childrenwould be protected from harm. However, thisbill is not about helping our families, nor is itabout saving our children. The primary pur-pose of this billis to achieve more than $61billion in budget cuts. And unfortunately, thosewho will suffer most from this legislation willbe those who need assistance the most, ourchildren, and the poor.Seven months ago, President Clinton wasforced to veto a welfare bill which, much likethe bill before us today, would place an alarm-ing number of children into poverty. Accordingto the Urban Institute, H.R. 3734 would push1.5 million children into poverty. I appeal toPresident Clinton to veto this measure whichabandons the Federal commitment and safetynet that protects America's children.H.R. 3734 slashes more than $61 billion over 6 years in welfare programs. This bill guts funding for the Food Stamp Program,cuts into the SSI protections for disabled chil-dren, drastically cuts child nutrition programs,and slashes benefits for legal immigrants. Mr.Speaker,Ifind these reductions in quality oflife programs appalling.Mr. Speaker, I believe most of us agree thatour Nation's welfare system is in the need ofreform. But do we reform the system by deny-ing benefits to legal immigrants who, despiteworking hard and paying taxes, fall upon hardtimes? How can we demand that welfare re-cipients work 30 hours a week, yet provide in-efficient job training and job services\u2014essen-tial components in contributing to longevity inthe workplace? In short, how can we justifypunishing children and their families simplybecause they are poor?If we are truly to talk about the reform ofwelfare, if we are going to talk about increas-ing opportunities for our low-income residents,we cannot expect productive changes for ourCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEcommunityby taking away from those who al-ready have very little.Mr. Speaker, I can understand and supporta balanced and thoughtful approach to ad-dressing the reform of our Nation's welfaresystem. However, I cannot support this tegisla-tion which would shatter the 'ives of mflftons ofour Nation's poor.The pledge to end welfare as we know it isnot a mandate to act irresponsibly and withoutcompassion. On behalf of America's childrenand the poor, Iurge my colleagues to voteagainst H.R. 3734.Mrs. COLLINS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I risein opposition to the conference agreement onH.R. 3734, legislation that revises our currentaw providing welfare to needy children, indi-viduals, and families in America. This welfarerevision does lithe more than poke holes in thesafety net that is caHed welfare. In my opinion,thislegislationis a desperate\u2014and unsuc-cessful\u2014attempt to daim reform when it is anillogical revision. Change merely for change'ssake can lead to chaos, damage, and injury.This bill reportedly contains changes to ourwelfare system that will ensure insecurity andforecast fear on the part of the many vulner-able, loving parents out there trying their bestto provide for their children a safe, secure,and nurtunng environment.Some of my constituents in the SeventhDistrict of Illinois are among the poorest of theNation. For the 23\u00bd years that I have servedin this body, Ihave fought strong and some-times bitter battles for the benefit of the vul-nerable, the disenfranchised, the young, old,disabled, and poor. That is what I hope to beremembered for when Iretire from the Houseat the end of the year.So,feelI have an obligation to rise todayin opposition to the conference agreement de-veloped in the 11th hour by a few secretly se-lected Members of Congress. I continue to beconcerned that we are applying Band-Aid pol-icy and control instead of prevention and earlyintervention. The funds provided in current lawattempt to address, and/or remedy, the symp-torns of poverty: joblessness, hunger, domes-tic violence, child abuse and neglect, illiteracy;but untfl and unless we set about strategicallyto address the causes, we go far short of ade-quate to eradicate the problem and then won-der why we are losing the fight.Iwas contacted this moming by the Day-Care Council of Illinois, located in Chicago,who reminded me that President Frankiin Roo-sevelt, under whose leadership the safety netfor our most vuinerable children and familieswas established some 60 years ago oncesaid: \"The test of our progress is not whetherwe add more to the abundance of those whohave much; itis whether we provide enoughfor those who have too Uttle.\"We do too little when we take away theFederal oversight of funds that are channeledinto State and local coffers in the form of blockgrants; reduce the Food Stamp program in thename of budget deficit; deny benefits to legalimmigrants; and make children-having-childrencontinue to live in housing environments thatfailed them as teenage parents instead of sup-porting communities in their efforts to providestable, dependable support systems. Whetherthat support is suppUed by the teen parent'sbiological or substitute parent, or a publiclyfunded shelter, should be the decision of thatchild-parent, not the Federal Government.Block granting weflare benefits is likely toblock grant suffering.I can only hope that ifH9423this legislation passes, sufficient Federal cr1-teria and oversight can make them work. TheStates have asked for block grants and whO becalled upon to demonstrate that they can actresponsibly to all vulnerable populations in anon-discriminatory manner. My fear and recol-lection of contemporary history is that many ofthem will not.On the issue of Medicaid eligibility, until andunlessCongress - canachievemeaningfu'health care reform to provide for universal ac-cess to health care financing, there must beMedicaid eligibibty for the unemployed, unin-sured families who receive public assistance.The well-being of our children is what publicwelfare should be all about; and we shouldfocus on how best we can prevent and protectthe vulnerable children of our Nation from ex-periencing poverty and despair, against hun-ger and sickness, and against fear and help-lessness. Iurge my colleagues to reject this rush toagreement.yield back the balance of mytime.Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise todayin opposilion to the welfare conference agree-ment. This bill is an outrage. It constitutes thelatest chapter in the right wing majority's alt-out attack on chUdren and the poor.Let's get real. Less than 2 percent of Fed-eraldollarsarespent onassistingpoorwomen and children. Yet radicals are ramminga bill down our throats that does nothing morethan single out and punish children inthename of deficit reduction.Many on the other side of the aisle areunder the false assumption that all we need todo to eliminate poverty istake food andmoney away from poor people. But Ihavenews for you\u2014this sink or swim approach willnot work. According to the Urban Institute thisbill would push 1.1 million children into povertyand eliminate their ability to count on basic in-come support.The worse tragedy of all is that this cruel billcomes up short on jobs. Cutting financial as-sistance to poor families without money for jobcreation, job training and day care will notforce recipients to swim but cause millions ofpoor children to drown.The real problem is that in poor areas likethe oneIrepresent, there simply are notenough jobs for people. n fact in some areasin NYC there are 14 applicants for every onefast-food job.Let's end this charade. Iimplore my col-leagues, on both sides of the aisle, to supportfaimess and basic decency and reject thisheartless legislation.TheSPEAKER protempore.

I am clearly going to have plentyof time to accommodate them. I hopethey will be watching here so that wedo not have big periods of time whenwe are in a quorum call.Mr. President, we come to the end ofa long journey today to reform ourFederal-State welfare programs. Wetake this final step today to send tothe President of the United States forhis announced signature the Personal-Responsibility and Work OpportunityReconciliation Act of 1996.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEAs vice chairman of the welfare rec-onciliation conference, I wish to firstthank the people who did the bulk ofthe work to bring this conference to aquick conclusion. On our side, I thankin particular Senator ROTH, the chair-man of the Finance Committee, whosits here. Without his diligent workand that of his excellent staff, wewould not be here. I also thank. Sen-ator LUCAR, who chairs the AgricultureCommittee. For some it is not quiteunderstood why a welfare bill can in-clude agriculture issues. Of all of thenutrition programs that are a part ofthis package, most of them come with-in the jurisdiction of the AgricultureCommittee, from food stamps on down.Obviously Senator LUCAR and his verydedicated staff must be given very highpraise on our side of the aisle for theirwork.These two distinguished chairmenand their staffs, from what I under.stood, worked tirelessly this last week.I was with them some of the time. Iknow of no other budget reconciliationconferencein our history that wascompleted as quickly as this\u2014less than1 week.Now, obviously, the House and Sen-ate have passed bills that were some-what similar\u2014we have been at this anumber of times. In fact, we have here-tofore sent to the President two billsthat passed both the House and Senateand he vetoed them. So, completing theconference report in 1 week seemed tous to be an achievable goal. And, in-deed, they have exceeded our expecta-tion and finished in slightly less than aweek.I believe part of the reason why thisconference was completed so quickly isbecause the work on this issue has beenin progress since the beginning of the104th Congress. which began almost ayear and a half ago. Welfare reform wasone of the top legislative agenda itemsof this Congress. The former Repub-lican leader, Senator Bob Dole. ourcandidate for President, made welfarereform a centerpiece of our broader ef-fort to reform the Federal Governmentand return power back to the Statesand communities. For that, I want toindicate my great praise for our can-didate for President, and our formerleader. He had a lot to do with us beinghere today.In addition. the national Governors,both Republicans and Democrats. haveworked over the last year, both withthe Congress and the administration.to help us make as informed judgmentsas we can.This legislation truly represents andreflects the beginning of an open part-nership with the States. This opennesswill be critical to its long-term suc-cess. We finally have decided what weshould have decided a long time ago.that the States should not be our jun-ior partners: who we tell how to do ev-erything. do not listen to, and do notlet make any innovative changes or doanything different from State to State.For too long we have assumed that oneAugust 1, 1996shoe fits all and that the States betterdo as we say because we are payingsome or most of the bill.We have decided that the States andGovernors and legislatures out there inAmerica are as concerned about thepoor as we are. They are concernedabout their well-being and as con-cerned. if not more so, about the statusof welfare in their States\u2014a program-that was built upon and built upon overthe past 60 years. but never containedany elements which were truly an in.centive to go to work, or to improveyour own personal responsibility andtake better care of yourselves, andthus of your children. It had become asif people were locked in poverty, kindof waiting around for the next minimalcash benefit check and whatever elsewent with it. The rewards were notgreat. The money was not very much.But of those who got on it, many ofthem stayed on it forever because therewere no tools to help them get theireducations and look for jobs. Therewere not job placement approaches.All of that will change when this billbecomes law. The essence of the newwelfare will be more like workfare.Welfare offices will turn into workplacement offices, into job training of-fices, into places where people can goto find out how to improve their skillsand what help they can have whilethey are doing that, such as enhancedchild care. We put a great deal of re-sources in here, because we want manyof the people who are single heads ofhouseholds, who have a couple of chil-dren, to be able to become trained andeducated. So we have provided about$14 billion over the next 6 years in thisbill. in order to help parents who wantto go find jobs with those things thatthey need to take care of their childrenin the interim.The spirit of bipartisanship is heretoday also. The President's statementyesterday indicates he would sign thislegislation.after having vetoed twoprevious attempts at welfare reform.Our Senators may describe what wehave done differently. but from mystandpoint I describe it in five simpleways:First. we want to encourage andmake people work. We believe work isthe best thing to make people feelmore self-esteem. It builds personal re-sponsibility\u2014which is precisely the op-posite of the ethic we have built intothe welfare program heretofore. Able-bodied persons who seek assistanceshould seek work and employment, andonly after failing to find employmentshould they turn to the taxpayer forassistance.Second, simple as it sounds. we askparents to take care of their children.We stress personal responsibility andcreate incentives for families to staytogether. We reestablish one simplerule, parents should take care of theirchildren first. Accordingly. we trackdown and punish deadbeat fathers andmothers. Third, we change the cultureof welfare. This is a culture that has August 1, 1996dominated and poisoned our good in-tentions for the last 61 years. We doaway with the concept of an entitle-ment to a cash benefit. Welfare willhave a 5-year time limit for any recipi-ents. No longer will welfare be a way oflife. It will be a helping hand\u2014and nota handout.Fourth. we cut endless, unnecessaryFederal regulations and bureaucraciesand bureaucrats by turning power andflexibility over to the States and com-munities. That is where help for thosein need can best be determined andbest be delivered, and where innovationwill flourish. Better ways to do thingswill be found.Fifth, and finally, this is a budgetreconciliation bill, and these reformswill slow the growth of Federal andState spendingfor these programs.Spending on the programs in this bill:thenew temporaryassistancefor needy families block grant\u2014temporaryassistancefor needy families blockgrant, I repeat that\u2014this is a new pro-gram. and a new child care block grantprogram, and the reformed food stamp,SSI, child nutrition, foster care\u2014all ofthese, along with the earned-incometax credit and other programs will in-crease from $100 billion this year tonearly $130 billion per year 6 yearsfrom now. Total spending over the next6 years for these programs will exceed$700 billion.For those who say we are not goingto provide for those in need that wereheretofore on welfare, let me repeat:The combined programs will increasefrom nearly $100 billion this year to$130 billion per year in 6 years, hardlya reduction in expenditures. Let me re-peat, the total programs that I havejust described, food stamps. SSI, childnutrition, foster care, the block grantprogram for child care, the new blockgrant to take the place of AFDC, whichwe will call temporary assistance forneedy families\u2014all of those programswill seek, from the taxpayers of Amer-ica, $700 billion over the next 6 years.Nevertheless, our taxpayers shouldknow that we will save, we will savethem, about $55 billion. This programinitsreformed and more efficientmode will cost $55 billion less than itwas assumed to cost if we had left ev-erything alone and kept the entitle-ments wherever they were.I believe much of these savings aregoing to be achieved because we aremaking the programs work better. Weare going to be pushing people to dowhat they should have been doing allalong\u2014get off the rolls into work. offdependenceintoindependence,off looking to somebody else for respon-sibility and looking to themselves. Andeverywhere we turn, in this bill, thereare provisions for those who just can-not do it. There are emergency setasides,emergency allowances.there are provisions, where it just cannot bedone, to provide some of what must beprovided in addition to the basic pro-gram.I would like to quote one of our verydistinguished Senators. Senator RICKCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATESANTORUM\u2014for whom I also extend mygreat appreciation for his help on thefloor on many occasions during the de-bate on welfare. He stood here in mystead and he did a remarkable job. Hecame to the Senate well informed onthis subject. He. at one point, said:Welfare reform has been and will con-tinue to be a contentious issue. Thislegislation is tough love.\"I concur. And I do not believe there isanything wrong with that either. I have some concerns about provisions inthis legislation. Other Members willhave their particular concerns, and thePr\u00e9sident has expressed his. Unfortu-nately or fortunately, depending onyour philosophy of governance, itis possible and probable that even withthe President's signature we will nothave seen the last of welfare reform.When he has signed it. we will probablysee a completed law and we will carryit out. In due course, we will see thereare some areas that need some repair.some fixing. But I believe, under anycircumstance. with a bill that is asmuch on the right track as this\u2014al-though perhaps imperfect in certainareas\u2014we should proceed. We shouldlet the reform move along.For today, I believe, that the besthope we have to fulfill the promise weall made to the American public tochange these programs as we haveknown them\u2014is to pass this bill over-whelmingly.Making such fundamental changes toprograms, some of which are 60 yearsold,will surely require adjustmentsand additional tuning as we begin tosee how this legislation unfolds. Butfor those who seem frightened of thischange. and for those who want to findthe areas where they have concern andthat might need some repair in the fu-ture, I merely ask, is it possible thatthis welfare reform program can beworse than what we have?I cannot believe that it is; because ina landof opportunity with untoldchances for people to succeed on theirown and move ahead with personalachievement and responsibility, in aland with plenty of that, one thing thatstands out as a testimonial to failureon the part of our legislative bodiesand the executive branch is the welfareprogram of this country. This program,for the most part, moves people in theopposite direction of mainstream op-portunity in America, and for many itlocks them there. We must unlocktheir opportunity potential.For today, I believe this is our bestopportunity to change the culture ofwelfare and, once again, I repeat, toprovide in every way possible a handup. an opportunity up, not a handout. IbelievetheseAmericanswhoare locked in welfare as we know it todayare anxiously waiting in their mindsand in their hearts for a better way oflife. What we are saying, is we hope weare providing that for you. We hope weare giving many of you an opportunityto get Out of welfare and get into some-thing that is more like what mostS9323Americans have the opportunity to bea part of.In short. I believe this legislation isthe best hope we have today to providesome real hope for a future for thosefamilies and children in our societywho, in many, many instances, are to-tally without hope. But we need to behonest and sober. I believe proponentsand opponents may be overstating theresults, but I believe the overwhelmingconsequences of this bill will be posi-tive. The legislation represents a fun-damental change in social policy. Weelectedofficialsshould not assumethat this legislation is perfect. The onething the last 61 years should havetaught us is that no one can be all-knowing.So let us be proud of this significantaccomplishment today. I believe it isthe right legislation for the future. Butlet us also remain vigilant and sober.Many people's lives will be affected bythis critical legislation, and we hopefor most of the overwhelming percent-age it is for the better.Again, I congratulate the Members ofthe House and Senate who have workedto help bring this legislation before ustoday. I am hopeful that we will put anend shortly to welfare as it is.Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.ThePRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FAIRCLOTH). Who yields time?Mr. DOMENICI. Mr.President.I yield the floor.Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the man-ager.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey.Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President,let me start off by saying that I great-ly respect my colleague on the otherside of the aisle, the manager and thechairman of the Budget Committee. Ilistened to him carefully, and I knowthat he is a man of compassion andconcern. I have seen it manifested inmany ways: his interest in the men-tally ill, his interest in the disabled.This is someone who cares about peo-ple. So when I talk about my differencein view, this is my personal perspectiveand, by no means do I intend to criti-cize the distinguished Senator fromNew Mexico.Mr. President,Itake this oppor-tunity, acting as the minority manageron this conference report, to make myremarks. and they reflect my opinion.This is not a consensus view that Ihave mustered; this is the opinion ofthe Senator from New Jersey, who hasbeen on the Budget Committee forsome time and draws on some experi-ence from my corporate world, as I dis-cuss my perspective.This is a historic and peculiar timefor the U.S. Senate. The body is on theverge of ending a 60-year guaranteethat poor childreninthis countrymight not go hungry. I salute the at-tempts to solve the problem. I am rightwithalltheothers,includingthe Presidentof the United States,in wanting to solve the problem. S9324Thequestionisnot whether onewants to solve the problem; the ques-tion is, how do you solve it? This isgoing to be a test not only of our pock-etbooks and our resources, but of ourhearts as well. Though I have heard itdescribed as bleeding hearts. I am will-ing to accept the nomenclature thathas applied, because having had my lifeexperience whenintheDepressionyears my family was, to use the expres-sion, dirt poor, and my father had to goto work on a WPA program, it was ahumiliating experience for him to haveto go to work on a Government pro-gram. But he buried his pride for a mo-ment, and he did what he could to sup-port his family.I don't know many people who wantto humiliate themselves standing in aline waiting for their welfare check.Yes, there are some cheats Out thereand there are druggies and there aredrunks. They are out there, there is noquestion about it. but a lot of thosepeople are simply people who have notyet discovered a way out of their mis-ery and their poverty.Women with children, many of themunwed\u2014I do not approve of that condi-tion, but that is life. The punishmentshould never exceed the deed, and thatis what I fear, Mr. President, we areabout to do in this body of ours, in ourbeloved country. For 60 years, we couldrest easier at night and be sure Amer-ican children had a minimum safetynet. The bill before us takes away thispeace of mind and throws up to 1,100,000childreninto poverty, according to astudy by the Urban Institute.I agree, the welfare system is in needof repair, and I believe that it needs topromoteworkandself-sufficiency,pride and dignity. That is going tomake the difference.I think it should also, however, pro-tect children and, unfortunately, I amnot certain at all that this so-calledwelfare reform does it.First, the Republican bill does notpromote work. It asks for work. It de-mands work. I heard the distinguishedchairman of the Budget Committee saywe can make people work. That is a re-quirement for welfare recipients. But itdoes not require the resources to putpeople to work.In fact, CBO said that most Stateswould be unlikely to satisfy this workrequirement for several reasons. Onemajor reason is that this bill cuts fund-ing for work programs by combiningall welfare programs into a cappedblock grant.Second, the Republican bill hurts children. It would make deep cuts inthe Food Stamp Program. which mil-lions of children rely on for their nutri-tional needs. It would also end theguarantee that children will alwayshave the safety net. Under this bill, aState could adopt a 60-day time limit,and after that the children would becut off from the safety net entirely.The State would not even be requiredto provide a child with a voucher forfood, clothing, or medical care. WhenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEyou take all of these policies together,this bill will put an estimated approxi-mately 1.1 million children into pov-erty. Ahd this is a conservative esti-mate. It could be higher.Mr. President, my conscience doesnot permit me to vote for a bill thatwill likely plunge children into pov-erty.I had an experience some years agowhen I was at the Earth summit inBrazil with the now Vice President ofthe United States and other Senators,Republican and Democrat. We weredining at a restaurant, facing a beau-tifUl harbor in Rio. The restaurantswere separated by rows of shrubs\u2014beautiful places, a marvelous atmos-phere. I saw a light brown hand reachthrough the bush and take food off thetable. Children starving, thousands ofthem, sometimes chased by the police,sometimes shot at because they crowd-ed the doors.Mr. President. a child who is hungrywill go to any means, as will an adult,to satisf' their hunger. I am worriedabout that. I cannot vote to leave ourchildren unprotected. I was one of only11 Democrats to vote against the origi-nal Senate welfare bill that would haveput 1.2 million children into poverty. Ivoted against the conference report onthis bill that would have doomed 1.5million children to the same fate. I willvote against this bill for the same rea-son. We dare not abandon our children.Mr. President, I hold a different vi-sion of what the safety net in thiscountry should be.I am concerned,frightened, that thisbillwillleave. children hungry and homeless. I am afraid the streets of our Nation's citiesmight someday look like the streets of.the cities of Brazil. Walk around thereandyouseechildrenbeggingfor money. begging for food, and even at 8and 9 years old engaging in prostitu-tion.Tragically, that is what happens tosocieties that abandon their children.When we don't protect our kids, theyresort to their own means to survive. Ido not want to see that happen in thiscountry. I want to see this country in-vest in children.Ithink we should invest more inchild care and health and nutrition sothat our kids can become independent,productive citizens.I want to givethem the opportunity to live the Amer-ican dream like I and so many in thisroom had the good fortune to do. If wedo not, we will create a permanentunderclass inthis country. We willhave millions of children with no pro-tection, and we are going to doomthem to failure.Mr. President, as a member of theBudget Committee, I also want to com-ment on the priorities that are re-flected in this reconciliation bill. De-spite the fact that this bill is only lim-ited to safety net programs, it is stillconsidered a reconciliation bill. Thebill receives the same protections as abudget-balancing bill, but there is nobalanced budget in it. This reconcili-August 1, .1996ation bill seeks to cut the deficit onlyby attacking safety net programs forpoor children, for legal immigrants.There are no cuts in corporate loop-holes or tax breaks, despite the factthat the tax expenditures cost the Fed-eral Treasury over $400 billion a year.There are no such savings in this bill.There are no grazing fee increases, nomining royalties, no savings in themilitary budget or NASA's budget.The only cuts in this bill come fromwomen and children. This reconcili-ation bill gives new meaning to puttingwomen and children first.Mr. President, I realize that this billisgoingto pass.Iunderstand thePresident clearly has indicated that heis going to sign it. However, as the dis-tinguished Senator from New Mexicomentioned, the President and many ofus are determined to examine a pack-age of changes next year to soften theblow of the harsh provisions in thisbill.Mr. President, we have seen the reac-tion of people regarding this bill. Whenyou hear from the mayor of one of theworld's most distinguished cities. NewYork City Mayor Giuliani, he is wor-ried about where they get the money inthe block grants to supply the jobtraining, the child care support. He isconcerned, as are many mayors acrossthe country we have heard from.Mr. President, I will, for a moment,just relate an experience that I hadwhen I ran a corporation. a big cor-poration, When I left to come to theU.S. Senate, we had over 16.000 employ-ees, a very successful company. Wewere a company, founded in New Jer-sey, that tried to work within our com-munity. The company still hasits headquarters in New Jersey and em-ploys almost 30,000 people today.I always tried. since I came from apoor background of hard-working. hon-est people who always wanted to keeptheir heads high and always wanted todo the right thing and not ask anybodyfor anything\u2014but there were timeswhen we needed help. If I did not have'the GI bill. Mr. President, I doubt thatI would be standing in front of the U.S.Senate and the American people today.So, we were very conscientious, mypartners and I. about trying to under-stand what was happening around us.We began to hire people. or we at-tempted to hire people. who were lit-erally unemployable with job after job,short-term employment, and then backon the streets.We brought people into the computerroom, not into the factory. We did nothave a factory. I was in the computerbusiness. We brought them into thecomputer room, and we had one star-tling success among several people thatwe worked with. The reason for thatsuccess was very interesting, The rea-sons for failure were obvious. becausethough we would give these people ajob, and they would be enthusiasticabout it for a couple days, as soon asthey got back into their environmentand as soon as they were faced with August 1. 1996poverty and despair and drugs andcrime, they fell right back in the trap.They were useless as employees in veryshort order.Buttheone person who succeeded sowell, we got an apartment for her, andwe moved her, helped her move fromher ghetto area to a more middle-classarea. The success was astounding. Thiswoman, when we hired her, she was 25years old. She had very limited edu-cation. She became a computer roomsupervisor\u2014a good job--and went on tobecome a part of management in thecompany. It was a startling success.because it was not that we said, youhave to go to work and have to show upon time. We said that to everybody.You say. that to all of your employees.All of them do not do it. It needs train-ing. It needs commitment.Mr. President, I hope that this billthat is being considered today, thisreconciliation bill, will not be the firststep toward larger problems than wecan understand today, toward the kindof situation where America turns itsheart into stone and says. OK, we arehere as accountants, we are here to cutthe budget.I want to cut the budget. I have pro-grams to cut the budget to arrive at abalanced budget. I know what happensin the corporate world when your ex-penses get too high and your revenuestoo low. You make changes, makethem selectively. We did not just cutevery department if we had to reduceexpenses. Maybe it was time to cut themarketing department or the produc-tion department or the products designdepartment.ButIalways thoughtabout the long term. We are abandon-ing the long term. What we are doing isgiving a lot of people political satisfac-tion, those who work here and thosewho are outside who hear us on TV andthe radio.Mr. President. I make my remarks inthe full context of the realization ofwhere we are. This bill has lots of sup-port. I am not, I promise you\u2014not\u2014at-tempting or trying to influence peopleto vote against it.I am stating thecase as I see tt. I hope it will in someway encourage others to think verydeeply about their decision to vote. Ithank you and yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. howmuch time does the distinguished Sen-ator from Delaware desire?Mr. ROTH. Ten minutes.Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 15 min-utes to the Senator from Delaware,Senator Rom.Mr. ROTH. First of all. let me thankthe distinguished Senator from NewMexico for his gracious remarks aboutme and my staff. I just point out thatwe would not have been able to com-plete the reconciliation within a weekif it had not been for his leadership. forthe assistance and help that he pro-vided at any time when it became nec-essaryinthedifficultnegotiationsthat had to take place. I want to pub-licly thank the Senator for his con-tribution.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEMr. President, this day is a remark-able turning point in the lives of mil-lions of American families and genera-tions to come. This is the day we willreorder our confused and confoundingsystem of welfare. A world spinningout of control will be brought backinto proper course. It will return toorder not through the power of Wash-ington but through personal respon-sibility and work opportunity, the verytitle of this important legislation.I say to my distinguished friend fromNew Jersey that what we seek to dohere is to provide the same kind of op-portunitythat was given tohim, through help to go to college. but par-ticularly as he tried to help that ladyinto the mainstream of life by givingher meaningful work. I think that iswhat we are all seeking to do together.Mr. President, this is the third timewelfare reform will have passed in the104th Congress. The issue of welfare re-form has been frequently and passion-ately debated over these past months,and rightly so. The effects and con-sequences of the welfare system insome way touches us all.During this time. the Finance Com-mittee has held 19 hearings and takentestimony from 90 witnesses. We havefound that the current AFDC program,as it was designed in the 1930's, aban-doned many families long ago as a sta-tistic of long-term dependency in con-temporary society. The current welfaresystem has failed the very families itwas intended to serve.If the present welfare system wasworking so well we would not be heretoday.I think that is a point wellworth underscoring because the fact is,as the record shows, that this currentsystem has not been good for children.For anyone who believes that it has, Irecommend you read the findings sec-tion of this legislation. I have yet tohear anyone defend the present systemas good for children.I point out that in 1965 there were 3.3million children on AFDC; by 1992, thathad risen to over 9 million children. In1992, 9 million children were on welfare,AFDC, despite the fact that the totalnumber of children in this country hasdeclined. Last year. the Department ofHealth and Human Services estimatedif we do nothing, 12 million will be onAFDC in 10 years.I reemphasize once again that thepresent system is not good for children.But the record clearly demonstratesthe contrary\u2014that instead of beinggood. we find more and more childrenbeing trapped in a system and into de-pendency on welfare.As I said, to do nothing is absolutelyunacceptable. Mr. President, 90 percentof the children on AFDC live withoutone of their parents. Only a fraction ofwelfare families are engaged in work.The current welfare system has cheat-ed the children of what they needmost\u2014among these is hope, the nec-essary condition of liberation from de-pendency. The key to their success willnot be found in Washington but in thetimeless values of family and work.S9325Opponents of welfare believe that theStates lack either the compassion orthe capacity. or both, to serve needyfamilies. They are wrong. We promisedwelfare reform and we have kept ourpromise. Our legislation is built uponthe original principles from which wehave never waivered. This is a biparti-san bill. Half of the Senate DemocraticMembers who served on the conferencevoted for the bill when it passed theSenate by an overwhelming margin.Yesterday.thisconferencereport passed the House of Representatives bya vote of 328 to 101. Half of the Demo-crats in the House of Representativesvoted for this bill. I believe that dem-onstrates the bipartisan spirit uponwhich we have approached welfare re-form.A number of people deserve ourthanks and credit for giving us this op-portunity today. First,let me givecredit and thanks to Senator Bob Dole,our former majority leader. Even afterwelfare reform had been vetoed twice,Bob Dole insisted that we could andshould remain steadfast in our fun-damental principles and achieve wel-fare reform. Bob Dole introduced a wel-farebillbefore heleftthe Senatewhich was, frankly, the benchmark ofour conference report before us. Hislast advice to me was to make sure thisjob gets done this year. I have to say,Mr. President, today's action reflectshis work, reflects his vision. reflectshis leadership.Our Nation's Governors. most espe-cially the lead Governors on welfareand Medicaid reform. people like JohnEngler.TommyThompson,Mike Leavitt,Tom Carper,BobMiller, Lawton Chiles, and Roy Romer deserveour thanks and credit for their work tomake welfare reform a reality. I lookforward to working with them again toface the challenge of Medicaid reform.Even though Senator MOYNIHAN doesnot support our legislation. I want tothank him for his work and insightsinto this extremely complex world ofwelfare. Perhaps no one has done moreover the past three decades than Sen-ator Mo'r.nwi to bring the alarrrnnggrowth in welfare to the Nations at-tention.President Clinton has announced hissupport for this hard-won conferencereport and he is to be congratulated forthat decision. It is the right thing todo.Mr. President, while the present wel-fare system is full of excuses, the wel-fare reform legislation being presentedto the American people today is indeeda bold challenge. And while the presentsystem quietly accepts the dependencyof more than 9 million children, ourproposal speaks loudly to them and in-sists that they. too. must be among theheirs to the blessings of this great Na-tion.Welfare reform is about helping fami-lies find the freedom and independencewe take so much for granted.Mr. President, this legislation clearlypoints the way to that independence. S9326Buttheroadto independence does notbegin or end in Washington. Independ-ence begins with living up to one's re-sponsibilities. This is echoed throughthe legislation with the provisions onwork, time-limited benefits, limits onbenefitsfornoncitizens, and strongchild support enforcement reforms.Mr. President, I urge adoption of theconference report.I yield the floor.Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER.The Chair recognizes the Senator from Or-egon.Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 15 minutes. Mr. President, thereis a concrete reason for voting for thisless-than-perfect bill. For millions ofAmericans, this legislation can be atool for turning the welfare check intoa trampoline for opportunity and inde-pendence.Iknow this because myhome State of Oregon has achieved it.Once more, the State of Oregon hasmarked a path for the Nation. By put-ting in place our welfare reform pro-gram, known as Jobs Plus, we haveshown the Nation that it is possible tobe both tough and compassionate. Withour Jobs Plus Program, we have beenable to have strong work requirementsand critically needed child care andmedical care for folks coming off ofwelfare. The plan is working for bothtaxpayers and those coming off of wel-fare. And as the President said yester-day. today's legislation can spark moreStates into going with the kind of ap-proach we have at home.Mr. President, a few years ago, an Or-egonian approached me on the streetand said, 'You know, for me, welfare iskind of likeeconomic methadone.'You guys send me a check. The checksalways come, but you people never letme do anything to break out, to get offwelfare.\"This legislation provides the way tobreak out\u2014a real key for unlocking theriddle of welfare dependency. I think itis an opportunity to remake this sys-tem that doesn't work for those whoare in it and doesn't work for the tax-payers who pay for it.Take child care, for example. Childcareisan absolute prerequisiteto changing welfare. Ichaired hearingslooking at the child care issue, and weheard heartbreaking accounts of how,again and again, women would get offof welfare, they would be doing well inthe private sector, but their child carewould fall apart just as they were get-ting back on their feet.This bill provides S3.5 billion morethan current law for that criticallyneeded child care. That increase of $3.5billion in child care is going to be abso-lutely critical to helping folks get offwelfare.In addition, as several of my col-leagues have noted, child support isstrengthened. I am also pleased thatMedicaid is protected as a guaranteefor all of our Nation's children.Now, at the beginning of this Con-gress. there was a lot of talk about or-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEphanages. A lot of us did not particu-larly think that all of these orphanageswere exactly Boys Town, and nobodyseemed to zero in on the question thatif an orphanage was Boys Town, itwould come with a big price tag fortaxpayers. So a lot of us thought thatwe ought to do something better. I worked very hard to develop a new ap-proach known as \"Kinship Care.\" Whatthe Kinship Care amendment says isthat the Nation's grandparents\u2014themillions of loving grandparents\u2014wouldget first preference when a youngsterfrom a broken home needs help. In-stead of sending the children away, thegrandparents,if they met the childcustody standards, would get first pref-erence. Along with Congresswoman EL-EANOR HOLMES NORTON, CongressmanCLAY SHAw, and Senator DAN COATS, ona bipartisan basis, we all worked to-gether on this kinship care amend-ment.Now, as we look to the 21st centurywhen, as a result of the populationtrends and demographics, there are going to be many more, grandparents,we have an opportunity to keep fami-liestogether,to use a new modelknown as kinship care to provide lov-ing care for youngsters in a cost-effec-tive way.Mr.President,thislegislationdoesn't meet my definition of perfec-tion. I will say that I, frankly, detest acoupleof theseplovisions\u2014particu-larly, what was done with the foodstamp shelter deduction and the legalimmigrant provisions. So this legisla-tion doesn't meet my textbook stand-ard of what would constitute perfec-tion. I, like a number of our other Sen-ators, am going to fight very hard tomake changes in this area. As I thinkit is critical to do, we ought to be con-sti-uctive and we ought to look at use-ful ways that Senators can work on abipartisan basis for changes.For example, there has been a lot oftalk in this Congress about the idea ofa lock box, the idea of special accountsso that when the spending is reduced,those funds are protected for deficit re-duction. I have supported that concept.I think the lock box makes sense.Frankly, I think we ought to look at anew idea, and we can call it the lunchbox. We could make sure that whenyou eliminate some of those tax loop-holes,when you goalter wastefulspending. some of those funds could beput in what I call the lunch box, andwe could use these savings to try freshapproaches to ensure that all Ameri-cans have access to good nutrition. Ithink there are a number of new, inno-vative approaches that we ought to tryand that are going to be needed, evenafter this billis enacted and signedinto law.At the end of the day, Mr. President.the question, to me, is straightforward:Is this legislation better than the sta-tus quo? Is it better than the systemthat an Oregonian told me was likeeconomic methadone? Ithink thatwhen you look at the child care provi-August 1, 1996sions, at the Medicaid guarantee, whenyou look at the opportunity for Statesto follow the path that Oregon has fol-lowed with our Jobs Plus Program, Ibelieve you see the case for supportingthis legislation. I intend to vote for it.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, asmanager of the time on this side, I want to indicate that Senator GORTONwill be recognized to take my place,and he will have up to 15 minutes, andthen he will indicate thereafter the se-quence until I arrive back on the floor.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER.The Chairrecognizes theSenatorfrom Washington State.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I great-ly admire those who, during the courseof this debate over the last year and ahalf, expressed great confidence in theconsequences of the passage of this billor of its predecessors. I expressed thatadmiration both for those who are asconfident that the bill will end a cul-ture of dependency as for those whoview with alarm what they believe willvastly increase poverty among the peo-ple of the United States. While I ad-mire their certainty, I cannot join init.I must say, Mr. President. that I amnot at all certain of what the con-sequences of the passage of this billwill be. I hope and I am inclined to be-lieve that they will primarily be posi-tive, but I cannot be certain. In thatregard, Mr. President,I agree fullywith the views expressed yesterday inthe Washington Post by Robert Sam-uelson, and I will quote three sentencesof his review:The exercise aims to promote self-relianceby making it harder for people to rely ongovernment. Without the threat of extra suf-fering,people would have no reason tochange. What can't be predicted is how thegood and bad will balance.Mr. President, I find that entire col-umn to be so persuasive\u2014and not atall, incidentally, to be so similar to myown views\u2014that I ask unanimous con-sent that the entire column be printedin full at the end of my remarks.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.(See exhibit 1.)Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on theother hand, what I do know and what Ifeel confident in stating is that ourpresent welfare system is a tragic anddestructive failure. At the very least,the present system has been accom-panied by a massive increase in thevery conditions that it was designed toalleviate: illegitimacy, family breakup,a negative attitude toward work, a cul-tureofdependency. At most,our present system has been a contributingcause to those conditions.Ishould also like to observe, Mr.President, that those who oppose thisbill, by and large. are those who indi-vidually\u2014or whose philosophy\u2014haveguided and managed the system thatthis bill in large part dismantles. Thesepeople. these ideas clearly representthe conventional wisdom. a conven-tional wisdom that has guided and pro-duced every change in welfare policy in August 1, 1996this country,or almostevery suchchange, for at least the past 30 years.Their present advice is to view withalarm these changes, to attempt topreserve the status quo, except to askthat we do a little bit more of what wehave been doing with these last severaldecades.Mr. President. that conventional wis-dom is bankrupt and ought to be aban-doned, not only for the sake of our so-ciety as a whole but for the sake of thesupposed beneficiaries of these welfarepolicies.Those of us who support this legisla-tion, these changes. hope with somereason that this bill will increase in-centives to work, some of those incen-tives being positive and some negative.We hope, with some reason, that it willresult in strong disincentives for teen-age pregnancy and illegitimacy. We areconvinced that it will require greatermale parental support for their chil-dren.But the heart of this bill\u2014not withtotal consistency. after all, with thecompromises that have entered intoit\u2014but the heart of this proposal isconsistent with my own uncertaintiesabout specific consequences resultingfrom specific policies. That central fea-ture is to end the absolute entitlementto welfare, to end the detailed Federalregulation of the way in which welfarepolicies are administered by the State.to end the massive bureaucratic inter-ference with every detail of welfarepolicy, and to encourage\u2014for that mat-ter. to require\u2014a wide range of experi-mentation in welfare policies amongour 50 States.I suppose that States which reallywant to pay for even more generouswelfare systems than they have at thepresent time will be able to find a wayto do so, and that there may be a hand-ful of such States. Perhaps more sig-nificantly. those States that want toadopt tough work requirements will beable to do so. Those States that wantto providefor greater training andchild care will be able to do so. ThoseStates that want to impose strong dis-incentives against dependency will beable to do so.In fact, in a relatively short period oftime after the passage of this bill, wewill have 50 distinct and different sys-tems of welfare in the United States.We will learn just how much privatesector charities can and will do in thewelfare field. We know that in certainareas they have been magnificentlysuccessful at much lower cost than anygovernment-run program. How muchthat private sector effort can be in-creased we simply do not know at thepresent time, but we will learn as a re-sult of this bill.As a consequence. 5 years from nowor 10 years from now. I believe that wewill know far more about which wel-fare policies work and which do not.Perhaps we will even know enough tolead us wisely to a more centralizedsystemofadoptingthosepolicies which seem to have worked well. I sus-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEpect. I hope. and I think this 50-Stateexperimentation will probably be. suc-cessful enough so that our successorswill wish it to continue.Mr. President. I am gratified but notatallsurprisedthatapoll-drivenPresident of the United States hasagreed to sign this bill. That agree-ment means that we are talking here,debatinghere,somethingreal\u2014real changes in policy with a real impact onour society and on our citizens.It would be very diffictilt to do worsethan we have been doing over thecourse of the last several decades. Wehave a marvelous opportunity to do farbetter. The time has come to act. Theday is at hand on which we will act.I commend this magnificent new ex-periment to my colleagues.EXHIBIT 1[From the Washington Post. July 31, 1996)FOR BETrER OR WORSE?(By Robert J. Samuelson)We are now hearing a lot about the prom-ise and peril of \"welfare reform.\" To itschampions, the legislation nearing congres-sional approval would destroy the \"cultureof dependency.\" Critics see it as further im-poverishing many poor families. Both arecorrect.Theexercise aims to promote self-reliancebymaking it harderforpeopleto rely on government.Without the threat ofextrasuffering, people would have no reasonto change. What cant be predicted is how the goodandbad will balance.I have put \"welfare reform\" inquotes, pre- cisely because \"reform\"is a termofart. It is automatically attached to any scheme forsocial change. from campaign finance re-form' to \"school reform.\" In debates aboutthese proposals, the protagonists act as iftheycaneasily foretell the effects, for goodor ill. As oftenasnot, this convenient fictionspawns \"reforms\" with many unintendedconsequences. The process is now in full swing with \"welfare reform.'The combatants regularly issue confidentpredictions and shrill denunciations that de-pict a fixed future. Last week. for example,the -Urban Institute, a research group, re-leased a study estimating that the House-passed welfare bill would increase the num-ber of people in poverty by 2.6 million people.including 1.1 million children. Naturally, op-ponents of the legislation seized upon this toemphasize how bad it is. But a close look atthe study shows that its conclusions oughtto be highly qualified.The House and Senate bills would givestates great flexibility to run their welfareprograms within broad federal guidelines.Total lifetime federal benefits would be lim-ited to five years, though states could ex-empt 20 percent of their caseloads. Stateswould be pressured through complex regula-tions to move most mothers into some typeof 'work\" within two years. After makingsome assumptions about state programs. theUrban Institute study estimates that theloss of benefits would outweigh the increasein earnings from jobs.This could happen. The study's assump-tions aren't implausible. But uncertaintiesabound. First, the full rise of people in pov-erty would occur only in 2002 after all thebill's provisions took effect. Between nowand then. Congress(Or the states) couldmake changes if things went badly. This isespecially true of one of the bill's worst pro-visions: the denial of many benefits, includ-ing food stamps, to legal immigrants. Thatalone accounts for about two-fifths of thebills' benefit cuts.S9327Second. the increase in the poor would bemuch less\u2014only 800,000 and not 2.6 million\u2014if the Urban Institute had used the govern-ment's official definition of poverty. I citethis difference not because I think the UrbanInstitute deliberately inflated the impact of\"welfare reform\" but because it shows howperceptions can be shaped by somewhat arbi-trary statistics.(For numbers freaks. the difference arisesbecause the government definition countsonly cash income to determine who fallsbelow the poverty line: $15,141 for a family offour in 1994. Excluded are benefits such asfood stamps that substitute for cash. TheUrban Institute counts many of these bene-fits. As a result, the Urban Institute findsmany fewer poor people: but if welfare re-form cuts non-cash benefits, the impact onrecorded poverty is greater. Still, the num-ber of poor by the Urban Institute's count\u2014even after adding 2.6 million\u2014would be al-mOst 25 percent lower than under the govern-ment count).Statistics aside. what matters are people.Would more be made better or worse off by\"welfare reform\"? Unfortunately, we can'tanswer that,becausewe can't predict all of\"reform's\" effects. The Urban Institute ex-amines one aspect of change: the shift fromwelfare to work. The study assumes thattwo-thirds of mothers who lost welfare wouldget jobs\u2014many part-time\u2014paying about $6an hour. That wouldn't offset all the lostbenefits. But this may miss some other fa-vorable effects. Stingy welfare would dis-courage someout-of-wedlockbirthsand prompt some parents to marry. The main route off welfare for good is marriage,\" saysDouglas Besharov nor But the so-cial climate isshifting, and \"welfare re-form\" is simply a part of the change. Harsh-er welfare may reinforce the message thatmany teens are hearing elsewhere: and theimpact may be amplified by tougher enforce-ment of child support payments and moreprosecution for statutoty rape of older menwho prey on young 'welfare reform\"is that, despite many flaws. it would disruptthe existing system. As Mickey Kaus arguesin Newsweek, we may discover what worksand what doesn't. Some states would empha-size job training and child care for welfaremothers: others would impose harsh timelimits. All could be forced to examine howcharities, churches and self-help groups canbest aid vulnerable families. This process isalready occurring through 'waivers\" grant-ed to states to modif' existing federal rules:the legislation would give change further im-petus.Weought to be sober about the possibili-ties. We are dealing with the most stubbornproblems of poverty\u2014family breakdown, lowskills and human relationships. Changinghow people behave isn't easy. Indeed, newgovernment figures show that out-of-wed-lock births continue to rise, as Charles Mur-ray notes in the Weekly Standard. In 1994,they were 32.6 percent of all births, up from23 percent in1990.These numbers are an ar-gument for assaulting the status quo and areminder of how hard it will be to change.The remaining drama over the welfare billis mostly political: Will President Clintonsign it? And who then\u2014a Republican Con-gress or a Democratic president\u2014will get thecredit or blame for enacting or killing \"re-form'? However the drama ends, the welfaredilemma will endure. It is this: How can a S9328decent society protect those who can't pro-tect themselves without being so generousthat it subverts personal responsibility? Noone on either side of this bitter debate hasan obvious answer.Mr.WELLSTONEaddressedthe Chair.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER.The Chair recognizes the Senator from Min-nesota.Mr. WELLSTONE.

I wish to insertinto the RECoID an op-ed piece todayby Frances the New YorkTimes called \"From Workhouse toWorkfare.\"This is a very powerful piece. It con-cludes with the statement that the\"facts don't seem to matter' in the de-bate over this welfare bill. \"We mayhave to relive the misery and moraldisintegration of England in the 19thcentury to learn what happens whensociety desertsitsmost vulnerablemembers.\"That is the conclusion of this article.I ask unanimous consent that it beprinted in the CONGRESSIONAL 19thcenturyEngland, he might not have decidedto sign the welfare reform bill.Eminent English social thinkers developeda justification for an 1834 law that elimi-nated relief for the poor. Learned argumentsshowed that giving them even meager quan-tities of bread and coal harmed both thelarger society and the poor themselves.Never mmd the rapid enclosure by the richof commonly used agricultural land; nevermind the displacement of hand-loom weaversby mechanized factories; never mind the de-cline in the earnings of rural workers. Thereal causes of poverty and demoralizationwere not to be found in these large economicchanges, the thinkers said, but rather in thetoo-generous relief for the poor. The solutionwas to stop giving relief to people in theirown homes: instead, survival for the familymeant entering prison-like workhouses.The misery and reduced life spans that en-sued were well-documented not only by his-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEtoriansbut ultimately by Parliament. whichinvestigated the workhouses and the riotsagainst them. England came to learn thatthe theory that relief itself caused povertywas wrong, and replaced the Poor Law witha modern system of social assistance.No matter what England learned, the Unit-ed States Government is eagerly followingthe 1834 script by ending Federal responsibil-ity for welfare and turning it over to thestates. The arguments are the same: welfareencourages young women to quit school orwork and have out-of-wedlock babies. Onceon the doll these women become trapped independency, unable to summon the initiativeto get a job or to raise their children prop-erty. Welfare, in short is responsible for thespread of moral rot in society.Never mind low wages and irregular work:never mind the spreading social disorganiza-tion to which they lead: never mind changesin family and sexual norms occurring amongall classes and in all Western countries. Thesolution is to slash welfare, \"Tough love.\" itis said, will deter young women from havingbabies and force those already raising chil-dren to go to work.But slashing welfare does not create stablejobs or raise wages. It will have the oppositeeffect. By crowding the low-wage labor mar-ket with hundreds of thousands of desperatemothers, it will drive wages down.The basic economic realities of high unem-ployment levels and falling wages for less-educated workers; guarantee a clamaity inthe making\u2014and not only for welfare moth-ersIt is true that the United States has ahigher proportion of single-parent familiesthan other Western countries. But sinceother rich countries provide far more gener-ous assistance to single mothers, this veryfact suggests that welfare has little to dowith it.Other facts also argue against the welfare-causes-illegitimacy argument. Most obvious,welfare benefits set by the states have de-clined sharply since 1975. while the out-of.wedlock birth rate has risen nationwide. Inaddition, there is no discernible relationshipbetween the widely varying levels of benefitsprovided by the states and the out-of-wed-lock birth rates in the states.But fact don't seem to matter. We mayhavetorelivethemiseryandmoral distintegration of England in the 19th cen-tury to learn with happens when a societydeserts its most vulnerable members.Mr.WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.I suggest the absence of a quorum.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER.The clerk will call the roll.The legislative clerk proceeded tocall the roll.Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection. it is so ordered.Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yes-terday, after the President announcedhe would sign this legislation. I said:\"The President has made his decision.Let us hope that it is for the best.\"Today, I continue to hope for thebest. even if I fear the worst.As I have stated on this floor manytimes, this legislation does not reformaid to families with dependent chil-dren: it simply abolishes it. It termi-nates the basic Federal commitment of.support for dependent children in hopes'of altering the behavior of their moth-ers. We are putting those children atAugust 1, 1996risk with absolutely no evidence thatthis radical idea has even the slightestchance of success.In our haste to enact this bill\u2014anybill\u2014before the November elections. wehave chosen to ignore what little we doknow about the subject of poverty.Just 2 days ago. on July 30, 11 of theNation's leading researchers in thisfield issued a st-atement urging us notto do this. Among them were sevencurrent and former directors of the In-stitute for Research on Poverty at theUniversity of Wisconsin established inthe aftermath of the Economic Oppor-tunity Act of 1964. Scholars of the stat-ure of Sheldon Danziger of the Michigan. They write:As researcherswho have dedicated years tothe study of poverty, the labor market, andpublic assistance, we oppose the welfare re-form legislation under consideration by Con-gress. The best available evidence is thatthis legislation would substantially increasepoverty and destitution while doing too lit-tle to change the welfare system to one thatprovides greater opportunity for families inreturn for demanding greater responsibility.Real welfare refoi-n, would not impose deepfood stamp cuts on poor families with chil-dren, the working poor, the elderly the dis-abled, and the unemployed. It would noteliminate the safety net for most poor legalimmigrants, including the very old and theinfirm. It would not place at risk poor chil-dren whose parents are willing to work butare unable to find unsubsidized employment.It would not back up work requirementswith the resources needed to make them ef-fective,We strongly support an overhaul of the na-tion's welfare system. But the pending legis-lation will make a troubled welfare systemworse. It is not meaningful welfare reform. Itshould not become law.Irepeat what these social scientistshave concluded: \"The best availableevidence this poverty arid des-titution.\"Whatistheevidence?Dr.Paul Offner, the distinguished Commissionerof Health Care Finance for the Districtof Columbia, summarized it nicely lastweek. Respected research organizationssuch as the Urban Institute here inWashington, and the Manpower Dem-onstrationResearch Corporationin New York have, over the years. under-taken careful evaluations of variouswelfare reform demonstration projects.As Offner recounts, they found thatwelfare caseloads were reduced in only4 of the 23 welfare demonstrations theystudied.Dr. Offner points out that even theprogram in Riverside. CA, which is re-garded by many experts as the mostsuccessful ever. has achieved caseloadreductions of less than 10 percent.This should not surprise us: it is noteasy to change human behavior. Not-withstanding this fact. the premise ofthis legislation is that the behavior ofcertain adults can be changed by mak-ingthelivesoftheirchildrenas August 1, 1996wretched as possible. This is a fear-some assumption. In my view. It is cer-tainly not a conservative one.If we acknowledge the difficulty inbringing about the transition from wel-fare to work, we must recognize thatputting people to work on a large scalewould require a large-scale public jobsprogram, and that would require agreat deal of money.Let me say that Democrats were thefirst to fail in this regard. In the com-pany of Sargent Shriver and AdamYarmolinsky, I attended the Cabinetmeeting in the spring of 1964 where wepresented the plans for a war on pov-erty. Our principal proposal, backed bySecretary of Labor Willard Wirtz, wasa massive jobs program, along WorksProgress Administration lines, to be fi-nanced by a cigarette tax. PresidentJohnson listened for a moment or two:announced that in that election yearwe were cutting taxes,not raisingthem. He thereupon picked up the tele-phone attached to the Cabinet table.calledsomeone,somewhere,about something else, and the war on povertywas lost before it began.This legislation is even worse.In fact, this legislation provides some$55 billion less over the next 6 years.There are work requirements in thebill, but we seem tacitly willing toadmit they will never be met. Dr. JuneO'Neill, Director of the CongressionalBudget Office, has been most forthcom-ing on this subject. The CBO report onthis bill bluntly states thatGiven the costs and administrative com-plexities involved, CBO assumes that moststates would simply accept penalties ratherthan implement the Iwork] requirements.What else does the evidence show? Itshows quite clearly that the centralfeature of this legislation, the timelimit, will affect millions of children.CBO estimates that \"under current de-mographic assumptions, this provisioncould reduce cash assistance rolls by 30to 40 percent\" within the decade. I should say that again: 30 to 40 percentof the caseload will be Cut off in lessthan 10 years' time.Let me put that in terms of howmany children will be cut off. Accord-ing to the Urban Institute. 3,500.000children will be dropped from the rollsin 2001. By 2005. 4,896,000 children willbe cut off.The Urban Institute has also esti-mated, in a report released just lastFriday. July 26.that this billwill cause 2.6 million persons to fall belowthe poverty line:1.1 million of thoseimpoverished will be children. To saynothing of those persons already livingin poverty. They will be pushed evenfurther below the poverty line: The av-erae loss in income for families al-ready below the poverty line will beSl.040 per year. I note that the UrbanInstitute's estimates are based on quiteconservative assumptions. so the ac-tual impact could well be even worsethan predicted.I cite this evidence because it is im-portant that we cast our votes with fullCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEknowledge of the consequences. Thisinformation has been widely available,and I have made these arguments onthe floor previously. so I believe we areall on notice of the implications forchildren.The implications of this legislationfor our State and local governmentsare another matter. These are notwidely known, but they will be veryreal indeed. On Thursday of last week,2 days after the Senate passed its ver-sion of this legislaton. I received inthe mail a four-page letter from theHonorable Rudolph W. Giuliani, mayorof the city of New York. He wrote ofhis -concern that the major provisionsof the bill would impose huge new costson New York City totaling some $900million per year. The mayor listed theadded costs to New York City as fol-lows: $380 million for child care for wel-fare recipients: for aid tolegal immigrants; $100 million persons dropped to time limits; $100 million forwork programs.Mayor Giuliani wrote that the bill'sban on Federal assistance for legal im-migrants was of particular concern toNew York City. where 30 percent of thepopulation is foreign-born.The sum of $900 million a year is alot of money. New York City's totalannual budget is $33 billion. And other,smaller local governments will also behit hard.The total additional cost to NewYork State will be in the neighborhoodof $1.3 billion per year. We estimate theloss of Federal funds to some of ourlargercountiesasfollows:Albany County $15 million: Erie million.These are sums that New York Stateand New York City simply cannot af-ford. It will be ruinous for us. In Marchof this year, the New York State Fi-nancial Control Board reported that\"the city's finances continue to dete-riorate.\" The board said that over thenext 4 years, the growth in New YorkCity's spending will be more than dou-ble the growth in its income. Spendingwill grow by approximately 2 percentper year, while revenues will grow byless than 1 percent. In the absence ofthis welfare legislation, the gap be-tween the city's outlays and revenueswill increase by $400 million annually.With the new additional costs imposedby this bill, the annual increase in theshortfall will more than triple.New York will not be alone in this, ofcourse. Senator FEINSTEIN said on thefloor last week that the bill will costCalifornia $17 billion over 6 years. orabout$3billionannually.Other States\u2014Illinois.Texas,Florida\u2014willalso bear immense flew burdens. I won-der if they are ready for what is com-ing.More importantly. I wonder if theNation is ready for the social changethislegislation willsetin motion.There are great issues of principle atS9329stake here. as leaders of the religiouscommunity have said with such clarityand force. Bishop Anthony M. Pilla,president of the National Conference ofCatholic Bishops. wrote to the Presi-dent on Friday to urge that this bill bevetoed. Quoting St. Matthew's Gospel,Bishop Pilla wrote that \"the moralmeasure of our society is how we treat'the least among us.'\"I know what the outcome will betoday, but before we cast our votes, Ihope Senators will ask themselves howthis legislation will treat the leastamong us.I began these remarks with a com-ment on language. The conference re-port before us is not welfare reform, itis welfare repeal. It is the first step indismantling the social contract thathas been in place in the United Statessince at least the 1930's. Do not doubtthat Social Security itself, which is tosay insured retirement benefits, will benext. The bill will be called the Indi-vidual Retirement Account InsuranceAct.Somethingsuch.John Westergaard points out that this legis-lation breaks the social contract of the1930's. We would care for the elderly,the unemployed. the dependent chil-dren. Drop the latter: watch the othersfall.Fred C. Ikie has coined the fine term\"semantic infiltration\" to describe thetechniqueininternational relationswhereby one party persuades anotherto use its terms to discuss the issuesbeing negotiated. We now have its do-mestic counterpart in egregious dis-play. Recalling George Orwell's essay,\"Politics and the English Language,\"we would do well to be wary. HenryFriedlander has reminded us recentlyof the stages by which genocide evolvedfrom the soothing and supportive no-tion of euthanasia.And so to one other matter of lan-guage. We are told that this legislationis a defeat for liberals. We are assuredin private, and it is hinted at in print,that many of the President's most lib-eral advisers opposed this legislation.Liberals are said to have lost.This is nonsense. It is conservativeswho have lost.For the best part of 2 years now. Ihave pointed out that the principal\u2014and most principled\u2014opponents of thislegislationwere conservativesocial scientists who for years have arguedagainst liberal nosti-ums for changingsociety with the argument that no oneknowsenoughtomechanisticallychangesociety.Typicallyliberals think otherwise: to the extent that lib-erals can be said to think at all. Thecurrent batch in the White House, nowbusily assuring us they were againstthis all along, are simply lying. albeitthey probably don't know when theyare lying. They have only the flimsiestgrasp of social reality; thinking allthings doable and equally undoable. As.for example, the horror of this legisla-tion. By contrast, the conservative so-cial scientists\u2014James Q. Wilson, Law-rence Mead, John Delulio. William S9330Bennett\u2014havewarned over and overthat this is radical legislation. with al-together unforeseeable consequences.many of which will surely be loath-some.All honor to them. They have kept totheir principles. Honor on high as wellto the Catholic bishops, who admit-tedly have an easier task with matters.of this sort. When principles are atissue, they simply look them up. Toomany liberals, alas, simply make themup.Mr. President. I thank the Senate forits courteous attention.I thank myfriend from Minnesota for reservingthis time for me. seeing to it I was ableto speak. and I yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER(Mr. Ir4HOFE).

I hope youcan contact us and see if we can ar-range it so there are no big lulls on thefloor and we can get our work done assoon as possible.Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Missouri.Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator fromNew Mexico for yielding me the time.Our responsibility in acting on afailed welfare system is as profound aresponsibility in responding to the peo-ple of this country as we have ever had.The fundamental role and responsibil-ity of Government is to call people totheir highest and best, not trap themat their lowest and least.In spite of the good intentions of thewelfare program. which we have pouredbillions of dollars into. hundreds of bil-lions of dollars, we have ended up trap-ping people at their lowest and leastrather than calling people or prompt-ing people to their highest and best.The real objective of our legislationhere ought to be to change the char-acter of welfare. We need to change itfrom a system which has provided ca-reers and conditions that lasted a life-time to a system that instead of pro-viding a condition provides a transi-tion, that moves people from povertyinto opportunity, that moves peoplefromindolenceintoindustry,that moves people from welfare into work.No longer can we afford a system thatnot only provides people a condition ora career, but goes beyond trapping in-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEdividuals and goes to trapping genera-tions.One of the real problems of our wel-fare system is that we have childrenwho are trapped in welfare and they be-come welfarecareeriststhemselves,and their children are thn trapped inwelfare. The truth of the matter is thatthe prisoners of war in the war on pov-erty have been the children of America.There are more children in povertytoday than there were when we startedthe war on poverty, and it is a clear in-dication that the system is a tragicfailure as it relates to human beings\u2014children who have lost their lives, chil-dren who have lost their opportunity.children who have lost their spirit.children who fall into a net which wasdesigned to save them. but instead be-comes a net to ensnare them.A good industrialist friend of minesays that your system is perfectly de-signed to give you what you are get-ting. I do not know anyone in Americawho believes that what we are gettingis the right thing. We are getting high-er rates of illegitimacy. We are gettinghigher rates of dependency. We arefinding ourselves with individuals stay-ing on welfare longer and longer peri-ods of time. Is that what we want? Iswhat we are getting what we need? Ab-solutely not.The system may not have been in-tended to give us what we are getting,but the design of the system is whatcauses us to get what we are getting.and it is our responsibility, it is a sa-cred charge of ours given to us by theAmerican people. and they have madeitfundamentally and unmistakablyclear that they want different out-comes. they want different results. They do not want more dependency.they do not want more illegitimacy.they do not want more careers and gen-eratioris on welfare.They want less, because they wantpeople to be free. They want childrento have an opportunity to look towardthe U.S. Senate or toward the Presi-dency or toward being a captain of in-dustry or developing their own busi-ness. They do not want people trappedinanintergenerationalnetof ensnarement, rather than a net of safe-ty.So it is incumbent upon us to makefundamentalchanges.fundamentalchanges in the way this system treatspeople.We can no longer allow Governmentto be the instrument of ensnarement,of entrapment. We must make Govern-ment an instrument of liberation, ofopportunity. of industry and develop-ment. That is why it is so importantthat we end this one-size-fits-all Wash-ington approach which says that every-body will respond the same and all thesystems are to be uniform. and movewelfare programs back to the Statesand allow them to experiment and dowhat works.I often laugh when I think of the one-size-fits-all term. We have almost cometo believe it. Can you imagine If weAugust 1, 1996were to send off for a catalog and get acatalog that said, 'One size of pajamasfits all for your family\"? I know whatwould happen in my family. We wouldget five pairs of pajamas. They wouldbe one size but they would fit none be-cause we are pretty different.The great family of America is dif-ferent. States and communities havedifferentcharacteristicsandat- tributes, and they need to be able toshape. to tailor, to fashion what theydo from a block grant that gives thembroad discretion and authority. Yes.they need for the block grant to be lim-ited. They need to have the energy oflimited resources to drive the creativ-ity of solving the problem.No one ever solved a problem whenthe supply was infinite. No one everworks to conserve energy as long as itis free. You start to pay the heatingbill and you learn to close the door,you learn to shut the windows, youlearn to caulk the cracks. And when weput limits on the amount of money weare going to spend on welfare. we willstart caulking the cracks and startstopping up the places where we haveleakage. And it is not a leakage finan-cially. We are talking about leakage ofthe great human resource of America.We are looking at the Olympics. Boy.they areinspiring.But how muchchance would we have in basketball orvolleyball or baseball if we did not sendour full team onto the field, if we toldsome of them.

August 1,1996Hehasa phrase. \"experienceis what you get when you expectedsomething else.\"Overthe last30years. I think weexpected something else from this so-called WaronPovertyand Great Soci-ety program, but we got something dif-ferent from what we expected. We gotchildren without fathers and we gothomes without dicipline and we gotstreets without safety and we got gen-erations locked\u2014locked\u2014out of oppor-tunity. without education.We expected something different. Butour experience is what we got. And our experience has not been very positive.But I want you to know that therehave been a few bright lights over thelast 30 years that signal to us how wecould maIe changes, how we could ac-tually change the behavior of people.how we could help them move frombeing dependent to being independent.the glorious state of liberty and free-dom, what America is all about.Those bright lights have been in thenongovernmentalsectorprimarily.They have been the Salvation Army.the Boys and Girls Clubs, the missions,and homeless shelters that have beenrun by the nongovernmental entitieswho are energized by a calling which isbeyond the calling of duty that comesfrom government. It is a calling of hu-manity that God stirs in our hearts.One of the primary features of thisbill is that States will be allowed tocontract with organizations like theBoys and Girls Clubs and the SalvationArmy andcharitableorganizationsthat specialize in hope and opportunityand who care, who care for the peopletrapped on welfare, not just as welfarestatistics, but care for them after theyleave the condition of welfare. Thesegroups have a lifelong interest in help-ing people make it all the way to thetop. notjust over the threshold.I have to say that our experiencetells us that not everyone in the wel-fare system has wanted to see everyoneleave the system. Sometimes we havehad too much interest in how manypeople we could have on welfare in-stead of how many people we couldmove off welfare.Significantly, theprovisions of this bill would allow char-itable and even faith-based operationsto compete for contracts or to partici-pate in voucher programs to help peo-ple. It does it with safeguards, so thatif a person is offended by virtue ofbeing involved with a faith-based orga-nization, they would be free to gettheir assistance from some other pro-vider.These faith-based organizations havein the past\u2014many times the smallerones who did not have large legal de-partments\u2014have been afraid of accept-ing governmental fundsin order tohelp the poor.

He's ar-gued both for changes, such as work require.ments and time limits, and for preservationof welfare's protections for poor children.It's understandable that congressional Re-publicans would want their final-offer, election-year welfare bill to force the presidentto show his true stripes. Theyve crafted abill that ought to dojust that.The bill that's moving toward the Houseand Senate floors is one Clinton might betempted to sign for political reasons. But heshould vetoit.for moral reasons,If he doesnt, he will have put the lie to all hisclaims of concern for the well-being of thenation's most vulnerable children.S9331 [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, July 22.1996]REFORM ON THE CHEAPWho'll blink on this latest shot at changingwelfare? And, in the long run, who'll windup paying for it?Voters liked Bill Clinton's promise to Sendwelfare as we know it.\" So Republicans areaching to show he didnt mean it. The resultis a game of political chicken that's far morelikely to hurt poor Americans than to upliftthem.The Republican Congress is about to darethe President to veto a wrong-headed billthat would cut welfare spending, toughen therules, and shift a lot of decision-making tothe states. Since this would be his thirdstraight veto of a so-called welfare reformbill. Mr. Clinton may blink. Its possiblehe'll sign a bill that pretends the feds canturn welfare into a helpful. job-oriented net-work even as they squeeze about $10 billiona year in savings from the system. That's apipe dream.Unfortunately, if he does veto it and a bet-ter. bipartisan plan doesn't emerge. Mr. Clin-ton will have to follow through on a promisethat he made last week to give himself polit-ical cover on this emotional issue. Absent abill, he vowed to issue an executive order let-ting states cut off benefits after two years.The terms of this order are still in theworks. But it could let penny-pinching statesgive welfare recipients far too little help to-ward employment and self-sufficiency.Ijust want to say that this bill is the For all its reformist window-dressing, thebill that emerged from conference commit-tee Monday is too hard on America's poor. Itdoesnt spend enough money to hold the lineagainst hunger, or to make workable the re-quirement that ajob take the place of wel-fare within two years after benefits start.The bill's goal of quickly replacing welfarechecks with paychecks is something mostAmericans support. But making that happenin a way that gives poor families lasting self-sufficiency takes r\u00f1ore than the hammer of atime limit. It takes job training. counseling.public-works jobs where private employmentis unavailable, child care and transportation.Those tools cost money. This bill doesn'tprovide it.As a result, in the name of overcomingpoverty, this bill would likely push some ofAmericas least employable adults and theirchildren into more desperate circumstances.And, because of the bill's big cuts in food-stamp spending, that desperation could wellinclude hunger. Admittedly, the food-stampprovisions in the final bill aren't as extremeas earlier versions. A guarantee of food-stamp eligibility\u2014though not of food-stampamounts\u2014was preserved for families withchildren. No so for unemployed adults with-out dependents. They'd be cut off from thegovernment's food lifeline after six months.The welfare bill isespeciallypunitive to- ward legal immigrants. Under this legisla-tion, the nation's official message to its le.gitimate newcomers would be. You are wel- come only as long as you remain gainfullyemployed.\" A down-on-his-luck immigrantcould get no cash assistance whatsoeverfrom his new country.Had Clinton more boldly taken sides in thenation's welfare debate earlier in his presi-dency, a bill this harsh might not be headingtoward his desk afew months before an elec-tion. He should have been calling all alongfor more realistic and compassionate reform,the kind that spends more in the short termin order to redeem lives in the long term.Here's hoping Clinton has learned thatpresidentialequivocationcarriesahigh price\u2014and that his equivocation on welfareends with a forthright veto of the bill Con-gress is about to send him. S9332That'sthe basic problemwith what Con-gress is cooking up. It pretends that helpingpoor peoplebecome self-sufficient doesntcostmore money in the cost more,for childcare, fortraining.forgovernment-createdjobsfor thosewho can't find work in private sector. Com-mittedreformerssuchasCoy. TommyThompson. the Wisconsin Republican, areup-frontabout this.Chances are, the public willrespondposi- tively to major parts of the GOP package,such as benefits to be an employer oflast resort.Bypromisingto act on his own, Mr. Clin-ton was trying to show Republicans that\u2014politically\u2014they needa welfare bill morethanhe does. He was trying to coax Repub-licans toward compromise.The House did consider a bipartisan plansponsored by Reps.MikeCastle (R.,Del.) and JohnTanner(D..Tenn.)\u2014aplanwhosespending cuts weren'tsoextreme. But and line upwithMr. Castle.Since Republicansseem uninterestedinasensible,bipartisanreform,Mr.Clintonshould get his veto pen ready. As for the ex- ecutive order he promised\u2014every bit the p0-litical gimmick that Republicans charged\u2014it should be loaded with conditions to pro-tect poor families from politicians peddlingwelfare reform on a dime.fFrom the Washington Post. July 25, 1996jA CHILDREN'S VETO'I just don't want to doanythingthat hurtskids,\"President Clinton said asthe Senate passed its supposed reform of welfarethe other day. Why did the sentence strikeus as yet another cynical manipulation ofthe welfare issue for political purposes? Be-cause if Mr. Clinton were determined not tohurt children, he would have indicated daysago that he intended to veto this legislationor any bill remotely like it.Instead, he. the Senate's Democrats andmoderate Republicans continued to try toprettify the bill around the edges. A coupleof the amendments that they succeeded inmaking were consequential. and they mayyet make more in conference. Rut mainlythese are marginal and cosmetic changes.They are sops to conscience meant to justifya regressive vote that for political reasonsthese politicians are afraid not to cast. Theyare determined to vote in this selection yearin favor of a bill that bears the label \"wel-fare reformS'; it doesn't matter that the labelis not deserved.The president and his followers are theprisonersoffour years of sloganeering on thesubject that he himself set off. It was hewho, in an effort to preempt the welfareissue and show himself to be a different kindof Democrat, famously promised in the 1992campaign to end the system as we know it.He set off a process that hecould not con- trol, in part because he has been unwilling totake the toughandunpopular positions nec-essary to controlit.Noone\u2014or very few, anyway\u2014would arguethat the cur-rent welfare system is a goodone.Mr. Clinton was and remains right totryto change it. But his original position alsowas right\u2014that the change should in-volve equal amounts of added pressure onwelfaremothers to go to work and additionalresources to help them make the move suc-cessfully. The cur-rent bills fail to providethe resources: they walk away from the sec-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEondhalfof the strategy.Theywould disman- tle the federal program, limit futurefederal aid andshift tothe statesafinancial burden thatmanystateswillfind hard to meet.

Ifinstead he signs the bill, he no doubt willclaim it as a triumph, butinmoral and pol-icyterms it will be the low point of his presi-dency.tFrom the Buffalo, NY News. July 23, 19961DON'T LET RUSH TO WELFARE 'REFORM'LEAVE SOME OF NEEDY WITHOUT HELPWhat if time limit is reached and there's nojob toget?In his eagerness to outflank Republicansonthe thing billed as 'reform,\" President Clintonshould resist the urge to abandon the long-establishedconcept that there is a nationalinterest in helping the poor become self-suf-ficient.That is the chief danger now as Washing-ton's warring factionsundertakea mad scramble to produce some sort of welfare leg-islation before taking time off to go into fullcampaign mode.The Republican-led Congress made sensiblewelfare legislation a little more possible lastweek by dropping plans to attach Medicaidreform to the welfare bill and to turn Medic-aid into a block-grantprogramcontrolled by the states.Endingthe guarantee of medical care forthe poor never made any sense because theimpoverished deserve health care as much asthey deserve help with life's other basic ne-cessities.Rut it also doesn't make any sense to endthe federal guarantee of food and other aidfor those who play by the rules and whoseonly offense is that they're impoverished.Nor does imposing time limits on welfarerecipients make sense except in cases wherethey refuse to work even though a job isavailable. The poor\u2014and their children\u2014should notbeblamed for economic cyclesthat may well make finding ajob impossibleat any given time.Those are bedrock principles that the na-tion\u2014and the president\u2014should not forsake amid an understandable distaste for thesmall percentage of welfare recipients whoare slackers.Unfortunately. the House the other daycast aside those principles by passing a re-August 1, 1996form plan that ends welfareas all would slashfunding and turn the reduced moneyover to states in block grants.Thestatescould then structure programslargelyas they please, ending the nationalsafety net and competing with one anotherin a \"race to the bottom\" as they cut bene- fits and drive Out the poor.That's nowayfo,ranenlightened nation toliftits most vulnerable people. But the finalbill that emerges from House-Senate nego-tiations seems sure now to take that tack.The other failure of the GOP approach isits time limits regardless ofjob availability.Clinton, too,recentlyendorsed time limits.saying the White House will administra-tively impose a two-year limit but that hisaction would be unnecessary if Congresscould produce an acceptable reform plan.Details of the new White House initiative\u2014suchas how to protect children whose par-ents get cutoff\u2014haveyettobeworked Out.Rutin addition to safeguarding kids, the new rule shouldsafeguard those who simply cantfind work through no fault of their own.Thesebasic safeguardsshould bepart ofwhateverreform bill ultimately reaches thepresidents desk. If they are not, he shoulduse the same veto pen he's waved at othertimes\u2014regardless of what the calender saysabout the election season.IFrom the Atlanta Constitution, July 28.1996jWELFARE BILLS SUFFER FROM POLITICSThe welfare system must be reformed, andthe goal of that reform must be twofold:It must reinforce a work ethic that has fal-tered among some welfare recipientsIt must protect the children of poor Ameri-cans from hunger anddeprivation inan in- creasingly fickle economy.Unfortunately, the reform effort makingits Congress\u2014the rewards of thework ethic seem obvious. It gives you a six-figure salary, a taxpayer-provided staff andfree parking. casecan in an inner cityor isolatedruralarea, where jobs are scarceand transportation difficult. If the motherovercomes those obstacles and gets a job,andif she works 40 hours per week. everyweek of the year at $5.10 an hour\u2014which is 20percentabovetheminimum wage\u2014shestandstomake agrand totalof $10,608 a year. In the process. she may also lose healthinsurance for her family, because most low-wage jobs do not include a benefits package.Imagine trying to ratse two childrenonSl0.000 a year in today's economy. Child carealone would take a hugechunk of herpay. She has the option. of course. of choosingnot to pay for child care, to leave her chil-dren on their own while she's working. Givenour problems with juvenile crime, that's nota choice toencourage.If welfare reform is to work, it has to makework a viable option. It must subsidize childcare for thatworking mother. Itmust ex- tendhealthinsurance coverage for the work-ingpoor. And itmust offertraining and edu-cation, so that she has at least the hope ofrising Out of that $5.10-an-hour job intosomething better.Some of those stepscostmoney, at least inthe short term. In thelong term,suchre- form will benefit the mother; benefit her August 1, 1996children, to whom she is a role model: andbenefit society, which is currently losing thevalue of her labor and incurring the expenseof supporting her and her children.The House and Senate have passed sepa-rate but similar welfare bills, and are tryingto resolve their differences and send a meas-ure to President Clinton for his signature.Their effort is fatally flawed, however, be-cause in addition to the goals listed above.Congress is using the legislation to pursuetwo less admirable goals.It is trying to balance the budget on thebacks of the poor. Even though true welfarereform will cost more money in the shortterm, and even though entitlement programsfor the middle class are far more expensivethan welfare programs, deficit cutters havefocused on the poor, cutting $80 billion fromfood stamps and other programs over thenext stx years.The bill is calculated as an election-yeardare to Clinton. He has made clear his un-easiness with the bill's impact on poor chil-dren, but has nonetheless indicated a will-ingness to consider signing theSenate's more reasonable approach. But Republicansseem intent on forcing him to veto the legis-lation, As Bob Dole grumbled on the cam-paign trail, \"He's not going to get that bill.He's going to get a tougher bill,\"And as House Speaker Newt Gingrich putit,I believe we win from this point on nomatter what happens.'Welfare reform is important. but appar-ently less important than election-year poli-ticking.IFrom the Chicago Tribune, July 21. 1996JPLAYING'GOTCHA!'ON WELFARE REFORMThe House passed a new welfare bill Thurs-day. and the talk afterward was not of whatthe bill would mean for the children andadults who depend on the kindness of thetaxpayers. but of a political calculus,\"In the end.' said House Majority LeaderDick Armey, 'the president is going to haveto make a determination whether or not he'sgoing to sign this bill and satisfy the Amer-ican people while he alienates his left-wingpolitical base, or if he's going to veto the billin order to satisfy the left wing of the Demo-crat Party and thereby alienate the Amer-ican people.\"In other words, \"Gotcha!\"And that pretty much captures what's beenwrong from the beginning with the effort tolegislate welfare reform. Clinton has ex-ploited the issue to establish his bona fldesas a \"new Democrat,\" The Republicans, sus-pecting insincerity on Clinton's part. haveused it to bash him and back him into a cor-ner.Suffusing the entire debate have been twonotions, one simply wrongheaded and theother both wrongheaded and pernicious.The first is that reforming welfare is a wayto save money. It is not. at least initially.Done properly\u2014that is, with the purpose ofgetting welfare parents into the work force\u2014.reform will actually cost more money, forjob training, child care and so forth. (Andwhatever else the 9 million children on wel-fare suffer from, it is not from having toomuch money spent on them.)The second notion, which partisans on nei-ther side have'done enough to counter, isthat welfare reform is about getting blacklayabouts off the public dole. In fact, mostwelfare recipients are not black, But thatcontinues to be the accepted stereotype and,one suspects, a substantial motivator of thewelfare-reform push.Inits broad outlines, the newly passedHouse bill differs little from the measurethat Clinton vetoed earlier this year. It endswelfare as a federal entitlement and convertsit into a program of block grants to thestates. which would befree, within verybroad limits, to devise their own programs ofpoor support.This devolution is a good idea, Clinton hasacknowledged that implicitly by grantingnumerous waivers for state welfare experi-ments over the last 3\u00bd years. Perhaps themost promising such experiment. Wiscon-sin's W-2 program, which substitutes privateand public jobs for cash assistance and oughtto be the paradigm for all welfare, is await-ing waiver approval even now. -Buteliminating welfare's entitlement sta-tus is a grievous error of historic propor-tions, Indeed, Sen. Carol Mosely-Braum (D-ill.) did not exaggerate when she called it an\"abomination.\"That the world's richest nation would notguarantee help for poor children\u2014and Aid toFamilies With Dependent Children is noth-ing except a vast chiidcare program\u2014is Out-rageous. It represents not progress but re-gression. And while Dick Armey may be con-vinced that that's what the American peoplewant, we are not.Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do want to talk about this piece of leg-islation, I have heard some discussionabout doing good. Let me start outwith what is a very important frame-work to me as a Senator from Min-nesota. It is a question. Will this legis-lation, if passed, signed into law by thePresident,create more poverty andmore hunger among children in Amer-ica? And if the answer to that questionis yes, then my vote is no.Mr. President, we .were discussingwelfare reform several years ago, andwe said that we should move from wel-fare to work, that that would includejob training, education training, mak-ing sure the jobs were available thatsingle parents\u2014mostly mothers\u2014couldsupport their children on, and a com-mitment to child care.Just about every single scholar inthe United States of America has saidthat this is what reform is all about.You have to invest some additional re-sources, Then, in the long run, not onlyare the mothers arid children better off,but we are all better off. That is realwelfare reform. Slashing close to $60billion in low-income assistance is notreform, colleagues. It is punitive, it isharsh, and it is extreme.Mr. President. we have been focusingin this Congress on the budget deficit,I think, today. what we see in the U.S.Senate is a spiritual deficit because,Mr. President, I know some of my col-leagues do not want to look at this.They push their gaze away from un-pleasant facts and an unpleasant re-ality. Sometimes people do not want toknow what they do not want to know,Mr. President, the evidence is irref-utable and irreducible: This legisla-tion, once enacted into law, will createmore poverty and hunger among chil-dren in America. That is not reform.Mr. President, we have here about $28billion of cuts in nutrition assistance. Ibelieve when the President spoke yes-terday he was trying to say that doesnot have anything to do with reform,and he intends to fix that next Con-gress, But I worry about what will hap-S9333pennow. Mr. President. 70 percent ofthe citizens that will be affected bythese cuts in food nutrition programsare children, 50 percent of the familieshave incomes of under $6,300 a year.Our incomes are $130,000 a year.Mr. President. there will be a $3 bil-lion cut over the next 6 years in foodassistance, nutrition assistance, evenfor families who pay over 50 percent oftheir monthly incomeforhousingcosts. So now we put families in ourcountry\u2014poor families, poor children\u2014in the situation of \"eat or heat,\" butthey do not get both. At the sametime, my colleagues keep wanting tocut low-income energy assistance pro-grams. This is goodness? This is good-ness?Mr. President, I was involved in theanti-hunger struggles in the South. Isaw it in North Carolina, and I remindmy colleagues, maybe they want to goback and look at the expos\u00e9s, look atthe Field Foundation report, look atthe CBS report, \"Hunger USA,\" Whereare the national media? Why are wenot seeing documentaries right nowabout poverty in America?Mr. President, the Food Stamp Pro-gram, which we dramatically expandedin the late 1960's and early 1970's, withRichard Nixon, a Republican, leadingthe way, has been the most effectiveand important safety-net practice inthis country. As a result of expandingthat program, we dramatically reducehunger and malnutrition among chil-dren in America.Now we are turning the clock back,and some of my colleagues are callingthis reform. Mr. President, how did itget to be reform, to cut by 20 percentfood nutrition assistance for a poor, 80-year-old woman? How dare you call itreform. That is not reform. How did itget to be reform to slash nutrition pro-grams that are so important in makingsure that children have an adequatediet? How dare you call it reform. Thatis not reform, How did it get to be re\u2014form to essentially eliminate all of theassistance for legal immigrants, peoplewho pay taxes and work? How dare youcall that reform. That has not a thingto do with reform.The Urban Institute came out with areport several weeks ago. Isabel Saw-hill, one of the very best, said this leg-islation will impoverish an additionalii million children. We have had theseanalyses before. The Office of Manage\u2014ment and Budget had a similar analy-sis. So did the Department of Healthand Human Services. How dare you calla piece of legislation that will lead tomore poverty among children in Amer-ica reform?Marian Wright Edelman of the Chil-dren's Defense Fund is right: To callthis piece of legislation reform is likecalling catsup a vegetable. Except thistime it is more serious. because manymore children. many more elderly,many more children with disabilitieswill be affected,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE S9334Mr.President, the evidence is reallyirreducible and irrefutable. Bob Green-stein, who has won the MacArthur Ge-nius Award for his work, crunched thenumbers about what it means in per-sonal terms, real terms for the mostvulnerable citizens in America, but mycolleagues are too worried about polls.They are too worried about the politicsof it, and they turn their gaze awayfrom all this.Mr. President, I do not particularlycare about words like \"entitlement.\"But I do think as a nation we are acommunity, and up until the passage ofthis legislation, if signed into law, weas a nation said, as a community wewill make sure there is a floor beneathwhich no child can fall in America.Now we have eliminated that floor. Weare now saying as a Senate that therewill no longer be any floor beneathwhich no child can fall. Arid you callthat reform?Mr. President, we had a proposal outhere on the floor of the Senate thatsaid, if you are going to cut people offfrom work, if you are going to cut peo-ple off from welfare, at least requirethe States to provide vouchers. TheCBO tells us we do not have the moneyfor the job training slots, and peoplewill not necessarily find work, andthen you will cut the adult off work.So we added an amendment that said,\"For God's sake, at least make surethere are vouchers for Pampers, forhealth care, for food for the children.\"That amendment was rejected.So we have no requirement that atthe very minimum, even if you aregoing to cut a parent off of welfare, atleast make sure the law of the landsays that every State from Mississippito Missouri to Minnesota to Californiato Georgia, that at least there will bevouchers for Pampers, for food, formedical assistance, and you vote 'no\"and you say there will be no vouchers.And you call that reform?Mr. President, in the Senate, I intro-duced an amendment, and it was ac-cepted. It said in all too many cases,too many of these women have beenvictims of domestic violence, they havebeen battered, and welfare is the onlyalternative for too many women to avery abusive and dangerous situationat home. So every State will be re-quiredtohaveservicesforthese women and not force people off therolls if, in fact, there needs to be addi-tional support.It took Monica Seles 2 years to playtennis again after she was attacked.Imagine what it would be like to bebeaten up over and over again. Thatamendment was knocked out in theconference\u2014no national requirement,no protection. Maybe it will be done inthe States and maybe it won't.Mr. President. I had a safety valveamendment. It was defeated. SenatorKERRY from Massachusetts had an-other one which was watered down, butimportant. It was knocked out in con-ference committee. It said, why don'twe at least look at what we have done,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEand if in fact there is more poverty andhunger. then we will take correctiveaction in 2 years. That was knockedout in conference committee. You callthat reform?Mr.President,let me be crystalclear. You focus on work, you focus onjob training, you focus on education,you focus on making sure that familiescan make a transition from welfare towork, and that is great. Eliminatingservices for legal immigrants, draco-nian cuts in food nutrition programsfor children and the elderly, deep cutsin assistance for children with disabil-ities\u2014none of this has anything to dowith reform. This is done in the nameof deficit reduction.When I had an amendment on thefloor that dealt with all of the breaksthat go to some of the oil companies,ortobaccocompanies,orpharma- ceutical companies, that was defeated.When we had a budget that called for$12billion more than the Pentagonwanted and we tried to eliminate that,that was defeated. But now when itcomes to poor children in America,who clearly are invisible here in Wash-ington, DC\u2014at least in the Congress\u2014faceless and voiceless, how generous weare with their suffering. And you dareto call that reform? You dare to saythat, in the name of children, when youare passing a piece of legislation thatevery single study says will increasepoverty and hunger among children.Vote for it for political reasons, butyou can't get away with calling it re-form. It is reverse reform. It is reform-atory, it is punitive, it is harsh, it isextreme. It targets the most vulnerablecitizens in America\u2014poor children.Mr. President, in this insurance re-form bill we are going to be dealingwith, late last night someone inserteda 2-year monopoly patent extension foran anti-arthritis drug. a special inter-est gift to one drug company, becausethen you don't have the generic drugs.Late last night, someone put this intothe insurance reform bill. There yougo. There is some welfare for a pharma-ceutical company. But they are theheavy hitters. They have the lobbyists.They are well-connected. We do justfine by them. But for these poor chil-dren. who very few Members of theSenate even know, we are all too gen-erous with their suffering.Mr President, I had an amendmentthat was passed by a 99-to-O vote thatsaid the Senate shall not take any ac-tion that shall create more hunger orhomelessness among children. Now weare slashing $28 billion in food nutri-tion programs with the harshest effectbeing on children in America. Can mycolleagues reconcile that for me? Iwould love to debate someone on this.I doubt whether there will be debate onit, because the evidence is clear.Mr. President, President Clinton saidyesterday that he will sign the bill, andhe said that he will work hard, I pre-sume next Congress, to correct what hethinks is wrong. He pointed out thatthese draconian cuts in food nutritionAugust 1. 1996programs and in assistance to legal im-migrants are wrong, they have nothingto do with reform. He is absolutelyright.Personally, it is difficult for me tosay, well, with the exception of thesedraconian cuts in food assistance pro-grams for children and the elderly,with the exception of these draconiancuts for children with disabilities, anddraconian cuts for legal immigrants,this is a pretty good bill otherwise. Ican't make that argument. But I willwork with the President because, clear-ly, this is going to pass, and, quiteclearly, corrective action is going tohave to be taken next Congress.But, for myself, Mr. President, I am aSenator from the great State of Min-nesota. As Senator Hubert Humphreysaid, the test case for a society or gov-ernment is how we treat people in thetwilight of their lives\u2014the elderly; howwe treat people at the dawn of theirlives\u2014the children; and how we treatpeople in the shadow of their lives\u2014thepoor, and those that are strugglingwith disabilities. We have failed thattest miserably with this piece of legis-lation.Mr. President, I come from a Statethat I think leads the Nation in itscommitment to children and its com-mitment to fairness and its commit-ment to opportunity. As a Senatorfrom Minnesota that is up for reelec-tion this year, there can be one zillionattack ads\u2014and there already havebeen many, and there will be manymore\u2014and I will not vote for legisla-tion that impoverishes more childrenin America. That is not the right thingto do. That is not a Minnesota vote.Mr. President. in my next term as aU.S. Senator from Minnesota,I am going to embark on a poverty tour inour country. I am going to bring tele-vision with me, and I am going to bringmedia with me, and I am going to visitthese children. I am going to visit someof these poor, elderly people.I am going to visit these families.I am going to visit these legal immigrants. Iam going to have my Nation focus itsattention, and I am going to have mycolleagues. Republicans and Democratsalike, focus their attention on thesevulnerable citizens. And, if in fact wesee the harshness, the additional pov-erty, and the additional malnutrition,which is exactly what is going to hap-pen, I am going to bring all those pic-tures and all of those voices and all ofthose faces and all of those childrenand all of those elderly people back tothe floor of the U.S. Senate. and wewill correct the terrible mistake we aremaking in this legislation.Mr. President, I yield the floor.AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOP-MENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMIN-ISTRATION.ANDRELATEDAGENCIESAPPROPRIATIONSACT. 1997 CONFERENCE REPORTThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The con-ference report will be stated. S9352governmentor another now. over half.If Thomas Jefferson were here today,he would roll into his grave that itwould ever come to the point that overhalfafamilysincomeisbeing consumed by the Federal. State. orlocal government. And here we are,with this administration having takenanother $2,000 to $3,000 out of a familywho only has about $25,000 of dispos-able income. That is like a 10 percentreduction in their disposable income injust 36 months. So it does not take arocket scientist to figure out whythere is so much anxiety in the work-ing family. They have less to workwith. The median household incomehas declined from $33,119 to $32,000.Job lock: Anemic economic growthhas frozen many workers intojobs theywould like to leave for better employ-ment. but they are afraid those jobswiU not be there if they try to gosomeplace else.Or how about credit cards? The delin-quent payments on credit cards, whichisa real consumer-connected deviceacross our country, are the worst theyhave ever been in 50 years. Why? Be-cause we have, by Federal policy.pushed the average family to the wall.And the policies of this administrationhave created the anemic economy. justas Senator DASCHLE has alluded to.Those policies have reduced the dispos-able income in that family's checkingaccount and they have made middleAmerica very worried.Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr: President. butfor the strength, determination andleadership of the Republicans in theCongress_-and I am referring to thisand past Congresses\u2014we would nottoday have a better budget situation orhave an article like the one which was printed in the Wall Street Journal thismorning.But for the economic wisdom of theFederal Reserve and the steady guidinghand of its chairman, Alan Greenspan,we would not today have the economicfooting that we need to be closer to a balanced budget than we have been inrecent years.There are two facts of economic life.One isthat Republicans have beenmore steadfast and committed to bal-ancing the budget than has the Presi-dent. I remind my colleagues of the ve-toes he issued on our attempts to bal-ance the budget last year. But for oursteadfastness and commitment to thisgoal, but for Republican leadership,this President would be no where near to working on a balanced budget.The second is a fact that this SenatoraddressedduringChairmanGreen- span's confirmation. The Federal Re-serve has played, and continues toplay. a crucial role in stabilizing theeconomy andmaintaininginvestor confidence in the face of big spendingCongresses. This confidence has lead toincreased participation by some Ameri-cans in the stock market. This in-creased capital investment is what hasled to newjobs, and expansion.ThePresidenthasraisedtaxes, though. The Clinton tax increases havetaken away from all Americans' abilityto take care of their families. The Clin-ton tax increases have decreased theamount of money which mothers andfathers haveto buy necessities fortheir children. This is wrong.Several of my colleagues have veryaccurately described the reality of theso-calledClintoneconomicgrowth rate. I wish to associate myself withtheir remarks. The charts which theyhave shown the Senate depict an econ-omy which is not growing as fast aspast economic expairisions. In fact oneof the charts show that this is theweakest economy in 100 years.Another of the charts clearly showswhat has happened to real mediumhousehold income. It has decreased. Asthe Senator from Florida pointed out,real medium household income in theyears between1933\u20141992 was $33,119.During the Clinton years of 1993\u20141994real median household income droppedto $32.153.No wonder American workers areconcerned about their future. This dropin income hurts hard working Ameri-cans.Let us continue to reform Govern-ment programs, as we are with thiswelfare reform legislation. And let uscontinue our efforts in Congress to bal-ance the budget. This is true economicstimulation. This will lead to real eco-nomic growth. Thiswillput more money into the pockets of Americans.Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President. I yield5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas.Mr. GRAMM. Excuse me. I thought Ihad 10 minutes on welfare.Mr. DAMATO. We are running a lit-tle behind. We would appreciate it ifyou could keep it\u2014Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let mejust reschedule time to talk about wel-fare.Mr. DAMATO. If the Senator wouldlike to be yielded10 minutes. whydon't we start, instead of just talkingabout it.Mr. GRAMM. All right.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas.Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President. it is anincredible paradox that while today wecelebrate one of the most dramatic leg-islative victories certainly in this Con-gress and in the last decade. we arehere responding to our Democratic col-leagues who came over to give us a les-son in perverted economics this morn-ing. They tell us how things are greatbecause they had the courage to raisetaxes. and if only we had raised taxesmore and spent more. things wouldeven be better. I personally do not be-lieve the American people are going toadopt that brand of economics.I would simply like to say that if wehad not raised taxes in 1993. but ratherhad cut spending and adopted the bal-anced budget amendment to the Con-stitution,theeconomywouldbe stronger. and we would not be havingan economic recovery, which happensAugust 1, 1996to be one of the weakest economic re-coveries in any postwar period.PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ANDWORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILI-ATION ACT OF 1996\u2014CONFERENCEREPORTThe Senate continued with the con-sideration of the conference report.Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let menow talk about welfare. We are goingto pass here in the Senate tonight awelfare reform bill that has the prom-ise of dramatically changing a systemwhich has failed in America. Let mebegin by talking about the failure.In the past 30 years. we have spent$5.4 trillion on welfare programs: pro-grams where we were trying to helppoor people. Nobody in America knowswhat a trillion dollars is. So let me tryto put that number in perspective.If you take the total value of allbuildings,all plants and equipment.and all productive tools in Americanindustryandagriculturecombined.they are worth about $5 trillion.So if you want to know how much wehave invested in the old welfare pro-gram over the past 30 years. itis roughly the equivalent of the value ofall buildings. all plants and equipment,and all of the tools of all the workersin the United States of America. No so-ciety in history has ever invested moremoney trying to help needy peoplethan the United States of America hasUlvested.Yet, what has been the result of all ofthose good intentions? What has beenthe result of that investment? The re-sult of that investment, 30 years later.is that we have as many poor peopletoday as we had 30 years ago. They arepoorer today. they are more dependenton the Government today. and by anydefinition of quality of life. fulfillment,orhappiness.peopleare worse offtoday than they were when we startedthe current welfare system.When we started the War on Povertyin the mid-1960s, two-parent familieswere the norm in poor families inAmericaToday, two-parent familiesare the exception. Since 1965, the ille-gitimacy rate has tripled.I know that we have colleagues onthe other side of the aisle who aregoing to lament the passage of this newwelfare reform bill. But I do not seehow anybody with a straight face, or aclear conscience, can defend the statusquo in welfare. Our current welfareprogram has failed. It has driven fa-thers out of the household. It has mademothers dependent. It has taken awaypeople's dignity. It has bred child abuseand neglect. and filled the streets ofour cities with crime. And we are heretoday to change it.Let me outline what our programdoes. I think if each of us looks back toa period when our ancestors first cameto America. or back to a time whenthose who have gone before us foundthemselves poor. we are going to findthat there are two things that get indi-viduals and nations out of poverty.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE August 1, 1996Those two things are work and family.I think it is instructive to note thatthose are the two things that we havenever applied to the current welfareprogram of the United States of Amer-ica.The bill before us asks people towork. It says that able-bodied men andwomen will be required to work inorder to receive benefits. It sets a timelimit so that people cannot make wel-fare a way of life. It seeks to changethe incentives within the welfare sys-tem. And I believe the time has cometo change those incentives within thewelfare system.So what we have done in adoptingthis billis make some very simplechanges. No. 1. we have said that unlessyou are disabled, welfare is not a per-manent program. It is a temporary pro-gram. We are going to help you for upto 5 years. We are going to train you.But at the end of 5 years. you are goingto have to work.We have also in this program giventhe States the ability to i-un their ownprograms. We believe that the FederalGovernment does not have all the wis-dom inthe world, and that Statesshould run welfare. What we have doneis we have taken a federally-run pro-gram. we have taken the funds that wehave spent on that program, and wehave given that money to the States sothat, rather than have one program.each State in the Union can tailor itsprogram to meet its individual needs.I believe that we have put together apositive program. It is a program thatasks people to work. It is a programthat tries to make Americans inde-pendent. It is a program that for thefirst time uses work and family to helpfamilies in America escape welfare andto escape poverty. I think this is amajor achievement. I am very proud ofthis bill, and I hope we can get a soundvote for it.I know there will be those who saythat the President. in committing tosign this bill, is going to end up takingcredit for it. I do not believe the Arner-ican people care who gets credit forthis bill. We know that had there beenno Republican majority in both Housesof Congress. we would never have passed this bill. We know that withouta Republican majority in both Housesof Congress. we would not have a man-datory work requirement. We wouldnot be changing welfare as we know it.But it seems to me that the return weare going to get for adopting this bill isworth letting the President take a sub-stantial amount of credit for it.I think this is a major step in theright direction. I am very proud of thisbill. I commend it to my colleagues.I yield the floor.Mr. D'A1\\4ATO addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New York.Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President. I yield -myself5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New York has 5 minutes.Mr. D'Av1ATO. Mr. President. let mereflect,ifImight. not only on theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEeconomy but more particularly as to.the impact, the adverse impact thatthebrutalwelfare program\u2014brutal;one that entraps people\u2014has had onthis country. It has not been beneficial.We have seen welfare spending movefrom approximately $29 billion in 1980to something in the area of $128 billion-today. Incredible. This is a programthat was intended to help people tem--porarily. those people who were dis-abled. those people who, through nofault of their own, found themselveswithout ajob.The lessons of history, confirmed by theevidence immediately before me. show con-clusively that continued dependence upon re-lief induces a spiritual and moral disintegra-tion fundamentally destructive to the na-tional fiber. To dole Out relief in this way isto administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyerof the human spirit. It is in violation of thetraditions of America.Mr. President. those were the wordsspoken by Franklin Delano Rooseveltwhen President Roosevelt gave his sec-ond annual message to the people onJanuary 4. 1935. Indeed, how prophetic:60 years later we see his admonitionthat where welfare becomes a long-term program. it is fundamentally de-structive to the national fiber, andthat it is a narcotic to the human spir-it, and it is a violation of the tradi-tions of America.That is exactly what the welfare pro-grams have done to this country. Andlet me say. as difficult as is the politi-cal process of campaigns and elections.thank God it is an election year: thereis one good thing that has come about,and that is welfare reform.Let me also suggest that withoutthere having been a Republican Con-gress pushing. working. challenging.there is no way that we would have hadany opportunity to pass a bill. And tothose who are critical of the reform. letme say that no bill is perfect, but tocontinue business as usual, as if all iswell. would have been a kind of con-spiracy, a conspiracy to continue tokeep our people on that narcotic. Abso-lutely not acceptable.I have to tell you. if you want to getthis economy going. then we have togive educational opportunity a helpinghand and move people who have be-come dependent. dependent upon thatwelfare narcotic. that drug. that drugthat President Roosevelt warned usabout. off of the welfare rolls into asystem of work.To those of my colleagues who havelegitimate concerns that there may be-some imperfections. we will deal withthose. We have the ability to fix them.We have the ability to make the bill abetter bill. But to do nothing, to sitback, to languish in the bureaucracy ofentrapping people, keeping people frommeeting the opportunities that thiscountry has of freedom, real freedom,freedom to participate. freedom to un-dertake- a challenge.is morally de-structive and is wrong. This change islong overdue.So if there this is anything good thatcomes from those elections and theS9353partisanship back and forth and thebickering. I say this welfare reform. inmy mind, would never have takenplace\u2014never, never have taken placewere it not for this election.Mr. President. I am pleased to haveworked for this program. Workfare, notwelfare. is long overdue.Mr. President. I yield to the Senatorfrom New Hampshire for 5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire.Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wonderif the Senator from New York couldmake that 10 minutes?Mr. D'AMATO. I yield 10 minutes tothe Senator from New Hampshire.Mr. SMITH. Mr. President. I rise invery strong support of the welfare re-form bill, H.R. 3734, that is before theSenate at this time. This is historiclegislation that the Senate later willbe passing by an overwhelming major-ity\u2014a bipartisan majority. Imight add. There will be some who will bevoting for this today because they arecaught up in the wave of welfare re-form and there will be others of us whowill be voting for it because we causedthe wave. But it really does not matterbecause the result will be the same.This Republican Congress has gotten itdone. After all the years and years oftalk, we have finally gotten it done. Wesent the President two bills. He vetoedboth of them. This is the third at-tempt. He now says he wifi sign it.The Senator from New York has al-ready quoted President Franklin Roo-sevelt who. in 1935, talked about whatwelfare. or in those days they called itrelief. does to a society and does to afamily. It does destroy the human spir-it and it is a violation of the traditions -ofAmerica, as Franklin Roosevelt cor-rectly said in 1935.Mr. President, in terms of welfare, wedid declare a war on poverty, and pov-erty won, That is the problem. Thisprogram has not worked. When some-thing dOes not work. we have to trysomething new. It does not mean wesay we have all the answers, but it doesmean we have to try.In 1965. per capita welfare spendingwas $197. By 1993, per capita welfarespending was $1,255. That is a 600-per-cent increase. For all this increasedspending. have we seen a correspondingdrop in poverty? No, we have not. In1965, 17 percent of Americans lived inpoverty. In 1993 it is a little over 15percent. barely a change. So we need totry something new. which is why thisRepublican Party has fought so hard tomake these changes.This is historic because it ends a 60-year status of welfare as a Federal cashentitlement. As a result, once this billbecomes law. no person will be able tochoose welfare as a way of life. And noperson will be entitled to cash benefits,from the Federal Government simplybecause he or she chooses not to work.It is amazing some of my colleaguescan defend this fajled system. wherepeople who make $18,000 or $19,000 ayear. working hard with their bare S9354handsto make just enough money toput food on their tables and pay taxes.we should ask those people to continuepaying forever for somebody who won'twork. Won't\u2014not can't, won't. Becausethat is what welfare is all about.Yes, there are some who cannot andthey are not going to slip through thenet. It is the ones who won't work. Yet.time after time after time, speakerafter speaker alter speaker in this bodyhas defended this system, saying peoplewho work hard for a living, trying toput food on the table, trying to paytheir mortgages, trying to get theirkids through college, working hard,paying their taxes\u2014honest, hard-work-ing Americans\u2014should continue to payfor people who won't work.We are changing it. That is why thisis historic. The President, in announc-ing he was going to sign this bill, kindof apologized for signing it, if you lis-ten to his remarks. But again, the re-sult is the same. He is going to sign it.We will get the results. So I give himcredit for signing it. It took him a lit-tle while to get there, but he is there.As the Senator from Texas said a fewmoments ago, ask yourself this ques-tion. Would we have welfare reform,would we have workfare today. were itnot for people in a Republican Congresswho pushed and pushed and pushed toget it through this Congress and intothe White House where the Presidentcan sign it? I think the answer is: Obvi-ously. no, we would not have. By dra-matically cutting the Federal welfarebureaucracyandreplacingitwith block grants to the States, this billrecognizes the best hope for makingwelfare programs successful liesin shifting major responsibilities for theiradministration to a level of govern-ment where innovation and experimen-tation can flourish. This is a giant steptowardreinvigoratingfederalismin our system of Government.I heard the Senator from Massachu-setts. Senator KENNEDY, earlier n thedebate, talking as if somehow all thesepeople were going to slip through thesafety nets because the Federal Gov-ernment no longer is assuming respon-sibility. We all know that we have 50Governors out there, frankly, Demo-crats and Republicans\u2014I have con-fidence in those people. I do not thinkany Governor in any State in the Union is going to put a starving childon the street. I will believe that whenI see it. That is not going to happenand we all know it. It is an outrage todefine this welfare reformin those kinds of terms.Governor Steve Merrill, the Governorof New Hampshire. using my State asan example. is a compassionate, decentman and a good Governor. He is notgoing to let that happen. I want him tohave this program. I want him to beable to administer this program, thisblock grant, because in the State ofNew Hampshire. Governor Merrill andthe legislature and the others whowork every day in these welfare pro-grams. know who the needy people are.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThey also know how to help them findwork. That is compassion and it is compassion at the local level, where itshould be. Because people in Washing-ton. DC, do not know all the answers.in case you have not figured that outyet.No Governor is going to let a childstarve and it is an outrage and an in-sult for anybody to even insinuate itrather than say it. Our Governors havebeen leading the way, from both par-ties. President Clinton, when he wasGovernor, talked about welfare reformand as a Presidential candidate said hewould end welfare as we know it. Heknew then as a Governor it was notworking. which is why he spoke outabout it. This is landmark legislation.This is dramatic. This is the kind ofthing that I have been working on forall the years that I have been in Con-gress, and I am so happy just to see itcome to fruition.I am going to be pleased and proud towork with Governor Merrill and seethatthisprogramisadministeredproperly to help the people in the Statewho need help.This is a huge accomplishment justto get this bill through this Senate andthe House and on the President's desk.Mr. President, this bill transformswelfare from a handout that fosters de-pendency into a temporary helpinghand for those who fall on hard times.It places a 5-year lifetime limit on re-ceiving welfare benefits and requiresable-bodied adultsto work alter 2 years.Surely after 5 years. an able-bodiedindividual can find a job. Of course,they can find ajob. if you want to finda job. But you are not going to want tofind a job if somebody is taking care ofyou all the time.When I was a kid,I had a favoriteuncle, Uncle George. He used to selltoys, and I used to look forward toUncle George coming around with toys.My family at sometime would say, \"IfUncle George keeps coming around, wewon't havetobuy toysforlittle Bobby.\" because they expected it.Where is the respect for the peoplewho are paying the bills? It is not theFederal Government paying these billsfor people who will not work. It is thetaxpayers. It is the hard-working menand women across America who workhard for a living. There is no reasonwhy this is an entitlement for some-body who does not work.There is not a person out in Americatoday who does not have the compas-sion in their heart to help somebodywho needs help. We see it every timethere is a tragedy. Whether it is theTWA bombing. a flood.earthquake,American people are always steppingforward in a compassionate. helpfulway to help their fellow man. It hap-pens every day. It is happening now,and it is not going to stop because wepass a bill that says people who willnot work cannot get benefits for therest of their lives.Mr. President, another very impor-tant pornt here is that this bill cracksAugust 1, 1996down on the so-called deadbeat dad byrequiring that father to pay child sup-port, and it mandates that welfare ap-plicants must assist in establishing thepaternity of their children in order toqualify for their benefits.What is wrong with that? That is re-sponsibility, Mr. President.I am also pleased that this bill takesa number of steps toward ending theabuse of the welfare system by thoselegal immigrants who come to Amer-ica, not to go to work but to go on wel-fare. That is not true with every personwho comes to America, it is not truewith most people who come to Amer-ica. but it is true with some. and theyought not to be getting welfare bene-fits if they are not an American citizenwhileAmericans who areworkinghard, trying to pay their bills are pro-viding it. That is simply wrong. It ought to stop. and this bill does stop it.But it also provides when you are spon-sored, the sponsor can assume some re-sponsibility for you. If they want tobring you to America, they can assumesome responsibility. That is what builtthis country\u2014responsibility, not run-ning away from it.Deeming is a good policy. Nonciti-zens, after all. remain. by definition,citizensofothercountries.They should not, in all fairness, expect to besupported by Americans who are nottheir fellow citizens.Finally. Mr. President, H.R. 3734 pro-vides a total of $22 billion to help theStates provide child care for parentswho are participating in work and jobtraining programs. It also provides ad-ditional grants for States that experi-ence high unemployment or surges intheir welfare populations.Mr.President,Icommend thoseamong my colleagues in the Senatewho have worked long and hard tomake this such a strong, landmarkwelfare reform bill. I also commend aformer colleague\u2014Senator Bob Dole\u2014for working tirelessly since the begin-ning of this historic 104th Congress todeliver landmark welfare reform forthe American people.Thank you. Mr. President. I yield thefloor.Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 7minutes to the Senator from Maryland.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland.Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator fromNebraska.Mr. President, a number of my col-leagues have talked about their verydeep concerns about various aspects ofthislegislation,includingtheesti- mates that go as high as 1 million morechildren being thrown into poverty, thevery harsh cut in food stamps that iscontained in this legislation. the limi-tation on the time period for receivingfood stamps, which will hit workerswho have been laid off and their fami-lies very hard in the years to come. theextreme cuts in benefits for disabledchildren and the treatment of legal\u2014not illegal,butlegal. andIstress August 1, 1996that\u2014legal immigrants coming intothe country. These are people who.under our laws, are legitimately in thecountry, and yet,if they encounterpersonal disaster financially, we arenot going to provide any help to them.All of these factors constitute a validbasis for voting against this bill.I am not going to go back over thoseissues. They have been discussed atsome length by others. There is an-other matter I wish to discuss, anotherdimension to this legislation which Ithink is another strong reason to op-pose this legislation which I intend todo. And that dimension is the situationwe will confront in times of economicdownturn and recession. All of the dis-cussion here is about the limitationsand constraints that are being placedupon existing programs in the contextof current economic circumstances.Current economic circumstances area5.3-percentunemploymentrate across the country. But we must con-sider the question of what is going tohappen when we have a downturn inthe business cycle. People are discuss-ing this legislation almost as thoughthe business cycle has been repealedand is not going to happen again.Thislegislationprovidesblock grants to the States. The size of thosegrants does not vary with such factorsas unemployment or the poverty rate,and, therefore,inrecessions, Stateswillfacerisingcaseloads and cor-responding large gaps in funding for as-sistance programs.The bill has a contingency fund of $2billion,butitiscompletelyinad- equate\u2014completelyinadequate\u2014itfails to address this issue. Let me justgive you an example. In our Nation'smost recent recession during the Bushadministration in the period from 1989to 1992, the Federal share of welfarespending increased 36 percent\u2014an addi-tional amount of $7.2 billion over thefour years\u2014that is. timesthe contingency fund.There was a 35-percent increase inthe number of children in poverty overthose years. This was a period when theunemployment rate rose from 5.3 per-cent to a high of 7.7 percent.What are the States going to dounder this legislation when a recessionhits and more and more people slip intopoverty, people lose their jobs, they areout of work? Under the current system.the Federal Government assures to theStates additional money for each of theadditional persons who are placed intodirecircumstances by a worseningeconomy. Under this bill, no such sup-port. This billessentially gives theState a block grant based on 1994 fig-ures, and that's it.Much of thediscussion has beenabout the difficulty of handling the sit-uation under current economic cir-cumstances and the problems are veryreal and severe. What happens whenyou get an economic downturn and thenumber of people showing up in thepoverty category on the unemploymentrolls is on the increase, rising very sub-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEstantially? Are the States then goingto come up with more money in orderto handle this problem?Our experience to date is every timea recession strikes the States come inand say. \"We need help. We're con-sti-amed. We can't deal with this reces-sion. Look what this recession hasdone to our sources of revenue. Oursources of revenue are down. We can'thandle the situation.\"That is what they say today whenthe Federal assistance is automaticallyadjusted. What are they going to saynext year or the year after and theyear after that when a recession comesalong, when people are added to the un-employment rolls, out of ajob, familiesgo into poverty? Where are the re-sources then going to come from?Under the current system, the Fed-eral Government, since President Roo-sevelt, assumed an obligation to pro-vide help to the States to help themwork through this situation. Now theFederalGovernmentautomaticallysteps in when a recession hits. Thatwill not be the case in the future underthis legislation.It is true there is a contingency fund.But as I said, it is totally inadequatefor any recession of any consequence,let alone a very deep recession as weexperienced under President Reagan inthe early 1980's, or just the recessionwe experienced in the early 1990's dur-ing the Bush administration when theunemployment rate went from 5.3 to 7.7percent. That was its peak, 7.7 percent,contrasted with the Reagan recessionwhere it went just shy of 11 percent un-employment.In the Bush recession in the 1990's,the fact of the matter is that there wasabout a 40-percent increase in the Fed-eral expenditure on welfare during thatrecession period. This bill fails to ad-dress the consequences of such an eco-nomic downturn.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's time has expired.Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senatoryield me I more minute?Mr. EXON. I am glad to.Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, thisbill does not do that. The Federal Gov-ernment is out of it in terms of assur-ing the States that the full burden ofrecession will not fall upon them. Inthe last recession, when the unemploy-ment rate went close to 8 percent, mil-lions of Americans lost their jobs andhad a difficult time finding new jobs.What is going to happen in the nextrecession? Does anyone realisticallybelieve that the States will step in andpick up the burden? Even now with ad-ditional Federal assistance the Statescome in during a recession and say,We can't handle our situation becauseour revenues have been impacted bythe recession.\" What is going to hap-pen is you will have literally millionsof people affected by the economicdownturn and without any support. Noadditional Federal assistance as now,because of the block grant provision.We will pay dearly for failing to pro-S9355vide a fail-safe mechanism against aneconomic downturn. The consequenceswill be such that we will rue this day.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's time has expired.Mr. SARBANES. I yield the floor.Mr. EXON the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska.Mr. EXON. Will the Chair kindly ad-vise the Senatdr when I have used 15minutes? I yield such time as is nec-essary to myself.Mr. DOMENICI. I think we rotate.Mr. EXON. Before the chairman camein, we had three Republicans in a row.I thought that we would proceed\u2014Mr. DOMENICI. They were part ofthe1hour where you had 1hour and\u2014Mr. EXON. No, they were not. Theywere after that. I yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator NICK-LES,doyou need 15 minutes?Mr. NICKLES. Yes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma.Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, Iwish to congratulate and complimentour colleague from New Mexico for hisleadership on this bill. In addition, Icompliment Senator ROTH. ChairmanARCHER in the House, and ChairmanCLAY SHAw for putting this bill to-gether, as well as Chairman KASICH inthe House. I would like to go back alittle farther and also compliment Sen-ator Dole and Speaker GINGRIcJ1 forlaying the groundwork for fundamentalwelfare reform, fundamental welfarereform that is long overdue, fundamen-tal welfare reform that today will havebipartisan support. I am very pleasedwith that and I am pleased the Presi-dent said he would sign this bill.He is correct in making that deci-sion. I know he agonized over it. Hewas not sure what he was going to do.That is evidenced by the fact he vetoedtwo similar bills earlier. He actuallyvetoed a bill in January, a bill thatpassed the Senate with 87 votes.I thought that veto was a mistake. I thought that veto was a repudiation ofhis campaign statement when he saidwe need to end welfare as we know it.When candidate Bill Clinton madethe statement, \"We need to end welfareas we know it,\"Iapplaudedit.I thought he was exactly right. Unfortu-nately, I think welfare had become away of life for far too many families.Maybe that was their fault, maybe itwas Congress' fault. I think most of thewelfare programs that we have werewell-intentioned, but many have hadvery suspect results.In addressing the issue of welfare, onJanuary 4, 1935 Franklin D. Rooseveltsaid that:The lessons of history, confirmed by theevidenceimmediately before me. show con-clusively that continued dependence upon re-lief induces a spiritual and moral disintegra-tion fundamentally destructive to the na-tional fiber. To dole Out relief in this way isto administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyerof the human spirit. It is inimicable to thedictates of sound policy. It is a violation ofthe traditions of America. S9356Thatwas in his second annual mes-sage to the country. He was right.Maybe he was a little bit prophetic be-causeif you look at what has hap-pened in our welfare system, we nowhave under the Federal Government 334federally controlled welfare programs.The Federal Government determineswho is eligible. for how long, and forhow much they will receive. We have156 job training programs stacked ontop of each other, all with good inten-tions but a lot with results that are notvery desirable, results that in manycases have not helped a lot of the in..tended beneficiaries and certainly havenot helped taxpayers.This Congress has done several his-toric things. I have been around herenow for 16 years. This Congress. for thefirst time, has actually passed some re-form and some curtailment of thegrowth of entitlement programs.We passed it in the Balanced BudgetAct, but the President vetoed it so thatdid not become law. We passed it in thewelfare bill, but the President vetoedthat and it did not become law. Wepassed entitlement reform in the farmbill. a historic rewrite of decades offarm policy. That was a good bill. ThePresident signed it. I compliment himfor signing it.Now we are passing welfare reform. Isthe bill perfect? No. But it is a good.giant step in the right direction. I ampleased the President will sign it.Mr. President, this bill does changethe way we do welfare. The so-calledAFDC, aid to families with dependentchildren. will no longer be a cash enti-tlement. We are reforming its entitle-ment status. The current program saysthat if you meet eligibility standards\u2014in other words, if you are poor\u2014youcan receive this benefit for the rest ofyour life. There is no real incentive toget off. There is no real incentive to goto work. We are really falling into ex-actly what Franklin Delano Rooseveltsaid. We are destroying human spirit.So now we have a chance to fix that inthis bill today. This is a giant leap.Again, I mentioned that I am pleasedPresident Clinton is signing this bill.But if you look at the bill he intro-duced, his bill was a continuation ofthe entitlement of aid to families withdependent children. They would go oncontinually. It was a continuation ofan entitlement.Today we are breaking that continu-ation. We are going to say that wetrust the States. I have heard some ofmy colleagues say. \"Wait a minute.What about the kids?\" What we aredoing is taking this money and we aregoing to give this cash welfare programto the States and let them determineeligibility. I happen to think that theStates are just as concerned, maybeeven more concerned than we are aboutkids in their own territory.What makes people think that thesource of all wisdom comes from Wash-ington,DC.thatWashington.DC. should determine who is eligible andwho is not? Who can make the best de-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtermination of those requirements? Ibelieve the individual States can.In this bill we have work require-ments. We have time limits. We have a5-year lifetime limit. I think we havetaken some big steps in the right direc-tion.So I want to compliment SenatorRom and Senator DOMENICI, SenatorDole, and others.Also, I would like to make a coupleof other comments. I have heard thePresident say we have cut too much infood stamps. In this bill we requireable-bodied adults age 18 to 50 with nodependents. no kids, to work 20 hours aweek, with the exception that theyhave 3 months in a 3-year period whenthey can receive food stamps. Otherthan that they are going to have towork at least 20 hours a week. That isreal reform. I know my colleague fromNorth Carolina thinks that is right.Under current law you can receivefood stamps forever. Eligibility is pret-ty easy. If you meet these income re-quirements,youcanreceivefood stamps. There is not a time limit.Under this bill we are telling able-bod-ied people, now you are going to haveto get ajob.There are now going to be work re-quirements in order to receive welfare.You are going to have to get a job. Weturn the money over to the States, yes.but it is a transition. We call it tem-porary assistance for needy families. Itis temporary assistance: it is not a wayof life. It is not a system that we aresetting up where people can receivethis income forever, as many familiesdo under the current system.There was an investigation in areasof my State that had drug problemsand crime problems, and I learned a lit-tle bjt about the drugs and the crime.But I probably learned a little bit moreabout welfare. This area had a veryhigh incidence of crime and drug prob-lems but had an even higher incidenceof welfare dependency.As a matter of fact,I talked to ayoung person who had a couple of kidsand found out that, yes, she had beenon welfare for a few years and hermother had also been on welfare forseveral years. I was thinking, we haveto break this cycle. What about thekids? I looked at her kids, and I reallyfelt sorry for them, and they weregrowing up, now the third generationof a welfare family. We have to breakthat trap of welfare dependency.This bill will help give people a handup and not just a hand out: to wherethey will be able to go to work; wherewe provide job training; where we havechild care; where we have an oppor-tunity for people to climb up out ofthis welfare dependency cycle. This is agiant step in the right direction.With the old system, if they met theincome standards. then they kept get-ting the cash. There is no limit whatso-ever. So this bill is. again, a very posi-tive step in the right direction towardrewarding work. encouraging work, en-couraging people to become independ-August 1, 1996ent, and not dependent on taxpayers. Icompliment Senator Dole and otherswho are responsible.Iwanttocorrectsome misstatements that have been made bythe President and other people. ThePresident stated yesterday that thereason why he is signing the bill is thatit allows States to use Federal moneyfor vouchers for children and for par-ents who cannot find work alter thetime limit has expired. The Presidentsays he lobbied for this. To clarif', wedid not put money in specifically underthe welfare bill. but we have said theycan use money under title XX, the So-cial Services Block Grant, for thosepurposes. That is the same policy wehad in the bill H.R. 4, that unfortu-nately the President vetoed. There wasnot really a change in that area.President Clinton made a statementsaying the congressional leadership in-sisted on attaching to this extraor-dinarily important bill a provision thatwill hurt legal immigrants in America,people working hard for their families,paying taxes and serving in our mili-tary. Well. the President is wrong. Justto state the facts,noncitizens whowork for their families, pay taxes, canbecome eligible for welfare in two waysunder this bill. First, they can becomecitizens. If they become citizens, theycan qualify for any benefits any otherAmerican can. Second, even if they de-cide not to become citizens, they canbecome eligible for welfare by workingand paying SocialSecurity payrolltaxesfor40quarters,basically10 years.Third, and this is most important,noncitizens who serve in our militaryare eligible for welfare under this bill.The bill explicitly exempts them fromthe bans on welfare to non-Americans.It is in the bill.I was surprised by the President'sstatement.His statement was this:You can serve in our military, youmay get killed for defending America,but if somebody mugs you on a streetcorner or you get cancer or get hit bya car, or the same thing happens toyour children, we are not going to giveyou assistance anymore.\"Mr. President, President Clinton iswrong. As I mentioned, people whoserve in our military, veterans andtheir dependents all continue to be eli-gible for assistance under this bill, thisis title 4. page 5. So are refugee andasylees and people who pay Social Se-curity taxes for 40 quarters, title 4, page 5. People mugged on a street cor-ner or hit by a car, whether or not theyare citizens and whether or not theywork and whether or not they are inthe country legally or illegally, qualif'foremergencymedicalassistanceunder this bill.I think it is important we stay withthe facts. President Clinton also saidyesterday, \"I challenge every State toadopt the reforms that Wisconsin, Or-egon. Missouri, and other States areproposing to do.\" Fact: On May 18,President Clinton spoke favorably of August 1. 1996the welfare waiver application submit-tedbythe State of Wisconsin: 'Wis- consin is making a solid welfare reformplan. I pledge my administration willwork with Wisconsin to make an effec-tive transition to a new vision of wel-fare. States can keep on sending methese strong welfare proposals, and Iwill keep on signing them.\" That wasMay 18. Guess what? Wisconsin's waiv-er was proposed on May 26. over 2 months ago. and he has not signed ityet.President Clinton. before a speech ofNationalGovernors'Associationin 1995, told the Governors he would acton their waiver application within 30days. some of which have taken wellover a year. some almost 2 years. It hasbeen 60 days since the Wisconsin waiv-er. We tried to put the Wisconsin waiv-er into the bill to make it applicable.We get a message. according to Speak-er GINGRICH, that if it is in the bill, thePresident will veto it. At the sametime he was bragging on Wisconsin'swaiver and their new approach yester-day on national TV, he was telling us ifwe put it in the bill, he would veto thebill.Mr. President. I could go on. I thinkit is important we not try to scare peo-ple. that we stay with the facts, thatwe do try to do what is right.Let me make a couple of other com-ments. I heard the President and otherpeople saying this bill is too hard onnoncitizens, on legal aliens. We elimi-nate benefits for illegals: what aboutnoncitizens who are legally here? Wemake some changes. The President andothers say we went too far.Let's look at what we did. Our legis-lation has a priority that says fun-damentally we should take care ofAmericans. When aliens come to thiscountry, their sponsors pledge to sup-port them and they sign a statementthat says they will not become a publiccharge. People come to this countryvoluntarily. If noncitizens want to stayin this country, they sign a statementsaying they will not become a publiccharge. We will start holding them tothat statement and hold their sponsorswho also signed the statement saying.'We will make sure they do not be-come a public charge: we will makesure they do what they committed todo.\" I think that is very important.Imight mention a couple thingsabout taxpayers. If you look at thenumber of noncitizens currently receiv-ing SSI. Social Security supplementalincome,in1982there were almost128.000 noncitizens receiving SSI: in 1994 that number had increased by al-most sixfold, and there were 738.000noncitizens receiving SSI. The programhas exploded since1982\u2014almost sixtimes as many.What happens is a whole lot of peopledetermine they can come to the UnitedStates not asking for a land of oppor-tunity to grow and build and expand.they come to the United States for ahandout. What did they do? They re-ceived SSI and Medicaid. They receivedCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEa lot of Government assistance. Thankyou very much. taxpayer, and the spon-sors who signed statements saying.'We will take care of them and makesure they do not become a charge tothe Federal Government' But whohave not done their share, they havenot held up their side of the bargainwhen they said they would not becomea charge to the American taxpayers.and they did.We are saying they have a couple ofchoices. If they want to become citi-zens, they will be eligible for benefits.If they do not become citizens, that iscertainly their option, but they do nothave the option to say, \"Yes, take careof us, taxpayers.\" If they pay taxes for40 quarters then they could become eli-gible for benefits.A couple of other comments. We denynoncitizens from receiving food stampsuntil they become citizens or pay taxesfor 10 years. We did the same thingwith food stamps. Why should someonecome to the United States as a nonciti-zen and say. \"Give me food stamps\"?Some people have criticized this bysaying. \"Wait, cuts in food stamps aredraconian.' We spent $26.2 billion thisyear in food stamps. In the year 2002, ifyou listen to some of the rhetoric, youwould think we cut that in half. Thatis not the case. In the year 2002. 6 yearsfrom now, we will spend over $30 billionin food stamps. So we are spendingmore money in food stamps every year.but we are saying to the people who arenoncitizens who come to the UnitedStates, they are not automatically en-titled to continue receiving benefitsforever.Mr. President, I have several chartsto be printed in the RECORD, and I com-pliment my friend and colleague fromNew Mexico for his leadership. I men-tioned food stamps. and I will mentionSSI, the growth rates in SSI.In 1980, SSI cost the taxpayers $6 bil-lion: in 1996, it costs $24 billion. fourtimes as much. This program is explod-ing. The growth rates in SSI for the-last 5 years are 10 percent, 14 percent,21 percent, 18 percent, and 20 percent.The program has exploded in many.many cases because noncitizens havesaid this is a good way to get on agravy train. We need to close thatabuse. We do that under this bill. I think that is positive reform.I ask unanimous consent to haveprinted in the RECORD charts to sub-stantiate these facts.There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows: FEDERAL SPENDING ON MAJOR WEIJARE PROGRAMS.[CWTei1law m IIis ci d\u00f8llars]1011111112141515171818191920212122(00 0 00 20 Nickies.Mr. I thank my colleaguefrom New Mexico and my colleaguefrom Nebraska for yielding.Mr. DOMENICI. First.

We hope we can keep everyone tosomewhere around 10 minutes or less.Having said that, Senator EXON hasnot even spoken today. He is next, andhe will choose as much time as hewants, obviously. Following him, myunderstanding is that Senator SPECTERof Pennsylvania will speak on our side.Who will speak on your side?Mr. EXON.

Come down and tell us.So the order on our side is SenatorsSPECTER,FAIRCLOTH,GRASSLEY. CFEE, and GREGG.Mr. EXON. Mr. President, many ofmycolleagueshavegivenvery thoughtful and rigorous descriptions ofthe economic growth of our Nationunderthededicatedleadershipof President Clinton. Much of that growthis due to the deticit reduction in thePresident's 1993 budget that we passedwith strictly Democratic votes, andnot a single Republican vote in eitherthe House or the Senate. The FederalReserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan,agrees. He said, earlier this year, thatPresident Clinton's budget was \"an un-questioned factor in contributing tothe improvement in economic activitythat occurred thereafter.\"Mr. President, we have been on theright course since we passed the 1993deficit reduction plan. At that time,dire predictions were made on that sideof the aisle. If anybody is interested inthose, I would be glad to supply thedoomsday forecast if that became law\u2014which it did\u2014from that side of theaisle.In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion,the highest dollar level inhistory. Today. thanks to the President's budg-et. it has been cut more than in half. to$117 billion. That is living up to bothyour promises and the promises thathave been emphasized so often in de-bate here.I don't customarily use charts, but Iwant to put up a chart that may havebeen used before. which drives thispoint home. I suggest. Mr. President,that this may be the best kept secretin America.In 1980, when President Carter wasPresident of the United States, we hada deficit of $74 billion for that year.That was an awful lot of money. I re-member how concerned we were aboutAugust 1, 1996that. Several years later, after 1980, inthe intervening 12 years of RepublicanPresidents\u2014first Ronald Reagan andthen George Bush\u2014and supply side eco-nomics, that deficit loomed from ahigh $74 billion, we thought, to $290 bil-lion. When President Bill Clinton be-came President of the United States,look what has happened since thenunder his leadecship. That deficit hasbeen more than cut in half. to the 1996projection of $117 billion.I don't know what tells the history ofsuccess in this particular area morethan a chart like this, which is factual.I ask anyone to challenge it. The Re-publicans like to carp a lot about thePresident's1993budget.Adistin- guished Republican said that PresidentClinton's taking credit for deficit re-duction is like a rooster crowing veryloudly at sunrise. I say to my Repub-licanfriend that the President hasevery right to crow. if you want to usethat word. He has every right to layclaim to reducing the deficit. becausethat he has done.That enormous fiscal egg laid by theprevious two Republican administra-tions had to be attacked by someone,and President Bill Clinton did the job.Facts are facts. He has cut it morethan in half.As much as I am gratified by the eco-nomic and fiscal performance of thecurrent administration,I am deeplyconcerned with what is being said bythe Republican campaign to challengethis administration. The same folkswho were part of the fiscal wreckingcrewinthe1980's,and who votedagainst the only real deficit reductionplan in the 1990's, are now ready to sab-otage the 21st century with billions ofdollars in new tax cuts. which theydon't pay for. That is more of the sup-ply-side economics that got us intothis mess in the first place.Mr. President, I ask my colleagueshere, and I ask the people of the UnitedStates. why on Earth would Bob Dolechange his mind from a strict andsound fiscal conservative and becomethe Willy Loman of supply-side eco-nomics and perhaps destroy the econ-omy by going back on this track?Mr. President. the lessons learned inthe 1980's through the 1992 period arevery clear: You can't grow your wayout of tax breaks of this magnitude.That is why President Clinton cameinto office. saddled with a $290 billiondeficit. Supply-side economics. or so-called dynamic scoring are. at best, atoss of the dice.To gamble the fiscal integrity of ourNation on such speculation is totallyirresponsible.Itisshameless.Itis truly shameless. Only it is a way of dis-guising the true costs of tax cuts.How did they make up for them withthe supply-side economics, or voodooeconomics, to use a Republican phrase.from the period 1980 to 1992 that causedthis?Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said,\"We must avoid resting key the period 1980 to 1992.I find it curious. Mr. President. thatthe advocates of supply-side Dole taxcuts seem to be trying to cash two fis-cal dividends at the same time. And itwill not work. On the one hand, theywant to take credit for the fiscal divi-dend that the Congressional Budget Of-fice said we will get from the conserv-ative fiscal policies needed to balancethe budget. On the other hand, theywant to simultaneously take credit fora fiscal dividend that would come fromthe stimulative fiscal policies of a taxcut. We have a record to show whathappens when you go down that road.I hope the American voters will findout quickly what the Dole medicineshow is really trying to sell. It is purepoison, and ithurts. The Americanpeople reject out of hand the heartlessreductions, indeed, in the latest Repub-lican 7-year budget plan. I tell my fel-low Americans that these needs pale incomparison to what may lie ahead ifwe follow their lead to supply-side eco-nomics once more. Those reductionsfrom real need will be twice as bad ifwe have to pay for the total tax breaksthat are about to come.That is right, Mr. President. That isright, and all should understand thatPresident Clinton cut the deficit inhalf, as evidenced by this chart. BobDole wants to double the amount thatthe Republicans are taking from ordi-nary Americans to pay for his $600 bil-lionor sointax breaksforthe wealthy. The American people knowand the American people understandwho is heading in the right direction,and it is President Bill Clinton.Mr. President. an important part ofall of this\u2014to keep the promises thatwere made during the campaign\u2014is thematter of the welfare reform bill thatis presently before the body.Mr. President, the conference reportthat is before us in the Senate today isnot the best possible welfare bill. but itmay be the best welfare bill that thisdivided and weary Congress can pass.I salute my good friend. the chair-man of the Budget Committee. fordoing his able best, and he did a lot tosmooth over the rough edges of theHouse measure, and there were many.I also want to compliment the tena-cious and effective work of the Senatorfrom Rhode Island, Senator CHAFEE, inthe conference committee. This is abetter bill for their efforts.Throughout the consideration of thisbill. my primary concern has been withour Nation's children. A hungry childshould be an affront to all men andwomen of good will.I am at a loss to understand why theRepublican leadership felt it necessaryto force their caucus to vote against al-lowingStatestoprovidenoncash vouchers for children's food and cloth-ing under the State's block grant. Theconference report allows States to useanother program for that purpose. butprovides no additional funds, and haseven reduced that program by 15 per-cent below the baseline.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEItis certainly not the intention ofthis Senator to throw more childreninto poverty, or to create more want inour land of plenty. Should this legisla-tion become law. I would hope that wemonitor its effects very carefully. Weare giving the States more powers andflexibility; with that will come new re-sponsibilities. A midcourse correctionmay be needed 2 or 3 years hence. if thecritics are right and the number ofchildren living in poverty swells.I am heartened, however, that theconference moderated some of the veryworst of the welfare bill and retainedmany of the improvements added bythe Senate. For example, there was theKasich food stamp amendment thatwas cruel and heartless in the extreme.It limited unemployed people withoutkids to only 3 months of food stamps intheir adult lifetime. Thank goodnesscooler heads prevailed. Eligibility hasnow been modified to 3 months for any3-year period, with an additional 3 months if one is laid off.I was also most gratified that theconference retained the Chafee amend-ment maintaining current eligibilitystandards for Medicaid, as well as theConrad amendment eliminating the food stamp block grant. These twoamendments were critical to this Sen-ators support of the conference report.Removing them would have been tanta-mount to pulling the keystone from anarch. Bipartisan support for this billwould have collapsed.I and many of my Democratic col-leagues will vote for this conference re-port today. We do so with some mis-givings. but also with the sincere hopeand desire that we are helping our fel-low citizens to reclaim the dignity andpride that comes from work and pro-viding for one's family\u2014no matter howhumble the calling. I hope our effortsprove worthy of both those we are try-ing to help and the American peoplewho have asked for reform.I hear a great deal these days aboutending welfare as we know it. But tothis Senator, that does not mean end-ing our responsibility to our fellowman. It does not mean just cutting offthe welfare check. and then cuttingand running on our poor.Mr. President. our responsibilities donot end with this bill. Quite the con-trary. As we ask those who have beeninwelfare'srutto become bread-winners, it is our responsibility to pro-vide them with a living wage throughan increase in the minimum wage.Since few minimum-wage jobs offerit. we must also help them find afford-able, available. and accessible healthcare. especially for their children. Wemust assist too with education and jobtraining to help them get and hold bet-ter jobs.Mr. President. one final observation.I believe that this will be the sole rec-onciliation bill of the three promisedby the Republican majority to make itto the President's desk.Their grotesque Medicare and Medic-aid bills are being locked up in theS9359attic. out of sight of the electorate.The tax breaks may. however, be a dif-ferent story. We hear rumors that. ifBob Dole's numbers plummet any fur-ther, we may see some tax breaksshoot up to the front of the legislativeagenda. I am deeply concerned that theRepublican majority may try to usethe welfare savings we achieve today tojustify their tax breaks. Some thingsnever change.Other things certainly have changed.Senator Bob Dole once scorned supply-siders, but Candidate Dole is now a fel-low traveler. He has jettisoned thehard, dirty work of cutting spending.and now peddles comforting tales abouttax cuts that pay for themselves.They did not pay for themselves inthe 1980 to 1992 period, and they willnot pay for themselves between nowand the turn of the century and there-after.These policies that they are trying toinvoke once again evidently broke thebank in the 1980's. We will repeat thisfoolhardinessagain under the newname of dynamic scorekeeping andsupply-side economics. A rosy scenariois a rosy scenario by any name. I prayfor the sake of our children and grand-children that the Republican majorityreclaims its wits.The bill before us today asks thosewho receive a helping hand to take re-sponsibility for their lives and to findwork. I will vote for the bill. In thesame vein. I ask those who have beenentrusted with the fiscal responsibilityof the Nation not to fritter it away.Face up to your responsibilities. Donot pander. Do not promise what can-not be delivered. Do not hide behindeconomic fairy tales. It will take hardwork to balance the budget.

Mr. President. one furtheritem for insertion into the RECORD.The President yesterday delivered astatement indicating he would sign thewelfare bill when itis presented tohim. I ask unanimous consent that acopy of that statement be printed inthe REcoRD.There being no objection, the state-ment was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:THEWHITE HousE.July31. 1996.STATEMENTBY THE PREsIDENTThePREsIDENT. Good afternoon. When Iran for President four years ago. I pledged toend welfare as we know it. I have workedvery hard for four years to do just that.Today, the Congress will vote on legislationthat gives us a chance to live up to thatpromise\u2014to transform a broken system thattraps too many people in a cycle of depend-ence to one that emphasizes work and inde-pendence: to give people on welfare a chance'to draw as paycheck. not a welfare check.It gives us a better chance to give those onwelfare what we want for all families in 'S9360America.the opportunity to succeed at homeand at work. For those reasons I will sign itinto law. 'The legislation is, however, farfrom perfect. These are parts of it that arewrong, and I will address those parts in amoment.But, on balance, this bill is a real step for-ward for our country, our values and for peo-ple who are on welfare. For 15 years I haveworked on this problem, as governor and asa President. I've spent time in welfare of-fices,I have talked to mothers on welfarewho desperately want the chance to workand support their families independently. Along time ago I concluded that the currentwelfare system undermines the basic valuesof work, responsibility and family, trappinggeneration after generation in dependencyand hurting the very people it was designedto help.Today we have an historic opportunity tomake welfare what it was meant to be\u2014asecond chance, not a way of life. And eventhough the bill has serious flaws that are un-related to welfare reform, I believe we havea duty to seize the opportunity it gives us toend welfare as we know it. Over the pastthree and a half years I have done everythingin my power as President to promote workand responsibility, working with 41 states togive them 69 welfare reform experiments. Wehave also required teen mothers to stay inschool, required federal employees to paytheir child support, cracked down on peoplewho owe child support and crossed statelines.As a result, child support collections areup 40 percent. to $11 billion, and there are 1.3million fewer people on welfare today thanthere were when I took office. From the Out-set. however, I have also worked with mem-bers of both parties in Congress to achieve anational welfare reform bill that Will makework and responsibility the law of the land.I made my principles for real welfare reformvery clear from the beginning. First andforemost, it should be about moving peoplefrom welfare to work. It should impose timelimits on welfare. It should give people thechild care and the health care they need tomove from welfare to work without hurtingtheir children. It should crack down on childsupport enforcement and it should protectour children.This legislation meets these principles. Itgives us a chance we haven't had before\u2014tobreak the cycle of dependency that has ex-isted for millions and millions of our fellowcitizens. exiling them from the world of workthat gives structure, meaning. and dignity tomost of our lives.We've come a long way in this debate. It'simportant to remember that not so very longago, at the beginning of this very Congress.some wanted to put poor children in orphan-ages and take away all help for mothers sim-ply because they were poor, young and un-married. Last year the Republican majorityin Congress sent me legislation that had itspriorities backward. It was soft on work andtough on children. It failed to provide childcare and health care. It imposed deep and un-acceptable cuts in school lunches, child wel-fare and help for disabled children. The billcame to me twice and I vetoed it twice.The bipartisan legislation before the Con-gress today is significantly better than thebills I vetoed. Many of the worst elements Iobjected to are out of it. And many of theimprovementS I asked for are included. First,the new bill is strong on work. It provides $4billion more for child care so that motherscan move from welfare to work, and protectstheir children by maintaining health andsafety standards for day care. These thingsare very important. You cannot ask some-body on welfare to go to work if they'regoing to neglect their children in doing it.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEIt gives states powerful performance incen-tives to place people in jobs. Itrequires states to hold up their end of the bargain bymaintain their own spending on welfare. Andit gives states the capacity to create jobs bytaking money now used for welfare checksand giving it to employers as income sub-sidies as an incentive to hire people, or beingused to create community serviejobs.Second, this new bill is better- for childrenthan the two I vetoed. It keeps the nationalnutritional safety net intact by eliminatingthe food stamp cap and the Optional blockgrant. It drops the deep cuts and devastatingchanges in school lunch, child welfare andhelp for disabled children. It allow states touse federal money to provide vouchers forchildren whose parents can't fInd work afterthe time limits expire. And it preserves thenational guarantee of health care for poorchildren, the disabled, pregnant women. theelderly and people on welfare.Just as important, this bill continues toinclude the child support enforcement meas-uresIproposed two years ago. the mostsweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents inhistory. If every parent paid the child sup-port they should, we could move 800.000women and children off welfare immediately.With this bill we say to parents, if you don'tpay the child support you owe, we will gar-nish your wages. take away yotir drivers li-cense, track you across state lines and, asnecessary. make you work ofT what you owe.It is a very important advance that couldonly be achieved in legislation. I did not have the executive authority to do this with-out a bill.So I will sign this bill. First and foremostbecause the current system is broken. Sec-ond. because Congress has made many of thechanges I sought. And, third, because eventhough serious problems remain in the non-welfare reform provisions of the bill, this isthe best chance we will have for a long, longtime to complete the work of ending welfareas we know it by moving people from welfareto work, demanding responsibility and doingbetter by children.However, I want to be very clear. Someparts of this bill still go too far. And I am de-termined to see that those areas are cor-rected. First, I am concerned that althoughwe have made great strides to maintain thenational nutritional safety net, this bill stillcuts deeper than it should in nutritional as-sistance, mostly for working families withchildren. In the budget talks, we reached atentative agreement on $21 billion in foodstamp savings over the next several years.They are included in this bill.However, the congressional majority in-sisted on another cut we did not agree to. re-pealing a reform adopted four years ago inCongress, which was to go into effect nextyear. It's called the Excess Shelter Reduc-tion, which helps some of our hardest pressedworkmg families. Finally, we were going totreat working families with children thesame way we treat senior citizens who drawfoodstampstoday.Now,blockingthis change,Ibelieve\u2014I know\u2014will make itharder for some of our hardest pressed work-ing families with children. This provision isa mistake. and I will work to correct it.Second. I am deeply disappointed that thecongressional leadership insisted on attach-ing to this extraordinarily important bill aprovision that will hurt legal immigrants inAmerica, people who work hard for theirfamilies. pay taxes. serve in our military.This provision has nothing to do with wel-fare reform. Itis simply a budget-savingmeasure, and it is not right.These immigrant families with childrenwho fall on hard times through no fault oftheir own\u2014for example because they face thesame risks the rest of us do from accidents,August 1, 1996from criminal assaults, from serious ill- nesses\u2014they should be eligible for medicaland other help when they need it. The Re-publican majority could never have passedsuch a provision standing alone. You seethat in the debate in the immigration bill.for example. over the Gallegly amendmentand the question of education of undocu-mented and illegal immigrant children.This provision will cause great stress forstates. for localities, for medical facilitiesthat have to serve large numbers of legal im-migrants. It is just wrong to say to people,we'll let you work here. you're helping ourcountry. you'll pay taxes, you serve in ourmilitary. you may getkilleddefending America\u2014but if somebody mugs you on astreet corner or you get cancer or you get hitbya car or the same thing happens to yourchildren. we're not going to give you assist-ance any more. I am convinced this wouldnever have passed alone and I am convincedwhen we send legislation to Congress to cor-rect it, it will be corrected.In the meantime, let me also say that I in-tend to take further executive acUon direct-ing the INS to continue to work to removethe bureaucratic roadblocks to citizenship toall eligible. legal immigrants. I will do ev-erything in my power, in other words, tomake sure that this bill lifts people up anddoes not become an excuse for anyone toturn their backs on this problem or on peo-ple who are generally in need through nofault of their own. This bill must also not letanyone off the hook. The states asked forthis responsibility, now they have to shoul-der it and not run away from it. We have tomake sure that in the coming years reformand change actually result in moving peoplefrom welfare to work.The business community must providegreater private sector jobs that people onwelfare need' to build good lives and strongfamilies. I challenge every state to adopt thereforms that Wisconsin, Oregon. Missouriand other states are proposing to do, to takethe money that used to be available for wel-fare checks and offer it to the private sectoras wage subsidies to begin to hire these peo-ple, to give them a chance to build theirfamilies and build their lives. All of us haveto rise to this challenge and see that\u2014thisreform not as a chance to demor\u00fcze or de-mean anyone. but instead as an opportunityto bring everyone fully into the mainstreamof American life. to give them a chance toshare in the prosperity and the promise thatmost of our people are enjoying today.And we here in Washington must continueto do everything in our power to rewardwork and to expand opportunity for all peo-ple. The Earned Income Tax Credit which weexpanded in 1993 dramatically. is now re-warding the work of 15 million working fami-lies. I am pleased that congressional effortsto gut this tax cut for the hardest pressedworking people have been blocked. This leg-islation preserves the EITC and its benefitsfor working families. Now we must increasethe minimum wage. which also will benefitmillions of working people with families andhelp them to offset the impact of some of thenutritional cuts in this bill.Through these efforts. we all have to rec-ognize. as I said in 1992. the best anti-povertyprogram is still a job. I want to congratulatethe members of Congress in both parties whoworked together on this welfare reform leg-islation. I want to challenge them to put pol-itics aside and continue to work together tomeet our other challenges and to correct theproblems that are still there with this legis-lation. I am convinced that it does presentan historic opportunity to finish the work ofending welfare as we know it, and that iswhy I have decided to sign it.Q.Mr. President.some civil rights groupsand children's advocacy groups still say that August 1, 1996theybelieve that this is going to hurt chil-dren. I wonder what your response is to that.And, also. it took you a little while to decidewhether you would go along with this bill ornot. Can you give us some sense of what youand your advisers kind of talked about andthe mood in the White House over this?The PRESIDENT.Sure.Well, first of all, theconference was not completed until late lastevening, and there were changes being madein the bill right up to the very end. So whenI went to bed last night, I didn't know whatthe bill said. And this was supposed to be aday off for me. and when I got up and I real-ized that the conference had completed itswork late last night and that the bill wasscheduled for a vote late this afternoon,after I did a little work around the housethis morning. I came in and we went to workI think about 11:00.And we simply\u2014we got everybody in whohad an interest in this and we went throughevery provision of the bill, line by line, sothat I made sure that I understood exactlywhat had come Out of the conference. Andthen I gave everybody in the administrationwho has there a chance to voice their opin-ion on it and to explore what their viewswere and what our options were. And as soonas we finished the meeting. I went in and hada brief talk with the Vice President and withMr.Panetta,and I told them that I had de-cided that, on balance. I should sign the bill.And then we called this press conference.Q. And what about the civil rights groups\u2014The PRESIDENT. I would say to them thatthere are some groups who basically havenever agreed with me on this, who neveragreed that we should do anything to givethe states much greater flexibility on this ifit meant doing away with the individual en-titlement to the welfare check. And that isstill. I think, the central objection to mostof the groups.My view about that is that for a very longtime it's hard to say that we've had anythingthat approaches a uniform AFDC systemwhen the benefits range from a low of $187 amonth to a high of $655 a month for a familyof three or four. And I think that the systemwe have is not working. It works for half thepeople who just use it for a little while andget off. It will continue to work for them. Ithink the states will continue to provide forthem.For the other half of the people who aretrapped on it. it is not working. And I be-lieve that the child support provisions here,the child care provisions here, the protectionof the medical benefits\u2014indeed, the expan-sion of the medical guarantee now from 1998to 2002, mean that on balance these familieswill be better off.I think the problems inthis bill are in the non-welfare reform provi-sions, in the nutritional provisions that Imentionedand especially in the legal immi-grant provisions that I mentioned.Q. Mr. President. it seems likely there willbe a kind of political contest to see who getsthe credit or the blame on this measure. Sen-ator Dole is Out with a statement calling\u2014saying that you've been brought along tosign his bill. Are you concerned at all thatyou will be seen as having been kind ofdragged into going along with somethingthat you originally promised to do and thatthis will look like you signing onto a Repub-lican initiative?The PRESIDENT. No.Firstofall,because I don't\u2014you know, if we're doing the rightthing there will be enough credit to goaround. And if we're doing the wrong thing.there will be enough blame to go around. I'mnot worried about that. I've always wantedto work with Senator Dole and others. Andbefore he left the Senate, I asked him not toleave the budget negotiations. So I'm notworried about that.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEButthat's a pretty hard case to make.since I vetoed their previous bills twice andsince while they were talking about it wewere doing it. It's now generally accepted byeverybody who has looked at the evidencethat we effected what the New York Timescalled a quiet revolution in welfare. Thereare 1.3 million fewer people on welfare todaythan there were when I took office.But there are limits to what we can dowith these waivers. We couldn't get the childsupport enforcement. We couldn't get theextra child care. Those are two things thatwe had to have legislation to do. And thethird thing is we needed to put all the statesin a position where they had to move rightnow to try to create more jobs. So far\u2014Iknow that we had Wisconsin and earlier. Or-egon. and I believe Missouri. And I thinkthose are the only three states, for example,that had taken up the challenge that I gaveto the governors in Vermont a couple ofyears ago to start taking the welfare pay-ments and use it for wage subsidies to theprivate sector to actually create jobs. Youcan't tell people to go to work if there is nojob Out there.So now they all have the power and theyhave financial incentives to create jobs, pluswe've got the child care locked in and themedical care locked in and the child supportenforcement locked in. None of this couldhave happened without legislation. That'swhy I thought this legislation was impor-tant.Q. Mr. President, some of the critics of thisbill say that the flaws will be very hard tofix because that will involve adding to thebudget and in the current political climateadding the expenditures is politically impos-sible. How would you respond to that?The PRES1DErJT. Well, it just depends onwhat your priorities are. For one thing. itwill be somewhat easier to balance the budg-et now in the time period because the deficitthis year is S23 billion less than it was thelast time we did our budget calculations. Sowe've lowered that base $23 billion this year.Now, in the Out years it still come up. butthere's some savings there that we couldturn around and put back into this.Next, if you look at\u2014my budget corrects itright now. I had $42 billion in savings, thisbill has about $57 billion in savings. Youcould correct all these problems that I men-tioned with money to spare in the gap there.So when we get down to the budget negotia-tions either at the end of this year or at thebeginning of next year. I think the Americanpeople will say we can stand marginallysmaller tax cuts, for example, or cut some-where else to cure this problem of immi-grants and children, to cure the nutritional.problems.We're nottalking about vastamounts of money over a six year period. It'snot a big budget number and I think it caneasily be fixed given where we are in thebudget negotiations.Q. The last couple days in these meetingsamong your staff and this morning, wouldyou say there was no disagreement amongpeople in the administration about what youshould do? Some disagreement? A lot of dis-agreement?The PRESIDENT. No. I would say that therewas\u2014first of all.I have rarely been as im-pressed with the people who work in this ad-ministration on any issue as I have been onthis. There was significant disagreementamong my advisers about whether this billshould be signed or vetoed, but 100 percent ofthem recognized the power of the argumentson the other side.It was a very movingthing. Today the conversation was almost100 percent about the merits of the bill andnot the political implications of it. BecauseI think those things are very hard to cal-culate anyway. I think theyre virtually im-possible.S9361I havetried to thank all of them person-ally. including those who are here in theroom and those who are not here, becausethey did have differences of opinion aboutwhether we should sign or veto, but each siderecognized the power of the arguments onthe other side. And 100 percent of them. justlike 100 percent of the Congress. recognizedthat we needed to change fundamentally theframework within which welfare operates inthis country. The only question was whetherthe problems in the non-welfare reform pro-visions were so great that they would justifya veto and giving up what might be what I'mconvinced is our last best chance to fun-damentally change the system.Q. Mr. President, even in spite of all thedetails of this, you as a Democrat are actu-ally helping to dismantle something thatwas put in place by Democrats 60 years ago.Did that give you pause, that overarchingquestion?The PRESIDENT. No. No. because it was putin place 60 years ago when the poverty popu-lation of America was fundamentally dif-ferent than it is now. As Senator Moynihan\u2014you know. Senator Moynihan strongly dis-agrees with me on this\u2014but as he has point-ed out repeatedly, when welfare was createdthe typical welfare recipient was a miner'swidow with no education, small children,husband dies in the mine, no expectationthat there was a job for the widow to do orthat she ever could do it. very few out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births. The wholedynamics were different then.So I have always thought that the Demo-cratic party should be on the side of creatingopportunity and promoting empowermentand responsibility for people, and a systemthat was in place 60 years ago that workedfor the poverty population then is not theone we need now. But that's why I haveworked so hard too to veto previous bills.That does not mean I think we can walkaway from the guarantee that our party gaveon Medicaid, the guarantee our party gaveon nutrition. the guarantee our party gave inschoollunches,becausethathasnotchanged. But the nature of the poverty popu-lation is so different now that I am con-vinced we have got to be willing to experi-ment. to try to work to find ways to breakthe cycle of dependency that keeps draggingfolks down.And I think the states are going to find Outpretty quickly that they're going to have tobe willing to invest something in these peo-ple to make sure that they can go to work inthe ways that I suggested.Yes, one last question.Q. Mr. President. you have mentioned Sen-ator Moynihan. Have you spoken to him orother congressional leaders, especially con-gressional Democrats? And what was theconversation and reaction to your indica-tion?The PRESIDENT. Well, I talked to him as re-cently, I think, as about a week ago. Whenwe went up to meet with the TWA families.we talked about it again. And, you know, Ihave an enormous amount of respect for him.And he has been a powerful and cogent criticof this whole move. I'll just have to hopethat in this one case I'm right and he'swrong\u2014because I have an enormous regardfor him. And I've spoken to a number ofother Democrats, and some think I'm rightand some don't.This is a case where, you know. I have beenworking with this issue for such a longtime\u2014a long time before it became\u2014to goback to Mr. Hume's question\u2014a long timebefore it became a cause celeb in Washingtonor anyone tried to make it a partisan politi-cal issue. It wasn't much of a political hotpotato when I first started working on it. I just was concerned that the system didnt S9362seemto be working. And I was most con-cerned about those who were trapped on itand their children and the prospect thattheir children would be trapped on it.I think we all have to admit here\u2014we allneed a certain level of humility today. Weare trying to continue a process that Ivebeen pushing for three and a half years.We're trying to get the legal chances weneed in federal law that will work to movethese folks to a position of independencewhere they can support their children andtheir lives as workers and in families will bestronger.But if this were an easy question, wewouldn't have had the Cwo and a half hourdiscussion with my advisers today and we'dall have a lot more answers than we do. ButI'm convinced that we're moving in the rightdirection. Im convinced its an opportunitywe should seize. Im convinced that we haveto change the two problems in this bill thatare not related to welfare reform, that werejust sort of put under the big shade of thetree here, that are part of this budget strat-egy with which I disagree. And I'm convincedwhen we bring those things Out into the lightof day we will be able to do it. And I thinksome Republicans will agree with us aridwe'U be able to get what we need to do tochange it.Thank you.The PREsS. Thank you.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Mexico is recognized.Mr. DOMENICI. I understand SenatorSPEcThR is next, and I might ask, willthe Senator yield me 1 minute withoutlosing his right?Mr. SPECtER. I do.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. if Iwas representing President Clinton, asmy good friend from Nebraska has. Iwould be trying to divert attention towhat Senator Dole might do. I wouldbe diverting attention away from Sen.ator Dole who might cut taxes for theAmerican people because, speaking of adismal record, the President seeks tohide behind a statistic that says wehave had great economic growth. Butthe big fairy tale, to borrow a wordfrom my friend from Nebraska. is thatwe have had the second lowest produc-tivity growth in 50 years: real-wagegrowth is the lowest in 32 years; stag-nant family incomes like we havenever seen:tax burdens have risensharply, almost I whole percent moreof tax burden on the American people.That is why they do not think we aredoing very well. That is why they say:What is happening to our salaries andour wages?Now, having said that, clearly if Ihad that record, I would be worried andtrying to set up a smokescreen as towhat Bob Dole might do when they donot even have the slightest idea whatBob Dole is going to do: he has not toldanyone. We anxiously await a planwhich will dramatically improve thesekinds of economic facts. That is whatwe hope for.I thank the Senator for yielding timeto me.Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time to the Senator from Penn-sylvania?Mr. DOMENICI. I have already yield-ed to him in sequence. I stated it, butI did not state how much time.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEMr. SPECTER. I may be able to do itin less than the 20 minutes I request. Iwill try to.Mr. DOMENICI. I hope the Senatorwill try. The Senator is yielded up to 20minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen..ator from Pennsylvania is recognized.Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sup-port the welfare reform bill with sub-stantialreservations.Isupport thewelfare reform bill because I think it isour best chance to break a patternwhich has existed for decades wherepeople rely upon welfare and find them-selves dependent upon welfare and haveno way to break out of the welfarecycle, the welfare chain to find jobs. Ibelieve this legislation. while far fromperfect\u2014it doesnotcontain manyamendments that I voted for\u2014is thebest chance to do it at this time.This legislation has advanced to thisstage with substantial bipartisan sup-port; 23 of 46 Democrats voted for thisbill. The President of the United Stateshas stated his intention to sign the billwhen it reaches his desk if the con-ference report is passed. It seems to bea very high probability.One of my colleagues on the Repub-lican side has voted against the bill be-causeitisnot tough enough. notstrong enough in limiting welfare bene-fits. Those are some of the indicatorsthat this bill perhaps is,if not bal-anced, about as good a job as we coulddo given the problems of our societyand given the problems of a campaignyear.I think it does not advance our causeat all to talk about Bob Dole and WillyLoman or to talk about a Republicanmajority coming to its wits, but, in-stead, to try in a bipartisan way tofashion welfare reform which will servethe American people, which will helptake those on welfare off welfare, be-cause I think it is certainly true thatpeople on welfare would much ratherhave a job and not be on welfare, andto try to take away the burden of thisentitlement on our society.The issue of welfare reform is some-thing which this Senator has been con-cerned about for a long time. In the99th Congress, I cosponsored 5. 2578 and5. 2579 with Senator MOYr'Jnip.N. thosebills being directed toward improvingthe welfare system. In the 100th Con-gress. I introduced similar legislationon a bipartisan basis with SenatorDODD, and then worked closely withSenator Mo''r'IH,\\rs1 on the legislationthat first became comprehensive wel-fare reform on the 1988 Family WelfareReform Act, which was signed by Presi-dent Reagan.This year, after welfare reform hadfaded from the picture, after the Presi-dent's vetoes. I joined my colleaguefrom Delaware, Senator BIDEN. on June12 in introducing bipartisan legislationcaptioned 5. 1867. which was an iden-tical bill to a bipartisan bill introducedby Congressman CASTLE and Congress-man TANNER in the House.The Biden-Specter bill was not suc-cessful. nor was the Chafee-Breaux pro-August 1, 1996posal successful, both of which wouldhave eased the problems for childrenand eased the problems for immigrants.and I think made for a more orderlytransition on welfare reform.Iregret very much that SenatorBREAUX's amendment did notpass, Senator BREAUx's amendment being di-rected to provide vouchers for childrenbeyond the5 years. Senator FORD'samendment did not pass. It was a nar-row vote. I supported it. It would haveprovided noncash benefits after 5 years.We have crafted a bill here whichtakes Out a good bit of the inflexibilitywhich was presented in the legislationby the House of Representatives andcomes somewhat close to the bill whichpassed the Senate last year by a lop-sided vote of 87 to 12.Mr. President. this bill does providean opportunity for those who are onwelfare to take ajob which they wouldhave never taken before because thereare many jobs which pay less thantheirwelfarebenefits.Why wouldsomeone take a job which pays lessthan their welfare benefits? They stayon welfare.This legislation. going to acore issue, will provide an opportunity forsomeone to take a job which pays lessthan welfare, which that individualwould not now take since welfare paysmore, because there will be flexibilityto add a supplement, so that there willbe a supplement from welfare funds.which means the welfare payment isless and the individual will be gettingmore with his lower wage in the pri-vate sector and the welfare supple-ment, and will have the benefit of Med-icaid where the employer does not payhealth benefits. So there is an oppor-tunity to move from the welfare roll tothe payroll.This legislation provides that able-bodied individuals will be limited as tohow long they can be on welfare, re-ceiving 2 years of assistance if they arenot working; lifetime benefits are lim-ited to a maximum of 5 years, but theStates do have flexibility to provide ahardship exemption up to 20 percent ofthe State's caseload if those require-ments are not met. This. I think, is re-alisticallycalculatedtoencourage able-bodied men to work.With respect to finding jobs, there isjob training provided and flexibility tothe States, and the States are givensubstantial incentive to take individ-uals off the welfare rolls.This legislation also moves to a coreproblem of teenage mothers who are onwelfare with the requirement that theylive at home unless there is some show-ing that there is brutality at home orsomething which is incompatible withliving at home. But the teenage moth-ers are required to live at home. Theyare required either to be in school oron jobs or in job training, and there isa very substantial amount of fundingin this bill for child care so that moth-ers can realistically do that.There are some provisions in this leg-islation which I think should have been August 1, 1996corrected. I think the amendments of-fered to leave noncitizens on the we!-fare rolls and apply the limitationsonly to the future would have beenmore sensible so people who come intothe United States would have noticethat they are not going to have thebenefits. I think the moratorium whichwas suggested on Medicaid benefitswould have been sensible.This bill provides for tough enforce-ment measures for child support, soparents have an obligation to supporttheir children.When you take a look at this legisla-tion in its totality, it is a step in theright direction. It has been crafted in acontentious political year where thereare deep.political divisions in the Con-gress, so there is a substantial block ofDemocratic support\u201423 Democrat Sen-ators having voted forit;an equalnumber on the other side. The Presi-dent, a Democrat, has stated his inten-tion to sign the conference report.There is very substantial support onthe Republican side, with one Repub-lican Senator having voted against itbecause it gives too much to welfarerecipients. But there is a real need tomove ahead, to try to give people anopportunity to have jobs.During my tenure as district attor-ney of Philadelphia. I saw many peoplein that big city trapped in the welfarecycle. I think, when they have an op-portunity to take a job which is a low-paying job, they are not going to takeit today if they lose medical benefitsunder Medicaid and they get less onthe low-paying job than they have onwelfare. But, when you have flexibilitywith the States\u2014and there are manyexamples where the States have movedahead on a flexible system. Wisconsin.illustratively, Michigan, illustratively.and other States. Governor Thompsonisending welfare,not just talkingabout it but ending welfare in 1997\u2014this welfare bill goes a substantial dis-tance.I know it is going to result in someholes in the safety net. But we willhave an opportunity to revisit those is-sues. But taken as a whole, my view isitis a significant step forward, andthat is why I am supporting it.I yield the remainder of my time andyield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time to the Senator from Illi-nois? The Senator from Illinois is rec-ognized.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Presi-dent, I understand the Senator fromNebraska is not on the floor as yet.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator may yield herself time.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will do so.Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield fora question?Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield to theSenator from Nebraska for a question.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen..ator from Nebraska.Mr. EXON. Mr. President. I thank mycolleagueforyielding.Beforeshe starts in on her speech. which I assumeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEis on her objection to the welfare bill,but she may be talking about econom-ics because she has been very much in-volved in things that we need to do toshape up America. I want to ask her aquestion. Did the Senator hear whenthe Senator from New Mexico madequite a point in answer to my disserta-tion on supply-side economics and sky-rocketing deficits that have been cor-rected and turned around by PresidentClinton? He was complaining about theproductivity of America.If we want to look at the productiv-ity of America, I think we ought to putthat in terms that people can under-stand:notproductivity,butjob growth. The percentage of change onan annual basis during the ReaganiBush years\u2014and I think it is consistentbecause Italked about the ReaganlBush years and the skyrocketing defi-cits that were created then\u2014all duringthose Reagan/Bush years. the privatesector job growth was 1.6percent. Under President Clinton it is 2.9 per-cent. That says something about pro-ductivity. does it not?Does that not say also somethingabout jobs and job creation, which iswhat the economy is all about?Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. It certainlydoes.Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Il-linois.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Presi-dent. I say to my colleague from Ne-braska. my colleague referenced thefact that I am kind of an armchaireconomist. I like these issues. But Imust tell you. I find it more than a lit-tle ironic on a day on which we aretalking about how well the Americaneconomy is doing, we are declaring de-feat and failure on our response to pov-erty and throwing in the towel on poorchildren in America.I point out, in the first instance. Ihave heard a lot of discussion aboutthe numbers pertaining to this welfare\"reform\"debate,about how muchmoney is being spent. For the generalpublic, it sounds like an awful lot ofmoney because that is what we do here.We talk about a budget that is almost$2 trillion. So the numbers associatedwith welfare, which impacts very dra-matically on the lives of the most vul-nerable people in our society. soundlike an awful lot of money. Still, alltold, those numbers relate to about\u2014well. actually less than 1 percent of theFederal budget. It is1 percent of theFederal budget. but that has an impacton Americans. particularly Americanchildren who are poor. greater than theother 99 percent that we spend. I justwant to put that in context.Mr. President. the French have anexpression.ifI may in my brokenFrench, \"plus ca change. plus c'est lameme chose,\" and it means essentiallythe more things change the more theyremain the same. The fact of the mat-ter is, this bill no more warrants thetitlereform\" than any of its prede-cessors. This bill is still an abomina-tion, which is what I called the pre-S9363vious bill. and I intend to vote againstit for precisely that reason\u2014and I keepcoming back to the question, and noone has answered the question: Whatabout the children? What happens tothem when all is said and done, withall the cuts and the changes that weare making in this legislation?When I talk about the children, I talk about them in the context that,again, welfare is simply a response topoverty. The system is broken. It needsto be reformed and fixed. The problem.however, is that, that is not what thisbill does. Welfare reform should not beabout pushing people. and pushing chil-dren particularly, into poverty.The Urban Institute has concludedthat 1.1 million children will be throwninto poverty by this bill. Estimates forprevious welfare bills passed by theCongress were1.5millionchildren thrown into poverty. Now 1.1 million isless than 1.5 million. but it is still toomany. The earlier Senate bill wouldhave cut off 170.000 children in myhome State of Illinois because theirfamilies had reached the time limits.That is about 28 percent of the childrenpresently receiving the AFDC subsidyin my State.I want to talk about AFDC again. themisconceptions and the welfare my-thology,because there has been a whole lot of conversation about howthis system is broken. let us turn itover to the States, let us let them doit. That is where I come back to thenotion that we have \"been there, donethat.\" This is called \"back .to the fu-ture.\"I have to mention that the PresidingOfficer and I worked together, when wefirst got here, on the whole question ofunfunded mandates and the relation-ship between State and Federal Gov-ernment. But it is precisely that rela-tionship that is at the base of the de-bate going on here. For those who donot know the history. I want to refermy colleagues to the history of whathappened before we had a national safe-ty net for poor children in this coun-try.Ihave referenced previously thisissue, I am looking at the spring 1995issue of Chicago History magazine. Iwant to read the title of the article,Friendless Foundlings and HomelessHalf-Orphans.\" I never read the firstline. which I think I will share with mycolleagues. It says:In 19th century Chicago. the debate overthe care of needy children raised issues ofGovernment versus private control and insti-tutional versus family care.Mr. President, that is exactly the ar-gument I have heard all day long onthiswelfaredebateinthis Senatetoday. So we are facing some of thesame issues and some of the same ques-tions that came up in our country 100years ago.Let me show you what State flexibil-ity got us last time, Mr. President. Thelast time we had State flexibility. wehad children sleeping in the streets,which was the first poster. S9364Hereis another one. This is anotherpart of the experiment, again, the his-tory that people maybe have forgotten.The fact is, they were scooping chil-dren up from the alleys in New York.shipping them to Rockford. IL. andauctioning them off. This is what hap-pened with poor children.This is the \"Asylum Children\":A company of children, mostly boys. fromthe New York juvenile asylum will arrive inRockford. IL, and remain until evening. ** theyare from 7 to 15 years of age. ***Homesare wanted for these children withfarmers.This is the response States came upwith before we had a national safetynet.I have another poster which anotherresponse- by states called the orphantrains. To be candid, maybe SpeakerGINGRICH really had studied the historywhen he talked about we will just haveto put these kids in orphanages. Thatis what happened at the turn of cen-tury. They took children from thealleys of New York, put them on trainsand took them out West to give themhomes. Some are still living and cangive testimony to what happened be-fore we had a national safety net forpoor children in this country, and get-ting rid of that safety net is what thisso-called welfare reform is all about.We are rending that safety net apartjust because it has not worked.Mr. President. I submit to you, itmay not have worked, but, we can dobetter by way of reforming it. This isnot reform. Real welfare reform wouldmean we give people jobs. we give themsome way to work, we give them someway to take care of themselves, we givethem some way to take care of theirchildren. That would be real welfare re-form. That is not what this legislationdoes.Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Sen-ator will yield for a Question.Ms. MOSELEY-BIAUN. Only if itwill not take from my 20 minutes.Mr. DOMENICI. I ask it be on mytime.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. DOMENICI. In all those casesyou described.1900 in Chicago. 19thcentury, do you have any idea howmuch the States and the National Gov-ei-nment was spending on these kindsof poor people then?Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. It dependedon the State. In fact, I commend thearticle to my colleague. What they sayhere is depending on the State\u2014someStates had better programs for han-dling poor children than others\u2014infact, one of the tragic things about it.and I was kind of ashamed, my State ofIllinois did not do well with poor chil-dren.Mr. DOMENICI. I was wondering ifyou knew how much we were going tobe spending on these programs, includ-ing food stamps, which is an entitle-ment. One-hundred thirty billion dol-lars. - Ms.MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say to mycolleague. I am prepared to debate thisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwith you, but. in the first place. again.that is less than 1 percent of the budg-et. We spend that much in an afternoonon some other programs that I knowmy esteemed colleague supports. But Ialso point out to my colleague thatthis bill cuts $54 billion from these pro-grams over the next 6 years in thename of welfare reform, with most ofthe cuts coming out of food stamps andcoming out of help for legal immi-grants.The real problem. Mr. President, isthat this bill is not designed to movepeople from welfare to work. There isnot an adequate investment in childcare, in job training or in job creation.factors which are critical to movingpeople into the work force.Instead, this bill is arguably aboutsaving money. The $54 billion cut sim-ply represents, and I again go back tounfunded mandates, a shift in fundingfrom the Federal to the State and thelocal governments. Poor people are notgoing to go away the day this legisla-tion goes into effect, and in light of thefact we have failed to provide for anyemployment, we have failed to createany jobs. we have failed to provide ade-quatechildcarefunding. we havefailed to address the fundamental cau-sations of poverty, the fundamentalreasons they are poor to begin with.e.g., they do not have a job to takecare of themselves. And, we are talkingabout the able-bodied, people. Unfortu-nately, the fine print of this bill alsohas an effect on non-able-bodied peopleas well.Nonetheless, the fact is, with regardto able-bodied, anybody who can workshould work, and anybody who canwork ought to take care of their ownchildren. But this bill makes no provi-sion for that, and that isthe fun-damental problem. On October 1, theeffective date of this legislation, therestill will be areas in this country withexcessive poverty and excessive unem-ployment. Those people. Mr. President,are not going to go away.I point out that the CongressionalBudgetOfficehassaidthat mostStates will not and cannot meet thework requirements in this bill. Thatalone should tell us that something iswrong with this picture. If the work re-quirements arenot met, and thatmeans the people do not have jobs andfamilies then get cut off because of thetime limits in the bill, then what hap-pens? What do these people do withtheir children?Do we put them on trains and sendthem out West? Do we scoop them outof alleys and auction them off? Whatare we going to do with the children?That is the essential question that hasnot been answered: What happens tothe children once the time limits arereached, once the assistance is cut off?There is no provision for them. Evenassuming for a moment the 20-percentcushion that is given in here, the kindof hardship exemption that States canuse or the title XX funding, the entireprogram along with the title XX fund-August 1, 1996ing are cut about 15 percent in this bill.This entire thing is predicated on cut-ting money. So you are talking aboutless money for a problem that is goingto result in the great unanswerableabout what it is we do with children.Are we going to have the State andlocal governments pick up the costs as-sociated with the children of the job-less poor? Or are we going to then say,\"Well, private charities can pick itup\"? What do we do about these chil-dren?And then, Mr. President, and this iswhere we get to Speaker GINGRICH's re-mark about orphanages, what do youdo when you have someone who hasreached the time limit, has children,still does not have a job and cannotfeed those children? Do we then startchild custody cases in the State courtsof this Nation? Do we then put them inorphanages. as the Speaker suggested?No one has answered that question.Mr. President. I have a friend who isa juvenile court judge back in Illinois,and she tells me that she already isseeing cases that come in as child ne-glect cases which really are a reflec-tion of people who do not have enoughmoney to take care of their children.She is seeing that happen already.Mr. President, this legislation thatwe are calling by the misnomer of \"re-form\" is going to exacerbate that prob-lem. This bill does not provide enoughmoney for people to go to work. It doesnot provide any job training, it doesnot provide any jobs. it does not pro-vide any education, it does not provideadequate child care, and we are goingto see an increase in costs passed alongto State and local governments.On the child care question. are wenow going to also see an increase inlatchkey kids and \"home alone\" chil-dren. because the bill requires for thosewho do get employed that they gowork. So if you are able-bodied and canfind ajob. you must, under this legisla-tion,comeoffwelfare.you havereached the limit, you have to go towork. What if you have a 3-year oldchild? Where does that child go? Thereis inadequate money. as the PresidingOfficer, I know, is well aware, inad-equate money to pay for child care.The Governors and the mayors willdiscover that this bill. which in the be-ginning looked likeit offered themsomething significant. is really a Tro-jan horse. We are going to deliver tothe Governors and the mayors the re-sponsibility for masses of poor childrenthat we, as national legislators. do notwant to face.Iask unanimous consent to haveprinted in the RECORD a letter from theNational Association of Counties urg-ing us to vote against this welfare billbecause, and I quote. \"counties willbear the brunt of the cost shift and willbe left with only two options: to cut es-sential services, such as law enforce-ment and fire protection. or to raiselocal taxes.\"There being no objection. the letterwas orderedtobeprintedinthe RECORD, as follows: August 1, 1996NATIONAL ASSOCiATION OF COUNTIES.Washington. DC. July 30. 1996.DEARSENATOR: The National Associationof Counties (NAC0) urges you to vote againstthe conference agreement on welfare reform(1-1.R. 3747). If this bill is enacted, countieswill bear the brunt of the cost shift and willbe left with only two options: to cut essen-tial services, such as law enforcement andfire protection, or raise local taxes. Countiesare already developing more efficient welfareprograms, but there is no way we can absorbthe federal governments costs all at once.NACo has long standing policy supportingthe entitlement nature of Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children (AFDC) and oppos-ing funding caps including those in the legis-lation. Ending the entitlement for AFDC es-sentially dismantles the federal safety netfor children.We also oppose the denial of benefits tolegal immigrants. NACo has consistently op-posed denying Supplemental Security In-come and Food Stamps to this population.These provisions will disproportionately af-fect counties in states with large immigrantpopulations. The California State Associa-tion of Counties estimates that the legal im-migrant exclusions will cost California coun-ties more than $10 billion over six years.Counties are also deeply concerned aboutthe legislations work requirements. Becauseof the funding cap, the bill lacks the suffi-cient funds to meet these requirements andoperate welfare to work programs efficientlyand could result in substantial unfundedmandates. Minnesota counties alone saidthat they would need to spend about $44 mil-lion to meet the work requirements for FY1997. Since the participation rates increaseevery year. this cost will increase as well.Able-bodied individuals should be expectedto work, but effective programs require sub-stantialinitial investments and countiescannot be expected to pick up the full costs.The bill will ultimately shift costs and li-abilities,create new unfunded mandatesupon local governments, and penalize low in-come families. NACo therefore urges you tovote against the conference agreement.Sincerely,MIcHAEL H1GHTOwER,President.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Presi-dent, no one is here to argue that thecurrent welfare system is a wonderfuland perfect response to poverty. It isnot. We do want to encourage inde-pendence. We do want to encouragefamily structure. We want to discour-age illegitimacy, give people an oppor-tunity to come together, create fami-lies, raise their children and take careof them themselves.We want to inspire hope in our peo-ple. We want to lift Americans out ofpoverty. Poverty should be somethingwe have conquered in this great Nationwith such a healthy economy as weheard tell about today. But we havenot gotten there.As we tinker with this situation, aswe try to work this situation, we can-not just say we are going to slash themoney, cut the money, send it to theStates and try to do reform on thecheap, which is what this bill does.Governor Thompson\u2014and it has beentalked about as the great welfare ex-periment out of Wisconsin\u2014GovernorThompson acknowledges that welfarereform has to encompass jobs. childcare, and creation of real opportunityfor people. That costs money. You can-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEnot do it on the cheap. And that is notwhat is in this legislation.Believe it or not, Mr. President. I ac-tually pray that this approach is goingto work. I mean, it is hard to say. Ipray it will because, quite frankly, I donot want to see the harm that this his-tory suggests that we are about to visitagain. I do not want to see this happento anybody, particularly poor childrenin a country as great as ours.But I have to tell you something. Ibelieve thatitisa fundamentallyflawed premise that if you simply stopgiving people assistance,if you stophelping them with their subsistence,they will go to work and stop having.babies. If this bill cures illegitimacy,dependency, joblessness and hopeless-ness. I will congratulate my colleagueswho support this legislation. However,Mr. President, I tell you it is not likelyto happen.For all of the rhetoric about reform-ing the welfare system and helping thepoor take care of themselves, this billprovidesnothing\u2014nothing\u2014tohelp them get there. Cutting the income ofthe poorest Americans will not reducethe number of poor babies. It will not.It is not likely that we will cure theproblem of dependency by just cuttingpeople off and telling them their chil-dren's needs can just fall off the edge ofthe Earth. That is why the legislationis so flawed.Mr. President. I also question wheth-er or not the savings in this bill com-ing frorri food stamps and the elimi-nation of benefits for illegal aliens isgoing to help move people from depend-ency to independency. I doubt this leg-islation is going to do anything aboutproviding protections for children afterall title XX, the social services blockgrants. are cut in this legislation bysome 15 percent.So we are doing. I think, great harmto children. There are some, Mr. Presi-dent, who suggest that this bill is notperfect, that we can fix the flaws later.I do not think, Mr. President, that it isappropriate for us to play games and tobe so generous with the suffering of thepoor. with the potential and the effecton their lives this legislation suggests.We do not have the luxury of guessingin this area and making policy basedon mythology and not on fact. Thissystem may be broken, but the fact isthat it affects the lives of real people.We have been talking in this Cham-ber about the States and their inter-ests, about the system and how it oper-ates or does not operate. The fact is,they are real people, real lives and realfaces and real feelings and childrenwho deserve a chance in this, the great-est country on the planet.We are not giving them this chance,Mr. President. with this legislation.That is why I do not believe that wecan call this reform in good conscience.I believe that, unfortunately, this isagain back to the future, to the poli-tics of 100 years ago, where we saw thishappen before in history. They werenot any more or less compassionatethan we are today.S9365This Senate does not hold a monop.-oly on vision or compassion or politicalwill. The fact of the matter is. we areresponding. thislegislationis a re-sponse to the same political will thatexisted at the time.We have met the challenge of pov-erty, and we have declared failure, andwe have declared retreat. I think thatis a real ironic situation for us to facein light of the good economic news thatwas given today.In closing, Mr. President, I say toyou this. I hope that the political cal-culation that says that we can experi-ment like this based on the vulner-ability and the lack of political cloutof people who do not vote or who can-not vote, I believe that that is politicalexpediency. It does a disgrace to thewell intentions of the Members of thisbody.I know this bill is going to pass. Ithas the votes. And this is my thirdtime giving a speech on this subject.But I can tell you, Mr. President, weare going back to the future. This ishistory repeating itself. And all we cando is pray that the harm to the chil-dren does not become what everythingtells us it is likely to be. I yield to theSenator from Washington.Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Based ona previous agreement, the next Senatorto be recognized would be the Senatorfrom North Carolina. The Senator fromWashington, as the floor manager. isrecognized.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that iscorrect. I think we do have an agree-ment to go back and forth. And justsimply for-Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed theChair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Except. I sayto my colleague from Washington. I be-lieve, Mr. President, I had 20 minutesallocated to me. I do not believe I haveused up the 20 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. All timehas expired.Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. All time hasexpired? All right. Thank you.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just forRepublican purposes, the next four Re-publicans listed in order are SenatorsFAIRCLOTH,GRASSLEY.CI-IAFEEand GGG in that order. But, as I under-stand. we go back and forth. So afterSenator FAJRCLOTH, the Democrat willbe--is that Senator BRADLEY or Sen-ator Senator BRADLEY.I yield10 to the Senatorfrom North Carolina.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER.The Chair may clarify.The Democraticorder would be the Senator from NewJersey. then the Senator from NorthDakota, the junior Senator from theState of Washington. and then the Sen-ator from Montana.Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey.Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, it ismy understanding that after I speak. S9366thenit wouldbe theSenator from Cali-fornia. I know the Senator from NewJersey speaks after the Senator fromNorthCarolina.The Senator fromNorth Carolina shall speak, and then Iwill speak.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Carolina is recognizedfor 10 minutes.Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President. I had asked for 15 minutes. I see I was al-located 10.I think that will probablyhandle it. But I had been granted 15.Mr. GORTON. If the Senator wouldyield, we are beginning to run out oftime. The next three Republicans areeven going to get 10 minutes. So wehope the Senator can do it in that.Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I hope I run out ofspeech before I run out of time.Mr. President. I said many times, andmany times over, that in this welfaredebate we have not addressed the rootcause of welfare, and that is illegit-imacy. The root cause of welfare de-pendency is illegitimacy. Until we ad-dress that, we will not have addressedthe root cause of welfare. And my be-lief has only been strengthened bywhat I have seen during this year ofwelfare debate.Some of the weaker points in thewelfare bill have been strengthened bythe conference. The conference reportcontains a provision for work for wel-fare recipients, a concept known as payfor performance. If you have ever heardof anything ludicrous,itwould bebeing paid not to perform work. Onlyin the Federal Government, only in thewelfare system could anybody conceiveof not having to work to get paid.where that would be an unusual con-cept that you had to require pay forperformance. It is incomprehensible tome that anybody would be paid thatdid not perform.To truly reform welfare, we have toreverse the current welfare policieswhich subsidize and promote self-de-structive behavior and illegitimacy.These policies are and have destroyedthe family.This conference report will serve as agood starting point for changing wel-fare in a culture that is based entirelyon a system of personal responsibility.That is where we need to return to\u2014asystem based on personal responsibil-ity.I have heard several times here todaythat we could correct the mistakes inthis bill at a later date. I think by cor-recting mistakes, they meant make ita softer, weaker bill. I hope we will cor-rect the mistakes by making it a stronger. better bill and put more em-phasis on personal responsibility.I had hoped this bill would contain.like a previous conference report, aprovision known as the family cap. Inplain languagethe family cap saysthatif you are a welfare recipientdrawing AFDC and have more children,you do not get more money for havingmore children.We did not put that in this bill. Weabsolutely should have. It is one of theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEglaring weaknesses of it. that you cancontinue to have children and continueto be paid by the taxpayers. The middleclass American family that wants tohave children has to prepare, to plan.to save, to accept. to take on the re-sponsibility of having children. At thesame time. we are taking their taxmoney to support these people who arenot accepting personal responsibilityand having children, on and on and on.We are taxing the working people thatplan to have children. We are takingtheir money to pay for this irrespon-sible behavior.Today. more than one in every thirdchild is born out of wedlock, and inmany communities it can go up to 85percent. Children born out of wedlockare three times more likely to be onwelfare when they become adults, andchildren raised in single-parent homesare six times more likely to be poorand twice as likely to commit crimes.It is clear that the cost of this hasbecome an extreme burden on theAmerican people. Each year, half amillion children are born to teenagemothers, Over 75 percent of these occurout of wedlock, The estimated cost tothe American people, our taxpayers,are $29 billion to care for society's partin child-bearing adolescents under 18,That is the stated cost to the Americanpeople.I commend the conferees who wereable to restore an important provisionof the bill. This is the funding for, theabstinence education program which Iinitially offered as an amendment toour first Senate bill. Abstinence edu-cation has worked in those counties,cities. and States that have put it in. Ithas done as much or more to break thecycleofout-of-wedlock pregnanciesand teenage welfare recipients as any-thing we have done, I plan to continueto promote this program and to intro-duce it again in later bills.After 30 years of the so-called GreatSociety. we are on the verge of passinglegislation that will return welfare towhat it was supposed to have been 50 or60 years ago. Actually. when it wasfirst began, it was temporary help forresponsible individuals who had fallenon hard times. It is no longer that. Wehave converted it to a way of life inwhich generation after generation aftergeneration receive welfare. It is not temporary help for those people whohave had a hard time. No, we havetaxed these people: we have spent $5.2trillion to create the worst system thatwas ever made. Nobody likes it. It islong since time that we change whatwe have been doing. It is not designedfor people on hard times. It is designedas a way of life for people who choosenot to work.With the $5.2 trillion we put into it\u2014$5.2 trillion is very close to the exactamount of our national debt\u2014we havemore poverty than we had when westarted. When we started this programof AFDC about 33 or 34 years ago, lessthan 7 percent of the children wereborn outof wedlock, By subsidizing il-August 1, 1996legitimacy, we now have it to over 37percent of the children. and it is rap-idly rising. It is even agreed by thePresident that it will soon exceed 50percent of the children in this country.It is long since time that we do some-thing about it, This bill makes a start,This bill makes a start. We are goingto see the States that fully implementthe work requiiements, that fully im-plement the requirements that peoplework for their welfare. they are goingto see such a great response and reduc-tion in their welfare rolls until theywill be applauded. and the other Stateswill attempt to emulate and copy whatthey are doing.I hope most of the States will takeadvantage of the opportunity giventhem to cut their welfare rolls. andthey will see a dramatic reduction andthe other States will attempt to emu-late.The real test ahead will be changingthe lives of today's welfare recipientsby helping them become sell-sufficientand ensuring that fewer and fewer peo-ple will come to need welfare, That isthe real purpose of what we are tryingto do, bring people to accept personalresponsibility. I believe this bill will doit. I intend to support it.ThePRESIDINGOFFICER(Mr.THOMPSON),TheSenator from New Jer-sey.How much time does the Senatoryield himself?Mr. BRADLEY. I yield myself 9 min-utes.Mr. President, this conference reporton welfare reformisapolitician'sdream, a poor person's nightmare. anda continuing source of anger and frus-tration for the taxpaying public thatwants real welfare reform.First. what the politician'sdream? Welfare, AFDC, $15 billion outof a $1.5 trillion budget has been a p0-litical football in this country for gen-erations: in some cases, a racialized po-litical football. as politician after poli-tician created in the mind of the publicthe idea that black women had chil-dren so they could collect $64per month for that third child in New Jer-sey. This bill allows those politicians,those Federal politicians, to end wel-fare and claim they will end povertyandillegitimacyand mind-numbingbureaucracy with one stroke. You cansend a signal to multiple constitu-encies under this welfare reform bill.Mr. President, this bill is a poor per-son's nightmare. The Urban Institutesays. as a result of this bill, there willbe 2.6 million more people in Americaliving in poverty, 1.1 million more chil-dren living in poverty. and they will beliving 20 percent deeper in poverty. Thegap between their income and the pov-erty level will be 20 percent lower.We say to send it back to the Statesand they can take care of it. Mr. Presi-dent, you have an economic downturnin the States. and they have a fixedamount of this money in a block grant.There is nothing that prevents themfrom cutting this poor person's grant August 1, 1996more, cutting benefits. saying you cannot go beyond 3 years. 2 years. 1 year.There are no requirements that we putin this bill. It is a poor person's night-mare.Mr. President,itisa continuingsource of anger and frustration for ourtaxpaying public that wants real wel-fare reform. When the public hearsend welfare as we know it.\" theythink 'end welfare.\" When people hearthat people are going to have to workfor welfare, they believe what politi-cians say\u2014beware. If you believe whatpoliticians say in this bill, that youhave to work for welfare, imagine howsurprised those individuals who havebelieved the politicians' rhetoric aboutwork and welfare, imagine how sur-prised they are going to be when theyfind out that States can pay about a$50 bounty per person instead of put-ting money up to put people to work.The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-et Office says that most States willsimply ignore the request to put peopleto work and instead pay the 5 percent,$50 penalty for the failure to meet thework requirements. It will pay them todo that.Just taking one example, the biggestcity. New York City, which operatesthe largest work program in this coun-try. Only 32.000 welfare recipients arein it out of 850.000 New Yorkers on wel-fare. The reason? Not because they donot want to do it\u2014lack of money tocreate jobs.The mayor of New York City saidthat to meet the work requirements inthe bill, the city would need $100 mil-lion more than it will receive in thisblock grant. It can't do it, and so itwill pay less, pay the $50 bounty perperson, to get out from under thatwork requirement. The politicians whoclaim the bill will put people to workwill suddenly discover a lot of peopleare not working.Imagine, there are those who thinkthis bill will promote marriage. Thisbill will not promote marriage at all.This bill will not promote two-parentfamilies. This bill will not promote re-ward for marriage. This bill will notpromote reward for work or penaltiesfor additional children. This bill willnot change the face of the bureaucratthat sits in his or her State office lis-tening coldly to whatever is said, re-sponding in a way that is at least in-sensitive and often demeaning. Thisbill will not change that.Imagine you are a taxpaying citizenin a State that has tough economictimes. The State will have a lot more'people on welfare, and their blockgrant may not cover them. The onlyway you are going to get more is byraising taxes. Imagine how you wouldfeel when a State three or four Statesover from you is in good times and itgets its block grant and only has to de-ploy 80 percent to welfare and can usethe rest to give its citizens tax cuts.That is why you need a national pro-gram. not a program of block grants.For those who believe in this remark-able federalism, anybody who thinksCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEthe State legislatures in Trenton. Al-bany. Sacramento. or wherever, aregoing to be more sensitive to issues re-lated to people who are poor or to chil-dren who are poor than national legis-lators. I have a bridge I would like tosell you shortly after I finish speaking.Mr. President. why is this bill such amistake, in addition to the points thatI have made? Well, when I left a smalltown on the banks of the Mississippi inMissouri. outside St. Louis, and wentto college in New Jersey\u2014a decisionthat changed my life\u2014in St. Louis, 13percent of the kids born that year wereborn to single parents. In 1994. 63 per-cent were born to single parents, and 85percent of the black children were bornto single parents. If we were honestabout this, Mr. President, we wouldadmit that no one knows what willchange this around. No one knows whatcombination of incentives and pen-alties and values will begin to changethis. That is why what we need is aFederal commitment and State experi-mentation, with a lot of different kindsof combinations of programs. Thenmaybe we can get the mix that willbreak this rising number of children inthis country born into single-parenthomes.But what this bill creates is Statechaos,notStateexperimentation.What this bill does is simply pass thebuck from Federal politicians to Statepoliticians: one group of politicianstake the pot of money and give it toanother group. Let us have a baseline.What is the illegitimacy rate in citiesin this country? What is the povertyrate? What is the unemployment rate?What is the violence or crime rate? In5 years, let us see whether this bill hasmiraculously changed all those statis-tics for the better because. deep down,that is the claim of this kind of legisla-tion, built on generations of using thisissue as a code word for a lot of otherthings in American politics.Mr. President, welfare was not thecause of these rising illegitimacy rates.and so-called welfare reform in this billwill not be the solution. The silver lin-ing\u2014if there is a silver lining in thisbill\u2014is the child support enforcementprovisions. They are the provisionsthat say that if you father a child. youhave an obligation to support thatchild. I strongly support those parts ofthis bill. But, Mr. President, I regret tosay that the rest of this bill is sorelylacking. I admit that it is a politician'sdream. a message to multiple constitu-encies. But it is a poor person's night-mare. and it is a source of continuinganger and frustration for the taxpayingpublic that wants real welfare reformand will not get it in this bill.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield10 minutes to the senior Senator fromIowa.Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yieldfor a unanimous consent request?Mr. GRASSLEY. If it doesn't comeoff my time.Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous con-sent that following Senator GRASSLEY,S9367I be allowed to address the Senate for9 minutes on another subject.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection. it is so ordered.Mr. COATS. Mr. President, are wefollowing an order of going back andforth?Mr-s. BOXER. I am on the Democraticlist.Mr. GORTON. Yes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. There isa suggested list, but it is not formallyagreed to.Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, Mr. President, we all should thank Presi-dent Clinton for keeping his campaignpromise of 1992 to end welfare as weknow it. He announced yesterday thathe would sign our legislation. Aftertwo vetoes of very similar welfare re-form legislation that we passed lastyear. we were beginning to wonderwhether or not he was serious aboutthat campaign promise of 1992. We areglad now to know, after 4 years of talk.that he is serious about ending welfareas we know it and that he won't bestonewalling anymore and that he willbe doing what he, as a Governor, saidought to be done\u2014return more author-ity over to the States. So we thankhim.We also know that Congress hasmade a very serious effort to reformwelfare, The last was in 1988. Such we!-fare reform was supposed to move peo-ple from welfare to work, to save thetaxpayers money, to reduce those onthe rolls, to move people to self-suffi-ciency. All of those things were pro-claimed in that 1988 legislation thatpassed 96 to 1.Now, 8 years later, we see 3 millionmore people on the welfare rolls. Wesee billions of dollars more being spent,and we also conclude that reform of thesystem. regardless of our good inten-tions and the reform that we werewanting to enact, did not happen.Thecurrentwelfaresystemhas failed.The programs werewell-in-tended, but they proved to be ineffi-cient, they proved to be unfair and,most importantly, they proved to dam-age those they were meant to help. Weare concerned about the children. Ourpresent welfare program was passeddecades ago out of concern for children.But after six decades. we find that ourchildren are the POW's of the war onpoverty.This has not helped our children. Ithas not strengthened our families. Andwe are insistent, in this legislation,upon making up for those wrongs ofthe past. In other words. to help ourchildren.Isaid that the last time Congresstried reform we failed. We built uponwhat we had been doing for 60 years\u2014to have everything run from Washing-ton; to micromanage everything fromWashington. But now, as we change theapproach for the first time in 6 dec-ades, it is not as, Senator BRADLEYtried to imply. just some casual effortto send it back to the States to solveall of our problems. No. We send it S 93 68backto the States because we haveseen the States succeed where we havefailed. I said that we wanted to movepeople from welfare to work. We want-ed to save the taxpayers' money. Wewanted to make people self-sufficient.We have failed.But we have seen States succeed.My own State of Iowa in 3 years ofreforms has 12 percent less people onwelfare: that is 4,000 less people on wel-fare. The monthly checks have gonedown from $371to$335, not because wewant to spend less to help families, butbecause there are more families work-ing and earning income. And as a Statewe have seen the highest percentage ofwelfare recipients in the Nation in thework force at over 33 percent. Underthe waiver Iowa received, we have acontrol group which is still under theold program. And in that control groupunder the old program, only 19 percentof the people have moved from welfareto work. Of those in the new program.over 33 percent of the people havemoved from welfare to work.So my State. Wisconsin, Michigan.and many other States, have a trackrecord of succeeding on welfare reformwhere the Congress in our last attemptin 1988 has failed.These local and State solutions canbe\u2014and are\u2014more innovative and tar-geted. They promote new opportuni-ties. I think they are doing what everywelfare reform intends to accomplish\u2014moving people from dependency to self-sufficiency, building self-esteem, mov-ing people from welfare to work, savingthe taxpayer dollars, and, most impor-tantly. ending the hopelessness thatwelfare recipients have experienced.In the process of passing this legisla-tion\u2014we are saving the taxpayers' over$55 billion. We are limiting the amountof time that people can be on welfareto a 5-year lifetime limit. We are help-ing recipients find jobs because theyhave to do this within 2 years of join-ing the program.States can do better if they want to.We are turning over the managementof these programs to the States be-cause they do a better job. We do it byblock grants to give the States morefreedom to use their money. We arestill going to have food stamp pro-grams and child nutrition programs.But these programs as well are goingto be reformed.Most importantly, individual peoplehave a responsibility, other than thetaxpayers, to take first and primarycare of their own families. Absenteedads are required to do better in pro-viding for their kids. This in the endwill do a better job than our givinggovernment aid to the children in need.We are going to get more for our money. Yet, we also provide for growthin this program at 4.3 percent annu- ally. What we are hoping for here is tomake sure that we provide hope for thefuture. Families that want self-esteembut do not have it will have the oppor-tunity to restore it again as they workoff a system that is a dead end.Part of the hope of the future is notonly that we pass this welfare reformand do good for people who are on wel-fare, but we hope that we are able toenergize this economy so that there aremore jobs not only for those who areleaving welfare for work but for peoplewho have never been on welfare. Weneed to create jobs and good payingjobs at that.We have seen during this administra-tion a 2.4-percent growth, the slowestgrowth of any administration sinceWorld War II except the administrationof President Nixon. If we had been ex-peri\u00e8ncing the growth on average thatother Presidencies have had, we wouldhave had many more jobs created. Andwe would not have the situation whereproductivity growth has averaged ameager six-tenths of a percent per yearunder President Clinton's tenure com-pared to the Iandone-tenth percentaverage pace that we have had since1973. That productivity per worker isgoing to mean more wages. more jobopportunities,andmore take-homepay.I yield the floor.Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California.Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. Mr. Presi-dent.First,I ask unanimous consent tohave printed in the RECORD a numberof editorials from newspapers in myhome State of California in oppositionto this welfare reform bill.There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:(From the Fresno Bee. July 27. 4996)BACKWARDWELFARE REFORMBillspassedby Congress go too far; thepresident should use his veto pen and de-mand a better legislative effort.Once again. Congress has passed welfarebills that are more about saving dollars andwinning votes than reshaping lives. As muchas Americans may want to reform welfare.they don't want a system that goes from ahand-out to the back of the hand.The House bill passed last week and a simi-lar bill passed Tuesday by the Senate wouldend the 60-year-old federal guarantee of as-sistance to poor children. In its place, thebills substitute block grants to the states.which would have wide power to set eligi-bility rules for assistance, but would be re-quired to cut off recipients after two years ifthey did not find work. Aid over a lifetimewould be limited to five years.There'sa wide consensus that welfareneeds to be converted to a jobs-oriented sys-tem. But moving welfare recipients, many ofwhom lack a high school diploma or market-able skills is a complex and expensive busi-ness. The most serious of the state workfarereforms, put forward by Republican gov-ernors in Michigan and Wisconsin, recognizethat reform must make upfront invest- ments\u2014in things like job training, child careand transportation\u2014if long-term welfare re-cipients or teen-age mothers are going tomove into jobs and achieve self-sufficiency.But the bills passed by Congress are morepunitive than supportive. The House billaims to save $60 billion over the next sixyeas. That means many states will not re-ceive adequate federai funds to move welfarerecipients into work or to provide expandedAugust 1, 1996assistancein times of recession, when joblosses push more families into need.Welfare reform doesn't require shreddingthe safety net for children and workers: theHouse bill attacks it with a cleaver. It cutsfood stamp dollars and removes eligibilityfor adults after three months if they aren'tworking. That means people who worked alifetime would be left in hunger after threemonths if severe unemployment, such asCalifornia has recently endured, preventedthem from findmg jobs. The bill would alsodeny food stamps to legal immigrants, re-gardless how hard they work.Moderate Republicans and Democrats triedto add protections for children and workingfamilieswithamendments thatprovide vouchers for services to children whose par-ents can't find work after the time limits.But the GOP majority defeated them.Now the last line of defense for decency isonce again President Clinton's veto pen.Having twice vetoed bad welfare bills, thepresident'spolitical advisers are pushinghim to sign any welfare bill that looks likeit will redeem his 1992 pledge to reform wel-fare. But Clinton has already proved his wel-fare reform credentials by approving federalwaivers for state reforms. He's already ush-ered in a new era in social policy around thecountry.It isn't necessary to sign a bad bill to \"endwelfare as we know it\"; Clinton should de-mand a bill that replaces welfare with some-thing more promising thai) a stingy planthat would put a million more kids in pov-erty. strap local governments and take thesafety net away from millions of workingfamilies.(From the Los Angeles Times. Aug. 1. 1996JIT'sWELFAREREFORM AT CAUFORNIA'sEXPENSEWhenPresident Clinton signs the com-promise welfare bill, as he says he will, theFinancial brunt will fall on California, hometo more immigrants than any other state.This is unfair to California taxpayers. Immi-gration is a national issue and its effectsshould be shouldered evenly. But that's notwhats going to happen.At least 40% of ail legal immigrants live inthis state, and half of those in California re-side in Los Angeles County, When needy non-citizens lose their federal benefits under thewelfare reform most of them obviously willturn to the counties and the state for assist-ance. They cannot legally be denied. But howto pay for it?State and county governments are re- quired to provide aid to all needy legal resi-dents. Expect lines of elderly. blind or dis-abled immigrants at relief agencies, for theywill no longer be eligible for federal benefits.Needy noncitizens will also lose access tofederal food stamps. All this adds up to gen-eral relief at local expense.Immigrants have been popular scapegoatsin Congress and were especially so in nego-tiations on welfare reform. Though the im-migrant poor account for a mere 5% of fed-eral social spending, cuts in their benefitsare expected to produce 60% of the plannedwelfare savings. For California, that load offthe federal budget could stick state tax-payers with more than $1 billion in new bills.The punishing elements of this welfare re-form distract from the positive provisions ofthe bill, such as greater flexibility for statesin designing their own programs to put wel-fare recipients to work, a major theme of thenational reform.Another key compromise allows states toprovide non-cash vouches for diapers andother child-care items to welfare motherswho have exhausted the five-year limit oncash benefits under the bill.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE August 1, 1996American children, however, will no longerbe entitled to federal subsistence aid simplybecause their families are poor. The nationalsafety net established by President FranklinD. Roosevelt in the 1930sis.in essence, evaporating. The changes could plunge an es-timated 11 million children deeper into pov-erty. Poor parents will be able to receivebenefits for two years. A time limit is cer-tainly appropriate, but should recipients becut off if they are responsibly looking forwork?Some of these changes are shameful, but itis the political will of a Congress determinedto decentralize the system, partly in re-sponse to the pressure of a presidential elec-tion year.The threat to legal immigrants, peopleworking and living in the United Statesunder a green card or other protection. is themost obvious fault of the legislation. Presi-dent Clinton says he believes, as do mostAmericans, that welfare should be a secondchance. not a way of life. But legal immi-grants wont get even temporary federal aid,even if they had paid taxes for years beforelosing a job. losing a limb or losing the in-come provided by spouse.By signing the welfare reform legislation.Clinton will be able to say he fulfilled a keycampaign promise to 'endwelfare as weknow it.\" But he wont be able to say that helived up to his more recent assertion thatchildren \"need to come Out ahead.\"EFrom the Sacramento Bee. July 30. 19961CLINTON'S WELFARE TESTBill Clinton. the man from Hope. ran forpresident as the candidate who would dosomething for children and the forgottenworking families who played by the rules butfound themselves falling behind in the eco-nomic race. But that promise won't meanmuch if he does not veto the misshapen wel-fare reform bill headed for his desk.No American leader has spoken more pas-sionately than has Clinton about how the de-clining wages of workers in the bottom halfof the job market have dragged millions offull-time workers and their families intopoverty and raised child poverty rates to lev-els unseen anywhere else in the industri-alized world. Yet instead of offering hope andassistance to those struggling families. Con-gress' pending welfare reform bill deliversthem a cruel body blow.Lost in the attention lavished on the bill'soverhaul of Aid to Families with DependentChildren, the grant program that goes pri-marily to single. nonworking mothers ofpoor children, are the totally unnecessarycuts the legislation would make in foodstamps, the key safety net program for low-income working people. According to theCongressional Budget Office. nearly half the$61 billion the bill cuts would come from nu-trition programs.Those cuts spell more suffering for familiesand children. An analysis by the Urban Insti-tute projects that the changes would push 2.6million more people below the poverty level,1.1million of them children. Altogethermore than 5 million working families wouldlose an average of $1,000 a year in income ifthe bill becomes law.There's a widespread consensus that we!-fare must be reformed to reduce long-termdependency and encourage work and per-sonal responsibility. But the current bill, un-derfunded and overly punitive, ignores every-thing we have learned over the last decadeabout moving welfare recipients into the jobmarket.More than half of welfare recipients lack ahigh school education at a time when labormarkets put a premium on education andskills.Two-thirdsliveincentralcities,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEplaces from which employers have fled. Attheir most successful, past efforts to movewelfare recipients into jobs. such as theGAIN program in Riverside County. have re-duced welfare rolls by only 10 percent and in-comes of welfare recipients by a few hundreddollars a month.Yetthe welfare bill requires states to movehalf of all recipients into jobs. even though.according to Congress' own experts. the billfalls $12 billion shy of full funding for thework program. Even if one heroically as-sumes that two-thirds of welfare familieswould find permanent employment, the bill'sfive-year lifetime limit on benefits wouldleave I million families\u2014adults and childrenalike\u2014without any source of income.Thepresidentknowswelfarereform doesnt require the sacrifice of millions ofyoung lives.If Clinton doesn't have thegumption and leadership skills to stand upand explain to the country the difference be-tween real welfare reform and Congress' actof callousness, what differentiates him fromhis Republican opponents?IFrom the Fresno Bee. Aug. 1. 19961CLINTON'S WELFARE SURRENDERPresident's reasoning for acquiesing on re-form bill, despite \"serious flaws,\" is barelycredible and clearly a political calculation.PresidentClintoneloquentlyexplained Wednesday the flaws in Congress' welfare re-form bill. It will punish hundreds of thou-sands of low-income working families by cut-ting back their food stamps. he said. It willtake away the federal safety net from legalresident workers who have paid their taxesand played by the rules. It will leave vulner-able poor children whose parents can't findjobs within the bill's five-year time limits.And after explaining all the reasons whythisbillis wrong, Clinton announced hewould sign it. Itwas the least principled actof a presidency in which principle has oftenrun a poor second.Clinton's rationale for signing the bill, de-spite its \"serious flaws.\" is barely credible.No one doubts that the welfare reform coreof the bill, which turns welfare from a fed-eral entitlement into a block grant for state-designed programs to assist needy familiesand move them into the workplace, could bepassed again by this or subsequent Con-gresses. There's widespread consensus thatthe current welfare system is broken.But if Clinton truly believes be can fix theflaws in this bill, he belongs to a very smallchurch. In an era of sound bites and attackads, what Congress. Democratic or Repub-lican, will soon dare to restore federal safetynet programs for legal immigrants, no mat-ter how needy or deserving? At a time ofgrowing budget stringency, what are thechances that Congress. once having slashedfood stamp spending. will reverse course andcome to the aid of the working poor?No matter how hard he tries to decoratehis action with policy arguments. Clinton'sdecision to sign this bill came down to a bru-tal political calculation born of a failure ofleadership on this issue.Had Clinton made welfare reform a top pri-ority in 1993. he could have shaped the na-tional debate and produced a new systemthat protected children even as it enforcedour values about work and personal respon-sibility. Instead, he left the issues to be de-fined by a GOP Congress more intent onbudget savings than shaping a humane andworkable welfare alternative. He thus puthimself in a political position where oppos-ng a bad bill could be made to look like op-position to reform.And now, for his failure of leadership andpolitical nerve, children and the workingpoor will pay.S9369(From the San Francisco Chronicle. July 22.19961WELFAREBILL Too HARSHMembersof the U.S. Senate had a chanceFridayto maintain a valid 60.year federalcommitment to help the truly needy whilestill moving toward a work-oriented welfareprogram. They didn't take it. and unless thelawmakerssignificantly changedirection this week, President Clinton has an obliga-tion to veto the-third welfare reform billthat comes before him.Clearly Clinton wants desperately to signan election-year bill that will allow him tosay he made good on his 1992 campaign prom-ise to end welfare as we know it.\"And the American public is squarely on theside of both the president and the manymembers of Congress who want welfare tobecome a work program and not remain innever-ending handout.But the Republican bill as currently con-stituted goes way too far in taking away thefederal government's duty to see that chil-dren do not go hungry or homeless.History shows that states do not alwaystake care of the neediest among us. evenwhen they make the best possible effort tofind work. The federal government shouldmaintain authority over welfare programs. aresponsibility that would be taken awaywith the Republican plan to give states wel-fare money in block grants.On Friday, the Senate turned down Demo-cratic amendments that would have alteredthe Republican plan to ensure that childrencould continue to receive federal help evenaftertheir parents were cut off.Forthat reason alone, the bill should berejected. While the culture of welfare as en-titlement clearly must change, wholesaleabandonment of the most helpless is not ac-ceptable.The Clinton administration has been lib-eral in its granting of federal waivers toallow states to try their own get-tough wel-fare-to-work programs. and the president hassaid he would continue to allow creativestate initiatives.Democrats are going to try again thisweek to amend the GOP bill. But so far, ad-ministrative directives, not legislation, offerthe best hope for welfare reform.IFrom the San Francisco Examiner. July 24,19961PUNISHINGTHE POORThe Dictionary defines as \"tomake \"the state ofbeing or doing well.\" It's a pity that corrup-tion of the language hasn't been added to thefederal Penal Code. Otherwise, members ofthe 104th Congress would be sentenced to anafternoon in the stocks. splattered with rot-ten vegetables.Bad enough that they have produced apackage of kick-the-poor legislation that iscallous,cruel,marble-hearted and meanspirited. Worse, this vote-pandering measurehas been given a supremely cynical label,\"welfare reform.\"The richest nation on Earth, with a mili-tary budget of $260 billion, is led these daysby politicians who assert with a straight facethat federal funds for public assistance andsupportservices are causes, not symptoms.ofwhat's wrong with our society.In its latest version, the welfare bill wouldshop federal funds to each of the 50 states inthe hopeful expectation that their governorsand legislators can come up with effectiveprograms that will end poverty as we knowit. This is nota joke.Conservativessay they want to end thepropensity on liberals to throw money at thepoor without doing much to beak cycles ofdependency. And yet.given the punitive S9370rhetoricby well-fed politicians of both par-ties, we're not surprised that the expulsionof families from welfare is not accompaniedby funds or mandates for training, schoolingor child-care programs.Sure lets get able-bodied men and womenoff the dole. But lets remember that 9 mil-lion children are among the 14 million peoplewho now get monthly survival checks underthe federal-state programs called AFDC. orAid of Families With Dependent Children.Most AFDC parents are single moms, fewwith job skills or work experience. Perhapstheir problems will go away if state bureau-crats replace federal bureaucrats, but wedoubt it.It's one thing to want to fix the enormousdisappointments and dilemmas of the na-tion's 60-year-old programs of federal aid tothe poor, but it's another for Congress todump the responsibilities on the states inthe name of \"reform. This is particularlygalling for California, because \"welfare re-form\" proposals included a cutoff of socialand health services for the state's legal im-migrants. And we'll have to make up the dif-ference.\"Reform' is supposed to make things bet-ter, not worse. It doesn't make sense fromany viewpoint, including the cry for govern-mental thrift, to create a terrible situationwhere children will be forced into orphan-ages or jails at many times the expense ofAFDC. Sen Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y. saysthe \"reform\" amounts tolegislative childabuse.\"[From the Los Angeles Times, July 18. 1996]PASSING THE Buck ON WELFARETucked into the Republicans' welfare re-form package in Congress is a wrongheadedproposal to cut benefits and social servicesto most immigrants who are legally in theUnited States but who have not yet becomecitizens. Under the proposal. Washington,which is seeking ways to finance federal wel-fare reform, would shift billions of dollars incosts to states and counties. The provisionshould be rejected.Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat,plans to offer an amendment to the bill tostrike Out restrictions on public benefits tolegal immigrants. a host of eligibility issuesranging from student aid to Medicaid forlegal immigrants already is part of a sepa-rate immigration bill now in conferencecommittee. There is no logic in includingthose matters in a welfare bill. The two is-sues should be handled separately.The welfare bill now proposes to help fi-nance the costs of reform by cutting $23 bil-lion over six years in benefits to legal immi-grants, including children and the elderly.This would be an unfair and punitive moveagainst legal immigrants who have played bythe rules.The bill would make most legal immi-grants now in the country ineligible for Sup-plemental Security Income (SSI) and foodstamps. Future legal immigrants (except forrefugees and asylum seekers) would be ineli-gible for most other federal means-testedbenefits (including AFDC and nonemergencyMedicaid services) during their fIrstfive years in the country.The cutbacks would disproportionately hitCalifornia. Florida. New York and Texas. thestates with the biggest immigrant popu-lations. California alone could lose $10 bil-lion, or about 40% of the proposed $23 billionin benefit reductions. Those ineligible forsuch benefits would have to turn elsewherefor aid. In Los Angeles County. for example,if all affected SSI recipients sought generalassistance relief instead it would cost thecounty $236 million annually. The cost shift-ing could have potentially disastrous resultsfor the already fiscally strapped county.The immigration bill now under consider-ation already includes $5.6 billion in savingsfrom tightening eligibility requirements forlegal immigrants on a variety of federal pro-grams. including Medicaid. the attempt touse welfare reform to slip through furthercurbs on public assistance to legal immi-grants should be called what it is\u2014a deplor-able money grab by Washington that canonly hurt California.Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thankyou..Mr. President, I am putting in theREcoanumber of editorials.From the Fresno Bee in the conserv-ative heartland of my State that says:Once again. Congress has passed welfarebills that are more about saving dollars andwinning votes than reshaping lives.The Los Angeles Times wrote:The financial brunt will fall on California,home to more immigrants than any otherState. This is unfair to California taxpayers.Immigration is a national issue and its ef-fects should be shouldered evenly.In another L.A. Times editorial:Passing the Buck on Welfare. U.S. provi-sion affecting immigrants would hit Statesand counties.The one from the San Francisco Ex-aminer:Punishing the poor.San Francisco Chronicle:Welfare Bill Too Harsh. Wholesale deser-tion of the most helpless is not acceptable.And they go on.So, today I stand here for welfare re-form but against this bill. I am votingno, because I am not for .punishingkids, and I am not for punishing Cali-fornia or other States that have mostof our legal immigrants.Saying that I am for welfare reformbut against this bill is not inconsist-ent. My desire for reform was expressedby my vote for the Senate welfare billlast year in the two Democratic leader-shipwelfare reformproposals.Mr. President. those bills were tough onwork, compassionate to children, andcracked down on parents who were ir-responsible.It was interesting to note the Sen-ator from Iowa talking about how thisbill goes after deadbeat dads. Well, Iwant to note that my deadbeat parentamendment which unanimously passedin the Senate bill last year is gonefrom this bill. My amendment wouldhave cut off benefits to deadbeat par-ents who refuse to pay their overduechild support. I think the proponents ofthis bill seem to be more interested ingetting tough with the kids than theirdeadbeat parents.The provisions to cut assistance tolegal immigrants will cost Californiaan estimated $9 to $10 billion over the6 years of the bill. Of all the legal im-migrants in the United States on sup-plemental security income, which ishelp to the aged, blind, and disabled,and of those on AFDC. which is help forfamilies with children, 52 percent livein my home State of California. Amongthose who would be cut off are elderlyimmigrants who are too disabled tonaturalize and young legal immigrantchildren.August 1. 1996Let us face it. For every move wemake, there is a counter move. Forevery action we take, there is a reac-tion. And speaking as a former countysupervisor from the County of Mann, Ican tell you at the bottom line it willbe California's counties that will feelthe brunt. When your county super-visors come in to see you to tell youabout the increase in homelessness andhelplessness, I hope then at least youwill be ready to take some action.In Los Angeles County, the effectswill be staggering.

In Los Angeles. 190.000legal residents could be cut off ofAFDC: 93.000 legal residents will loseSSI, which is assistance for the aged,the blind, and the disabled; 250,000 legalresidents will lose their food stamps;and 240000 legal residents could losetheir Medicaid.Los Angeles County could be facedwith a cost shift of $236 million peryear under this bill. And if the State ofCalifornia opts to bar Medicaid cov-erage to legal immigrants, it couldshift an additional $100 million peryear to the County of Los Angeles.The conference report will place C\u00e4li-fornia at serious risk of a huge nega-tive impact on health services. Again,for every action there is a reaction.Our public hospitals and our children'shospitals that got reimbursed for thesemedical costs will no doubt have todownsize, shut down, cut back, andshift costs. And the bottom line is, iflegal immigrants cannot receive Med-icaid. all Californians and all Ameri-cans will be placed at greater risk ofcommunicable diseases because thesepeople will not be treated.Senator FEINSTEIN and I worked hardon an amendment which said this verysimply. This is a massive change oflaw. Let us phase in the changes to ourlegal immigrants. Many of these legalimmigrants came here escaping perse-cution. Many of them do not havesponsors to pick up the tab. They haveno one else to turn to. If we are goingto change the rules, Senator FEINSTEINand I said, make it prospective. Unfor-tunately, the conference report did notmove in that direction.It really amazes me to think aboutthe message we are sending to anasylee or a refugee who risked their lifeto get to this country. Many of themare working. Many of them are payingtaxes, and doing well. If they fall onhard times, they are out. They are outof luck. And the costs will be shifted tothe counties.Many of these legal immigrants arechildren. We profess to care about chil-dren. Look in the eyes of a child beforeyou cast this vote, because this billwill subject even more children to pov-erty.I have to tell you, the Urban Insti-tute says more than 1 million childrenwill be thrust into poverty under thisbill. I hope that we can move quicklyafter this bill passes and is signed\u2014andwe know that is going to happen\u2014tosoften the blow on children.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE August 1,1996Icould not believe when this Senateturned down the Breaux-Chafee amend-ment. The Breaux-Chafee amendmentdid not get the 60 votes it needed. Doyou know what it said? That if littlechildren are cut off because for somereason their parents cannot find workwithin the mandated time period, chil-dren cannot get any help to get dia-pers: they cannot get any help to getspecial medicine, school supplies, orother necessary items.This is the United States of America.We know that a nation is judged byhow it treats its most vulnerable peo-ple. And I do not think it asks verymuch of very healthy U.S. Senatorswith big fat paychecks. big fat pay-checks,. to provide for vouchers for ababy who is unfortunate enough to bein a family with a mom who, even ifshe tries every day, cannot land a job.That was it for me.I thank my colleagues very much forbearing with me. This bill is not fair tomy State. That is clear. That is whynearly every major newspaper in Cali-fornia has said it is wrong. This bill isnot fair to innocent children. For thatreason. I stand here for welfare reformand against this bill which will bringharm to children and which will bringharm to my State. I hope we can miti-gate its ill effects.I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington.Mr. GORTON. I yield 10 minutes tothe Senator from Rhode Island.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island.Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I wouldappreciate it if I could be notified whenI have 1 minute remaining.I am pleased today to speak in behalfof the welfare proposal which camefrom conference. It is a good bill, andwhile there are areas which still couldbe improved, overall I think it is a positive first step toward real welfarereform. Indeed,itdoes represent acompromise. The administration hadsome thoughts they contributed. Obvi-ously. the House did, and clearly, ofcourse, the Senate did.We can no longer continue the cur-rent welfare system. I think that isclear.This system hasencouragedlong-term dependency, and that hasbeen addressed several times this after-noon and this morning. There is onething we all know, that the surest pre-scription for a life of poverty is to beborn to young, to unmarried, and topoor parents. It is time to give theStates a chance to improve the lives ofall these poor families.This billdoes that.It turns theAFDC Program over to the States andallows them, the States, to create pro-grams suited to the needs of the resi-dents of those States. We are doing thiswithvery fewrestrictionsonthe States. Indeed, we can practically rat-tle off the restrictions. The States willbe required to impose time limits onbenefits. The States will have to meetCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtough work participation rates. Buthow they achieve these goals is left al-most entirely to the State and to thelocal government.I would like to see more Federaloversight of the program. I was on theconference. I presented my views butdid not prevail in that particular area.The Governors insist that they willdo the right thing and we ought tohave confidence in them. I am hopeful.indeed optimistic. that they will, but Icertainly will be keeping a close eye onthe progress in this area.While we are giving the States maxi-mum flexibility, there are several im-portant protections in this bill. First.we have ensured that families who losecash benefits because of changes in theState's cash assistance program, thosefamilies will still be entitled to receiveMedicaid. If the State goes down, low-ers the level at which an individual canqualify for cash assistance, the fami-lies still receive Medicaid based on theold formula. This is the critical provi-sion for the success of welfare reform.In the last 2 years, in the FinanceCommittee welfare reform hearings.one thing we heard over and over isthat we cannot pull the rug out frombeneath these poor families. In order tobe able to support themselves theymust have Medicaid coverage.I am very pleased that this bill includes theamendment Senator BREAUX and I sponsored to continVe Medicaid cov-erage for these individuals.Earlier versions of welfare reform in-cluded block grants in several childwelfare and foster care programs. I have long believed that despite thename \"child welfare\"\u2014that is a mis-nomer. Mr. President. Child welfare isnot a cash or an in-kind assistance topoor families. Child welfare programsdeal with abused children. It deals withneglected children regardless of theirincome. It does not have anything todo with a poor child. Child welfare pro-grams deal with neglected and abusedchildren regardless of income.So, child welfare has no place in awelfare reform bill, and I am pleasedwe were able to have those blockgrants removed. We stay with thepresententitlement systeminthechild welfare program.The present welfare billhas alsomade more cuts to the children's SSIprogram than I would have liked tohave seen. That is the way it startedoff, with rather severe cuts. This bill ismuch less damaging in that area. Itdoes tighten the eligibility for partici-pation in children's SSI programs, butretains cash assistance for those chil-dren who remain eligible. This is theright thing to do. These families areunder enormous strains. families withSSI children. and they need the bene-fits, the cash assistance that comes sothey can care for those children. I wanttopay specialtributetoSenator CoNRAD, who worked with me and oth-ers to achieve this compromise.Welfare, as we know, has always beena shared responsibility between theS9371States and the Federal Government.That will continue under this bill. It istrue that States ought to have a finan-cial incentive to reduce the welfarecaseloads. We all agree with that. How-ever. when they are reducing thesecaseloads, they should benefit from it,but also the Federal Government oughtto benefit from it, too. That is why weprovide that, if-the States reduce theirspending below a percentage mark,Federal dollars will be reduced like-wise. In other words. the Federal Gov-ernment will share in the savings.There is one thing that does botherme about this bill. and that is the de-nial of benefits to legal immigrants. Ithink the bill is harsh in that area. Wemade some improvements, inother words we made it less harsh. becausewe allow States to decide whether toextend Medicaid coverage to legal im-migrants. In other words. the Statesstill have the option to extend Medic-aid coverage to legal immigrants.I had hoped during the legislativeprocess.consideration here and theconference, we might have mitigatedsome of the harsher provisions, espe-cially those affecting currently elderlyand currently disabledrecipients.I think itis very tough to take awaysome of the benefits of those individ-uals that they are currently enjoying.In closing, I congratulate those whoworked so hard to reach this agree-ment. Former Senator Dole deserves alot of credit for laying the groundworkfor this bill. Senator RoTH picked upafter Senator Dole left and helped steerthis. bill through the Senate. On theother side of the aisle. my colleaguefrom the centrist coalition, my col-league Senator BREAUX. did splendidwork to forge a compromise betweenthe two parties.On the other side of the Capitol, Con-gressman Shaw and Congressman Ar-cher were dedicated to this cause forsome time and deserve a lot of credit.So my congratulations to each and all.and to all here who worked hard tomake this bill a success, the success Ibelieve it can be. It is not perfect. Weall recognize that. But there are a lotof very fine provisions in this bill.I yield the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. CHAFEE. Mr.President.the time is on the other side now.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Dakota.Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I risetoday to indicate that I will supportthis welfare reformlegislation. I do itwith some reservations.I think any-body who has been deeply involved inthis process understands that there areweaknesses in this legislation and thatthere are risks. But, make no mistake,there are risks in sticking with the sta-tus quo. The status quo cannot be de-fended. The current system does notwork and is unlikely to work in the fu-ture.r have visited with literally dozens ofwelfare recipients and with people who S9372workin the current welfare system. Icannot find anyone who believes thecurrent system is a good one. I cannotfind taxpayers who support it. who be-lieve in it. I cannot find welfare recipi\u2014ents who believe in it. I cannot find thepeople who work to deliver the serviceswho believe in it. Without exceptionthey say to me. There has to be a bet-ter way.\" I do not know if we found thebest way in this welfare reform legisla\u2014tion. but I do know it is time to trysomething different.I have concluded from my conversa-tions with welfare recipients that thereis very little question that the currentsystem is encouraging children to havechildren. I do not know how one canconclude otherwise. When we set up asystem in which we say to a youngwoman, in many cases a child, that ifyou leave home, we will see that youhave an apartment, that you get assist-ance, the precondition is that you havea child, what kind of system have weset up here? I talked to one of my col-leagues who met with a number of wel-fare mothers in the last several weeks.He asked them the direct question.'Did the fact that there is a welfaresystem that you knew would supportyou and provide an apartment to youencourage you to have a child?\" Abouthalf of them denied that it contributedto their decision, but about half ofthem said.'Yes, Senator, it did con-tribute to my making the decision tohave a child, because I knew I could getan apartment, I could get assistance,and that I could move away from afamily situation.\" In many cases thatfamily situation is not a very pleasantone.That does not make sense for our so-ciety. to have structured a system thatencourages children to have children.That is a disaster.I say to my col-leagues who have talked about theirconcern for children, and in every caseI believe they are well motivated andfeel deeply that we need to protectchildren,I share in that belief. Thequestion is, how we do it? It is not inchildren's interests to be born to chil-dren. That is a disaster. We know whathappens inthose circumstances.In case after case it leads to more pov-erty, more crime, more abuse. Childrenare not prepared to have children. Weneed to take away the incentive that isin the current system for that to occur.There are many parts of this bill thatconcern me. I believe the percentagethat is allowed for hardship cases, andtherefore exempt from the time limits.is unrealistic. I think that is going tohave to be revisited in the future. I per- sonally believe there are marginal peo-ple in our society, people who, eitherbecause of mental disability or phys-ical disability, simply are unable tohold full-time employment. A 20-per-cent hardship exemption is not suffi-cient to cope with the percentage ofour population that simply will neverbe fully employable. I think we aregoing to have to revisit that issue.But there has been much done to im-prove this legislation from where itCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEstarted. I was very pleased my amend-ment to maintain a Federal safety netin the food assistance programs wasadopted here on the Senate floor andwas kept in conference. I think that iscritically important. That provides thefood safety net for millions of Ameri-cans. one that adjusts automaticallyfor natural disasters or severe economic downturns.I also think the provisions that wereadopted that were offered by SenatorCHAFEE and Senator BREAUX to main-thin the Medicaid coverage was criti-cally important to this legislation.Isalute my colleagues.Senator CHAFEE and Senator BREAux, for theiramendment.Thatwasmaintainedlargely intact in conference and wascritically important.So. Mr. President, there are defectshere. I think we all recognize that. Ithink we all understand that this isgoing to have to be revisited. But wehave also heard from the Nation's Gov-ernors. They have told us. \"You cantrust us, we are going to be responsiblewith this charge.\"I say to them, we will be watching.we will be watching very carefullywhat you do. and we urge you to stepforward and shoulder this responsibil-ity with great seriousness.They have insisted there is not theflexibility and the resources to addressthe problems of poverty and welfarewithout these changes. They have as-sured Congress and th.e American peo-ple they care as much about the well-being of children and other vulnerablepopulations as Federal representativesand that they are in a better situationto target these resources. We takethem at their word. They have pledgedto protect these populations, and Con-gress is going to hold them to theirword.While this bill gives States flexibilitythey insist they need to end the prob-lems associated with welfare, I want tobe clear. Congress maintains the rightand the duty to intervene in the futureif States, in fact, do not live up to theirword and run their programs in an ar-bitrary or capricious manner.We are counting on the States to liveup to this responsibility. I take themat their word. and I have confidencethat in each of the States. the Gov-ernor and the State legislature willstep forward to shoulder these obliga-tions in a serious and responsible way.I am confident that in my homeState of North Dakota that will be thecase. I conclude by saying to my col-leagues. in looking at the risk associ-ated with any change, clearly there isa cause for concern, but the status quocannot be defended. It is time for achange. The time is now. We will haveother opportunities to address short-comings in this legislation. I intend tosupport this bill.I thank the Chair and yield back anytime I have remaining.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President. I yield10 minutes to the junior Senator fromIndiana.August 1, 1996The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Indiana.Mr. COATS. Mr. President, with thepassage of this welfare reform legisla-tion, I think we can confidently statethat the New Deal is old news. As weall know, this legislation will end theFederal Government's entitlement towelfare. an entitlement created 6 dec-ades ago during the New Deal. Yet, thereason that it must be overturned isfound in the reasoning of FranklinRoosevelt himself who said, 'When anyman or woman goes on the dole, some-thing happens to them mentally, andthe quicker they're taken off the dolethe better itis for them the rest oftheir lives.\"He added: \"We must preserve notonly the bodies of the unemployed fromdestitution, but also their self-respect,their self-reliance, and courage and de-termination.\"The welfare reforms that we will passtoday are designed not just to savemoney andreduce waste,although those are important goals. but they arealso designed to help restore certainbasic values: self-respect and self-reli-ance.Some critics have claimed that thesewelfare reforms will leadto catas-trophe. Mr. President, I suggest the ca-tastrophe has already arrived. It is ob-vious in an exploding population of fa-therless children, rising violence in ourcities and streets, suburbs and ruraltowns, endless dependence and frac-tured families. No one can honestly de-fend the current system as compas-sionate. No one can be proud of the re-sults of the last 30 years. We are tiredof good intentions and dismal results.We need to take another path.This legislation that we are propos-ing is not experimental nor it is notuntested. It is rooted in proven prin-ciples of American tradition. It trans-fers powers to the States where thatpower should have belonged all along.It emphasizes the dignity of work. Itshows compassion, but it also expectsindividual responsibility, and it beginsto encourage private and religious in-stitutions as partners in social re- newal.Mr. President, I am pleased that thepersonalresponsibilityagreementsthat I authored, along with SenatorHARJcmi, are part of this final welfarepackage. States like Indiana and Iowahave used these agreements as effec-tive tools. moving thousands of citi-zens from welfare to work. The welfarebill we are passing today gives Statesthe options to include those personalresponsibility agreements in their wel-fare programs, and I hope they will fol-low the examples of Indiana and Iowa.I have argued in the past, Mr. Presi-dent, that devolution of power to theState governments is necessary but notcomplete. Such devolution encouragesinnovation, but State government isstill government. prone to the sameproblems ofineffectivebureaucracyand red tape that we see in Washing-ton, and that is why I am glad this leg-islation gives States the opportunity 'August!, 1996andthe option to contractwith faith-basedorganizations without forcingthoseinstitutionsto compromise theirspiritual identity. This, I believe, is thebeginning of an important idea.Itis also important to rememberthat the reforms that we are passingtoday directly affect human lives. Thatis the only measure of our achieve-ment. I am convinced on the evidenceof 3 decades that people need independ-ence, work, responsibility and hope farmore than they need endless checksfrom the Federal Government.Our current system treats the dis-advantaged as merely material, to befed and forgotten. We need to be treat-ing them as human beings with highhopes and high potential. When you ex-pect nothing of an individual, you be-little them. We must stop belittlingthe able-bodied poor in America withlow expectations.Mr. President, I argue that there is anext step to welfare reform, a step thatthis Congress and this President. orwhoever occupies the Presidency, needsto address in the next Congress. Weneed to go beyond Government. Weneedtobegintoencourageand strengthen, nurture and expand thosemediating institutions of family, com-munity, volunteer associations of char-ity. of church, faith-based charities\u2014those institutions that offer real solu-tions and real hope.We needtobegin to look at trans-forming our society by transforminglives one at a time inside out. For themost part. this is work that cannot bedone by institutions of government.Government can feed the body and helptrain the mind, but it cannot nurturethe soul or renew the spirit. This is thework of institutions outside of govern-ment.This shift of authority in resourcescan be accomplished in many ways, butwe need to recognize tradition and thetime-honored practice of reaching outto the poor in effective ways. givingthem renewed hope, renewed spirit, arenewed place in American society. Ithas not been accomplished in an effec-tive way by institutions of governmentbut can be effective by institutionsoutside of government.How do we make this transition? Be-cause it will be a transition, and nor-mally the problem is such that it willrequire a significant increase in the in-volvement of these institutions. But itis important because they are the in-stitutions that bring about the real so-lutions and bring about real hope.I propose the charity tax credit as ameans of beginning this process, a wayin which the taxpayer can designate ona joint basis up to $1,000 of taxes other-wise due the Government as charitablecontributions to institutions that havededicated themselves to the propo-sition of alleviating or preventing pov-erty.Who rather give $1,000 oftheir hard-earned money to institu- tions like Habitat for Humanity, rath-er than Housing and Urban Develop-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEment, if you really care about provid-ing decent, affordable housing to low-income individuals?For those concerned about fatherlesschildren, who wouldn't believe that$1,000 of their money would be betterserved through Boys and Girls Clubs orBig Brothers and Big Sisters or othermentoring organizations. rather thangiving it to \"Big Brother\" in Washing-ton?For those concerned about the home-less on our streets, who wouldn't rath-er support the gospel missions andchurchfeedingprograms.CatholicCharities and other organizations thatreach out to those in our local commu-nities, rather than turning the moneyover to HHS. where, by some esti-mates, over two-thirds of the moneyfueled by the Federal social welfaresystem never goes to the poor? It goesto those above the poverty line: it getseaten up in bureaucracy, administra-tion, fraud, and abuse. It has created acompassion fatigueinthis countrywhere people have no faith that theirtaxdollars,sometimesgenerouslygiven and well-intended to help thosemost in need, ever reach those most inneed.This is a stark alternative that canbe provided to the individual withoutthe constraints of the first amendment.They can give it to secular or nonsecu-larinstitutions,faith-basedinstitu-tions which have proven and dem-onstrated their capability of providingservices to the poor far more effec-tively, with far better results, at afraction of the cost of Government.These are the institutions that weneed to strengthen. And this, I hope,will be the agenda of the next Congressas we move to the next step of welfarereform, to defining compassion in aneffective way, the spirit of the Amer-ican people, which has always beengenerous, which has always reachedout to help those in need, which re-sponds to emergencies time and timeagain, which provides and allows grainfarmers from the Midwest to ship graindown to famine areas and droughtareas of other areas of our country,which cause people to jump on planesand trains and buses and go to the lat-est hurricane area or ravaged area topitch in. on a volunteer basis, to helptheir fellows Americans.We are a country of generous spirit,yet a country that has lost confidencein the ability of Government to effec-tively deliver compassion to those inneed. So let use energize, renew andstrengthen and nourish and encouragethose institutions in our own commu-nities that are making a difference inpeople's lives.Community activist Robert Woodsonmakes the AmericaL nomatter howsevere,is currentlybeingde- feated somewhere, some religious or group.

It is time to pub-licly, creatively, and actively take their sidein the struggle to recivilize American soci-ety.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington.Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. I yieldmyself 10 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen.ator from Washington.Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it isclear that most Americans agree weneed to change welfare as we know it.Our current system does not work, notfor those on public assistance and notfor those who pay for it.The American people feel stronglythat personal responsibility has to be apart of this country's welfare system. Icould not agree more.Mr. President. for nearly 4 years Ihave spent countless hours examiningthe current welfare structure, talkingto participants and listening to thefrustrations of both reformers and peo-ple on public assistance.This Senate has debated many ideasfor welfare reform. I have worked withmy colleagues to do everything pos-sible to help create a welfare bill thatwill move able-bodied adults off wel-fare and into work. The transitionfrom welfare to work is the core of thispolicy debate. But my concern is this.We are creating a system in which peo-ple will not get a welfare check, butthey will not be able to get a paycheckeither.If people leave welfare, but are notqualified or cannot find work, they arefaced with one fundamental problem:The grocery billisstill there, andthere is no way to feed their kids.My vote on this final welfare bill isone of the most difficult I have had tocast. There are no easy answers. I wantwelfare to be reformed. I hear fromthose recipients who complain that thecurrent system does not work. There istoo little job training. There is too lit-tle child care. And the programs try tofit every single welfare recipient intoone single mold.As this bill worked its way throughthe Senate and House, I have sponsoredandcosponsorednumerousamend- ments to protect the well-being of chil-dren, from preventive and emergencyhealthcare.nutritiousmeals,safe child care, iUiteracy, issues that areimportant because they affect the abil-ity of parents to move successfullyfrom welfare to work while they arestill taking care of their own kids.I agree with President Clinton thatthis welfare reform bill makes signifi-cant strides toward ending welfare aswe know it. It will help put some peo-ple back to work and end the cycle ofdependency that this system is accusedof breeding. It will give more flexibil-ity to the States and allow for morelocal decisionmaking authority.But I also agree with President Clin-ton that this bill has serious flaws, S9374Ninemillion children will be cut offfrom services. Legal immigrant chil-dren will be ineligible for almost allFederal and State services, other thanin an emergency, leaving them hungry,uneducatedanddesperateonour streets.One-half of the $60 billion cut inspending will come from nutrition pro-grams. It will have a dramatic impacton the very individuals who need themost help today in this country, andthat is our children.It has been clear for quite some timethat this bill is going to be passed byan overwhelming majority and signedby the President. but I realize that Icannot in good conscience support abill that, will put so many of our chil-dren in jeopardy.Mr. President. I am the only formerpreschool teacher to serve in the U.S.Senate. I have looked into the faces of2. and 3. and 4-year-olds who are hun-gry every single day. I have worked asa parent educationinstructor withadults who have lost their jobs. Foodstamps provided the only chance theyhad to feed their children while theydesperately were looking for work. Iknew immediately when a child in myclass was unable to learn and feltfrightened because of tough financialtimes at home, and I saw the effectsthose kids had on all the other kids inmy classroom.Many times I have sat and listened toyoung women whose lives have beendevastated. They have been left aloneto care for young children. They haveno job skills and no ability to go towork because their full-time job wasbeing a mom.For me. the bottom line in the wel-fare reform discussionis, what willhappen to our Nation's children? Whatwill happen to those children I held inmy lap in my preschool? For me, it isa risk that I am not willing to take.Itisvital that parents return towork. But we have to help ensure thatour children receive adequate healthcare, nutrition, and are not left homealoneor,worse,to wander on ourstreets.When this welfare reform proposalpasses, we have to ask, what is next?This bill only tells people what theFederal Government will not do any-more. In its place will come 50 differentexperiments in 50 different States. Itmay help some people, and it most cer-tainly will hurt others. But whether itworks or not. from this day forward Ibelieve that we have to begin a na-tional commitment to our children andto give them a fair chance, every one ofthem. at succeeding in life.We all want a country where everychild is secure. where every person canbe' a contributing member of our soci-ety and our economy, and where theworld around us is a healthy and safeplace to live. No one disagrees withthat. To make sure it happens, we haveto start a discussion in every singlecommunityandneighborhoodand every single dinner table in this Na-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEtion. We have to ask, what is impor-tant to us as Americans? Are we goingto be a compassionate Nation? Whenpush comes to shove, are we going tohelp our neighbors when they need it?And if. as I suspect, the answer is yes.we are going to have to say how. In theaftermath of this welfare reform bill.these are the questions that every oneof us as adults in this country willhave to answer.I am not going to dwell on changesbrought about in this welfare reform.Instead,I am going to aggressivelyseek answers to the questions I haveraised, and I will reaffirm my own com-mitment to children. I will work forconstructivesolutionstoproblemsthat arise in the future.I have already formed a bipartisanworking group within the Senate tohelp develop and create ideas to helpadults find more time to spend withour young children. And I formed anadvisory group at home in Washingtonon youth involvement to help supportthis effort. Hopefully. the people of thiscountry will ultimately work to createthe kind of communities that we canall be proud of.But, Mr. President, one good thingwill come out of this for sure that willhappen as a result of us passing welfarereform. Finally. we will no longer, ei-ther here on the floor of the Senate orin living rooms across this country, beable to blame welfare as the cause ofour Nation's problems: After today. in-stead. perhaps. we can all sit down andwork to agree on what we can do tokeep our young children in this coun-try healthy and secure and educatedand growing up in a country that weare all proud of.I yield the floor.Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield10 minutes to the Senator from NewHampshire.Mr. GREGG. I wish to rise in supportof this welfare proposal, and I con- gratulate the Members of the Senatewho have worked so hard.I want to mentiont three reasons whyI think this is an appropriate action totake.First,thisis one of the fivemajor programs which isweighingdown the Federal budget and which iscausing us to careen towards bank-ruptcy as a Nation in the beginning ofthe next century if we do not addressthe Federal spending patterns. Theother four are the farm programs. theMedicare and Medicaid Programs. andSocial Security.We have addressed the farm pro-grams. Now we are addressing the wel-fare programs. That is two out of thefive major entitlement programs thatwill be addressed as a result of this billby this Congress. That is a major stepforward. If this were a game of Myst\u2014which it is not, but it is as complicatedas a game of Myst\u2014we would have got-ten through two levels. We have threelevels to go and. hopefully. we will con-tinue to pursue those aggressively.The bill involves returning to theStates significant flexibility over man-August 1; 1996aging the welfare accounts. This meansbetter services for our citizens. It Isthat simple. There is a certain arro-gance in this town, a certain elitism inthis town that tends to believe all theideas, all the feelings of goodness. allthe compassion is confined within thecorridors of Washington. Well. it is nottrue. The fact is. in our States at ourState legislative level and in our citiesand at our county level. there is notonly great compassion but there is anextraordinary knowledge. That knowl-edge and compassion would be broughtto bear on the welfare programs of thiscountry as a result of this bill.I know, for example. that in NewHanpshire we will get a lot more serv-ices for actually less dollars, and ourpeople will be better taken care of as aresult of this flexibility being returnedto the States.Third. thereis the cultural issue.This represents a significant culturalchange in the way we address the issueof welfare in this country. We are nolonger creating this atmosphere of de-pendency. We are no longer undermin-ing generation after generation of indi-vidualsrelativetotheir own self-worth. We are saying to people: \"Youare important, you do have self-worth,youshouldhaveself-respect,you should be working and taking care ofyourself and your families and obtain-ing the personal respect and confidencethat comes from undertaking that ap-proach.\" It is a cultural shift.Obviously, it will not impact the en-tire culture. Obviously. there are a lotof people on welfare who deserve to bethere. For some percentage. and it willnot be a dramatic percentage. I admitto that. they will be moving off thewelfare rolls because they will have togo to work, something they have notdone before. That will be very positive.I think, for them and for this societygenerally.So I believe this is a very good billand something that takes us in theright direction in the area of fiscal sol-vency, in the area of managing govern-ment policy through flexibility at theState level. and in the area of how weapproach the cultural issue of caringfor people who are less fortunate or inhard times.I also want to address today justbriefly, because it is a topic that I amintimately involved with as chairmanof the Commerce, State, and JusticeCommittee. the issue of terrorism\u2014oneminor area. a secondary point to whatis going on here today, but I want toraise this point at this time.We just reported out of the full Ap-propriations Committee a bill.the Commerce. State. Justice bill. whichhad a major initiative in the area ofterrorism, countering terrorism, tryingto get some comprehensive planninginto the issue of how we approach it asa Federal Government, and beefing upthose projects that are going on inthose agencies. such as the FBI, thatare trying to counter especially inter-national terrorism. It is a major step August 1, 1996forward. We have actually been work-ing on this for months. It is ironic itcame to fruition today. so soon afterthe Atlanta bombing. but it is a veryimportant step.Second. we cannot do all this at theFederal level. The issue of counteringterrorism cannot entirely be accom-plished by the Government. There hasto be a change of attitude within ourpopulation as to how we approach theterrorists.I made a proposal today which I think moves along that issue a littlebit\u2014not dramatically. but a little bit\u2014but itis important. We see on theInternet today a massive amount of in-formation about how to make weapons.how to make bombs, how to use instru-ments of death. Now, the Internet is aWild West of information. I have no in-terest in regulating it.I think thatwou1d be a mistake. There are, today.developing a whole series of industries.that develop the information and infor-mation access in the area of Internet.peoplelikeAmericaOnline. CompUSA. Yahoo. Netscape. Magellan\u2014thelist goes on and on.What I have done today is write a let-ter to the CEO's of these various orga-nizations and asked them to exercise alittle common sense and a little com-munity value and to expunge fromtheir databaseaccesscapabilityof items which are clearly directed at cre-ating bombs. I had my staff quicklyrun the InternetI wanted to do itquickly. so I had my staff do it. Theycame up with, on their first test underthe question of \"explosive.\" they cameup with an identification of how tomake a bomb, which was followed byleaving your bomb in your favoriteairport and Government building.\"That is the type of information thatshou'd not be accessed easily throughsome sort of accessing agency. So Ihave asked the leaders of these variousindustries to think about it, to thinkabout puttingintotheirprocessessome sort of self-voluntary block thateliminates the ability to easily accessthis type of information which is so pa-tently inappropriate. I hope they willtake such action.I yield the floor.Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield tothe Senator.Mr. DODD. I commend my colleaguefrom New Hampshire. I hope everyonelistens to his last remarks on this sub-ject matter and that people will heedhis advice. This is a serious matter.Our colleague from Arkansas, Sen-ator BUMPERS. yesterday i think, madesimilar comments and brought to thefloor the documentation that came offcomputers on this information. I thinkhis advice is extremely worthwhile.Mr. GREGG. I can show the Senatora copy of the letter and have him be acosponsor, as well as any other Sen-ators.Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself 5 min-utes.I first want to very much thank mycolleaguefromCalifornia,SenatorCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEFEINSTEIN, and Senator DOoD of Con-necticut for very generously and gra-ciously yielding me their time and al-lowing me to proceed ahead of them. Ithank the Senators.Mr. President, I rise today in strongsupport of welfare reform. The welfarereform debateisemotional. we allknow that. It is complex. that is clear.But I must say I find almost universalagreement that today's Federal welfareprogram does not do what we would ex-pect of a welfare system.It does not help people get back ontheir feet and back to work. It does notpromote worth or promote personal re-sponsibility or self-sufficiency. Most ofus envisioned a different system. a wel-fare system that encourages personalresponsibility.onethatencourageswork and self-sufficiency. one that letsStates like Montana create their ownsystems that make sense to their State's own unique problems. one thatprotects children. helps keep familiestogether. prevents communities fromdeteriorating, and is fair to taxpayers.The Nation's welfare problems took along time to develop, and they willtake some time to solve. Our solutionswill not come overnight. We have towork on them. I believe this proposal isa clean break with the past and a goodstart for the future. It is based on twoessentialelementsthatencourage work and self-sufficiency.First, there will be a time limit onwelfare assistance to make sure that,people have an incentive to leave wel-fare and move to work; second. we willremove some obstacles that now deterpeople on welfare from moving towork. They will have more help avail-able for child care, and Medicaid willstill be there to provide basic healthcare.I might add, Mr. President, that theimminent passage of the increase inminimum wage will be a big boom, willbe a big part of the solution to welfarereform.On the whole, I believe this effort re-flects the views and values of Mon-tanans and of Americans. Undoubtedly,it is not perfect, and we can learn fromexperience. We can and will improve itas time goes by. However. it is a goodstart and a step we have to take.Finally. I am glad that the Presidenthas chosen to sign it.It was not aneasy decision. But it is time that thesystem reflects the consensus now ex-isting in America for welfare reform. Ibelieve this bill is a good start. It isnot perfect. Nothing is perfect. But wecannot let perfection be the envy of thegood. It is a good start, and I believewe will have many opportunities to im-prove upon it as days. months. andyears go by.I yield the floor.Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield myself upto 10 minutes.Mr. President, this is landmark legis-lation, and it is a pivotal point in ourNation's history and future. What itdoes. this bill before the Senate. itdoes.indeed, change welfare as weknow it.S9375This is what the hard-working Amer..ican people have been asking Congressto do for years. It limits welfare to 2years for able-bodied individuals, andthere will be a 5-year lifetime on wel-fare for any individual in our country.Mr. President, this sends a messageto the working people of our countrythat. yes. we understand how hard it is.to make ends meet. All Americanswork hard. Welfare recipients shouldnot be an exception. If we have uniformrequirements for work. we will thensay that this Nation is a Nation thathas a work ethic and values people whoare trying to be productive citizens.This bill requires all able-bodied wel-fare recipients to work within 2 years.or lose their benefits. States will be re-quired to have 50 percent of their wel-fare recipients working by 2002. And toensure that child care is available for asingle parent. this bill provides an ad-ditional $4.5billionmore than currentlaw for child care. So we are makingsure that there is a safety net, while atthe same time we are going to save thetaxpayers of our country $58 billion.Now, I want to put this in perspectivejust to show what the American peopleare seeing in our welfare system as it istoday. In many States. welfare systemsprovide the most perverse incentives.In 40 States. welfare pays more than an$8 per hour job. In 17 States. it paysmore than a $10 per hour job. In sixStates. and in the District of Columbia.welfare pays more than a $12 per hourjob\u2014more than two times the mini-mum wage. In nine States. welfarepays more than the average first-yearsalary of a teacher. In 29 States. itpays more than the average startingsalary for a secretary. In the six mostgenerous States in this Nation. bene-fits exceed the entry-level salary for acomputer programmer.Mr. President, no wonder our welfaresystem is broken. No wonder the Amer-ican people are saying that we musthave relief from a system that wouldpay more to people who do not workthan a teacher, a computer program-mer, or a person making $12 an hourthat is getting up every morning, put-ting their lunch together. and walkingout the door to make a living for his orher family.Mr. President, what we are doinghere tonight is saying that those peo-ple have a value in our society. Andpeople who can work. but won't. willnot be any better off than the personwho gets up. puts his or her lunch in abox, goes to work, and is a productivecitizen of this country.This is indeed landmark reform. It isfair. It will stop a system that has be-come a cancer on our society. It willgive self-worth to the people who willnow have to work for any benefits theyreceive. And it will say to hard-work-ing Americans that are struggling tomake ends meet, \"You have a valueand we appreciate you in this country.and you will not have to work to sup-port someone who can work. but choos-es not to... S9376Thankyou. Mr. President. I yield theremainder of my time.Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut.Mr. DODD. Mr. President. will theSenator from Nebraska yield me up to15 minutes?Mr. EXON. Yes. I yield the Senator 15minutes.Mr. DODD. Mr. President.let mebegin by saying that I respect thosewho support this legislation, and I re-spect the President for making the de-cision he did. But may I also begin bysaying that I respectfully disagree withtheir decisions.Mr. President, I have served now inthis body for almost 18 years. I servedin the Congress for 22 years. I have dedicated a good part of my service inthe U.S. Senate, as many of my col-leagues know, to issues affecting chil-dren. In fact, one of the first things Iever did as a part of the Senate wasform the first children's caucus, alongwith Senator SPECTER from Pennsylva-nia. DA.N COATS of Indiana and I werethe authors of the family and medicalleave legislation. It took 7 years toadopt that. It went through two vetoesbefore being signed into law by Presi-dent Clinton in the early days of hisadministration in 1993. Senator ORRINHATCH and I were the authors of thechild care block grant, which is a sub-ject of much discussion here today.I note, with some irony, that when Ioffered amendments a year ago to in-crease the child care funding in theearly welfare reform proposals, onlytwo Members of the majority partysupported the increase for child carefunding. Nonetheless. I am delighted tohear such strong, ringing endorsementsfor the child care block grant, consid-ering it took us so many years to bringit the support it has now. There are nu-merous other pieces of legislation overthe years that I am proud to have beenassociated with that affect children.While there are certainly significantdeficiencies, in my view, in this legisla-tion.affecting legal immigrants, af-fecting working adults. I want to focusmy remarks, if I can. Mr. President. onchildren. I say that because the over-whelming majority of the people whowill be affected by this legislation arechildren. We are a Nation of some 275million people in the United States\u2014avery diverse and rich people. Of thetotal population of this country. it isworthwhile, I think, to note that weare talking about 13 million Americansout of 270 million Americans who re-ceive some form of aid to families withdependent children from the U.S. Gov-ernment. There are local welfare pro-grams. And there are State programs.But the Federal Government's commit-ment to welfareaffects13million Americans. Of the 13 million Ameri-cans, almost 9 million are childrenunder the age of 18, and 4 million areadults. Of the 9 million who are chil-dren. 80 percent of the 9 million areunder the age of 12, and 50 percent ofthe 9 million are under the age of 6.So we are talking about 4 millionadults and 4 to 5 million infants andyoung children, in effect, who will beaffected by this legislation. We alsoknow that roughly 2 million of the 4million adults are unemployable underany situation. They are either seri-ously ill. or disabled, and will not beaffected bythislegislationbecause they cannot work.So our goal is to put I to 2 million ofthe 4 million adults on AFDC, who areable-bodied and can work, to work.This is I to 2 million people out of a na-tion of 270 million people. My concernis that, in our efforts to do that, we areplacing in jeopardy, and at significantrisk, for the fIrst time in a half-cen-tury. the 9 million children in thiscountry who are also the recipients ofpublic assistance.So it is with a great deal of sadness,Mr. President, that I rise today, know-ing that in less than 2 or 3 hours fromnow,America's nationallegislaturewill vote overwhelmingly to sever com-pletely its more than one-half centuryof support for the most vulnerable ofour people\u2014our children.For over 60 years, Mr. President,through 10 Presidents, hundreds of U.S.Congressmen and Congresswomen, Sen-ators,Democrats,Republicans,lib- erals, moderates, and conservatives, wehave tried to improve the opportunitiesfor all Americans. Certain issues werealways in conflict, and I suspect theyalways will be. But with regard to oneconstituency, one group of Americans,there was never any serious division.We in America take care of our chil-dren.There is a national interest. I argue,and there has been for decades, to pro-tect the most innocent and defenselessin our society. Whether you were achild from Eastport, ME. or San Diego,CA. if allelse failed, your NationalGovernment, your country, would notlet you go hungry, would not let you bedenied medical care, and would notdeny you basic shelter. No matter howirresponsible your parents may havebeen, no matter how neglectful yourcommunity or State, your country.America, would absolutely guarantee.as a last resort, a safety net of basiccare.In less than a few hours. Mr. Presi-dent, we will end, after half a century,that basic fundamental guarantee tothese children.Am I opposed to reforming welfare?Absolutely not. But let us put thisissue in perspective. We are talkingabout9million children\u2014many ofwhom have no other protection at allbecause of the circumstances in whichthey are raised\u2014who count on theirGovernment as a last resort to be ofhelp.Let me be starkly clear about whatthis legislation does. Under this bill.States can cut off benefits. They can-not provide work opportunities. Thereis no requirement for them to do so.They can set shorter and shorter timelimits, if they so desire. They can cutAugust 1, 1996off families completely without mak-ing any accommodation for their chil-dren. And no matter how draconianthese measures may be, this NationalGovernment will stand by and do noth-ing.It is worth noting that virtually allreligious groups in this country andtheir leaders oppose this piece of legis-lation. Let me. share with you theviews of Bishop Anthony Pilla on be-half of the Catholic Bishops:The test of welfare reform is whether itwill enhance the lives and dignity of poorchildren and their families. The moral meas-ure of our society is how we treat the leastamongst us. This legislation fails these testsand fails our Nation.What is more, we are considering thislegislation with the benefit of datashowing that the bill will push at least1.1 million children into poverty in thiscountry and worsen the situation ofchildren already in poverty by 20 per-cent.Let us consider, if you will. for justone moment that instead of dealingwith welfare reform here, we were deal-ing with a piece of legislation affectingAmerican businesses. And assume for Iminute, if you will. that we were pro-vided data by credible sources that saidas a result of this bill, if it were to be-come law,Imillion business peoplewould fail as a result of your actions.I would just inquire: How long wouldthat legislation last on the floor of theU.S. Senate? We would not be told. 'we may fix that later.\" Wewould not spend 1 minute considering apiece of legislation that would cause Imillion business people to fail. And,yet, when Imillion children may failand alreadypoor childrenwillbe pushed into even more difficult cir-cumstances, we are told over and overagain that somehow we will fix thatdown the road.I cannot support a piece of legisla-tion that would take I million innocentchildren and push them into povertywith a vague hope that some day wemay do something to correct that situ-ation.These numbers should make all of ustake pause and seriously consider thedire implications of our actions. I knowmany people argue that the currentwelfare system does not serve our chil-dren well. I do not disagree. But replac-ing a system in need of reform with aworse system is no solution at all. Infact, it is irresponsible. There is nojus-tification, in my view. to try some-thing different at any cost; namely,abandoning a national commitment tochildren for the sake of change.Again, I applaud the improvementsthat were made in this bill. and theyhave been recited by others. It, cer- tainly. is better than what was consid-ered a year ago in a number of aspects.But despite those improvements, thereare still elements in this legislationwhich make it fundamentally flawed.The Congressional Budget Office esti-mates that between 2.5 and 3.5 millionCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE AugustL 1996children would be affected by the 5-year cutoff of benefits in this bill. I have no objection to setting time lim-its on adults. In my State, it is 2 years.Experiments like that make sense, tosee if they work. What I do not under-stand is that no matter how difficultyou want to be on the parent, how doyou look into the face of a S-year-oldchild who, through no fault of theirown,arebornintodifficultcir- cumstances and say that regardless ofthe flaws of their parents, the irrespon-sibility of their parents, they must paythe price? I do not understand thatlogic or that thinking.It seems to me that if we know thiswelfare bill will increase the number ofpoor ch.jdren, we should, at the veryleast, make some provisions for chil-dren whose parents have reached thetime limit and are cut off from assist-ance. But this bill prohibits\u2014and I em-phasize this\u2014this bill prohibits evenproviding vouchers to children whoseparents have hit the 5-year time limit.In fact,it does not even grant theState the option to provide noncash aidto infants and toddlers.This is not only a step backward, but.in my view, it is an unconscionable re-treat from a 60-year-old commitmentthat Republicans and Democrats. 10 American Presidents, and Congresseshave made on behalf of America's chil-dren.Some will argue that the conferenceagreement says that States can use thetitle XX social services block grant toprovide vouchers for these families andchildren. But I ask my colleagues tolook at the provisions of the bill thatcut this block grant by 15 percent. Weare reducing the very block grants weare now telling States they can use toprovide for these benefits.I truly believe that if we were seriousabout ensuring the safety net for chil-dren in this bill, we would do it Out-right and not come up with fancy ac-counting methods thatprovideno guarantees for children whatsoever.Thislegislationdoesnot provideenough funds, quite frankly. to meetthe work requirements of the bill. Thisbill has the goal of putting welfare re-cipients to work. I applaud that. Yet, itfails to provide adequate funds to reachthat very growth.We are setting ourselves up for a fail-ure. The Congressional Budget Officeestimates that this bill is $12 billionshort of funds needed to meet the workrequirements\u2014S2 billion more than theshortfall of the Senate bill which waspassed last year. The same Congres-sional Budget Office says that mostStates will not succeed in meeting the,work requirements. They will just ac-cept the penalty of reduction in funds.Do our friends here who support thislegislation think that millions of jobsfor welfare recipients will simply ap-pear out of the air? Will millions ofwelfare recipients, most of whom wantto work, I would argue. magically findjobs? Not unless they receive the as-sistance, the training, and the edu-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEcational help which leads to job cre-ation. In this bill, they will receive nosuch help at all.While we see movement on childcare\u2014again. I applaud that\u2014this con-ference agreement retreats on a criti-cally important child care provision.Let me emphasize this point. Boththe House and Senate bills contain pro-visions that prohibit a State fromsanctioning a family if the mothercould not work because she could not.obtain nor afford child care for chil-dren age 10 and under. The conferenceagreement. which we are about to voteon, moves that age threshold from 10years of age to 5 years of age, at the re-quest, I am told, of some Governors.Currently. approximately 2.4 millionchildren on AFDC are between the agesof 6 and 10. The families of these chil-dren could lose all of their benefits asa result of a work sanction because theparent could not find adequate childcare for a 7-year-old. an 8-year-old. or a9-year-old. This bill encourages parentsto go to work and leave a child athome. without supervision, at a timewhen we are talking about family val-ues and parents caring for their chil-dren. We put these parentsin thecatch-22situation.either they lose.benefits or leave their child\u2014a 6- 7- or8-year old at home alone. I do not un-derstand, again, the logic of that kindof thinking.I know that the Governors have ar-gued that the protection for children 10and under would make it hard for themto meet the work requirements in thelegislation. But that sort of argumentpoints out flawed thinking in this bill.I think all of us understand the need.for child care. Latchkey children are aserious problem in our society. I fail tounderstand how Governors who arguethat a provision which protects kidswho are 6- 7- and 8-years old would im-pede their ability to meet work re-quirements. Governors, at the veryleast, should be able to guarantee tochildren age 10 and under that theywill not be left at home without care.Additionally. the food stamp cuts inthe conference agreement are deeperthan last year's vetoed welfare bill anddeeper than last year's Senate-passedbill. The conference agreement wouldcut food stamps by about 20 percent.Familieswithchildren\u2014notsingle adults\u2014families with children will bearthe greatest burden. Two-thirds of thecuts in food stamps will hit familieswith children.Additionally.thebilllimitsfood stamps to unemployed adults not rais-ing children to just 3 months in a 3-year period with no hardship exemp-tion whatsoever. If we were in a periodof high unemployment in this country,with people being laid off from jobsthrough no fault of their own, how doyouexplaintosomeone who hasworked for many, many years and findshimself without a job, that he will becut off from some basic necessities toallow him to exist? And there's no ex-emption whatsoever to account for eco-nomic difficulties.S9377The Congressional Budget Office esti-mates that in an average month, underthis provision. 1million poor. unem-ployed individuals who are willing towork and have worked in many casesand would take a workfare slot, if onewere available. would be denied foodstamps because they cannot find work.Finally, Mr. President,I want tomention the treatment of legal immi-grants in this legislation. which I knowis of great concern to our colleaguesfrom California and Florida and NewYork and others.This bill. in my view. is a repudiationof the legacy of immigration that hasdefined our country for more than 200years. We are talking about legal im-migrants now.It is this influx of immigrants fromdiverse cultures and distant lands thathas made this country a shining exam-ple to the entire world. That is whymillions of people across the globehave come to our Nation.To say to legal immigrants who paytaxes, who get drafted and serve in ourmilitary that we are going to denythem basic protections after we haveinvited them to come here in a legalstatus because they do not vote andthey are an easy target I think is amistake.It was the promise of the Americandream that brought my family to thiscountry from Ireland. And it was thedesire for a better life that broughtmillions of other immigrants to Amer-ica, whether they came over on theMayflower or if they came to our landin just the past few days.The fact is, nearly every Senator inthis body is a descendant of immi-grants.The attack. in this legislation. onlegal immigrants is mean-spirited andpunitive.This bill is more interested in reduc-ing the deficit than maintaining ourcommitment to legal immigration.Thisbillbans legal immigrants\u2014children and the disabled\u2014from foodstamps and SSI. When people lose SSI.they lose their health coverage underMedicaid.I fear that we'll see people who havepaidtaxes wheeled out of nursinghomes as a result of this bill.The legal immigrant provisions ofthis bill will shift substantial costs onto local governments.In the words of Mayor Guiliani ofNew York:By restricting legal immigrants' access tomost Federal programs. immigration. in ef-fect, becomes a local responsibility. Welfarereform should not diminish Federal respon-sibility for Immigration policy or shift costto local governments.But that's exactly what this billdoes.coNcLusioNIn closing, let me say, Mr. President,that welfare reform is by no meanseasy. If we are to change the cycle ofdependency and encourage work amongwelfarerecipients.we must maketough decisions. S9378But, in the end, those decisions mustalwaysbe weighed against their effecton poor children. Our success will notbe judged by how much we reduce thewelfare rolls, but how we help thosewho are left behind.This bill fails that test\u2014on both ac-counts.President Franklin Roosevelt oncesaid that:The test of our progress isnot whether we add more to the abun-dance of those who have too much: it iswhether we provide enough for thosewho have too little.'For those in our Nation who have toolittle, we are providing only crumbs.If welfare recipients are to revel inthe hopes and aspirations of the Amer-ican dream then they must be providedwith the tools and opportunities tomake those dreams a reality.This bill fails those Americans and itfails our commitment to the most vul-nerable and poorest citizens in our Na-tion.I know this is a futile effort, but Iurge my colleagues in the remainingfew hours to consider that we are aboutto sever the lifeline to 9 million chil-dren in this country for the sake ofputting 1 to 2 million adults to work.This incredibly misguided policy is notin balance and ought to be defeated.Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alabama.Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise instrong support of the conference reporttothe Personal Responsibility andWork Opportunity Act of 1996. TheAmerican peopleIbelieve have de-manded welfarereform,andIam pleased thatthe Congress has notyieldedinits commitment to passmuch needed and long overdue com-prehensive welfare reform. Our currentwelfare system is a death sentence. Itis a death sentence to the human spir-it,the family, and the hopes anddreams of millions of children in Amer-ica. The welfare system today encour-ages dependency, facilitates the break-down of the family, demoralizes thehuman spirit, and undermines the workethic that built our Nation. For a thirdtime this Congress has delivered legis-lation to address the failures of thewelfare state and provide reforms thatI believe will free the poor from beingtrapped in a cycle of dependency. Thisbillis the boldest statement we canmake in the current political environ-ment, and I am pleased that the Presi-dent has finally pledged to keep hispromise to end welfare as we know it.Mr.President,the imperative forwelfare reform is manifest. The Amer-ican taxpayers have spent more than$54 trillion since President Johnsondeclared a war on poverty. But afterspending this massive sum, we are nocloser to having a Great Society thanif we had done nothing. In fact, thepoverty rate in America has actuallyincreased over the past 28 years. Thereason for this is simple: Welfare hasbecome a way of life. The modern wel-fare State is rife with financial incen-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEtives for mothers to remain unmarried.Eighty percent of children in manylow-income communities in Americaare born in homes without a father. Itisvirtually impossible for a youngunwed mother with no work skills toescape the welfare trap as we know ittoday. This has done nothing to stopthe ravaging of our cities and the sky-rocketing of violent crime.People have become dependent onwelfare because it completely destroysthe need to work and the natural in-centive to become self-sufficient. Formore than 30 years the message of thewelfare state is that the Governmentwill take care of you. It is a punitiveform of assistance. It punishes thosewho want to work and want to succeed.It punishes those mothers who want toget married and have a husband to helpraise the children.Whereisthe compassioninthis present welfare program? It isnot there. Only the beltway establishmentwoulddaresuggestthatprovidingmonthlybenefitsismore compas-sionate than fostering the natural in-clination in every human being toreach your fullpotential. However.with the enactment of this bill. Con-gress will require welfare recipients towork in exchange for benefits for thefirst time. By imposing a 5-year life-time limit on welfare benefits, themessage of the reformed welfare stateis that we will provide temporary as-sistance to help during hardship as youreturn to self-sufficiency.The bill we vote on today begins torepair a very badly broken welfarestate in other ways. It puts healthy in-centives in our welfare system. Thegenerous package of welfare benefitsavailable in America is a magnet forliterally hundreds of thousands of legaland illegal immigrants. I do not believethis is just, and this bill properly de-nies welfare to noncitizens.Also, the Government will no longertell young women,1f you have chil-dren you are not able to support andyou are willing to raise them without afather the Government will reward youand pick up the tab.\" That is the wrongmessage. This legislation allows Statesto end additional cash payments tounwed mothers who have additionalchildren while collecting welfare. Thebill also permits States to deny cash tounwed teenage mothers and insteadprovide them with other forms of as-sistance. It is good for children to seeboththeir parents in the morning, andthis bill provides the mechanisms thatwill make this the norm, not the excep-tion.This legislation represents real wel-fare reform. The monster that was cre-ated over the last 30 years will notchange overnight, but we take a sig-nificant step today. This bill ensuresthat welfare finally will benefit, notharm, its beneficiaries. I urge all mycolleagues to adopt this landmark leg-islation.Mrs.FErNSTEINaddressedthe Chair.August 1, 1996The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California is recognized.Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr.President. I ask to be recognized for 13minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection. it is so ordered.Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I would like to read you an excerpt froman editorial in yesterday's SacramentoBee which, I believe, sums up the billwe are about to vote onThere is a widespread consensus that wel-fare must be reformed to reduce long-termdependency and encourage work and per-sonal responsibility. But the current bill, un-derfunded and overly punitive, ignores every-thing we have learned over the last decadeabout moving welfare recipients into the jobmarket.More than half of the welfare recipientslacka highschool education at a time whenlabor markets put a premium on educationand skills. Two-thirds live in central cities,places from which employers have fled. Attheir most successful, past efforts to movewelfare recipients into jobs. such as theGAIN program in Riverside have reducedwelfare roles by only 10 percent and incomesof welfare recipients by a few hundred dol-lars a month.Yet the welfare bill requires states to movehalf of all recipients into jobs. even though.according to Congress' own experts, the billfalls $12 billion shy of funding for the workprogram. Even if one heroically assumesthat two-thirds of welfare families wouldfind permanent employment, the bill's five-year lifetime limit on benefits would leave Imillion families\u2014adults and children alike\u2014without any source of income.Mr.President,Iamverydis- appointed that I must oppose the wel-fare reform bill as presented to thisbody by the House-Senate conferencecommittee. I had hoped that the billthat emerged from the conference com-mittee would be one that Californiacould live with, because, I think it isclear that, with 32 million people, noState in the Union has as much to gainor as much to lose from welfare reform.Unfortunately, this bill remains onein which California loses. and loses big.California is being asked to foot thebill for changing welfare as we knowit\u2014and that is wrong. One-third of theestimated $55 billion savings in thisbill comes from one State: California.California faces a loss of more than $16billion over the next 6 years as a resultof this bill, more when you add reduc-tions in State funds under the newrules and potentially much more if ourwelfare caseload continues to increaseat the current pace.The losses to California are stagger-ing: Up to $9 billion in cuts to Federalaid for legal immigrants, $4.2 billion incuts in food stamps, and as much as $3billion in AFDC funds over the next 6years.Not only is this bill unfair to Califor-nia on its face, it is seriously flawed ina number of critically important areas.The contingency funds provided inthisbill\u2014$2billion\u2014aretoolittle. California alone, I predict, can and willneed the entire amount.Work requirements are an impossiblegoal. The heart of this bill. moving August 1, 1996people from welfare to work, rests ontheunknownand probably the impos-sible. No state, to my knowledge, in 6years has been able to move 50 percentof its welfare caseload into jobs. as thisbill requires. California will have animpossible hurdle to move the required20 percent of its welfare caseload intojobs in 1 year. let alone 50 percent in 6years. In order to meet the 20 percentwork requirement in this bill. Califor-nia would have to find jobs next yearfor more than 166.000 current adult wel-fare recipients. But, in the last 2 years.the State added an average of only300.000 people total to payrolls in non-farm jobs. How do we possibly createenough jobs to increase employment byanother .50percent\u2014especially for awork force that is largely unskilledand under educated? California is aState that has all but lost its produc-tion base and is now producing eitherhigh-skilled jobs or hamburger flippersat minimum wage.In order to move people into work,there must be affordable child care forparents. This bill does not provide any-where near enough funds. The childcare block grant in this bill is awardedto States based on their current utili-zation of Federal child care funds. InCalifornia. there are approximately 1.8million children on AFDC. Californiacurrently provides child care subsidiesand/or slots to approximately 200.000children. The Child Care Law Centerestimates that under the welfare re-form bill, as more parents are requiredto work, as many as 418,000 additionalpreschool children and 650,000 childrenaged 5 to 13 may need child care. Thiswould be a 600 percent increase in needfor child care slots.This bill does not come near theamount of child care dollars that wouldbe needed in California to do this job.The conference bill is actually worsethan the Senate bill in handling Ameri-ca's ultimate safety net: Food Stamps.The conference bill cuts food stamps by20 percent. California loses $4.2 billion.Last year. an average of 1.2 millionhouseholds\u2014more than 3.2 million peo-ple\u2014-in California relied on food stampseach month.California'sunemploy-ment rate is still high at 7.2 percent\u20142 percentage points above the nationalrate of 5.3 percent. 1.117.000 people areout of work today\u2014more than the en-tire populations of nine States. Thisbill would limit food stamps for anable-bodied adult with no children to atotal of 3 months over a period of 3years. If that person becomes unem-ployed. they would only be able to re-ceive an additional 3 months of foodstamps in that same 3-year period. Thisbill would also bar all legal immigrantsfrom receiving food stamps\u2014there is noexemption for elderly, disabled, or chil-dren.The shelter deduction in this bill is acase in point which demonstrates that.however wellintentionedthisbill might be. it lacks a fundamental foot-hold in reality when it comes to Cali-fornia.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThe shelter deduction allows familieswith children to deduct a maximum of$247, with an increase to $300 in theyear 2001, from their income level whenapplying for aid\u2014ostensibly to compensate for the cost of housing.In the vast majority of the popu-lation centers in California. particu-larly in urban areas, you can not find aplacetorentforthat amount ofmorley. In San Francisco. the averagerentisbetween $750 and $1,000 permonth.So this deduction is so low that it isvirtually useless in California.California is not the only loser inthis welfare bill.America's childrenlose as well. In a rush to deliver a wel-fare reform bill\u2014any welfare bill\u2014be-fore the November elections, this bill isthe moral equivalent of a dear Johnletter to our Nation's needy children.Under thIs bill. 3.3 million childrennationwide and 1.8 million children inCalifornia could lose AFDC after the 5-year limit. Children of undocumentedimmigrants would not even be allowedtobuyfederallysubsidizedschool lunches. Recent studies by ChildrenNow and the Urban Institute estimatedthat this welfare plan would thrust anadditional1.1million childreninto povertyconditionsintheUnited States. The Senate rejected moderateamendments soughtbytheWhite House as well as members of both par-ties to provide noncash assistance tochildren whose parents lose their bene-fits in the form of vouchers for food.clothing and other basic necessities.The voucher language included in theconference report is an empty-handedgesture allowing states to rob Peter topay Paul because it adds no new fundsto provide basic necessities to childrenwhose parents lose benefits.The major cost shift to Californiacomes from the elimination of Federalassistance for legal immigrants. mostof whom are elderly, blind, and dis-abled\u2014all of them poor\u2014who came tothis country under terms agreed to bythe Federal Government. And yet. theFederal Government will not bear thecost of changing the terms of thatdeal\u2014the cost of this policy shift willbe forced onto States and counties.Let me be clear: I am all for changingU.S. immigration policies to hold spon-sors of legal immigrants legally boundto provide financial support to theirsponsees. But to change this policy onthose already in this country\u2014retro-actively\u2014and thus summarily droppinghundreds of thousands of elderly anddisabled immigrants from Federal sup-port programs like SSI. food stamps,and AFDC onto already overburdenedcounty assistance programs, isnot only an abdication of Federal respon-sibility\u2014to me it is unconscionable.The impact of this cost shift to Cali-fornia counties could be catastrophic.An estimated722,939legalimmi- grants in California\u2014many of whomare aged. blind, and loseSSI, AFDC. and stamps thisbill.S9379Los Angeles County\u2014the most im-pactedareanationwide\u2014estimatesthat 93,000 noncitizen legal immigrantswill lose SSI under this bill. at a poten-tial cost of more than $236 million eachyearincounty generalassistance funds.Los Angeles also estimates that therestriction on future immigrants re-ceiving nonemergency Medicaid serv-ices would result in $100 million in ad-ditional costs\u2014much higher unless theState comes up with the funds to pro-vide coverage to noncitizens.San Francisco County estimates thatthe cost of county funded general as-sistancecouldincrease$74million under the legal immigrant provisionsin this bill\u2014an increase of more than250 percent.OthercountiesinCaliforniaare studying the impact of this legislationand coming up with similar financialhorror stories. Twelve of the top twen-.ty metropolitan areas in the countrythat are impacted most severely bythis bill are in California.The State of California indicated byits budget that it has no ability or in-tention of stepping in to fill the fund-ing gap this bill creates. Governor Wil-son's State budget for fiscal year 1996-1997 assumes the immigrant provisionsin this legislation will pass and legalimmigrants will no longer be eligiblefor assistance.California's legislative analyst's re-port indicates that Governor Wilson'sbudget:assumes enactment of federal legisla-tion barring most legal immigrants from re-ceiving SSI/SSP benefits starting January 1.1997. The budget assume savings of $91 mil-lion from this proposal.That is from the \"Legislative Ana-lyst's Report, 1996-97 Budget.\"While we in Washington sit in ourivory tower and pat ourselves on theback for changing welfare as we knowit, the real impact of this bill will landon real people who are too old or toosick to care for themselves, and whosefamilies\u2014if they have one\u2014have noability to help them.Let me put some faces and names onthis welfare bill for you:A 73-year-old woman who asked notto be named came to the United Statesas a refugee from Vietnam in 1981. Shesold everything she owned to pay forher passage on a boat for her and hermother. Her mother died on the tripover. She moved to San Francisco in1985 and fellill with kidney disease.She currently depends on SSI and Med-icaid to pay for dialysis and other med-ical care. Her only relative in the Unit-ed States is a goddaughter who cannotafford to care for her. She has appliedfor citizenship. but may not pass theEnglish proficiency exam.Maria, who livesin Los Angeles,came to the United States in 1973 whenshe was 62 years old to live with herdaughter. In 1984, her daughter had astroke at work which rsulted in twocerebralaneurysms.Followingthe stroke, her daughter was unable to S9380workand therefore unable to supportMaria as she had done for the previous11 years. Maria received both SSI andMedicaid. Neither Maria nor her daugh-ter would be able to survive on herdaughter's disability income alone.Thank you. Mr. President.I yield back the remainder of my time.ThePRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time? The Senator from Vir-ginia.Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I yield7 minutes to myself.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia is recognized for 7minutes.Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, like somany of my colleagues. I have had theopportunitytoactuallyvisit\u2014thistime Norfolk, VA a few days ago\u2014acenter which is providing job trainingfor welfare recipients. The first thing Iwas impressed with was a collection ofabout 12 rooms. It was absolutely spot-less. The staff of this nonprofit organi-zation had many volunteers who camein to work with their welfare clients.In this instance I only saw welfaremothers, or some perhaps who did nothave children, and largely minorities.All was neat andclean,and theyshowed up meticulously on time at thiscenter with a spirit of \"can do-we willovercome our handicaps if only youwill reach out and give us a helpinghand.\"That is what this bill does. It shouldbe called the helping hand bill. Each ofus in our lifetime has experienced peri-ods when you had to reach out a help-ing hand. Most have the opportunity todo it regularly. I can remember at onepoint serving in the U.S. military withmen, in this instance, who could notread and write, but they received ahelping hand and quickly learned thosemilitary skills. that they could at thatlearning level. and became key mem-bers of fighting teams, in this instance,in the Navy. I will never forget that.All they asked for was a helping hand,and that is what this bill is designed todo and will do if we will just give it afair chance.I regret to hear, largely from theother side of the aisle. these cries thatwe have done a wrong. We have notdone a wrong. We have listened to theAmerican people. Sixty-five percent ofthe American people, or higher, agreethat the system in Washington has notworked. It was given a fair chance. Itwas given an enormous sum of money.One piece of paper says we have spent.as a nation, more money on welfarethan the cost of all military actions inthis century. Thisisa substantialamount of money.Yet. the casualties in terms of thefamilies.particularlythechildren, have been very high. Why not give theStates and the local communities theopportunity now to make this systemwork? We all know that there are per-sons less fortunate than ourselves, andall they want is a helping hand. Reachout, that is what we should do.As this bill goes forth\u2014the Presidenthas now indicated. for reasons of hisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEown, after two vetoes he will sign thisone\u2014let's send it forth in a spirit ofcan do. like the people I met in thewelfare center in Norfolk. We do notwant it to arrive on the doorstep in theseveralStates,down inthe smalltowns and villages of my State andyour States with a message. \"It isn'tgoing to work.\" But it is there. so let'ssend it in the spirit of give it the bestshot.I ask. are not the people in the com-munities. large and small, all acrossthis Nation as well qualified as the in-numerable army of bureaucrats here inthe Nation's Capital who, for half acentury, have worked with this? Arethey not as well qualified? I say abso-lutely yes, and let's give them a chanceto make it work.I am not satisfied with every provi-sion in this bill. I sided with the Sen-ator from Louisiana, JoirsJ BREAUX. togive more funds and support to thechildren.Iwas concerned.Ivoted against a majority on my side of theaisle. There is not a person in thisChamber who is not concerned as to ex-actly what will happen to children. Butlet me tell you. in the communities inmy State. and I say in the commu-nities in your States. they are notgoing to let the children be injured, ir-respective of however the law is writ-ten. They will find a way to make itwork and protect those children farbetter than we can as bureaucrats inWashington. They will make it work.If there are legislative changes need-ed,I assure you, the citizens of mygreat State will come to my doorstepvery promptly and say, 'Senator, we'retrying to make this bill work. but weneed a change here.\" or a change there.And I am confident I will step forward,as will others on both sides of the aisle,and make those changes to make thispiece of legislation work.Families living side by side, one re-ceiving welfare, one getting up andgoing to work\u2014the friction betweenthem. the discontent right in the samestreet in the same neighborhood\u2014Is in-tolerable. We have to stop that. We areproviding a disincentive for those whoare getting out of bed and trying to goto work. Within the welfare ranks, wemay be taking a gamble. but I will betthat there are a substantial number onwelfare who want to come forward and.with a helping hand. make this piece oflegislation work.It is incumbent on those welfare peo-ple to have a willingness to break outof the system. They may be shy. theymay be reticent, and we will be pa-tient. but they have to go to work.There are able-bodied people in all these communities\u2014and Ihave seenthem and you have seen them\u2014whowill step forward and gently but firmlyand decisively extend that hand tomake it work and to quickly comeback if children or other aspects of thisprogram are not working and informthe Members of Congress so we can fixIt.Mr. President, this is a great day forour country. We have come to the real-August 1, 1996ization that one of the major entitle-ment programs has not lived up to itsexpectations. It has created scenes inevery town in America which are to-tally unacceptable inthis day andtime. Let's make this piece of legisla-tion work. Let's send it out of here andpraise the efforts that we have made inresponseto the direct plea of theAmerican people to fix this system bysending it from Washington back towhere it belongs\u2014hometown USA.I yield the floor.Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BEN-NErr). The Senator from Illinois.Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 7 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator is recognized.Mr. SIMON. Mr. President. let's faceit, our choice is: hurting poor peopleand gaining some votes in the process,or appearing to stand for somethingthat we all know needs change and los-ing votes but not hurting poor people.My friend from Virginia. for whom Ihave great respect. says this is a help-ing-hand bill. The Urban Institute sayswe are going to put 2.6 million moreAmericans into poverty. 1.1million more children. That is not the kind ofhelping hand we need. We already have24 percent of our children living in pov-erty. No other Western industrializednation is anywhere close to that. andwe are compounding the evil.I am supporting Bill Clinton for re-election. In many ways, he leaves agood legacy. But let no one make anymistake about it, he is marring his leg-acy by signing this bill. He may gain afew more votes on November 5, but heis hurting history's judgment of whathe is doing as President.This is not welfare reform. This is po-litical public relations.Iheard one of my colleagues, forwhom I have great respect. say we haveto change the system of children hav-ing children. Of course we have tochange the system of children havingchildren. But this bill does not do onething in that direction. And it shouldbe added that the birthrate among peo-ple who have welfare is going down,and going down significantly.Second. I say to you. Mr. President,we have about a million teenage preg-nancies each year. about 400.000 of which end up in abortions, inciden-tally. What we know is those who arehigh school dropouts are much morelikely to be involved in teenage preg-nancies. You want to do somethingabout that? Let us put some moneyinto education, not this phony bill thatis going to cause great harm.Will Durant and his wife have writ-tengreathistories:\"Reformation.\"\"The Age of Napoleon.\" and so forth.But Will Durant wrote a small bookcalled The Meaning of History.\" Inthat small book, in \"The Meaning ofHistory.\" he said: 'This is the historyof nations. that those who are morefortunateeconomically continueto pile up benefits. and they press down August 1, 1996thosewho arelessfortunate untilthose who are less fortunate eventuallyrevolt.\"What are we doing here in this ses-sion of Congress? We are giving thePentagon. this fiscal year. $11 billionmore than they requested. We aregoing to have some kind of tax cutsthat particularly benefit those of us inthis Chamber who are more fortunateeconomically. And with this bill, forthe next 6 years, we will be cuttingback $9.2 billion a year from poor peo-ple.I am for genuine welfare reform, butgenuine welfare reform requires provid-ing jobs for people of limited abilityand providing day care. I have a bill inthat says you cannot be on welfaremore than5 weeks\u2014in some ways,tougher than this\u2014but then the Fed-eral Government has a WPA type ofjobavailable. We screen people as theycome in. and if they cannot read andwrite, we get them into a program. Ifyou have no marketable skill, you getthem to a technical school or a com-munity college. That would be genuinewelfare reform.But as Gov. Tommy Thompson haspointed out\u2014a Republican, inciden- tally\u2014if you are going to have welfarereform, you are going to have to put inmore money upfront. not less money.Ilike Senator FEINSmIN's remarkthat this is the moral equivalent of a'Dear John\" letter to the poor peopleof the Nation. She is. unfortunately.right.In October\u2014the Presiding Officer issomeone who has a sense of history\u2014inOctober. we have Roosevelt HistoryMonth because we thought at thatpoint we would dedicate the Rooseveltmemorial. It looks like now it will notbe ready then. But we will celebrate.that month, when we had a great na-tional leader who lifted the poor peopleof this Nation. Two months prior tothat, we are going to celebrate bypushing down the poor people of thisNation.Let us be very practical. A womanwho lives in Robert Taylor homes inthe south side of Chicago. desperatelypoor, lives in a public housing project,has three children, and with this bill\u2014and she has very limited skills becauseshe went to poor schools, probably canbarely read and write\u2014with this bill weare saying to her, you can at the moststay on welfare 5 years, maybe only 2,but we are not going to provide any jobfor you. we are not going to have anyday care for your children.What does that woman doif she wants to feed her children? Does shetake to the streets in crime? Does shebecome a prostitute? I do not know,nor does anyone else in this Chamber.L'et me pay tribute to two peoplehere, one who just spoke against thisbefore. Senator CHRiS DODD. whois the Democratic national chairman and whois interested in votes. But despite beingDemocratic national chairman, despitethe stand taken by President Clinton,CHRIS DODDstoodhere and said this isCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEbadfor the children of America. AndPAULWELLSTONE. upfor reelection.showing great, great courage.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's time has expired.Mr.SIMON.I yield myself 30 addi-tional seconds.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator is recognized.Mr. SIMON. When my friend fromVirginia. Senator WARNER. said the' States will protect people. I think ofthe bill we finally passed when I wasover in the House to protect childrenwho wanted to go to school who haddisabilities. The States said,'If you'rein a wheelchair.if you're blind,if you're deaf, sorry, we're not going toforce education for them.\" The major-ity of the mentally retarded were notbeing given any help by our publicschools. The Federal Government camealong and said, \"You are entitled tothis.' The Federal Government pro-tected people with disabilities, and theFederal Government should protectpoor people in this Nation. We are notdoing it with this legislation.Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa.Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Sen-ator from Ohio 8 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio.Mr. DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent.This legislation that we will pass inthe next 2 hours is truly historic. Itrecognizes. literally for the first timein 60 years. that when it comes to lift-ing people out of poverty, Washingtondoes not have all the answers. In fact,I think most of us know Washingtonhas really few answers in this area, be-cause the true innovation, the truechanges that we have seen in the lastdecade in regard to welfare reform hascome from the States. That is whatthis bill will foster. That is what thisbill will allow.Mr. President, there has been a greatdeal of controversy about many partsof this bill, but I believe what unitesjust about everyone in this debate is arealization that the current systemsimply is not working. that the statusquo is unacceptable. We disagree aboutwhat should replace that system.That is why one chief merit of thisbill is that it gives the States the flexi-bility to reinvent welfare, to find outwhat works, what does not work, andonce we find out what works, to buildon that. That experimentation has al-ready started in the States. The onlything that is holding it back, frankly.is the Federal Government. And thisbill allows for more experimentation,it allows for new ideas.Mr. President. compared to the cur-rent system, a failed, top-down systemthat fosters the cycle of dependencythat blights so many parts of America.this is a huge improvement. And thereare other improvements, Mr. President.in this bill as well.This bill reestablishes the connectionbetween work and income. the time-S9381honored idea that people should workto get income. The current welfare sys-tem cut the nexus between workingand making money. This was one of thegreat mistakes of our social welfarepolicy. People do need a hand up. Theyneed help. And this welfare bill givesthem a hand up.I am also very pleased. Mr. President.the bill includes a \"rainy day\" contin-gency fund for the States. As a formerLieutenant Governor, I know how vul-nerable a State's budget is to an eco-nomic downturn. Many States, such asmy home State of Ohio. are required bylaw to balance their budget every sin-gle year. no matter how hard the eco-nomic times are. We need to make surethat the poorest Americans are takencare of when that contingency arises.thus the contingency fund in this bill.That is why. Mr. President, I offeredthe amendment for the contingencyfund last year. I applaud the confereesand the leadership for the decision toinclude that contingency fund in thispackage as well.I also think this bill's crackdown onunpaid child support is a terrific ideaand long overdue. As a former countyprosecutor.I dealt with these childsupport cases all the time. and I cantell you that when child support goesup, the welfare rolls go down. It is assimple as that.One provision in this bill that I amparticularly proud of is one I proposedas an amendment to last year's welfarereform bill. It has been included in thisbill as well. It would give States addedtools in their efforts to track down thebank accounts of deadbeat parents.Mr. President. in this bill, we arestrengthening the States as they at-tempt to go after the delinquent anddeadbeat parents. It is absolutely es-sential that we strengthen the ethic ofpersonal responsibility in this way. Weneed to make itabsolutely clear\u2014America demands that parents be re-sponsible for their children. Deadbeatparents cannot be allowed to walkaway from their responsibilities. In this bill, we deal with that.We also provide a strong safety netat the same time. a strong safety netforpeople who need help. The billpassed the House by a broad bipartisanvote. 328 to 101. I expect it will pass theSenateoverwhelminglylaterthisevening. I applaud the President for hisdecision to sign this bill. My only re-gret is that we lost time. We lost ayear. Last year. the President had wel-fare reform before him. He decided toveto the bill. This bill is no different,not significantly different in any way.I am pleased to see that the Presidenthas changed his mind and that he nowintends to sign the bill.Today, the American people can beproud of this legislative process. Weare about to pass a bill in a couple ofhours that offers the best hope in ourlifetime for breaking the cycle of pov-erty. It is a bill that provides hope,hope for the people on welfare. and.hope for the idea that we can change S9382welfare,change the system that clearlyhas not worked. It has been a systemthat has kept people down. a systemthat has promoted illegitimacy, a sys-tem that has not given people hope.Today we take a major step to changethat.Mr. President. let me conclude bystating that we have heard a lot ofcomments today on this floor aboutchildren. I think we should not fail torealize that the chief victim of the cur-rent welfare system, the chief victims.are the children. If anyone doubts that,talk to families who are on welfare.Talk to the children. I believe the chiefbenefit of this bill, quite frankly, is thehope it holds for these children.I thank the Chair and I yield thefloor.Mr. ABRAHAM. In the absence of aspeaker on the Democratic side. I yieldmyself up to 10 minutes to speak atthis time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan.Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. as wecome to the conclusion of this debate,I think we should be proud of the ef-forts of the Senate and of the Congress.For the better part of 2 years we havenow been working toward. I think, avery positive conclusion to the debateon how we assist those in our societywho are the most needy.It is clear from an examination of thepast 25 to 30 years that the so-calledwar on poverty has been, at least ipuntil now, won by poverty. Althoughtrillions of dollars, over $5 trillion, hasbeen spent during this past 25 to 30years to try to fight that war, we findtoday virtually the same percentage, ifnot a greater percentage, of Americansbelow the poverty line than was thecase when the war began. We havespent. as I say, a lot of time debatingin this Congress and in previous Con-gresses why that is the case.It is quite clear, and I think acknowl-edged now by virtually everybody whohas been involved in this debate, thatthe process, the welfare system in thiscountry, is a principal reason why thewar has not been won. Some would say.yes. there is a problem. but we haveyet to come to the proper solution tothat problem. However, I disagree.Indeed, we have worked very hardfor, as I say. almost 2 years in this Con-gress, building on work done in pre-vious Congresses, to find the solution. Ibelievethislegislation,althoughmaybe not ideal from the perspectiveof any single Member. including theone from Michigan, is. nevertheless. amajor step in the right direction.I believe this approach will work. Mr.President. It will work for a variety ofreasons. First, it will work because itvests far more flexibility and far moredecisionmaking and far more authorityin the 50 States. There may have beena timeinthis country when someStates and communities did not stepup to their obligations to assist thosein need. That is certainly not the casetoday. I do not know of one person inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEthis Senate who has stood up here andsaid: \"My State will fail; my State willnot take care of people: my State can-not meet the challenge: my State isless compassionate than the NationalGovernment.' Ihave not heard oneMember say that. That is because notone Member could say that, Mr. Presi-dent.The States are as compassionate andas capable and more knowledgeableabout the problems confronted by theircitizens than bureaucrats in Washing-ton. This legislation gives those Statesthe chance to translate their compas-sion and their insight and their exper-tise into the action it will take to as-sist people in need to move out of pov-erty and on to the economic ladder.Thislegislationworks,also.Mr. President, because it changes the in-centives. Yes, we place some toughstandards in this legislation. incentivesto people to get out of the welfare de-pendency role and on to and into thework force. We put time limits. We putthe kind of tough standards that willcause people to understand that pov-erty is not the way of life, that welfareis not the way of life, and to seek theassistance of government at all levelsto obtain the training and the assist-ance and the help it will take to moveinto productive work. It changes theincentives in the right direction.The legislationis important, also.Mr. President, because for the firsttime it allows us to begin addressingone of the most important problems weconfront in this country, the problemof the rising rate of illegitimacy. ofout-of-wedlock births in America. Weprovide in the legislation incentives forStates to find ways to solve the grow-ing number of out-of-wedlock birth sit-uations, incentives in the form of'moredollarsfor the various problems if States can address effectively these is-sues and these problems. and do sowithout increasing the abortion rate atthe same time.Finally. this legislation makes sense.Mr. President, because it means lessbureaucracy. In my State of Michigan.we think we have a pretty darn goodformula for addressing the problemsthat confront our most needy citizens.Too often. however, Washington bu-reaucracy and red tape make it impos-sible to accomplish our objectives.Just to put it in perspective, when wetalk to people in our Family Independ-ence Agency\u2014it used to be called theDepartment ofSocialServices; wetried to change the title to change thephilosophy as to our objectives in thatagency\u2014the front-line case workers,the people who are supposed to be outthere at the front line assisting folksto get out of poverty and on to the eco-nomic ladder, two-thirds of their timeis not spent helping people get off wel-fare. Two-thirds of their time is spentfilling out paperwork, almost all of itcoming from Washington. We believe inour State. for example, that we cantake what is now a 30-page form thatmust be filled out by folks who areAugust 1, 1996going to go on to assistance programsand reduce it to about 5 pages. one-sixth the size of the form that cur-rently is used. The time the case work-er would have spent filling out theother 24 pages can now be spent helpingthe recipient figure out what trainingprograms and whatstrategieswill work to give them an opportunity to beproductive and to get on the economicladder. We think we should have theflexibility to get rid of the bureaucracyand to get rid of all that paperworkand concentrate on the true challengethat we have.For these reasons. I think the pro-gram that we are about to pass tonightis a sensible approach. I think it willdo two things. I think it will help thepeople who need help and give con-fidence to people who have lost it inour system. the people who pay thebills, the taxpayers, who are frustratedby what they see as a losing war onpoverty, confidence we are moving inthe right direction. I think that willtranslate,Mr. President. into moresupport for social agencies across ourStates and in our communities. forcharitableorganizations,forother types of approaches that will assistgovernment in getting the job done.Finally. let me conclude with a com-ment about one particular topic thathas been discussed at great length dur-ing this debate. That is the issue ofchildren. We all have different perspec-tives on this, of course. As I look backat the last 30 years, as I hear storyafter story from the people in our so-cial service agencies about families ina cycle of dependency. about kids with-out hope, of rising crime rates amongyoung people, of increased drug usagerates. of kids having kids, I can't helpbut think that what we have today hasto be changed if we really care abouthelping kids. If we really want to helpthe children. we certainly should not,in any sense, continue this legacy. con-tinue the system that has created somuch unhappiness and so much hope-lessness.Let us replace the hopelessness withhope, Mr. President. Let us finally putall the words and all the rhetoric ofmany years of campaigns and Con-gresses into action. Let us do it to-night. Let us finish the job and move ma new direction. Let us solve the prob-lem. Let us help our most needy citi-zens in the best way possible.I yield the floor.Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 7minutes to the Senator from Massa-chusetts.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts is recognized.Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thankthe Chair. Last year, I voted for thebill that the Senate passed 87-12 thatwent to conference committee. Theconference committee moved signifi.cantly back, so much so that the Presi-dent saw fit to veto it.I voted for thebill that came back. I voted for the billthat went to the conference committeethis year. I listened very carefully to August 1, 1996thecommentstoday of my colleaguesabout this bill that comes back fromthe conference committee.This bill that returns to the floorcontains a number of important im-provements from the bill that was ve-toed last year. The agreement before usassures that almost all categories ofcitizens who are willing to work whoare now eligible for Medicaid will con-tinue to be eligible for health care inthe future. The bill increases child carefunding levels by $4 billion over thatwhich was vetoed. It doesn't includethe optional food stamp block grant, soour Nation will continue to have a na-tional nutritional safety net that isbelow that which I think is necessary.The new bill also maintains the childcare health and safety protections con-tained in the current law and rein-states a quality set-aside.Additionally, whereas the vetoed billblockgrantedadministrationand child-placement services funding. thisbill before us retains the current lawon child protection entitlement pro-grams and services. And, finally, com-pared to the vetoed bill, this new billincreases the contingency fund from $1billion to $2 billion to provide Stateswith more protection during an eco-nomic downturn.Perhaps most important in the newbillis the child-support enforcementmeasures. These enormously signifi-cant changes will result in the mostsweeping crackdown on deadbeat par-ents in history. As the President saidyesterday. with this bill, we say to par-ents that if you don't pay the childsupport you owe, you are going to haveyour wages garnisheed, your driver's li-cense taken away, and people will bechased across State lines and tracked,and, if necessary. people will have towork off what they owe. That is a mon-umental shift in attitude and culture;although, ultimately, I believe withoutequivocation, that we will have to gofurther toward a national system, be-cause one-thirdofallchild-supportcases are interstate cases. The meas-ures contained in this bill will dra-matically improve the child-supportsystem so children can get the supportthey need and deserve.Notwithstandingthesegoodad- vances. Mr. President, I have also lis-tened carefully to my colleagues on thefloor, those who oppose it. There is notone of them who has not expressed le-gitimate concerns, legitimate fears. Irespect those concerns and those fears.and I do not believe that there is one ofthem who doesnotwant welfarechange in this Nation. But I do believewe are voting today on a fundamentaldecision about change and what we aregoing to try to do. The fact is that weare really codifying what 40 States arealready involved in. because there arewaivers all across this land. And we arecodifying something for a period of 5years.a5-yearexperiment, duringwhich time,the5years. thefull amount of time that people have beforethey would be cut off, will not have yetCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEexpired. We will be reconsidering it be-fore that date comes.Ibelieve that my colleagues whoPhave cited problems that still remainwith this bill are correct. But there isno way to a certainty, Mr. President,to say what the interaction will bewith those who will go to work, thosewho will benefit from the increasedminimum wage, those families thatwill benefit by increased purchasingpower from the combination of workand minimum wage. and therefore lessneed for food stamps. There is no wayto say to an absolute certainty what.the impact of a new culture will be onchildren or the relationship of family.What we do know is that it will benew, and what we do know is that itcarries risks. Mr. President, we alsoknow some things to a certainty. Iagree with the President and col- leagues who come to the floor that, al-though we made great strides to main-tain the fundamental nutritional safe-ty net, we do cut deeper than necessaryin this bill. And I am disappointed inthe bill's provisions on legal immi-grants. Legal immigrants are peoplewho pay taxes, they can be drafted, andthey are in this country completely le-gally. The harmful provisions that arein this bill have nothing to do withwelfare reform. They are fundamen-tally a savings mechanism. I will do ev-erything in my power, Mr. President,to see that we change those measuresas rapidly as possible to adjust.But as the President said yesterday,immigrant families with children whofall on hard times through no fault oftheir own should be eligible for medicaland other help when they need it. Ifyou are mugged on a street corner orare in an accident or you get cancer orthe same thing happens to your chil-dren, we are a society that should pro-vide some assistance. I will do every-thing in my power to fight for that.Finally. I was also disappointed thatwe weren't able to have the vouchersfor children as a matter of automatic.But. Mr. President, as I balance the eq-uities of this bill, the need for change,against those things that we can rem-edy and against the experiment that isalready taking place in this country. itis my belief that the bill before us willultimatelyprovidealeveragefor change that will also change the dy-namic of the debate in this country.and that is why, ultimately, I chooseto vote for the change and choose tovote for this bill.For years now, the poverty rate forchildren has already been going up inAmerica. We have the highest povertyrate of any industrial nation in theworld. But when we come to the floorof the U.S. Senate to try to do some-thing for children, we are told. well.now, wait a minute, their parents don'twant to work. or it is the welfare sys-tem that created the problem. In fact.the welfare debate that has been soadequately distorted in so many re-gards obscures the real debate aboutchildren and about how you put peopleto work.S9383Mr. President. I am convinced thatby taking that off the table, we are, infact. going to begin the real debate inthis Nation today about how we ade-quately take care of those kids.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. KERRY. I ask for1 additionalminute.Mr. EXON. I have exactly 1 minuteleft. I yield that 1 minute only to theSenator from Massachusetts.Mr. KERRY. Thank you. Mr. Presi-dent.I believe that, by taking thisaway. providing we are vigilant andproviding we all mean what we say,providing we are prepared to do whatwe ought to do in conscience, we willnow begin to focus on the children ofthis country and we will begin to focuson the real work of how you put peopleto work. I believe that is the most im-portant debate that the country canhave and take away from it any dema-goguery or artificiality that is placedin front of us about welfare or stereo-types with respect to it. I believe it isan important change.Yes, people ought to work. Hard-working American citizens should notbe required to carry people. But wealso have to be honest about the dif-ficulties of some of our population try-ing to actually find that work. Weshould not hurt children.I want to spend every ounce of en-ergy I have. Mr. President, on the floorof the Senate to stop the business ofthe Senate. if necessary, to guaranteethat we fulfill that commitment as wejudge how this works over the nextmonths and years.I thank the Chair.Mr. EXON. Mr. President. I yield 5minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arkansas.Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you. Mr. President.I thank the distinguishedfloor manager from Nebraska.Mr. President, let me say, first, thatnobody knows better than I that ourwelfare system does not work verywell. Everyone who is going to voteagainst this bill today said they do notlike the system, that it is broke. Thereis a lot of truth in that.There are a number of reasons I amgoing to vote against this bill. First.the bill is not going to address thosedeficiencies we all know exist in thesystem. Second, I am going to voteagainstitbecauseitdiscriminatesagainst my home State of Arkansas ina massive way. Children in my Statewill get $390ayear. Children in Massa-chusetts will get $4,200 a year; in Wash-ington, DC. $2,200 a year. You tell mewhy a child in Arkansas is worth $390 ayear and $4,200 in Massachusetts. Youexpect me to vote for a formula likethat, one that does not even take intoconsideration how many poor childrenare in your State?Everybody hates welfare. I am nottoo crazy about it myself. But I willtell you one thing. I have seen it first-hand. I have been in the ghettos of my S9384Statein theDelta. Icantell youit is not a pretty picture. Mr. President. Ifind it rather perverse that 535 men andwomen who make $133,000 a year willbevoting on whether children are going to eat or not, whether theirmothers are going to eat or not.Never has such an important piece oflegislation been crafted in such a high-ly charged political environment. Ev-erybody understandsprecisely whatthe politics of this whole thing are.The election is coming up. So we haveto do it. I said the other day that thereought to be a rule in the Congressagainst considering bills like this dur-ing an election year. The Americanpeople detest welfare. Iunderstandthat. But there ought to be a ruleagainst ccrnsidering these kinds of billsthat affect the very fiber of this Nationin an election year.This is the first time in my lifetimewe have deliberately and knowinglyand with some elation turned our backon the children of this Nation. I stillbelieve those Methodist Sunday schoolstories I heard about 'blessed are thepoor.\" I used to be one of them.We are going to kick people off wel-fare and tell them to get a job. I wouldlike to invite all of my colleagues to goto the Arkansas Delta. I will pick outa dozen communities for you to visit,and then you tell me after you havekicked these mothers off welfare wherethey are going to get a job: 50 percentof these mothers will be kicked off thewelfare rolls after the first 2 years.There are no jobs.We could not even findit in ourhearts to provide vouchers for mothersso they could provide diapers, medi-cines, and other necessities for chil-dren. We wouldn't even give them avoucher to buy nonfood products fortheir children. I can't vote for this.We have one out of every five chil-dren in this country in poverty. Youthink of it. One out of every five chil-dren in this country, 20 percent. nowlive in poverty. Every single study ofthis bill says there will be a minimumof1million to 2.5 million childrenadded to those rolls within 5 years.Oh. Mr. President, I could go on andon about why I am not going to votefor this bill. Simply, Ijust can't find itin my heart to vote for a bill that Iconsider to be punitive, Punitive to-ward whom? Not just some lethargicperson on welfare, but innocent chil-dren. If you are a legal alien and theschool district wantsto take yourchild. that is their business. We are notgoing to pay for it. So if you are a legalalien. you have a right to be here, youwork here, you pay taxes here. and yousend your child down to the school.They may take your child, but theywill not let him go to the lunchroombecause the Federal Government paysthat bill. and \"We ain't paying.\" Weare not going to pay it, I have heard itsaid that 47 members of our Olympicteam are legal aliens. or children oflegal aliens. Tonight, instead of honor-ing them during the Olympics. we areturning are backs on them.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATESo, Mr. President, I admit I am soft-hearted. I am very compassionate to-ward children and women. So I justsimply cannot vote for this bill. I wisheverybody well, and I hope it works. Ido not believe it will.I yield the floor.Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Pennsylvania is recognized.Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr.President.Mr. President,I speak as someonewho has worked on this issue for now 4years. This is a very meaningful thingfor me personally. But I think, as Ilook at this legislation and as I look atthe process it has been through, I can'thelp but think what we are doing hereis probably the most significant pieceof social welfare legislation that wepassed maybe since the mid-1960's, andI would even suggest possibly since the1930's. So it is a very significant day.We are making monumental decisionshere that are going to affect millions ofpeople.I understand that the passions runvery high on both sides of the aisle onhow desperately we need these changes,as some suggest, and how erroneousthese decisions are by others who op-pose the bill.If I can for a moment. because I knowthere has been a lot of debate aboutwhy we need to make these changesand what the bill does or does not do,or should or shou1c not do, let me talkfor a minute as to how this bill gothere.I think. if you look back at the gen-esis of this proposal, you have to goback to the House of Representatives.A task force was put together by NEwTGINGRICH, a task force on welfare re-form when we were in the minorityover in the House back in 1993. Heasked me, as the ranking member onthe Ways and Means Subcommittee ofHuman Resources, to chair a task forceof members of the subcommittee andother people, including the former Gov-ernor of Delaware. MICHAEL CASTLE,the Governor from Missouri. and a fewothers. to sit down and try to put to-gether a bill that would follow throughon ending welfare as we know it.We got all sorts of testimony frompeople. We talked to literally hundredsof people all over the country aboutthe problems in the welfare system andlistenedtoallof the experts andpseudoexperts on the issue of welfare\u2014frankly, not just from conservativesbut from across the spectrum\u2014as tothe pitfalls that we might encounter.Let me first state that this was anextraordinary thing to do. We actuallytook this very seriously. When you arein the minority, when you work on amajor issue like this, most people donot pay much attention to what youdo. \"You are not going to pass this bill.Itis not going to become law.\" Sothere is sometimes a feeling, \"Well,lets just sort of put together what wecan, sort of patch together some popu-August 1, 1996lar ideas, throw it out, and it will geta story for 1 day and no one will paymuch attention to it after that.\"I can tell you that myself, NANCYJOHNSON, CLAY Sw, MICHAEL CASTLE,and a whole lot of other folks who werein the House last term took this as areal serious responsibility. We met lit-erally for. I think, 6 or 7 months. everyweek, hours upon hours each week. justover every single item in the legisla-tion.It was a wonderful experience for me.But I think it was a great experiencefor all of us to see the real complex-ities of what we are dealing with. I think we got a real understanding ofsome of the concerns that Membershave expressed here.We came out with a bill in Novemberof 1993. It addressed for the first timeissues like the paternal establishmentswhich are in this bill. The provisionswe wrote in this bill almost 3 years agoare almost identical. In fact, I suggestthey maybe are identical to the provi-sions that are in the bill today that weaddressed\u2014the issue, for the first timeever, of immigration and benefits tolegal aliens. It was the first time thebill had come up and addressed thatissue. And those provisions are in thisbill today.We addressed the issue of illegit-imacy. Again. that was a word that,frankly, we were not supposed to useanymore. It was a politically incorrectword. You were supposed to use theword \"out-of-wedlock birth.\" We ad-dressed that issue for the first time andreally brought the attention of the wel-fare debate on this scourge in our Na-tion.I know it has been cited here before.but in1965, the illegitimacy rate inthis country was about 5 or 6 percent.Today a third of the children in thiscountry are born out of wedlock. I amnot saying that welfare is the solecause of that. It certainly is not. But itcertainly is a contributing factor. inmy mind and, I think, in other people'sminds. We were trying to come up withideas. some of which were included,and, frankly, a lot were not. But wepushed the envelope for the first time.We put this in the forefront and madeit an issue of debate. Yes; we had timelimits on welfare. Yes; we had work re-quirements\u2014real work requirements.And those time limits of 2 years with-out having to work and 5 years total onwelfare are in this bill today.If you go back and look at that origi-nal draft. I think you are going to seea lot of similarities in child support en-forcement and a whole host of otherareas that are in the bill today. And Ithink it is a remarkable compliment tothe men and women who worked inthat group that their hard work, seem-ingly fruitless at the time because wewere a minority, had absolutely nohope that we would ever be in the ma-jority but cared enough\u2014I think thatis the point I am trying to make\u2014wecared enough about this system andthe destruction that the system was August 1, 1996causing. we cared enoughto spendhoursandhours of timetoput togethera bill and endthe despairandthe de-pendency that thissystem in theHousewho madea tremendouscon- tribution to the original bill, and Icon- gratulate others for the successor bills.thebillsthat were introduced in theSenate by Senator Packwood and ical step and moved the ball forward ona few issues, fell back a little bit onothers, but that is howthe legislativeprocess works. We tried to meettheconcernsof. frankly, both sides of theaisle.AridIknow when Senator Pack-wood,and then subsequentlywhenSen-ator ROTHtookover the Finance Com-mittee, we actually crafted bill hereon theSenate floor lastyear that got87votesand then recraftedanother bill, very similar to the bill that passedlast year. and got74 votes, and Isus- pect we will get maybe even a few thesamething tothe is acashbonusfor Statesthat areable to reduce that statistic. that cruel statis-tic to children. AndIsay cruel becausegothroughall of the evaluation cri-teria: Children who are born to single-parent households aremorelikely tobepoor. are more likely to be on wel-fare.more likely to do poorer in school, more likely to be victims ofcrime. You can go ondown the ago that have stoodthe test oftime andscrutinyin bothHouses of Congress. because it isthe right thing to do. We have stood upand said familiesareimportant underthis bill. We have stood up and saidcommunities are important.SenatorASHCROVF.inanother goodaddition to this bill.said that reli-gious. civic, and nonprofit organiza-tions in the local communities aregoing to be much more able to be partof the system of welfare, of support ofthe poor than they are today. are goingto be eligible for more funds and moreopportunities to help the poor, whichthey do much better. much more effi-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEciently,but, frankly. even if they didnot do it more efficiently. they do itmore compassionately. They do it withlove for their neighbors and the peoplein their communities, not out of somesense of duty because it is their job.We have changed welfare in this bill,and we have done it over a long proc-ess. Those who would suggest this isjust something that was thrown to-gether at the last minute before anelection do not know the work, or ei-ther choose not to recognize the workthat has been put into this bill, thetime and the debate. the hours of thedebate here on the floor and over in theHouse, in the conference committees,to try to come up with a carefullycrafted bill that is truly compassionateand not compassionate in the sensethat the Federal Government is goingto go out and take care of every per-son's need who is poor.I think we have shown that that sys-tem is truly not compassionate becausewhen the Federal Government comes inand takes care of every aspect or everyneed that even a child has, then theFederal Government. in fact, becomesthe replacement for the others whoseresponsibilityittruly should be totake care of that child. We have said tothe father, again. you are not nec-essary. We have said to mothers, youdo not have to work: we will provide\u2014some distant bureaucrat will send acheck to provide for you.That is not compassion. Compassionis having a system that builds familiesso there is an environment there forchildren to flourish. Compassion is asystem that supports neighborhoodsand civic organizations, mediating in-stitutions that DAN COATS talks about so often that provide the values andcommunity support for families thatthey need to help take care of children,to create the neighborhoods where chil-dren are no longer afraid to go out andplay on the playground because theycould step on some drug-infected nee-dle.No, this bill is all about creating acommunity. creating a support net-work and environment at the levelmost important to that child as op-posed to that bureaucrat sitting behindthe bulletproof window passing out thecheck every month. saying to that per-son on the other end receiving thatcheck that you. because of your pov-erty, are unable to provide for yourselfand your children and you need to bedependent upon us for your life.The Senator from Arkansas said it isa tragedy that one in five children inthis country are in poverty. and I agreeitis a tragedy. And he said it is goingto get worse. I suggest he is wrong. Isuggest the tragedy is as bad as it isgoing to get. and there are plenty of or-ganizations as a result of this bill thatare going to get the opportunity tostep forward, including the family.I feel very good about what we aredoing here, and I would say. as myfriend and colleague in the House. CLAYSI-lAw, said many times, I am not sug-S9385gesting this bill is perfect. I grant youthis bill is not perfect. No bill is per-fect. But I can guarantee you that thisis a dramatic step forward that thiscountry has asked for and is gettingfrom a Congress that is listening.Yes. we will make mistakes. Unlikethose who crafted the current systemin the thirties and in the 1960's, we aregoing to be willing to come back hereand look at those mistakes. We aregoing to be willing to come back andface those problems. because we under-stand, unlike those who crafted thelast system, that we do not have allthe answers here. that we do not havethe omnipotence here to decide what isbest for everyone.This is a grand experiment, one thatwe must take if we are going to savechildren in this country and, more im-portantly, to save the fabric of Amer-ica for the next and future generations.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska.Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I adviseSenators on both sides of the aisle thatwe have 11 minutes remaining. I amabout to yield 7 minutes to the Senatorfrom Florida. There will be 2 minutesto Senator HEFLIN and 2 minutes toSenator FoID.I yield 7 minutes to the Senator fromFlorida.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida.Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, whenwe voted on this matter a few days ago.I voted \"no.\" Today. I am going to votefor the conference report, and I wish toexplain why I am taking that position.As I assessed the conference report,it seemed to me that we had basicallytwo options. One option was to waituntil there was a better point at whichto commence and continue our effortat welfare reform and be prepared toaccept the status quo until that secondopportunity presented itself. I felt thatwas likely to be a long time from to-night.The second option is to accept aclearly less than perfect bill, I wouldsay. accept a flawed bill, but one whichrepresents a step in a multistep process-leading toward a fundamental transi-tion from a welfare system that has fo-cused on providing for the needs of adependent population to a welfare sys-tem that provides the ladder by whichpeople can move from dependence toindependence. I believe it is more ap-propriate to take that second road. Ibelieve this is the time to take thatleap of faith.To use some statistics from my Stateof Florida, 3 years ago. in 1993, we hadan unemployment rate of 7 percent. Wehad 254,000 persons who were on theAFDC caseload. That is 254,000 familiesthat were on AFDC. Today, in 1996, wehave a 200,000 AFDC caseload. a reduc-tion of 54,000 in 3 years. That says thatwe are in a period of a strong economy,creating jobs. providing people withthe opportunity within the current sys-tem to get off welfare and to get a job. S9386Ithink that is the ideal environmentin which, now, to have this new systemwhich will be giving to the 200.000 whoare still on welfare the means by whichthey can get ajob and end dependence.If we cannot make this transition workunder the economic conditions thatexist in my State and most of theStates of America in the summer of1996, then I doubt we will see a time inthe foreseeable future when we couldmake this system work.It is for that reason that our Gov-ernor has announced his support forthis program. It is for that reason ourlegislature has passed its own versionof welfare reform, building on impor-tant demonstration projectsin ourState which have tested out what isgoing to be required in order to makethis new system achieve its objective.I stated candidly that this is a billwhich is far from perfect, and whichhas some flaws. That presents, as I be-lieve the Senator from Pennsylvaniajust stated, the agenda for our actionin the future. I suggest two areas inwhich I think that attention should befocused. One of those is on the basic fi-nancial arrangement between the Fed-eral Government and the States. Westart this in a period of prosperity. Weknow the business cycle has not yetbeen repealed. There will be timeswhen wewillreturntothecir- cumstances of the early 1990's, when wehad unemployment rates ranging from7.4 to 8.3 percent. We need to relook atour financial relationships to assurethat we have the flexibility, the elas-ticity in order to protect States duringthose downturns.We need to also look at the issue offairness of allocation. I continue to bedistressed at the fact that we are usingthe old method of allocating Federalfunds, the formula that we developedfor the system we are now rejecting aswe move into the new system. I suggestthat is inappropriate, an inappropriatebit of baggage we are carrying with usand it is going to be a heavy piece ofbaggage, in terms of achieving the ob-jectives of moving people from welfareto work, particularly in States such asArkansas. which start this process asvery low beneficiary States and aretherefore restricted in the amount offunds they will have available.The second area in which I believe weneed to focus our attention is on theissue of legal aliens. It confounds me asto why legal aliens were brought intothis bill, which has, as its title, welfarereform. That has very little relation-ship with the severe cutbacks in bene-fits for legal aliens. These are our par-ents and grandparents ofjust a genera-tion or two ago, who came to thiscountry seeking the freedom of Amer-ica. Now, those who have followedthem in that 200-year quest for thosevalues of America. we are now puttinginto a second-class status. There is norelationship to the goals we are tryingto achieve in welfare reform. It has alot to do with the fact this is a voice-less, vulnerable population, from whichCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwe can seek some additional resourcesin order to meet our budgetary goals.Let us be clear. this is a budget issue,not a welfare reform issue as we speakof legal aliens. And it is going to be amajor budget issue for those commu-nities which have sizable numbers oflegal aliens who will now become anunpaid charge to the local public hos-pital. So that area will also require ourattention.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I con-clude by saying itis with a leap offaith that we undertake this initiative.I think we are doing it at a time whichgives us the greatest hope and expecta-tion that faith will be justified.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Sen-ator SIMPsoN is next. I believe he hasasked us for 10 minutes? Up to 10 min-utes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming.Mr.SIMPSON.Mr.President,I thank Senator D0MENICI, always, forhis courtesy, his kindness and his gen-erosity in what he does for all of us;and to recognize once again how hardhe works. And. also. Senator EXON, whocame here to this body when I did. I donot think anyone realizes the task ofthe chairman and ranking member ofthe Budget Committee and what theydo. Through the years I have watchedwith awe, as they deal with every sin-gle issue that confronts us and do itwith a steadiness and skill that is envi-able. I do mean that.I think we have a good measure here.Ithascertainlybeen through thegrinder. We have all looked at it care-fully. There is nothing new in it. I sup-port it.I served on the Finance Com-mittee.I listened to the hearings. Itried to add my own dimension of ac-tivity and support to it in its passage.So I commend those who have workedso hard on this issue. I commend thePresident who has indicated he willsign the bill.There are some troubling things inthere for me. One especially, because Idid not have any real active participa-tion in it, and that is with regard tothe benefits to legal immigrants of theUnited States. There is a great dif-ference between an illegal immigrantand a permanent resident alien. Weshould not be making distinctions onpermanent resident aliens. in my mind,to the degree here. I did not participatein any aspect of that because I felt itwould detract from what I was tryingto do with legal and illegal immigra-tion\u2014which we have dealt with. andlegal immigration. which we did notdeal with.Next year, when legal immigrationgoes up from 900.000 to 1 million people,the people of America will wonder whatwe did in this Congress. But I think wewill deal with the issue of illegal immi-gration. We are not far from resolvingthat.August 1, 1996MENTAL HEALTH PARITYMr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let mejust say I am deeply troubled the con-ferees for the health insurance bill have apparently decided to not includeany form of mental health parity onthe final bill.In April,68 Senatorsvoted aye on an amendment by D0MENICI and WELLSTONE thatwould prohibit health plans from dis-criminating against people who havemental illness. This amendment wasnot a sense-of-the-Senate proposal orsome meaningless resolution. We doplenty of those in this place. They al-ways come back to haunt us, but we dothem all the time\u2014sense-of-the-Senatethis, sense-of-the-Senate that. That isnot what this was. It was a real piece oflegislation.It was real legislation that expresslyprohibited health plans from imposingtreatment limits and financial require-ments on services for mental illnessthat are not also imposed with respectto physical ailments.It was deeplygratifying to me personally to see somany Senators cast a rollcall vote,clearly on the record,\" in bipartisansupport of ending this terribly unfairdiscrimination.It is discrimination, that is what itis. We talk about that all day in here.If there is ever a more blatant form ofdiscrimination, I do not know what itis. To think we still carry such a stig-ma in society of mental illness is darkages stuff.So 3 months later, I am absolutelystunned that we are unable to gain sup-port for the Domenici-Wellstone com-promise which represents a very mere\"slice,\"\u2014aminusculeslice\u2014ofthe original amendment that received 68votes.All this compromise would require isthatmentalhealthparity\"be achieved with respect to annual pay-ment limit caps and lifetime caps.I think it is rather curious that theconfereesrejectedthiscompromise,held tough for so long and. at the sametimetheyacceptedanothercom- promise on medical savings accountswhich received only 46 votes on theSenate floor, and I am one of the 46who voted for medical savings ac- counts.I am pleased we were able to workout an agreement on that aspect of thebill. but I certainly must question whythe same spirit of cooperation was no-where to be found when the issue ofmental health was considered.I am especially troubled that some ofthe special interest groups\u2014boy, havethey been sharpening their fangs inthis session of the legislature: I havefelt a little of it\u2014have been so aggres-siveinlobbying againstthis com-promise. To say that this small meas-ure of parity is too costly is absolutelyutterly absurd. As Senator DO?vNICIpointed out, this entire bill is a man-date. To single out this one lone lonelymental health provision and label it asa costly mandate when the whole thing August 1, 1996is a mandate is a classic example of ab-surdity and discrimination. Yes I willusethe term one more time.Sadly,that is what this debate is nowall about. Discrimination is surely notsomething new to those who sufferfrom mental illness. I say to my col-leagues. They have had it for a life-time. and the stigma hangs and it isdemeaning and it is wrong. It is notsomething we should accept without agood fight.I have deepest admiration and re-pect for ny friend Senator KASSE-BAUM. She too came here when I did. Iwould certainly hate to see her workproduct injured or disrupted, but I re-spectfully urge my colleagues to con-sider what we are doing. and I hopeSenators DOMENICI and WELLSTONE willwork toward some other result, and Iwill work with them in that objective.Itis time to rid ourselves of thistragedy of stigma and discrimination.To see the business community dowhat they have done with regard tothisissue deserves closer attentionfrom all of us on this and other issuesof the day where they apparently feel agreat strength surging through theirmuscles and they do things they neverdid before. We will address that atsome future time, too.I certainly respect those who haveworked so hard to bring this about andwill certainly give my full energies toseeing if we cannot get a better result.I thank the Chair.Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Mexico.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr.President,I thank Senator SIMPSON. I think he willjoin me in saying. as both of us talk tothe business community about whatthey have done here, we want to ac-knowledge that some very good busi-nesses in America already have decidedto cover mental illness, and none of ourremarks are directed at them. Thereare many self-insured and otherwisewho are doing a good job of consideringthis discrimination.I thank him for his remarks.PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ANDWORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILI-ATION ACT OF 1996\u2014CONFERENCEREPORTThe Senate continued with the con-sideration of the conference report.Mr. EXON. Mr. President. I yield 2minutes to the Senator from Alabama.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alabama.Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, 1 week ago. I voted for the welfare reform leg-islation that passed the Senate. Pre-viously,Ihad supported two alter-natives\u2014one a Democratic version andthe other a bipartisan alternative. Al-though boththese attemptsfailed, some of their provisions were adoptedinto the bill that passed, making if farbetter by providing a wider safety netfor children and the poor.The conference report before us nowis not as good as I would like. It prob-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEably is not anyones ideal plan for wel-fare reform. Frankly. I think the Sen-ate's version was preferable to thisconference report. But, while some pro-visions within the legislation are stilltroubling and need to be reworkeddown the road, at least we are off to a'good start in reforming a system thatwe all agree to a good start in reform-ing a system that we all agree is bro-ken and needs to be overhauled. Onething is certain: regardless of its short-comings. this bill is a product of sin-cere efforts to end the harmful depend-ency and other severe short-comingswhich currently exist in our welfaresystem. Throughout this debate andthesedifficultnegotiations.Ihave been impressed with the diligence, te-nacity. and honesty which Membershave displayed in trying to come upwith an acceptable plan to end welfareas we know it.The measure weareconsideringtoday does, in fact, represent a changein philosophy in how we think aboutchildren and families. This is the mostsignificant and sweeping change in thesocial compact of our Nation since theNew Deal. Its strength is that it over-hauls our welfare system without theharshness of previous bills that havebeen vetoed. The two vetoes, alongwith the threat of a third, served thepurpose of eliminating the extrememeasures that made the previous billsunacceptable\u2014even harmful.For example, we have now rightlyrecognized that a mother with youngchildren who wants to work will haveaccess to adequate child-care. Also among its vast improvements is thefact that child nutrition programs,such as the school lunch program. arenot block granted. The same is true ofthe Food Stamp Program. I had gravefears that block-granting these kindsof nutrition programs would imposetremendous burdens on States like Ala-bama, which over the years has suf-fered from several periods of budgetproration and economic recession. Pro-grams like these aimed at helping chi.1-dren and the poor would have faceddrastic cuts if they had been block-granted.This measure raises the cap on thecontingency fund from $1 billion to $2billion to provide States with moreprotection during economic downturns.It also adds a new trigger mechanismbased on the food stamp caseload. It in-cludes some provisions for States to es-tablish objective criteria for deliveryof benefits and to ensure equitable andfair treatment.This welfare reform legislation. whilenot as sound as the Senate-passed plan.is still a vast improvement over theRepublican bills which were vetoed. AsI stated earlier. I still have some res-ervations surrounding certain provi-sions contained in the measure. But Ibelieve. overall. that the positive out-weighs the negative. I think the com-promise we have struck is a major stepin the right direction. and an overallpositive effort at making welfare moreS9387of a helping hand in getting people ontheir feet economically.Our debate over the last few monthshas been both constructive and produc-tive. We now have a bill before uswhich is a testament to the Congressand its leadership\u2014majority and mi-nority. In essence, it is a product of theCongress' legislative process workingas it was designed to work.We have seen some hard-fought bat-tles and witnessed significant changesfrom the original bill after some in-tense debate and good-faith negotia-tions between the two sides of theaisle. Each side has made concessions.while holding firm to certain core prin-ciples. We have arrived at agreementson several major issues. As a result, wenow have a bill that contains strongerwork provisions and that is not asharsh on children. While there are un-doubtedly problems still remaining inthe legislation that will have to be ad-dresseddown theroad,thiscom- promise is an overall positive step forreforming welfare,reducing depend-ency. and offering a brighter future formillions of American families.Mr. President, except for the bal-anced budget constitutional amend- -ment,this welfare reform bill is argu-ably the most important legislation wewill tackle in this or any other Con-gress. There is no doubt that our cur-rent system is failing welfare recipi-ents and taxpayers alike. I am pleasedto join my colleagues and the Presi-dent in taking advantage of this his-toric opportunity and enacting reformswhich will empower recipients to breakcycles of dependency. to focus on workand responsibility. and to become suc-cessful and productive citizens.Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. Irise today to talk about this importantissue before us\u2014perhaps the most im-portant initiative undertaken by the104thCongress\u2014welfare reform.For the last nineteen months. Congress hasbeen embroiled in an enormous debateover how best to reform our welfaresystem. There has been a lot of talkabout ending welfare \"as we know it',but for the most part. it has been justtalk and no action. Today. however.the Senate stands close to passing leg-islation that I believe will make themuch-needed changes in the way ourwelfare system operates.I think many of my colleagues onboth sides of the aisle. as well as a ma-jority of my fellow Montanans, wouldagree that our welfare system needsimproving. I am glad we agree thatchanges need to be made in our welfaresystem so that our assistance programsare more effective and less costly. Let'sface it, however. we don't need this leg-islation to know that the welfare sys-tem has failed miserably. The truth is,the system is not working as it was in-tended\u2014as a temporary assistance tohelp people until they can get back towork. Over the last thirty years. thesystem has become a way of life, notbecausethosereceivingassistancedon't want to work, but because the S9388systemmakes it tough, even discour-ages people, to get off welfare.Although we all know that this billbefore us today will not solve all theproblems with the current welfare sys-tem, it does take a giant step towardreversing years of failed social welfarepolicy. This bill will end welfare as away of life for many Americans. By re-quiring most able-bodied adults to goto work within two years and by put-ting a five-year limit on welfare assist-ance, we are making great strides for-ward in putting people back to work. Ihave to believe that most people wouldrather work than be on welfare. And itpleases me to no end that the toughand real work requirements containedin this bill will get folks off the welfareroles and into a productive job, jobtraining program or community serv-ice. There is no doubt there will be ex-ceptions, but the goal of welfare reformis independence, not government reli-ance.This bill also contains provisions tostrengthen families and personal re-sponsibility, something I think is es-sential to getting at the root of ourwelfare problems. In a scant few dec-ades, we have seen the demise of fami-lies and family values in our country.And illegitimacy rates are rising to al-most dangerous levels. These are thethings that are contributing most tothe decline in our society. More andmore children are growing up withouta father, without a solid family to sup-port them, and crime statistics showthat kids who are raised without a fa-ther commit more crimes. I think ourwelfare system, though designed to as-sist folks and born of good-hearted in-tentions, has served to fuel some of thesocial problems we face today. It isclear that our present welfare systemencourages young mothers to havechildren, and many of those childrenare not being cared for. Though it isimpossible to legislate, this bill takes agiant step forward in addressing theseproblems by encouraging families tostaytogether,providingmorere- sources for child care and enhancingchild support enforcement and domes-tic violence measures.Perhaps the fact that is most impor-tant to me personally, by passing thisbill we will give the states flexibilityto design programs that will work bestfor their residents. Currently, the Fed-eral Government has so many rules andregulations that when States want totry something innovative to reform thewelfare system, like my home State ofMontana, the barriers are often timestoo great. Over the last 7 years, I havespoken with the folks who administerthe welfare programs in my State andtime and time again they ask for theopportunity and flexibility to run thewelfare system as they see fit. And byblock granting funds to the States andletting States set many of their ownprogram rules, this bill will allow thedecisionmaking to be done at the stateand local level, not by Washington bu-reaucrats. There is no doubt in myCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEmind this will serve both our Nationand,specifically.the people of myState well. After all, Montanans doknow what is best for Montana.The bill does all this and will stillsucceed in reducing welfare spendingby roughly $55 billion over 6 years.Given our Nation's budget problems,thats an important fact.I realize that there are many Ameri-cans, including a number of folks inMontana, who have serious concernswith this legislation. Folks seem to beparticularly troubled by the possibilitythat this bill will actually increasepoverty and fails to provide a nutri-tional \"safety net\" for our Nation'sneedy families. I appreciate and under-stand these concerns\u2014no one wants topush more children and families intomisery. In fact. I have been an ardentsupporter of nutrition programs in thepast, especially those for children, andI have made every effort to protectthem throughout the current welfarereform process.The realityis,however, that theAmerican taxpayer is not getting hismoney's worth when it comes to manyof the current assistance programs andthe tragic state of the welfare systemmakes reforming the system all themore urgent. What's more, there havebeen those who have suggested thatthis bill is heartless and out to punishchildren and immigrants. In responseto those who would make such accusa-tions. I would join with many of mycolleagues in asking if the current wel-fare system is not already punishing\u2014evendegrading\u2014childrenandother folks it is supposed to help? Why do weinsist on protecting, or at least not re-forming, a system that promotes a cul-ture of dependency and poverty? As forthe immigration provisions containedin the bill, perhaps Senator SAWFORUMsummed it up best when he noted thatas we become the retirement home forthe rest of the world, the taxpayers ofthis country are picking up the tab. Tothat end, the goal of this welfare re-form bill is not to punish, favor or dis-criminate against anyone or any group.Itsintentisnotto promote andstrengthenthesystem.Itiscon- structedtoendthecycleof generational dependency and irrespon-sibility promoted by the current wel-fare system.Mr. President, we have a historic op-portunity today to change a systemthat has consistently failed poor Amer-icans. I want to thank the Governorsand all of those who have worked sohard, in both parties, to bring this leg-islation to this point. Iparticularlywant to commend the Republican lead-ership for leading the way on thisissue. Though Bob Dole may not bewith us on the Senate floor today, Ialso want to thank him for his effortsand dedication in ending welfare as weknow it.I also want to congratulatePresident Clinton on his announcementyesterday. Though the President hasresisted real welfare reform by castingtwo vetoes on similar bills in the past,August 1, 1996he has realized that the American peo-ple want this bill and that bipartisancooperation is needed to reform thisbroken system. And with the over-whelming bipartisan support in theHouse yesterday, it looks as though weare seeing our way clear to bring aboutthe much needed reforms with what Ibelieve will be the right kinds of re-sults. -Inclosing, Mr. President, it was al-most exactly 1 year ago\u2014in fact, it wasAugust 9,1995\u2014thatI stood on thefloor of this esteemed chamber andspoke about how much I was lookingforward to the upcoming welfare re-form debate. I spoke about how excitedI was to see some real changes in howAmericans perceive welfare, how wel-fare is paid out, and the direction ourcountry was headed. There were a num-ber of goals then that I was looking forin welfare reform legislation. Would itpromote and strengthen the family?Would it give more flexibility to theStates, allowing each State to design asystem that best suits their needs?Would it include strong work require-ments to get folks back into the work-place? Would it address our growingproblem with illegitimacy and teenagepregnancy? Mr. President. I think wehave addressed these issues with thislegislation.It is now a year later. During thistime, a number of differing opinionshavebeenoffered\u2014suggestionsput forth\u2014on how best to achieve thesegoals. It has been a very slow processindeed\u2014but I think that most of uswould agree that welfare reform is stillvery necessary and this bill does that.Business as usual was not working inAugust 1995 or even in November 1992,and it is not working now. All Ameri-cans deserve the chance to succeed.whether they are poor or not. I .thinkthis bill gives all of us the chance to dojust that. Let's not squander this op-portunity.I yield the floor.Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I willvote for this bill because maintainingthe status quo is unacceptable. Theother alternative is to do nothing. Ivote for this bill, having reservations,but believing it is the right thing to do.We Democrats have made 36 impor-tant improvements in this bill thatprotect the most vulnerable, the chil-dren. But there are still yellow flashinglights, warnings regarding the bill'ssafety net for children. We will need tomonitor them closely.On balance, though,Ibelieve thepoor and the taxpayers will be betteroff because we are voting for this bill.We all acknowledge that our currentwelfare system does not work. It hasfailed to move people from welfare towork, and has created a culture of pov-erty that has ensnared generations ofour most vulnerable citizens in povertyand dependency. I believe in the capac.ity of people to better their lives andbuild a better future for themselvesand their families. The current welfaresystem does not provide people with August 1, 1996the tools they need to do that. Welfareshould be a way to a better life not away of life.The current welfare system is dys-functional and destructive to the poor.I have worked to change that. I havefought for a plan, which I helped towrite, that was firm on work and de-manded responsibility from those whofind themselves on public assistance.but that protected children.I will vote for this bill because it isgreatly improved over the original Re-publican bill which the Senate debatedlast year. There are some 36 improve.ments in the bill. improvements whichI fought for and which are drawn large-ly from the Democratic alternative billwhich I co-authored with Democraticleader Senator DAScHLE and SenatorBREAtJX.Our Democratic alternative providedpeople with the tools to move fromwelfare to work. It demanded work ofall able-bodied adults. It removed thekey barriers to work\u2014such as lack ofadequate child care and inadequate jobskills. Our bill ensured that no childwould go without health care or ade-quate nutritional assistance because ofthe failings of their parents. It ensuredthat when we aimed at the parent wedid not hit the child.I am proud of my work on the Demo-cratic alternative bill. I am proud thatwe gained the support of every Demo-cratic Member of this body. I regretthat it was rejected by the other party.But thanks to the persistent advocacyof our Democratic leadership, of whichI am a member, many of the provisionsof the Democratic alternative wereadopted in the bill that the Senatepassed. They are now in this legisla-tion. These improvements have helpedto make this a more acceptable bill.I'm particularly proud of my role infighting for child abuse programs, forchild care health and safety standardsand for the health care safety net. I of-fered amendments on these issues andfought for their adoption.From day one.Iinsisted that wecould not do anything in this bill tolessen our commitment to fighting child abuse. I am pleased that this billno longer includes provisions whichwouldhave replacedFederalchild abuse and protection programs with aninadequate block grant. As a formerchild protection worker. I know howvital these programs are for takingcare of children who have suffered fromabuse or neglect.Ifought to keep current Federalchild care health and safety standards.Along with Senator DODD. I offered anamendment to restore those standardswhich the other party was prepared toabandon. I fought to maintain thosestandards becauseIbelieve stronglythat parents should have every assur-ance that when they place their chil-dren in child care, they will be pro-tected from infectious diseases, fromunsafe buildings and playground haz-ards. and that the child care workerwill know basic first aid. This is a sig-nificant improvement in the bill.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEI also fought for a health care safetynet for children. I wanted to make surethat children would still be eligible forMedicaid coverage even if their parentsfailed to meet the work requirementsof this bill. This bill contains the pro-vision I fought for to ensure that chil-dren will still have access to healthcare.I was an energetic and enthusiasticadvocate for other improvements tothe bill, such as the provisions to pro-vide funding for child care, to exemptmothers with infant children from thework requirements. and the provisionthat ensures that a mom with a pre-schooler cannot be penalized for notworking if she can't find or afford childcare. These are all important measuresto protect children, and I am pleasedthat we were successful in having themincluded in this bill. The protectionsfor children are significantly betterthan in previous bills we have consid-ered.So I acknowledge that this bill hasbeen improved in important ways fromthe conference report that I opposed:and which the President vetoed lastyear. And I believe the strong supportfor the Democratic alternative bill iswhat made these improvements pos-sible.While I will vote \"yes\" today, thereare yellow flashing lights that give mepause. They must be monitored me-ticulously. And all of us who vote forthis bill must be prepared to makemodifications if the safety net for chil-dren and the working poor becomestattered.A key yellow flashing light for me isthe bill's changes in the rules for thefood stamp program. Changes in the ex-cess shelter deduction could harm theworking poor\u2014those families that payover half their income for housing.Other changes will severely limit foodstamps for adults without children wholose their jobs. Another yellow flashinglight for me is the bill's restrictions onassistance for children of legal immi-grants, who have not yet obtainedtheir goals of citizenship. Another yel-low flashing light for me is the bill'sprovisions for meeting the needs ofchildren whose parents reach the 5-year time limit for benefits and still donot have work. I fought for a require-ment that States must assess and meetthe basic subsistence needs of thosechildren through vouchers or othernon-cashassistance. The conferenceagreement did not include what I advo-cated. but it gives States the option touse their title XX, social service blockgrant funds, to provide vouchers tomeet the needs of children.Mr. President, today we must facefacts. We cannot make the perfect theenemy of the good. And so I will votefor this bill. The American people andI want welfare reform. And I believethe people currently mired in poverty.who have not been well-served by thecurrent welfare system, deserve better.There are over 9 million children cur-rently on welfare. Under the currentS9389system, that number is estimated togrow to 12 million in 10 years. We oweit to those children to give their par-ents every incentive to leave welfarebehind and to lift themselves and theirfamilies out of poverty.I will vote yes today. But I will bestanding sentry and will be in the fore-front in fighting for any changes need-ed to prevent the safety net for chil-dren from being tattered.Mr. HELMS. Mr. President. futurehistorians are likely to regard this as amomentous occasionin Congress\u2014awelfare bill is finally about to be ap-proved by Congress and signed by thePresident\u2014a bill which will effectivelydrive a nail in the coffin of the GreatSociety.This welfare reform bill proposes toset welfare policy on the right course.Itrequireswelfarerecipientsto work;It promotes family and the workethic; andIt exercises sound fiscal responsibil-ity.In addition, this legislation will in-sist that illegal aliens must not receivewelfare and that non-citizens cannothereafter lawfully receive most Federalwelfare benefits during their first 5 years in the United States.These legislative goals are tough. butfair. Requiring welfare recipients towork provides the hammer that canbreak the cycle of poverty and depend-ency. As matters now stand. the aver-age welfare recipient stays at the pub-lic trough for 13 years. This bill re-verses that folly: it proclaims for all tohear that welfare must not be a way oflife.Equally important. Mr. President,this legislation is fair to taxpayers be-cause it saves $55 billion of taxpayers'money. The average American workerin 1993 paid $3,357 in taxes just to sup-port welfare recipients. Taxpayers aresick and tired of working hard, payingtaxes and watching folks on welfare geta free ride.Mr. President. the taxpayers can bethankful that this bill contains toughwork requirements for food stamp re-cipients. On several occasions, includ-ing during the conference, I took the.position that Congress should requireable-bodied food stamp recipients go towork before they receive free foodstamps.The original Senate welfare bill al-lowed recipients to receive free foodstamps for 6 months every year with nowork requirement. Now, Congress issending a bill to the President that willrequire food stamp recipients to work20 hours per week for an average of 11months per year or be thrown off thewelfare rolls. This is a giant step for-ward from current law which givesfolks a free lunch at taxpayer's ex-pense.Mr. President, when the liberal poli-ticians pushed through their welfaresystem more than 30 years ago. theAmerican people were assured thatwelfare would not become a way of life. S9390Andwhen Lyndon Johnson signed thewar on poverty legislation in 1964. hepromised. The days of the dole in ourcounty are numbered.\" Unfortunately.30 years after this war began. the dayshave numbered to about 11.680\u2014andwe're still counting.Since Congress obediently embarkeddown the road called the Great Soci-ety, the result has been the most mas-sive Federal spending in history, in- creased poverty and untold millions ofAmericanstrappedinthewelfarecycle. The Great Society has been amonumental failure, but it got a lot ofpromising politicians elected becausethey promised everything to every-body. But with the enactment of thebill, the days of the Great Society arecoming to a close.The cost of welfare programs has nowreached a budget-busting $345 billion ayear. During the past three decades,welfare spending has cost the Americantaxpayers $5.4 trillion. It may come asa surprise that welfare programs havecost 70 percent more than the waragainst Germany and Japan in WorldWar II.What. Mr. President. do we have toshow forthese exorbitantexpendi- tures? An increase in the poverty rate.As of 1993. 15.1 percent of Americanswere in poverty, compared to 13 per-cent in 1964, a 2-percent growth.Mr. President, the human devasta-tion caused by rising illegitimacy ratesand the breakdown of the family iseven more troubling than the cost ofwelfareprograms.Governmentpro- grams of any magnitude carry withthem acargoofunintendedcon- sequences. in welfare, like most otherthings, you reap what you sow. For 30years, the welfare system rewardedidleness and illegitimacy and there hasbeen a marked increase in both.Mr. President. I emphasize that no-body is opposed to helping those whoare less fortunate. Americans. as indi-viduals and communities, have a re-sponsibility to help those who cannothelp themselves. That responsibilitycannot and should not be abdicated.But we must help them by teachingthem to'help themselves\" as Presi-dent Kennedy once stated.This legislation will help those onwelfare because it restores the Amer-ican work ethic which once was one ofthe cornerstones of this Nation. in ad-dition. this bill takes a step in theright direction in helping reduce therising illegitimacy rates by providingfunds for abstinence education, and byallowing States the option of denyingbenefits to welfare recipients who al-ready have children living on the pub-lic dole.An Associated Press poll showed re-cently that 69 percent of Americansfavor a 5-year limit on welfare pay-ments. Likewise, most Americans obvi-ously don't think it's right that work-ing people are required to give up asubstantial percentage of taxes to sup-port people who refuse to work.Mr. President. the majority of Amer-icans are calling for welfare reform.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEWelfare entitlements must be replacedby limited handouts conditional onself-improvement and work.Mr. ROBB. Mr. President. I rise tosupport the welfare reform legislationpending before this body. I do so withboth reluctance and hope.My reluctance stems from some veryreal concernsIhave with this bill.First. I am concerned that we fail togive States the resources they need todo the job right. I am willing to paymore in the short term to bring abouteconomic independenceinthe longterm. Second, like the President. I amextremely uncomfortable with both thelevel of cuts to the Food Stamp Pro-gram and the severity of the restric-tions on legal immigrants. We cannotsimply abandon our obligation to pro-tect the most vulnerable among us.And, finally. I am troubled by specificprovisions of this bill\u2014like the onedealing with mothers with young chil-dren who do not work because theycannot find child care. The conferencelowered the age from 11 to 6\u2014and thisis wrong. Mr. President. If we wantmothers to move from welfare to work.we have to ensure they have child carefor their young children.Iwill vote for this billbelievingstrongly that it is not our final wordon welfare reform. And I'm prepared towork with the administration and withmy colleagues here in the Congress toaddress the concerns that I have\u2014andthat I know others have\u2014with this leg-islation.But. Mr. President. like the Presi-dent of the United States. I also believestrongly that the opportunity before usis one we cannot let slip away. We sim-ply cannot allow another generation ofAmerican children to fall victim to awelfare system that fosters dependencyrather than opportunity, that has be-come for far too many children, not asecond chance, but a way of life.I will vote for this bill. Mr. Presi-dent. because I believe it contains theincentives needed to bring people outof poverty and into the economic main-stream.It contains tough work re-quirements. time limits on benefitsand nearly $4 billion in new money forchild care. It protects health care forcurrent populations and allows Statesto use Federal money to provide non-cash vouchers for children whose par-ents meet the time limits.It emphasizes work and responsibil-ity.It includes a strong communityservice component, which teaches boththe value and the obligations of citi-zenship.But I know, Mr. President, that allthe positive incentives in the worldmean nothing if there are no jobs atthe end of the line\u2014and that the bestsocial policy of all is economic growth.That is why I believe that the firstedition of welfare reform was approvedby this Congress in 1993 with the pas-sage of the President's deficit reduc-tion plan. We can approve legislationtoday that aims at moving people fromwelfare to work because we do soAugust 1, 1996amidst a strong. vital economy. In lessthan 4 years. our economy has createdover 10 million new jobs\u2014most of themin the private sector\u2014and we have thelowest unemployment rate in 6 years.As we bring down our deficit, we en-hance our ability to invest in our peo-ple. And as we strengthen our econ-omy. we provide new avenuesof oppor-tunity for poor Americans to enter theeconomic mainstream.We cannot just give incentives tomove people from welfare to work, Mr.President. We have to also better in-vest in programs that give them thetools to succeed\u2014programs like edu-cation and job training.Mr. President.I have outlined myreservations about this bill. and I amcommitted to working in the comingmonths to remedy these concerns. Butmy hope for this bill transcends theability of individual mothers to ex-change a welfare check every monthfor a pay check.For every time a welfare recipientearns a living wage, at least one morechild in America sees their role modelgo to work in the morning, earn a sal-ary, pay their bills, believe a littlemore in their own ability and self-worth, and live in a world that is infi-nitely stronger because they contrib-ute to it.And every time a welfare recipientearns a living wage. at least one morechild in America escapes from whatcould become a cycle of dependencyand hopelessness thatisinherently unAmerican\u2014and which we have an op-portunity and an obligation to break.Although only history will tell forsure, I will vote for this bill because Ibelieve it is the first step in breakingthe cycle of poverty which has sappedthe optimism and the opportunity oftoo many generationsofinnocent American children.Mr. President. I thank the chair andI yield the floor.Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President. as we endthe debate on the welfare reform con-ference report, I would like to makeseveral acknowledgements of effort inbringing forward this truly historiclegislation.First, I want to congratulate Chair-man DOtvi\u20acNICI and Chairman ROTh andthank them for their leadership. Aschairman of the Agriculture Commit-tee. I am pleased to have been a part-ner with them in crafting this bill.I also want to thank my staff on theAgriculture Committee for their ef-forts throughout this 104th Congress tomake welfare reform a reality. Staff di-rector Chuck Conner. as always, con-tributed strong leadership. Dave John-son and Beth Johnson worked tire-lessly to develop proposals that bothmeet our budget goals and continue todeliver assistance to the needy.They were assisted ably over the pastyear by Bill Sims, who has returned tothe U.S. Secret Service. Special thanksare also due to Joe Richardson of theCongressional Research Service, whoseknowledge of the very complicated nu-trition assistance programs was invalu-able. August 1, 1996Thelegislativeprocess thatcul- minates hereinthe Senate todaysometimes seemed like a rollercoasterride with no end. Frustration and longhours were common for my staff. Butthey have my sincere thanks for theirefforts. They should be very proud ofthis landmark bill.In the final analysis. this welfare re-form legislation represents the best ofour democratic process. After much de-bate, a proposal of potentially monu-mental importance is about to be ap-proved overwhelmingly by a Repub-lican-led Congress.and a DemocratPresident will sign it.I hope we willsomeday be able to look back at thisbill as a major step toward restoringthe public's confidence in the ability ofits elected leaders to respond to ourNation's pressing needs.Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the billbefore us represents a historic oppor-tunity to change and improve the wei-fare system in this country. Today'sWashington Post headline proclaimsthat this bill represents a \"basic shiftin philosophy\" about welfare in thiscountry.It is true that this bill sends a strongmessage.That messageis:welfare should not be a way of life. We are say-ing that welfare should be a safetynet\u2014a fIrst step toward achieving inde-pendence and self-reliance.But this is not a major change fromthe way most Americans view the wel-fare system. We are a compassionatenation, and we accept our responsibil-ity to help those who are less fortu-nate, who are on the bottom rung ofthe economic ladder, and those\u2014espe-cially children and the elderly\u2014whoare unable to help themselves. Thisbasic notion is embedded in our socialpolicy,and thisbilldoes not\u2014cannot\u2014change that fundamental view.Our task in drafting this bill has beento ensure that the safety net will al-ways be there for those families need-ing assistance to get over a temporarysetback.I will vote for the welfare reform billtoday because I think we need to makesome changes in our welfare system. Ibelieve that this bill represents a sig-nificant improvement over last yearsconference report, which I opposed be-cause it did not provide an adequatesafety net for poor children. Specifi-cally, this bill does not include thedeep levels of cuts in child nutritionprograms or an optional block grantfor food stamps. It permits States touse Federal money to provide noncashassistance, or vouchers for children.And it preserves a national guaranteefor access to health care for pregnantwomen and children.This bill also takes the right firststeps toward encouraging and reward-ing work. It requires welfare recipientsto work after receiving benefits for 2years. and backs up that requirementwith the support families need to movefrom welfare into the workplace.The bill provides $4 billion more forchild care and maintains strong healthCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEand safety standards for day care. Itgives recipients flexibility to use someof their time on assistance to get theeducation they need to find and keep ajob. The bill also gives States moreflexibility to use Federal dollars to cre-ate new jobs for welfare recipients, andpreserves the earned income tax creditfor working families. AU of these pro-visions work together to give welfareparents the support they need so theycan afford to leave welfare and enterthe workplace. When combined with.the minimum wage increase that Ihope the Senate will approve in thenext few days, it is a significant movein the right direction for America'sworking families.While I have reservations about theblock grant approach presented in thislegislation, the bill does take steps toensure that States will follow throughon their obligation to spend Federalwelfare dollars to move people up andout of poverty. Most importantly, werequire States to maintain a signifi-cant portion of their own contributionsfor welfare programs. While the main-tenance-of-effort provisions are not asstrong as I would have liked them tobe, they are a major improvement overlast year's bill.One of the most important parts ofthis bill is its tough child support pro-visions. Nationwide, only 18 percent ofchild support cases referred to Stateagencies for coUection result in pay-ments by the absent parent. Yesterday,the President pointed out that, if everyparent paid the child support theyshould, we could move 800.000 womenand children off welfare immediately.This bill takes the necessary steps tomove us toward demanding responsibil-ity from both parents, and I whole-heartedly support this effort.Having said why I am voting for thebill, let me now explain that I remainconcerned about some of its provisions.One specific area that we will have to.adjust with follow-up legislation is thebill's change to the rules for determin-ing eligibility for food stamps. The billrepeals a provision that would havehelped families who are forced to pay ahigher-than-averagepercentageof their income for shelter and heatingcosts. In my state of North Dakota.heating costs take a big bite out ofevery family's income. For a poor fam-ily. this can mean choosing betweenheat and food. The excess shelter de-duction that was scheduled to go into,effect next year would have gone a longway toward eliminating the need forthat painful decision, and I intend towork to see that provision restored inseparate legislation.We must also address a punitivemeasure that denies food stamps toAmericans who are looking for buthave not been able to find work. The.conference bill places a 3-month limiton the receipt of food stamps by joblessadults between the ages of 18 to 50. I am certain that each of us knowssomeone\u2014a brother, an uncle, a cous-in\u2014who is out of work, has been look-S9391ing for work every day. but has notbeen able to find ajob because no workis available. In rural North Dakota, un-fortunately, we are not creating a lotof jobs, and finding work may takemore than 3 months. It is simply mean-spirited to deny an unemployed personfood assistance while they are lookingfor work, and I will work to fix that.Despite thes& concerns, this bill is.on balance, a responsible bill. It movestoward achieving the right balance ofpersonal responsibility and giving peo-ple the tools they need to move up andout of poverty. I will support this billtoday, and I will work to fix thoseareas that need improvement.Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased thatwe are here for this final step in theprocess of ending welfare as we knowit. Just yesterday, President Clintonmade clear that he will sign this con-ference report. After weeks of obfusca-tion,PresidentClintonfinallyhas made clear that he will act on hispromise to end welfare as we haveknownitandsignthisdramatic change in the welfare system. After allwe have been through in the last 18months, I have to admit that I was be-ginning to feel like a broken record.We passed2different welfarebills under the able leadership of formerSenate majority leader Bob Dole. Inboth cases, the President vetoed thoseefforts.From the President's most recent re-marks, apparently out hard work haspaid off and he is finally going to ap-prove our efforts. Interestingly, DougBesharov, a resident scholar at theAmericanEnterpriseInstitute,and known expert on the welfare program,says that the new bill is not signifi-cantly different from the 2 previousproposals. A Washington Times articleof yesterday quoted Mr. Besharov assaying,\"Thisbusinessabouthow much' improved is a certain amount ofpolitical rhetoric.\"In my judgment. Mr. Besharov isbeing kind in his remarks. This bill, infact, is significantly the same as pre-vious efforts.In the last 30 years we have spentmore than $5 trillion to fight the waron poverty. Unfortunately, we havelost. The child poverty rate in our na-tion is .8 percent higher than it is waswhen we started this process 30 yearsago. So what have the families on wel-fare gotten for their difficulties? Andwhat have the taxpayers gotten fortheir money? For all we have invested,we have made no progress.Clearly, something is not working.The reconciliationbillbeforeus takes a new approach to an old prob-lem. it restores power and authority tothe States to create their own systemsto meet the needs of low-income citi-zens.Iowa is a perfect example of success.Iowa overwhelming passed legislationin April 1993 to change welfare in theState.In order to implement theirplan. the State had to seek 18 initialFederal waivers and more since. Al-though the State wanted to implement S9392astatewide program, in order to obtaintheir initial waiver, they were requiredto have a control group of 5 to 10 per-cent who would remain under oldAFDC policies.In October of 1993, the work incen-tivesandfamilystabilitypolicy changes were implemented. At thattime, there were over 36.000 families re-ceiving assistance, with an averagemonthly benefit of over $373.Last week I received the latest Statefigures. Iowa's caseload is down 12.6percent to under 32.000 families. Theaverage monthly benefit is down 11.7percent to $330.In January 1994. Iowa implementedits personal responsibility contracts. Afamily commits to pursue independ-ence and the State commits to providesupports.BeforetheStateimple- mented reform, only 18 percent of Iowawelfare families had earned income.The most recent numbers show thatover 33 percent of all welfare familiesare earning income now.With Iowa's success as a backdrop, itis easy to understand why States wantwelfare reform, not waiver reform.Another reasonisthe frustrationStates feel when seeking a waiver.Though PresidentClintonhasex- pressed glowing support for the Wis-consin welfare waiver it has not beensigned. If the President is for the Wis-consin waiver, why can't he approve it?Even yesterday during his CNN inter-view, the President challenged otherStates to follow Wisconsin's lead in re-forming their welfare system. Onceagain we see him saying one thing anddoing another.The reconciliation bill before us alsoprovides for a lifetime limit of 5 yearsfor welfare benefits. This means thatthere is an actual measurable end sothat parents are held accountable fortheir choices.When working Americans do notshow up for work, they are not paidand are likely to lose their job. Theywant welfare recipients to live with thesame reality. Taxpaying Americans donot understand why their hard work issubsidrzing those who are not working.Mr. President, again. I want to saythat I am pleased that the Presidenthas finally agreed to sign this con-ference report. I think this is an his-toric effort on the part of Congress andit is appropriate for him to sign thislegislation.I look for-ward with anticipation towhat our outstanding Governors andState leaders will do with the freedomand responsibility we are entrusting tothem.Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President. I willvote for the welfare reform conferencereport. I do so with grave reservationsabout many specific provisions.Like President Clinton. I think thecuts in nutrition programs are too deepand they can and should be corrected.Like President Clinton.I am con-cerned about the treatment of legalimmigrants\u2014people who followed therules and came here under our legalCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEimmigration laws. Many have contrib-uted in numerous ways to their com-munities.They aretaxpayersand workers who. like all of us, may be-come ill or unemployed. This bill slamsthe door on them to a variety of pro-grams in a manner that is neither ap-propriate nor necessary.There are other provisions of thefinal bill that I feel are too harsh andshould be changed.But the overall effort at reformingthe current welfare system is one thatI support.When I campaigned for the U.S. Sen-ate in 1992, I said then. and I continueto strongly believe, that if people canwork, they should work. The focus ofthisbillisto encourage people towork, rather than remain on welfare. Isupport that goal.I also believe that the States shouldhave more flexibility to design pro-grams to meet the needs of their resi-dents.I do not believe that detailedprescriptions from Washington, DC arethe answer to the problems afflictingthe current welfare system.Nationwide, the current welfare sys-tem is a disaster.It keeps families trapped in poverty.It discourages self-sufficiency. It cre-ates unnecessary barriers to those try-ing to move from welfare to the workforce. It forces recipients and local offi-cials to wade through piles of bureau-cratic red-tape. It foters dependency.discouragesinitiative,and dampensthe spirits of those in need.We must do better. We must changethe status quo. We must provide a new.flexible approach that will help peoplework and get off welfare.This bill has improved dramaticallyfrom the original Republican proposalof last year. Many of the draconianprovisions have been dropped.The Medicaid safety net has been re-stored for vulnerable children, the agedand disabled. Child care funds havebeen significantly increased and effortsto roll back Federal health and safetystandards for child care were defeated.Attempts to dismantle the food stampprogram and child protection programsfailed. The effort to impose a familycap\u2014a penalty for having a child whenon welfare\u2014was rejected by a biparti-san majority in the Senate. Mainte-nance of effort provisions were re-tained. helping to assure that Federaldollars do not simply replace State dol-lars.There are other provisions of the billthat I am disappointed about. I am dis.appointed that the conference agree-ment did not include an important im-provement made during the Senate de-bate which expanded the educationalactivities that welfare recipients couldtake part in. In addition, the bill is toopunitive on mothers who cannot workbecause of lack of affordable child care.There are vast areas that should havebeen improved.I believe that those of us who votefor this measure have an obligation towatch closely asitisbeing imple.August .1, 1996mented to make sure that it works.works fairly. and that if changes areneeded, they are enacted. I am deeplyconcernedabouttheoppositionof many individuals whose opinions I re-spect. I share their concerns that in aneffort to get able-bodied adults to enterthe workforce, we do not inadvertentlypunish innocent children.But we are faced with the choice ofsupporting this bill or maintaining thecurrent system. I vote to change thesystem.Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise instrong support of the welfare reformbill.Iapplaud the bipartisan effortthat has taken place to end welfare aswe know it, but most importantly I ap-plaud the efforts of the former major-ity leader, Senator Dole for his effortsin helping to shed some light on theproblem of Americas children living inpoverty.Mr. President, the most vital invest-ment that we can make in America'sfuture is our children. If there has beenany one single pledge that I have madeto the people of Tennessee. it was thatI would spend my \u00e7ime in Washingtonworking tirelessly to protect the Amer-ican family but most importantly ourNations children.In the real world, beyond the Wash-ington Beltway. everyone knows thatthe real investment and sacrifice on be-half of children is not made by govern-ment do-gooders. educrats. Members ofCongress, or social workers. The realinvestment and sacrifice is made byparents.Mr. President, few in Washington un-derstand this fact more than I do. Asthe father of three young boys, it is mybelief that we should not be asking thequestion \"what should the Governmentdo for our children?\" Instead our ques-tion should be \"what must we do to getparents to do more?\" I strongly believethat our children do not need moreGovernment spending but a mother anda father who care about them.My RepublicancolleaguesandI pledged to return to families some-thing more than a program or a slogan.We have tried to return resources tofamilies, rather than the Federal Gov-ernment, to help them in raising theirchildren. Our devotion to our Nation'schildren is demonstrated in our agendaof strengthened families, safer streets,and stronger communities. Our agendahas included:A balanced budget that saves tomor-row's generations from crushing debtlevels\u2014because of Washington spend-ing. each child born this year alreadyowes more than $187,000 just to paytheir share of interest on the debt.A $500-per-child tax credit to ease thepressures on families and allow parentsto spend more time with their kids.Adoption reforms. including an adop-tion tax credit,to make adoptionsmore frequent, less expensive, more se-cure, and designed to make it easier toplace children in loving homes.Tough crime legislation to protectour childrenfrom violentcriminal predators. August 1, 1996Welfare reform that lifts families outof poverty and into work, provides forchildcare,introduces the toughestchild support enforcement standardsever considered by Congress. and realreform that reverses the destructive ef-fects of the $5 trillion War on Povertythat has failed so many of our children.Education reforms which empowerparents. teachers, school boards andthe local communities instead of theWashington bureaucracy. This includessolid reforms which would enable low-income parents to send their childrento quality public, private, and religiousschools.Unfortunately, our efforts to enactmuch of these pro-family items hasbeen stymied by the President's veto orthrough filibusters here in Congress.The President vetoed the $500-per-childtax credit, thus refusing to ease the fi-nancial burden that so many familiesfeeltoday, a financial burden thatoften results in parents spending lessand less time with their kids. ThePresident has vetoed a balanced budg-et. a budget which would have giventhe children of Tennessee freedom fromthe repercussions of Washington's de-structive spending habits.Right now, because of the traditionalWashington habit of spending now andpassing on the bills to future genera-tions, your children and my childrenwill face a lifetime tax burden of morethan 80 percent. Imagine that\u2014morethan three-quarters of their incomewill be taken away to pay for the debtswe have left behind. That to me istruly immoral. That is why I workedtirelessly last year to pass a balancedbudget, the first balanced budget in al-most 30 years. A balanced budget wouldhave put a stop to reckless Washingtonspending and would have allowed us topay our bills\u2014not pass them on to ourgrandchildren. The bottom line is: a balanced budget helps to secure a bet-ter future for our children\u2014and thePresident vetoed it.Mr. President. my Republican Col-leagues and I understand that manychildren are trapped in poverty or fail-ing schools, with little hope of achiev-ing a better life than their parents.During the past year and a half, wehave made it our priority to lift thelives and hopes of these children. In ad-dition to lifting the crushing debt bur-den, we must recognize this immediate.abusive, and destructive threat to thelives of America's children: the liberalwelfare state.Nothing punishes single parents andchildren more than the current welfaresystem. Our Federal Government is fix-ated with a system that is riddled withperverse incentives which discouragework and marriage while encouragingillegitimacyandlong-termdepend-ency. Designed as a system to helpchildren, our current welfare systemhas ended up damaging and abusing thevery children it has intended to save.Consider the facts:Between 1965 and 1994. welfare spend-ing cost taxpayers $5.4 trillion in con-stant 1993 dollars.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThere are 77 overlapping welfare pro-grams to assist Americans officiallydesignated as poor.Total welfare spending in the UnitedStates, in 1993 exceeded $324 billion. Ofthis spending. 72 percent is Federal and28 percent is State. About 90 percent ofall State welfare spending is on feder-ally designed welfare programs.The cost of the war on poverty hasbeen some 70 percent greater than theprice tag for defeating Germany andJapan in World War II, after adjustingfor inflation.Welfare spending is so large it is dif-ficult to comprehend. One way to makeit more tangible is to recognize that.on average, the cost of the welfare sys-tem amounted to $3,357 in taxes fromeach household that paid Federal in-come tax in 1993.A final way to assess the growth inwelfare spending is to compare it tothe increase in spending on other gov-eminent functions:Since President Johnson launchedthe War on Poverty in 1965, means-test-ed welfare spending by Federal, State,and local governments has grown morerapidly than spending on allother major government functions.In 1965, the United States spent 17cents on welfare for each dollar spenton national defense. By 1993, this hadrisen to $1.11 on welfare for each dollarspent on defense.In 1965, the United States spent 29cents on welfare for every dollar spenton primary. secondary. and post-sec-ondary education by all levels of gov-eminent. By 1993, the United Statesspent 91 cents on welfare for every dol-lar spent on education.Even if the analysis is restricted towelfare spending on cash. food. hous-ing. and energy programs, the trendsare virtually identical. Since the be-ginning of the War on Poverty. means-tested cash, food. housing. and energyprograms have grown more rapidlythan defense, education. or Social Se-curity.After $5.4 trillion has been spent onwelfare there remains little to cheerabout. The onset of the War on Povertycoincided with the disintegration ofthe low-income family and the rapidincreaseinillegitimacy.Overall,30 percent of American children are bornto single mothers. We have spent moremoney on welfare programs since 1965than on all the wars we have foughtthis century. yet people are poorer and,more dependent than ever.These are just a few of the ways thatFederal Government's welfare policiesand social programs are actually work-ing against the American family andour children. I believe that we have aresponsibility to provide a safety net\u2014helping those who, by no fault of theirown. have fallen on hard times. It isthe right thing to do. But when we helppeople who are able, and yet make noeffort to help themselves, we destroythe individual and undermine the veryprinciples of jersonal responsibility inwhich our society was founded on. Andthis is what has happened.S9393It is clear that our Great Society na-tional urban policy has not helped peo-ple. It has destroyed them. It has notkept families together.Ithas torn.them apart.It has not turned theurban areas of America into shiningcities on a hill, it has made them warzones where residents live in fear. Ourinner cities should be a symbol of whatis right about America. Unfortunately,they have become examples\u2014dying ex-amples\u2014of everything gone wrong withgovernment policy.Mr. President, this bill changes thatharmful government policy.I firmly believe that most of Ameri-ca's children are being raised in loving.caring families that struggle every dayto ensure that their children have achanceatachievingtheAmericanDream. But I also know that many ofthese same families arefilled withguilt. at not spending enough timewith their kids because both parentsmust work to make ends meet. WhileWashington cannot alleviate these par-ents'guilt\u2014the104th Congress hasacted to ease the tremendous pressuresand burdens on struggling families.Too many single moms are near pov-erty because their child support checksare nowhere to be found. Just sincePresident Clinton was elected, 175,000women,mostly single moms, haveslipped into poverty. Through the ef-forts by my colleagues in the Houseand the Senate, this welfare reform billholds fathers accountable fortheir child support, putting inplace thetoughest \"deadbeat dads\" provisionsanywhere in the country. We increasedchild care funds by $4 billion over cur-rent law in order to help single parentsmake the successful transition fromwelfare to work. Our children are suf-fering from the current welfare state.We must reverse this trend. to makewelfare a helping hand, not a way oflife.Changing the welfare system willhelp children. Encouraging families tostay together will help children. Put-ting welfare recipients back to workwill help children. Restoring the workethic will help children. Improving thequality of local education will helpchildren. Encouraging spirituality willhelp children.Spending more on the current brokenWashington welfare system will nothelp children. It's time we take awaythe blindfold and accept reality. Wehave to rebuild parents. families. andcommunities, but you can not do itfrom inside the beltway. It has to bedone at home; in school and at church.Mr. President, the most importantthing that we as a nation can do forour children. does not come from theCongress or even the White House.Rather, it must come from within allof us\u2014a commitment to read to yourson or daughter. a commitment to at-tend church with your child and fam-ily. coaching your son or daughter'slittle league team, and becoming in-volved in the education of your son ordaughter. Mr. President, our childrenare the future of this great country. S9394Iurge my colleagues to vote for thishistoric bill.I yield the floor.Mr. PELL. Mr. President. when thewelfare reform bill was before us lastweek, I said that I could not let my de-sire to vote for reform cloud my judg-ment about the bill, and about the seri-ous flaws which I perceived in it. Thebill has been returned to us from con-ference with some of those flaws rem-edied, but alas not all, and the omis-sions to my mind are determinative.And so once again, I shall vote againstthe bill.I am especially concerned about thebill's undeservedly harsh treatment oflegal immigrants. I note with dismaythat nearly half of the $56 billion thatwould be saved by this bill comes fromthe denial of benefits to people in thiscategory. More often then not, legalimmigrants are hard-working. tax pay-ing individuals who deeply appreciatethe freedom and opportunity of U.S.citizenship, which they hope to attain.To deny them so many of the benefitsthat they might legitimately need asthey build a life here, seems unfair andunjustified. While I applaud PresidentClinton's assurance that this grievousflaw in the bill will be corrected by fu-ture legislation, the provision amountsto justice denied, here and now, and Icannot bring myself to vote for it.I remain concerned, moreover, aboutthe practical consequences of ceasingto treat welfare as an entitlement andreplacing it with block grants. Butwhat this means is that this Nationwill cease to respond to anyone ingreat need, as a matter of right, andthat some people in need may be cutoff simply because we have shifted thisserious national problem to the States,and we have done so without providingthem with adequate support to addressthe problem.I am particularly con-cerned that some States, including myown State of Rhode Island which hasjust enacted a new welfare program,may be penalized if they choose to havea welfare program which is relativelymore liberal than the Federal law.Also troubling is the retention ofcuts in food stamp spending, projectedat roughly $24 billion over 6 years. Un-employed workers without childrenwill be hard hit, as will legal immi-grants.Finally, I continue to be deeply con-cerned about the plight of children. Isimply cannot believe that eliminatingan entitlement which ensures that allpoor children get the food, clothing,and shelter that they need can move usindividually or as a society down thepath we all want to go. While some im-provements were made in conference,the fact remains that children will bethe ones most vulnerable to the vagar-ies of variable State welfare programs.Mr. President. it is with real regret.then, that I cast ano\" vote on thiswelfare reform legislation. I recognizethat the bill achieves many importantbroad objectives which are clearly de-sired by the public at large\u2014includingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEwork requirements, time limits on ben-efits and job creation incentives. Butlooking at the final product, I cannotsay that what we have before us is bet-ter than what we now have. The bill is.as the Senator from New York (Mr.MOYNIHAN] reminded us \"radical legis-lationwithunforeseeable.con- sequences.' Better to rejectit now than try to make up for its deficienciesin the future.Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is theunderstanding of welfare conferees re-garding the reconciliation billthat that bill exempts electronic benefitstransfers from coverage of the Elec-tronic Funds Transfer Act. The Depart-ment of Agriculture is empowered toestablish regulations which will pro-vide some protections against recipi-ents' loss of benefits through electronictransfer systems. We encourage the De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices (HHS] to develop similar regula-tions which will require procedures tominimize the losses of benefits for aidto families with dependent children re-cipients. It is also the conferees' under-standing that nothing in this bill inany way prevents or discourages HHSfrom promulgating these essential reg-ulations.Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today wetake the first big step in ending the eraof big government. Today, we send thestates the authority to design theirown programs for the needy. We moveone step further away from the one-size-fits-all approach that comes froma Federal bureaucracyfar removedfromindividualstateenvironmentsandconstituencies.Thisbillcom- pletely changes the very nature of wel-fare from one of endless individual en-titlement to One of temporary assist-ance and personal responsibility.This legislationis the result of atruly bipartisan process.I want tothank my colleagues for their work incrafting a compromise that can be sup-ported by a majority of both parties.I also want to congratulate the Presi-dent for joining this effort. While weall wondered whether, after vetoingwelfare reform twice in the last year.he would sign this measure, I am de-lighted that he has announced his sup-port for this bill.I commend him forthis decision. This is a great victoryfor Congress, for the President, for theStates, for the taxpayers, and, aboveall, for the needy families of America.Do we know exactly what will happenafter this bill is passed? No. No one isblessed with that kind of omniscience.The current system provides an excel-lent illustration of the uncertainty ofthe future. The current system waswell-intentioned at its inception. Noone was deliberately trying to create acycle of dependency or despair for beneficiaries who much too often foundthemselves locked into the system.However,thecurrentsystemhas turned out to be just that, destroyingthe very spirit of those who are receiv-ing benefits. Through hindsight, we cansee that the approaches taken in theAugust 1, 1996current system have not, do not. andwill not work. It has been a near totalfailure despite its worthy intentions.We have learned from this experi-ence. We have not crafted this welfarereform proposal out of whole cloth. Wedid not simply dream it up. We re-viewed the findings of academics; weheard hours and hours of testimony; wepoured over statistics; and we listenedto our constituents.The result welfare system builton a new paradigm\u2014a 'can do\" philos-ophy that must be infused into recipi-ents and administrators alike.In designing a new approach to as-sisting the needy, we have looked tothose programs that are successful inmoving people to work and helpingthem become independent. The Stateshave been moving in this direction andhave been designing innovative andsuccessful programs for several years.My own State of Utah is in the thirdyear of asuccessful demonstrationproject that has just gone statewide.The Single Parent Employment Dem-onstration [SPED) has 90 percent of thecaseload actively participating in workactivities, utilizes the use of educationand training to provide basic job skils,and has been successful in moving par-ticipantsintounsubsidized,private sector jobs. This bill will continue thistrend and allow the States to continueto design comprehensive programs toaddress their unique constituencies,needs, and resources.Mr. President. this bill is not perfect.There are several things included inthis bill that I don't agree with. Thereare many things that aren't in this billthat I think should be there. There areeven some things that I think need tobe changed. I would particularly like tosee an expansion of the use of edu-cation andtraining to provide jobskillsforlong-termemployment,changes made in the language regard-ingexistingStatewaivers,anda broader compromise on Medicaid eligi-bility to provide a level of administra-tive relief to the States.However, the core reforms containedin this bill far. far outweigh these con-cerns. This bill contains block grantsto States and gives them the oppor-tunity to design their own systems\u2014systems that will provide not only thewherewithal to transition people intojobs, such as child care, but also sys-tems that have dignity, hope, and inde-pendence as the primary goals.Throughout this debate, we heardfrom many who were concerned aboutthe effects that these reforms couldhave on native Americans. I am pleasedthat this conference report retains sev-eral provisions addressing these con-cerns. The most important of theseprovisions is the native American trib-al allocation provision. I would like tothank my colleagues for working withme to address this issue.The tribal allocation provisions inthisbillwill provide tribal govern-ments the same opportunities and re-sponsibilities as the States to receive August 1, 1996direct funding and the flexibility to de-sign their own programs based on theunique geographical and cultural needsof tribal members. This represents asignificant shift in thought and Fed-eral policy. Through provisions likethese, this legislation reinforces theFederal Government's commitment forIndian self-determination and self-gov-ernance.Mr. President, we have heard fromthe American taxpayers in no uncer-tain terms that they are tired of pay-ing for people to do nothing. Familieswho are getting up to work every dayand are still struggling to make endsmeet are tired of seeing families re-ceiving assistance with virtually no ob-ligation., to workforit.Thisbill changes all that. Under this legisla-tion, people must work for their bene-fits. No longer will beneficiaries beable to continue to receive benefits fornothing. Families receiving assistancewill now be given the resources and op-portunity to receive job training andeducation and to move into work andindependence. The legislation provideschild care and other support services tothese families.Mr. President, we have heard muchduring this debate about the childrenand about how this biil is bad for chil-dren. This biil is not bad for children.If there is a program that has beencruel to children, it is the current sys-tem. How can anyone say that a pro-gram that traps our' families in a hope-less cycle of dependency is good for andhelps children? The current systemmay throw money at the problem ofpoverty, but it does not provide a solu-tion.This biil provides a solution, a wayout of the dependency cycle. This billgives needy children back the thingsthat money can't buy\u2014hope, dignity,self esteem, and a way out of long-termdependency. The best way we can helpneedy children in the long run is togive their parents the skills and re-sources\u2014and,yes.motivation\u2014toenter and be successful in the labormarket. It can be done. Many havedone it. Many more can be successfulunder the new system of assistance andincentives incorporated in this bill.Mr. President, this bill is not the endof the welfare reform debate. Congresswill continue to review and reform pro-grams for the needy of this country.The reforms contained in this bill willcontinue to be monitored arid evalu-ated. We can even see some technicalcorrections that could be made in thenear future. I assure my colleagues andthe American people that the passageof this legislation does not signal theend of congressional interest in thewelfare programs. Passing this legisla-tion is only the first, most importantstep in a long ongoing process.Not only is this bill only the firststep in reforming the welfare system.it is also the first step in tackling theseemingly insurmountable problem of-ever-growingentitlementprogramsand balancing the Federal budget. ThisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEis not a plateau but rather a ledge onthe way to the top of the mountain.Congress must continue to look atother entitlement programs for theneedy. We must look at the MedicaidProgram, at Medicare. at programs forthe disabled, and yes. even Social Secu-rity.Without reforming these pro- grams. this country will find itself digging itself deeper and deeper into ablack hole with no way to get itselfout. But, more importantly. our citi-zens who have come to rely on theseprograms will wake up one day to findthat these programs have met with fis-cal disaster and are no longer viable.Just as important as the fiscal aspectof reforming these programs is the evaluation of the role and values of theFederal Government. We must reform..the very nature of Federal programsfrom one of dependency to one of inde-pendence and transition. I encouragemy colleagues to continue this fight.We must not stop here at the first vic-tory over big government, but rathercontinue the process of reviewing therole of the Federal Government and ofreforming those programs that areholding us back on the way to a pros-perous and secure 21st century.Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I regretthat the conferees on the welfare re-form bill have decided to report out ameasure that is short-sighted and puni-tive to children, the disabled, and legalimmigrants. I realize that the Presi-dent has indicated that he will signthis bill into law, but I have concerns,as have already been expressed by thePresident in his recent statement, withmany of its provisions.Preliminaryestimatesthatthis measure will push an additional 1.3 million children nationwide into pov-erty. Once families have reached the 5-year time limit for receiving assistancein this legislation, they will have norecourse for assistance if a poor econ-omy leave them without the possibilityof finding employment.Legal immigrants. including thosewho have been in this country for sometime already. will be prevented fromparticipatinginallFederal means-tested programs, including the FoodStamp and Medicaid Programs.This measure also cuts $23 billionfrom the Food Stamp Program over thenext 6 years. It also limits benefits forthose out of work without minor chil-dren to 3 months total in a 3-year pe-riod.This measure will cause much griefin Hawaii. The State is already at itslimit in its ability to assist those liv-ing in poverty, and the changes in theFederal law will only exacerbate a bidsituationI believe that the intent of a welfarereform bill should be to make it easierfor families to make the transitionfrom welfare to work. This bill doesnotprovideadequate resourcesfor States to provide the necessary supportfor families to do so. For these reasons,I will vote against the conference re-port.S9395However, I wish to commend the con-ferees for including in the bill that willnow go before the President importantprovisions that would: First, providechild support enforcement services andfunding to Indian tribes; second, au-thorize a State to exempt any Indiantribe from the 5-year limitation on par-ticipation for any Indian residing on anIndian reservation where the residentIndian population is 1,000 or more andwhere the unemployment rate is 50 per-cent or higher; and third, establish a 3percent set-aside for American Indiantribal governments in the child caredevelopment block grant. Given thePresident's statement of his intent tosign his measure into law. I am pleasedthat the conferees have given specialattention to the very serious needs oftribal communities.Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, in1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the fore-sight to realize that a welfare systemthat replaces real work with handoutswas doomed to fail the very individualsit was intended to assist. In FDR's ownwords,The lessons of history ** showconclu- sively that continueddependenceupon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegrationfundamentally destructive to the nationalfiber. To dole Out relief in this way is to ad-minister a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of thehuman spirit.I am pleased that America's long,costly drug addiction to the easy, in-sidious welfare drug may be beginningto end today. Destructive generationaldependency, illegitimacy, fraud, waste.abuse, and neglect soon will be re-placed with greater self-sufficiency, re-sponsibility and pride.The bill before us would change thewelfare system and the lives of manyAmericans for the better. Welfare, wasmeant to be a safety net, not a way oflife. This bill would restore the valuesof personal responsibility and self-suf-ficiency by making work, not Govern-ment benefits, the centerpiece of publicwelfare policy. I am proud to be a partof the team that has brought this his-toric legislation to the Senate and,soon, to the President's desk.Why did the welfare system fail? Thevalue of work was replaced with ahandout, instead of a hand-up. The wel-fare system eroded the American workethic. In many cases, welfare recipientstoday can sit at home and make doublethe minimum wage. Work, as my col-leagues and staff know all too well, isa character building process. For gen-erations,SouthDakotansdem- onstrated this principle, that a hard-work ethic provides for themselves andtheir families. Imagine how they mustfeel when their tax dollars are used tosupport Americans who need not work.I can tell you how they feel\u2014upset.That is why we needed workfare.Workfare may seem innovative herein Washington, but its not a new idea.Fifteen yearsago,South Dakotanssought to develop new solutions for S9396theirwelfare system. South Dakotawanted workfare. not welfare. With thereforms it has implemented. South Da-kota has succeeded in decreasing itswelfare caseload by 17percent andsaved taxpayers $5.6 million. Those re-forms. considered radical at that time,will the vision of the future for the restof the country when the bill before usbecome law. Governor Janklow firstpursued workfare in the early 1980's.and former Governor Miller and ourlateGovernor Micklesoncontinuedwith further reforms. I also want to ac-knowledge and commend Deputy Sec-retary Mike Vogel.SocialServices Secretary.Jim Ellenbecker.Denny Pelkofer, Donna Keller, Judy Heinz,Julie Osnes. and the rest of the staff atthe South Dakota Department of So-cial Services for their efforts to makewelfare reform a reality in South Da-kota. When today's bill becomes law.these innovators will have even greaterfreedom to succeed where the FederalGovernment has failed.I am pleased that the final bill in-cludes workfare amendments I had in-cluded during the Finance Committee'smarkupofwelfarereform.These amendments ensure that welfare re-cipients will put in a full workweek.just as other Americans do. in order toreceive benefits. My amendments alsoincrease the number of welfare recipi-ents who must work and tighten liberalloopholes that have allowed people toavoid real work.This historic legislation isa dra- matic turn to decentralization of gov-ernment. We are putting greater faithand trust in the states to operate theirown welfare programs. I am confidentSouth Dakotans will do better thanWashingtonbureaucrats.No longerwill the Federal Government apply aone-size-fits-all welfare system run bybureaucrats. Indeed, the Federal agen-cies responsible for welfare will bedrastically reduced. States will havethe flexibility to seek solutions and al-ternatives to welfare problems. Thisbill also would do something very revo-lutionary for the native American com-munity\u2014 it would give them the oppor-tunity to run their own welfare pro-grams. This is a great opportunity forthem to seek innovative solutions aswell. This bill is not just about chang-ing the welfare culture, but also thebig Government culture. We changeboth for the better.Workfare is not just about restoringresponsibility at the individual andState level, it is about protecting chil-dren in need. This workfare bill wouldensure that children have quality foodand shelter. This bill would increaseour investment in child care by $4.5 bil-lion and increase federal child protec-tion and neglect funding by $200 mil-lion over current law. What this billeliminates is cumbersome bureaucracyand needless regulations.We also strengthen child support en-forcement and give States new tools tocrack down on deadbeat parents. Thesereforms represent the toughest childCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEsupport laws ever passed by Congress.The past welfare system fostered ille-gitimacy and discouraged marriage andparental responsibility. This welfarereform would promote the basic familyunit, and crack down on those who de-liberately walk away from meeting theneeds of their children. More and morechildren are growing up without themoral guidance and financial supportof parents, especially fathers. This is atragedy of our time.I am also pleased the final bill in-cludes provisions I authored to crackdown on food stamp fraud and prisonerfraud. Last year.I was shocked tolearn the extent to which prisoners areable to continue receiving welfare ben-efits. The workfare bill before us onceand for all puts an end to cash pay-ments to alcohol and drug addicts inprison. It also would, reward Statesthat crack down on food stamp recipi-ents who abuse the welfare system. Al-though my home State's food stampprogram is ranked first in the Nation.each year $1.7 billion is lost nationallythrough food stamp fraud, waste, andabuse. My provision would give addi-tionalincentive to crack down onthose who abuse the welfare system. Iwant to extend my thanks to the staffat the South Dakota Office of Recoveryand Investigations, specifically MartyArmstrong. for their diligent and effec-tive work on this matter.Several years ago. President Clintonpromised America he would changewelfare as we know it. Our former col-league and majority leader. Bob Dole.made the same promise. Last year Con-gress delivered on that promise. Wepassed workfare. Unfortunately. Presi-dent Clinton vetoed that workfare bill.The President vetoed workfare again aspartof our balanced budget plan. Thanks to Chairman ROTH, SenatorDOMENICI, and so many others we didn'tquit. We produced another workfarebill.I am pleased the President hassaid he will do the right thing thistime and support this workfare legisla-tion.I want to thank the conferees fortheir quick action in approving thewelfare bill. Again. I am proud to haveplayed a significant role in this efforttoenact workfarelegislation.The workfare bill before us will end welfaredependency by requiring work andplacing a time limit on benefits. To-morrow's welfare system would encour-age people to become more self-suffi-cient and productive members of soci-ety, as was intended many years ago.Americans deserve more than a hand-out for today, they deserve the hopeand happiness that come through per-sonal financial independence and theself-realization of work. Welfare reformensures a better future for all Ameri-cans.Mr. BYRD. Mr. President. as the Sen-ate debates the Conference Report onH.R. 3734. the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Act. Senatorsare considering one of the most signifi-cant pieces of legislation to come be-August 1, 1996fore this body in the current Congress.Indeed, if this legislation is approvedtoday\u2014and the President signs it as hehas indicated\u2014this welfare reform leg-islation may be the very hallmark ofthe 104th Congress. This being said, Mr.President, it is important that all Sen-ators pay heed to the vast and complexchanges that this legislation would ef-fectuate on federal welfare policy. I in-tend to support the Conference Reporton H.R. 3734 because I believe it rep-resents a necessary departure from awelfare system that few will deny isfundamentally flawed. My overall sup-port of this legislation notwithstand-ing.I do harbor certain reservationsabout the possible effects of certain as-pects of this welfare reform initiativeon our neediest citizens. With this inmind. Mr. President. allow me to ex-plain why I believe that this legisla-tion.even withitspotentialdefi- ciencies, represents a marked improve-ment over welfare as we know it.\"Mr. President, by combining many ofthe current federal welfare programsinto a single Temporary Assistance forNeedy Families Block Grant, H.R. 3734would effectively end the federal enti-tlement to welfare assistance and givethe States expanded control over theirrespective welfare programs. Under thebill's provisions, each State must es-tablish objective criteria for determin-ing eligibility and providing \"fair andequitable\" treatment for its welfare re-cipients. In order to receive theirfullblock grant, States would have to en-force rigid work requirements for wel-fare recipients and provide adequatechild care resources to families withchildren. Moreover. H.R. 3734 stipulatesthat States, in order to receive theirfullblock grant, must continue tospend at least 75 percent of the amountthey spent on cash assistance programsin fiscal year 1995. And, importantly.H.R. 3734 would limit welfare recipientsto five years of benefits and would re-quire most welfare recipients to workat least 30 hours per week by the year2000. In addition, to protect children offamilies whose 5 years of assistancehave expired, H.R. 3734 permits Statesto use funds from their Social ServicesBlock Grant to provide vouchers forfood for children.Finally, the legislation permanentlybans illegal immigrants from receivingany Federal benefits. and bans legalimmigrants from receiving most assist-ance for the first five years of theirresidency in this country.Mr. President, having mentioned thevarious aspects of this welfare reformlegislation that I believe will improveour system of welfare, I must also al-lude to a particular provision of thebill that I believe may have unneces-sarily negative effects on many of theneediestwelfarerecipients.Specifi- cally, I am concerned about the foodstamp work requirements included inthislegislation.which would limitadults without dependent children tojust 3 months of food stamps every 3years.Unemployedlaid-offworkers August 1, 1996would be given an additional threemonths, and areas with unemploymentof ten percent or more would also begiven a waiver from the work require-ments.Nevertheless.Mr.President,these provisions represent a significantdeparture from the Senate-passed wel-fare bill, and they also embody a com-plete departure from our national pol-icy of providing our needy with themost basic safety net: food. On the sur-face, it might seem that the two ex-emptions from the work requirementprovide a safety net. Yet, the Congres-sional Budget Office has reported thatStates will not be able to create thenecessary jobs or workfare slots for in-dividuals that are likely to be sub-jected to. these new work requirements.Mr.President,theSenate-passedmeasure, like the measure before usnow, would penalize States for not cre-ating the necessary jobs or workfareprograms. However, this bill goes fur-ther than that by including provisionsthat would also punish an individualwho simply cannot find a job or aworkfare slot available. While osten-sibly intended to target those whocould work but choose not to. this pro-vision may in fact have the worst ef-fect on vulnerable individuals whowant to work but cannot find a job. In-deed,thisissuewarrantscareful watching. I believe the conferees wouldhave better served this country byadopting the Senate food stamp workrequirements.While this legislation is not perfect.it represents what I believe to be a rea-sonable attempt to restore the conceptof welfare to its original purpose: atemporary 'safety net\" for those whohave fallen on hard times. Welfare should not be a permanent way of lifefor those among us who are able towork. The cost of such misguided poli-ciesisfar greater than the dollarsspent on providing benefits to thosewho choose not to work because, intime, they foster dependence and indo-lence among recipients and their fami-lies. This argument is not new. Presi-dent Nixon. in addressing the Nationon welfare reform in 969 said, \"If wetake the route of the permanent hand-out, the American character will itselfbeimpoverished.\" Mr.President,I agreefullywith PresidentNixon'sstatement and that is why I supportthis conference report.(At the request of Mr. DASCHLE. thefollowing statement was ordered to beprinted in the REcORD.)Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President. today, Iwill be unavoidably absent from theSenate. as I am in Arkansas on a fam-ily matter. However. I feel it is impor-tant to express my support for thiswelfare reform measure and discussbriefly the reasons for my support.My concerns in the debate over wel-fare reform stem from proposals thatwould outright dismantle the safetynet in this country. For decades, theFederal Government has assumed theresponsibility to help those that can-not help themselves. The welfare re-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEform bill before us shifts much of thatresponsibility to the States. I votedagainst last week's Senate version ofthe welfare bill with the hope that 1could improve itinthe conferencecommittee. In some ways it has im-proved, in others it has not.Even so. if I were able to vote for thisbill today. I would. I am not going tosay this bill before us today is perfect.It is not. But I cannot justifS' keepingthe current system. There are more in-dividuals in poverty now than ever be-fore. I believe we have a responsibilityto seek new ways to help people helpthemselves. Our current system fails atthis task and we must recognize thisfact.Welfare as we know it has not effec-tively emphasized work or pulled indi-viduals out of poverty. I do not like allof the provisions in this bill, but I cannot support the status quo.In the past week I have heard frommany people in Arkansas about welfarereform. They know how the currentprogram works in places like LittleRock, and in Camden. in Fayetteville.and across the Arkansas Delta. Theycan see that the current program needsreform.Under this bill. States will be giventhe flexibility to reform welfare tomeet the needs of that State. Yester-day, President Clinton said that thewelfare population today is differentthan the one 60 years ago. It is alsotrue that the welfare population todaydiffers from State to State. Individualson welfare in Arkansas face differentproblems and have different strengths.than those in New York or California.This legislation will give States the op-portunity to design a welfare programunique to that State. It is a big respon-sibility we hand over to the Statestoday. I pray they act wisely.Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I risetoday to voice my support for the legis-lation upon which we are about tovote. We have been working on this billfor a year and a half and we've beenback to the draftingtableseveral times. Today. though. we're going topass this bill and we have the Presi-dent's assurance that he'll sign it. I amtruly pleased to have been part of thishistoric effort, and I want to thank mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle fortheir hard work and dedication to re-forming welfare.Does my support mean that I believeweve got the perfect bill and all of ourconcerns have been addressed? Do Ithink we've finished the job and we canforget about welfare for another thirtyyears? Certainly not. No one thinksthat this is the perfect approach to re-forming welfare. Many of us would liketo see less in cuts to food stamps: wewould prefer more support for children.Inparticular,we'reemphasizingwork in a way that we never have be-fore\u2014and let me stress that I think weare emphasizing that goal. and I com-mend the bill on that point. Even so.we're not doing nearly as much as weneed to do to ensure that jobs areS9397available for people. and that peoplehave the education and training theyneed to fill the available jobs. We'vespent a fair amount of time and energythis session talking about job training.As we all know, reconciliation on thisissue has eluded us to date. We mustaddress this issue. The first thing peo-ple need to get and hold down ajob isa good education. Too often, I think.we assume that to mean a college edu-cation. That is not necessarily true. Inthe next Congress. I hope we will renewour discussion of how to link educationand job training so that people are ableto fulfill the expectations of the jobsthat are available.Our international competitors havebeen leaders in making the importantlink between education and work. Ger-many for example, has long been amodelfor vocational education. Asearly as the sixth grade. students optfor a college-prep or vocational edu-cation program.Over and over we've said people needto get off welfare and get back to work.I agree with that. We've said 'you canalways get a job at McDonalds.' Thereare two flaws with this flippant argu-ment. One is that a person doesn't earnaliving wage atafast-foodres- taurant\u2014but we've had that debate.The other flaw with the argument isthat even the fast food industry jobsare not as available as wed like to be-lieve. A 1995 Columbia University studyof fast-food minimum wage job open-ings found that 14 people applied forevery opening. Among those rejected.14 percent hadn't found work a yearlater. What are we going to do for thesepeople? What are we going to do aboutthis problem?While this bill makes some nods inthat direction, I think perhaps its big-gest failing is it fails to recognize allthe work we need to do to get peopleback to work. So far, the necessary re-sources in education and job trainingfar exceed the available resources. Jobtraining and education are an invest-ment that will yield us incredible re-turns. Last year the Department ofEducation released a study that foundthat \"a 10 percent increase in the edu-cational attainment of a company'sworkforce resulted in an 8.6 percent in-crease in productivity. Whereas a 10-percent increase in the value of capitalstock such as tools, buildings. and ma-chinery only resulted in a 3.4 percentincrease in productivity.\" I wont be-labor this point, but education and jobtraining are issues I will continue towork on. and I urge my colleagues todo the same.I think all of us realize that it will beour responsibility to monitor the ef-fects of this bill, to improve and en-hance those provisions that seem towork well, and to revisit those provi-sions that are unproductive or fallshort of what's needed. such as thosesurrounding job training and educationthat I havejust highlighted.This bill is not perfect. Even so, thesystem we have now is not working and S9398weneed to move forward now. The billbefore us takes important steps in theright direction, andisclearly pref-erable to the welfare program we've ar-rived at after 30 years under the oldsystem.We enacted this system 30 years agoto combat poverty, and the truth is\u2014this system hasn't worked. In 1965. 3.3million children received AFDC bene-fits. In 1990, 7.7 million kids receivedAFDC benefits, and in 1994 9.6 millionchildren received AFDC. At the sametime, between 1965 and 1990, the actualnumber of childreninthe UnitedStates declined by nearly 5 million.Clearly, the current system isn't work-ing. and because of that there is strongsupport. in this country and in thisCongress to reform welfare.Furthermore, the current system hasdeveloped into one that permits, evenencourages. a lifestyle of dependence.Under the system we have now. 65 per-cent of families on welfare will be de-pendent for at least eight years. One ineight children in this country is onwelfare, and nearly one in five mothersin inner cities is on welfare. Withoutwelfare reform. millions more childrenwill grow up dependent on welfare.Under the current system. childrenwho grow up in families dependent onwelfare are twice as likely to rely onwelfare when they become adults. It isclear that for many people. welfare hasbecome a way of life.The bill before us will terminate reli-ance on Federal assistance as a way oflife. We end this reliance by terminat-ing cash assistance after 5 years of re-ceiving benefits. After two years. werequire people to get jobs. This is realwelfare reform. Time limits are un-precedented at the Federal level. Fiveyears of benefits allow adequate timefor most people to get their feet underthem and get back on the road to sup-porting themselves. But even after 5years the line is not a hard and fastone. There can be exceptions. The billallows a 20 percent hardship exemptionfor the really difficult cases. So eventhough we say \"5 years and you're off,\"even then there's some leeway.Another strength of this reform billis that it retains the Federal safety netfornutritionbenefits.One of thechanges I worked hard on in the Senateversion of the bill was the food stampblock grant. We eliminated the blockgrant option last week, and the con-ference bill retains the food stamp en-titlement.Theentitlementensures that food stamps will always be avail-ableto our most vulnerable popu-lations: children, the very poor. andthe elderly. And food stamps will beavailable even after the eligibility forcash assistance has ended. I want tothank my colleagues for joining meand voting to strike the optional blockgrant.Another difference between this billand the ones we've considered pre-viously is the money provided for childcare. This bill fulfills the Governors'and the President's request for addi-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtional child care funds, and as a resultwe'll be spending $4.5 billion above cur-rent law on child care. In addition, thebill retains minimal health and safetystandards for child care, and it main-tains a quality set-aside from childcare block grant funds so we might bet-ter focus on encouraging and develop-ing good child care for our children. Fi-nally, this bill requires that the Sec-retary report to the Congress on howchildren are affected by welfare policychange: additionally,itrequires thestates to report on their child povertyrates.If the child poverty rate in-creases by more than 5 percent, thenimmediatecorrectiveactionisre- quired. I mention all of these factorsbecause they contribute to my willing-ness to support this bill. and also be-cause they illustrate that the draftersare concerned about children and in-tend to monitor the effect of this billand follow up to ensure that we arebringing about the positive changewe're attempting to achieve.In conclusion. let me speak briefly onhow this bill will affect Vermont. I waspleased to learn that the Governor ofmy home State, Gov. Howard Dean, hasspoken positively of this bill. While heshares the concerns that many of ushave, Gov. Dean thinks that Vermontcan come out ahead under the provi-sions of this bill. Vermont is currentlyoperating its welfare program under awaiver. Not only does this bill allowthe State to continue its first-in-the-nation reform project. the Governorrecognizes that the calculations usedto determine the size of the Federalblock grants mean that Vermont willhave more money to spend on its wel-fare program.While I am on this subject, I wouldliketake a moment to voice my sup-port and praise for those states, likeVermont,that have already under-taken welfare reform through waiversanddemonstrationprojects.Iam pleased that we will allow those waiverprojects to continue.But let me urge clarification on whatIconsidertobeaconfusing andcounter-intuitive provision in the bill.Under the provisions of the bill settingforth the guidelines for the temporaryassistancefor needy familiesblock grants we have a section that givesStates the option of continuing thewaiver projects already underway. Infact. the section goes so far as to re-quire the Secretary to encourage anyState operating under a waiver to bothcontinue the waiver and to evaluatethe result of the waiver so that otherStates may make use of the valuableinformation to be gained from thesedemonstration projects.However.under thehold-harmlessprovisions of this waiver section. weseem to forgive the accrued liability ofStates that choose to terminate theirwaiver projects. Our intent. I believe isto forgive the accrued liability of thoseStates. like Vermont, that choose tocontinue their waiver projects. To takeany other stance except one that alsoAugust 1, 1996wipes those slates clean would giveStates incentive to terminate theirwaivers. States like Vermont that arealreadyconductingdemonstrationprojects should be encouraged and sup-portedintheir effortsto continuethose projects. I understand that theremay be an opportunity to revisit thatissue soon. and I urge my colleagues toensure that were creating incentivesto continue the waivers that are prom-ising. rather than offering incentive toterminate those projects.Another aspect of the bill that isvery important to Vermont is the as-surance that. as under current law,LIHEAPbenefitswill not be counted asincome for purposes of determiningfood stamp eligibility. This provision isvery important to poor people in coldregions of the country who may rely onboth LIHEAP benefits and food stampbenefits. There was a provision in boththe House and Senate bills that wouldhave forced people to choose betweenheating and eating. and I thank mySenate colleaguesfor accepting myamendment to strike those provisions.Ialso want to thank my colleagueswho worked on the conference commit-tee for working to maintain the Senatebill provisions on this issue.Mr. President. I agree with my col-leagues who say this bill has flaws. andI look forward to working with themnext year and in future years as wecontinue to work towards the properbalance between self-sufficiency andGvernment assistance. In spite of itsweaknesses, I think this is a good bill.We've worked hard over the past yearand a half to get to this point and Ithink we've made some very positivechanges that will help all Americans tobe productive and contributing citi-zens. I will be pleased to vote \"yes\" onfinal passage.Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since 1987.when I first proposed an overhaul ofthe welfare system. I have argued thatwelfare recipients should be required towork. None long years later, I am pleased that it is finally about to hap-pen.It has been a long road. I was pil-loried by many of my friends back thenfor even suggesting the idea of requir-ing work. Today, I think everyone herebelievesthatwork shouldbethe premise of our welfare system.It was unthinkable a few short yearsago. that we would limit the time thatpeople could collect welfare benefits.Today, I think that is a proposition onwhich nearly everyone here agrees.And. on the other side of the aisle, itwas just a few short months ago. thatmany were unwilling to invest suffi-cient amounts in child care so that thechildren of welfare mothers would betaken care of when their mothers wentto work.We have come a long way towardreaching agreement on how best to re-form our failed welfare system. And,much of that meeting of the minds isreflected in this bill. So, I will vote forit, althoughIbelieveit could havebeen better. August 1, 1996I would feel much more comfortableif we were here today debating and vot-ing on the Bipartisan Welfare ReformAct that Senator SPECTER and I intro-duced in the Senate and that Rep-resentatives CASTLE and TA.NNER intro-duced in the House. It was more realis-tic in putting people to work: it wasmore compassionate to the childrenwho did not ask to be born in poverty:and it was a model of bipartisanshipfrom the very beginning.Unfortunately, the Biden-Specter, orCastle-Tanner, bill is not a choice fac-ing us today. Today. we have but onechoice: this bill with its flaws or thecurrent flawed system. And, in weigh-ingthealternatives,theflawed\u2014I should say failed\u2014status quo is simply.no longer an alternative.The culture of welfare must be re-placed with the culture of work. Theculture of dependence must be replacedwith the culture of self-sufficiency andpersonal responsibility. And, the cul-ture of permanence must no longer bea way of life. I will vote for this bill.Mr. President, because it is a step to-ward changing the culture.This bill will require welfare recipi-ents to work in exchange for their ben-efits, and it will limit the amount oftime that families can receive welfare.The bill will increase our investment inchild care so that welfare mothers cango to work, and it will go after thedeadbeat dads who refuse to supporttheir own children.Finally,itwill crack down on fraud in the Food StampProgram.These areimportant andcrucial changes that need to be made in ourfailed welfare system. They have beenmy priorities in reforming welfare, andthis bill meets those goals.But, we should not fool ourselves.There will be people, many of themchildren, who willfall through thecracks because of this bill.I do not know how many. I have heard numbersthrown around on how many more poorchildren there will be under this bill.To tell the truth, no one knows forsure. But, there will be some. And, forthat, we should not brag or boast orpound our collective chests or, as oneMember of the other body did yester-day. claim that this will be great forAmerica.However. that's not a reason for fail-ing to move forward. It is a reason forwatching closely what happens as wemove forward. As this new welfare sys-tem is implemented, we must monitorit with a microscopic eye. And, I hopethe authors of this legislation will beas willing to make corrections if cor-rections are needed as many of us havebeen willing to vote for a good, but notperfect, bill.And, this is not a perfect bill. In fact,I do not even believe this is the bestbill we could have written. But. it is agood bill. And, it is time to move for-ward.Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, about IImonths ago, the Senate passed a wel-fare reform bill by an overwhelming 87CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEto 12 margin. That vote demonstratedthattherewasstrong,bipartisanagreement that the current welfaresystem needsadramatic overhaul.After almost a year of discussion relat-ing to the best way to reform the cur-rent system, it is satisfying that thesame bipartisan spirit will be presentwhen we vote on a welfare reform planfor third time.The current system, with its trade-mark entitlement programs, has beenonly marginally successful in providingfor the most basic needs of low-incomepeople, and has been a dismal failure inencouraging recipients to become inde-pendent.While we supported changes in 1988 toemphasize work in our welfare sys-tem\u2014those reforms included so manyexemptions that the incentives to workwere seriously undermined. Those re-forms did not do enough to help us dis-tinguish those who had fallen on hardtimes and needed a helping hand fromthose who simply refused to act in adisciplinedandresponsiblemanner. When welfare is a Federal entitlement,it is very difficult to make that dis-tinction.The legislation before us today willput welfare recipients on notice thattheir time on the system is limited. Weare offering them assistance with childcare, health care, and training to be-come self-sufficient. In return, recipi-ents are expected to put in time im-proving their educatiOn, participatingin training, and getting ajob to get offthe system permanently.As recipients increase their efforts tocomply with these new requirements,States must understand the respon-sibility they are accepting with theflexibility gained from the block grant.The Federal Government is ending the60-year philosophy that anyone at any-time is entitled to cash assistance.The philosophy has changed to: wewill help someone get a job and keep ajob by providing child care and healthcare for a specified period of time. Thisshift in philosophy means that the cul-tureofState welfareoffices mustevolve into the culture of a job place-ment service where the focus is getting.jobs, not mailing checks.This legislation also takes a big stepforward to reinforce the importance offamilies in society. Regrettably, toomany of our young people are growingup without two parents involved in their lives; 92 percent of AFDC familieshave no father in the home. This billrecognizes that reducing out-of-wed-lock births is an important goal. butdoes not prescribe Federal solutionsthat would hamstring the ability ofStates to try different approaches.One of the most essential ingredientsfor self-sufficiency is the availabilityof child care. By funding child care ac-tivities at almost $22 billion, Stateswill have the resources they need to de-signsuccessfulreturn-to-workpro- grams. With this enhanced fundingparents will have some assurance thattheir children will be cared for in safesettings.S9399As the President indicated yesterday,this bill is not perfect. One of my prin-ciple concerns is the impact of cuts infood stamps on the working poor. Foodstamp benefits do not extend just tofamilies on AFDC. The Food StampProgram plays an important role inhelping poor, working families makeends meet.Food stamps -are the front-line de-fense against poverty. providing a min-imum safety net of I out of every 10peoplein Maine. This program hasproven vital in improving the health ofour children and the elderly, and pro-tecting people with disabilities. Weneed to ensure that this program re-tains its vital mission: to ensure thatfamilies have enough resources to buyfood.One of the most important provisionsin this bill is the emphasis on the col-lection of child support and establish-ing paternity for children born out-of-wedlock. Child support collections con-tinue to increase across the Nation.The Republican bill includes provisionwhich will encourage even greater in-creases in child support collections. Bytaking a tougher stand to establish andthen enforce child support orders, someof the families currently tied to thewelfare system may be able to getloose.It is obvious that no one likes thecurrent system. Governors don't likeit. welfare recipients don't like it, andthe public believes that welfare pro-grams serve only those people whowant to take advantage of the system.As a result. support for antipovertyprograms has eroded drastically in re-cent years.By injecting a work ethic into ourwelfare system arid emphasizing self-sufficiency. which this bill does\u2014weare on the right track. This bill comesvery close to providing resources andincentives that will improve our anti-poverty programs. but I also hope wewill continue to work to ensure thatour most vulnerable populations areprotected.Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today theSenate will be voting to transform theNation's welfare system. Despite somechanges, I believe that the fundamen-talflaws of the Senate and Housepassed bills remain and therefore I willvote against the conference report.Childrenand low-income workingmen and women will be the victims ofthis legislation. There are already fartoo many poor children in this countryand I believe that this bill will in theend cause many more children to livein poverty. I am particularly concernedthat in Ohio alone. as many as 43,500children will be pushed into poverty bythe implementation of the bill beforeus. Mr. President, I cannot support leg-islation that would cause this kind ofharm.I have been concerned from the startthat simply washing our hands of theFederal responsibility for welfare and.turning it over to States is no guaran-tee of success. This is risky policy and S9400therewill no longer be any mechanismfor guaranteeing a national safety netfor our poorest families.I am concerned that the work re-quirements in the bill can not be met.States that do not meet employmentgoals willlose part of their blockgrants. Penalties would rise from 5 per-cent in the first year to 21 percent intheninthyear.TheCongressionalBudget Office has already reported thatmost States will be unable to meet thework requirements.This legislationlacks the necessary commitment or re-sources to help people move from pov-ertyto meaningful employment.It does not provide any specific fundingfor States to help people find or trainthemselvesforbetter-payingjobs. Rather than moving people off welfareand onto work, this bill emphasizescutting off welfare.While I support reform that promotespersonal responsibility and communityinitiatives. I cannot support legislationwhich undermines the national safetynet and reduces resources for hungryfamilies.Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, duringconsideration of the Senate reconcili-ationbill, two regardingimmigrants. section 2403(c)(1), insection 2423. section 213(A)(f)(2), werestricken because they contained mate-rial that was not under the jurisdictionof the Finance Committee. Specificallythe definitions denied all means-testedbenefits to immigrants including bene-fits subject to appropriations.TheParliamentarianalsoagreed that the provisions violated anothersectionoftheByrdrule.section 313(b) (1) (D).Section313(b) (1) (D)pro- hibits language in a reconciliation billor conference report if the deficit re-ductionis merely incidental to thelarger policy changes contained withintheprovision. The Parliamentarianagreed that since the reconciliationprocessisconfinedtomandatoryspending, expanding the scope of provi-sions to include benefits provided bydiscretionary spending was a violationof the Byrd rule.The conferees were certainly notifiedabout these rulings and the offendingprovisions were not included in theconference report.Moreover, would the Senator agreethat, when the Senate struck these sec-tions as violating the Byrd rule, theSenate's intent was to prevent the de-nial of services in appropriated pro-grams such as those that provide serv-ices to victims of domestic violenceand child abuse, the maternal and childhealthblock grant,socialservices block grant, community health centersand migrant health centers? Does theSenator agree that recipients of appro-priated funds are not forced to conductchecks on citizenship and immigrationstatuswhenprovidingcommunityservices?Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Under the Byrdrule, the budget reconciliation processcannot be used to change discretionaryspending programs. Only mandatoryspending is affected.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEMr. GRAHAM. Is this consistent withthe understanding of the Senator fromNebraska as well?Mr. EXON. Yes. As ranking minoritymember of the Budget Committee, Ihave been concerned to ensure that thebudget reconciliation process is limitedto affecting mandatory spending and isnot misused to achieve other objec-tives.Budget reconciliation'sdepar- ture from ordinary Senate rules of de-bate must be carefully limited to itsoriginal and proper purpose. Our col-leagues on the other side of the aisleshared this view when they agreed tostrike the offending provisions fromthe Senate bill.Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senatoragree that the version of the bill rec-ommended in this conference report isconsistent with this understanding?Mr. EXON. Yes. These provisionsstayed out of the bill in conference, asthe conferees sought to avoid anotherchallenge on the Senate floor thatthese provisions violated the Byrd rule.This manifests our intent to keep thisbill within the proper parameters ofbudget reconciliation.Mr.President,changesindiscre- tionary programs on a reconciliationbill, such as the ones mentioned by theSenator from Florida and the Senatorfrom Massachusetts, result in no directbudgetary savings and are therefore ex-traneous under the Byrd rule.During floor consideration of thislegislation. we struck section 2403(c) (1),and in section 2423, section 213(A)(f)(2)because they contained material thatwas not under the jurisdiction of theFinance Committee. namely many dis-cretionary programs. because they vio-lated section 313(b)(1)(C) of the BudgetAct. These provisions also provide nobudgetary savings, and violating theintent of section313(b)(1)(A)of theBudget Act. but because they werecleverly embedded in language whichdid provide direct budgetary savings. itwas difficult to fully enforce the Byrdrule. Nonetheless, it is clear that thisbillshouldnotbeusedto make changes in discretionary programs, andthose who look to interpret the actionof the Congress should take this intoaccount.Mr. President, the purpose of theByrd rule is to prevent reconciliationbills from being loaded up with provi-sions, such as these, that have no budg-etary impact. This is important be-cause reconciliation bills move in theSenate under special rules which limitamendment and time for debate. With-out the protections provided by theByrd rule, it would be far too easy totake advantage of the privileged natureof reconciliation to enact controversialitems without proper consideration inthe Senate. Allowing reconciliation tobe used in this manner fundamentallyundermines the basic nature of theSenate's rules which protect the voiceof the minority and damages the Sen-ate as an institution.For this reason. I feel it is importantto bring these provisions to the atten-August 1, 1996tion Of the Senate, and I thank theSenators for their efforts.Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, theSenate will reach a milestone in thelong and sometimes twisting journey ofwelfare reform legislation. The Senatewill pass this bill. as the House of Rep-resentatives did yesterday. The Presi-dent has told the Nation that he willsign it, and soon it will become law. Iwill vote in favor of this bill because itis a step toward ending the present sys-tem which simply does not work andreplacing it with a system which re-quires and rewards work. I wish, how-ever, that we had before us a reformbillwhichIcould wholeheartedly.without reservation, endorse and sup-port. I would greatly prefer a bill. forexample. like the work first legislationwhich contained a Federal safety netfor children and which I cosponsoredwith Senator DASCHLE and many of mycolleagues or even like the bipartisanBiden-Specter approach which I votedfor in the Senate.The bill before us is an improvementover the legislation which I opposedlast year and which the President ve-toed because, among other things, itprovides more support for child care,retains needed child protection pro-gramsandservices,includesmy amendment strengthening the work re-quirement. does not block grant foodstamp assistance, requires a greatermaintenance of effort from the States,and doubles the contingency fund tohelp States in times ofeconomic down-turn. However, it contains a number ofserious flaws. That is why it is a mile-stone and not a final destination. Itwill need repairs. As the President hasindicated, there are aspects of this leg-islation which the Congress will be re-quired to revisit. And beyond that. Ibelieve that this kind of sweeping re-form involves an element of risk. Al-though our efforts are directed towardimprovingthesystem,recognizingwithin the welfare system the principleof the value of work, assuring the pro-tection of children and reasserting theresponsibilityof absentparentsto their children. we cannot possibly besure that all the effects of such sweep-ing reform will be those intended. Forthat reason, the Congress must remainvigilant in its oversight and monitor-ing of the impacts of this legislation.We must stand ready to address nega-tive impacts. If critics are fully correctand there is a large increase in thenumbers of American children who findthemselvesimpoverished,we muststand ready to remedy quickly the de-fects in this bill.For a number of years, I have beenworking toward reform of the welfaresystem. The existing system has failed.It does not serve families and childrenwell. It does not serve the Americantaxpayer well. It was created to meetthe needs of families in hard times. Un-fortunately. for far too many. what wasintended as a safety net has too oftenbecome a way of life, a cycle of depend-ency. It is wrong to allow such a sys-tem to continue. August 1, 1996Meaningful reform should protectchildren and establish the principlethat able-bodied people work. It shouldtighten child support enforcement lawsand be more effective in getting absentfathers to support their children. thebill before us represents a constructiveeffort.The funding levels in this bill areaimed at assuring that adequate childcare resources will be available forchildren as single parents make thetransition into work. Those levels aresignificantly improved over last year'sbill. This strengthens the work require-ment because it better assures thatStates can effectively move people intojob training,private sector employ-ment. and community service jgbs. Thebill will provide the kind of flexibilitywhich the States have been asking for.Now, they must step up to the task andmeet their responsibility. If they fail,this reform will fail because it is builton the foundation of getting able-bod-ied people back to work.I am particularly pleased that thislegislationincludes my amendmentwhich I first offered last year whichgreatly strengthens the work require-ment in the bill. The original legisla-tion required able-bodied recipients towork within 2 years of receipt of bene-fits. My amendment adds a provisionwhich requires that unless an able-bod-ied person is in a private sector job,school, or job training, the State mustoffer, and the recipient must acceptcommunity service employment with in2 months of receipt of benefits.As I have said. I am deeply concernedby several provisions contained in thislegislation. I am afraid that the reduc-tions in food stamp assistance may gotoo far, although the conference com-mittee added Si billion in food stampassistance back in. Also, while somelanguage was added in the conferenceto allow States to use some fundsunder thisbilltoprovide noncashvouchers for minimum safetynet sup-port to children of families which losetheir benefits they have reached the 5-year limit on assistance. I believe suchminimum aid should be mandated. Wewill want to monitor how the Stateshandle this problem. And, I am con-cerned that the provisions included, de-nying benefits to legal immigrants, aretoo harsh. I particularly object to theimpact on legal immigrants who are al-ready in the United States and on legalimmigrants who come here, work hard,and then may unfortunately becomedisabled. As the President stated yes-terday. these provisions don't belong ina bill relating to welfare reform.I am also concerned by a provision inthe bill which did not appear in eitherthe House-passed or Senate-passed bill.Both the House and the Senate billsprohibited penalties against single cus-todial parents with children under 11years old who cannot find adequate. af-fordable child care, as determined bythe State. Inexplicably, the conferencecommittee changed that provision tolower the protected age to childrenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEunder the age of 6. Again, I think thisisa matter which Congress shouldmonitor closely as it is applied in theStates, and revisit it. soon.Mr. President. the decision on thisbill is a difficult and a close one. But,I believe we must reform the brokenwelfare system which currently servesAmerica's children poorly and servesthe American taxpayer poorly. But, aswe move forward on a bipartisan basis,we must vigilantly work with the States, to make this reform successful,to get people back to work, and to im-prove the lives of America's most vul-nerablechildren,withan on-goingcommitment that mistakes will be ad-dressed, and shortfalls will be reevalu-ated.Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President. thePersonal Responsibility and Work op-portunity Reconciliation Act of 1996moves our Nation in a positive direc-tion by reforming our current welfaresystem. Not only does it eliminate theentitlement status of welfare, but thebill requires those able-bodied recipi-ents who can work, to work. In addi-tion, the bill provides 54.5 billion morefor child care than current law, main-tains Medicaid eligibility for thosecitizens who qualify for assistance, andallows those States who are operatingunder Federal waivers to continue todo so. The child care and Medicaid pro-visions in this bill will allow welfarerecipients to better make the transi-tion to work. Also, the Federal Govern-ment, by allowing States to continuewith their innovative welfare reformprograms, will see continued successes,as in Oregon. in welfare reform.As chairman of the AppropriationsCommittee, and while currently em-broiled in the appropriations process,my experience has taught me all toowell the dire consequences of continu-ing, without change, entitlement pro-grams that we do not, and cannot con-trol. We can no longer keep spendinguntil all needs are met. These entitle-ment programs place a great burden ontheAppropriationsCommitteeand more importantly, a burden on themany other needs of our Nation.Only through a commitment to pro-viding better opportunities for thoseliving in poverty will we find a solutionto poverty. We can achieve a reductionin welfare spending while working totransition the impoverished, out ofpoverty. The recent vote in the Senateto increase the minimum wage is an in-dication of Congress' commitment toensure that in the area of employment,a minimum standard is assured. How-ever, Congress cannot eliminate pov-erty by merely raising the minimumwage. There is a cycle of poverty whichis passed from generation to genera-tion. and it is the root causes of thispoverty that must be addressed: a lackof education and access to upward so-cial, and economic stability. Educationis the key to the success of society.Citizens without the opportunity toeducate themselves, to increase knowl-edge and skills, will weaken in despair,S9401maintaining the status quo at best. Inmy home State of Oregon. the Coy-'ernors office, county commissioners,andtheOregon Workforce QualityCouncil, are only a few among manywho have worked towards improvingjob training. As a result of the effortsin Oregon, in only a few years Oregonhas reduced their welfare roles by al-most 25 percent. By progressing to-wards a seamless link amongst differ-ing human resource agencies. Oregonhas made outstanding progress in inte-gratingeducation, employment, andtraining programs. These are key linksin ending the cycle of poverty. Thus, Iam pleased to see waiver language con-tained in this bill which will continuethe welfare reform process. With thisadded flexibility Oregon will be able tocontinue its extraordinary welfare pro-gram.Mr. President, we have chosen to ad-dress welfare reform and Medicaid re-form separately: a decision which I cannot fully support. Welfare reform isan integrated effort which includes:child care, effective job training andquality health care. To end welfare aswe know it we must allow our citizensthe opportunity to climb out of thewelfare trap and become productivecitizens of our Nation. Without an inte-grated approach the entire system isplaced in jeopardy. Thus.I am dismayed that we did not reform Medicaidwhile reforming welfare. for they arean integrated pair. However, I am sat-isfied at this point to know that Medic-aid will remain intact for our citizenswho are fulfilling the work require-ments of this bill. Furthermore, I ampleased that the State of Oregon willcontinue to operate its Medicaid sys-tem under the Oregon health plan.Under the Oregon healthplan, my State has enrolled 114,000 more Orego-nians who would otherwise not havehad access to health care. The Oregonhealth plan required numerous Federalwaivers to achieve this success, and Iam hopefulthatMedicaidreform,whenever enacted, will have similarsuccess as in Oregon.Iask unanimous consent to haveprinted in the REcORDaletter from theState of Oregon endorsing this bill.There being no objection. the letterwas orderedtobeprintedintheRECORD, as fare reform waivers and the current pendinglegislation. Your assistance has made it pos-sible for Oregon to continue to improve uponits extraordinarily successful strategies tomove families from poverty to employment.Regarding the current bill, it is my under-standing that the conference Committee hasallowed states the option to detennine if.after a five-year period following enactment.qualified aliens (generally speaking. legallyresiding non-citizens) would remain eligiblefor Medicaid coverage. With this issue re-solved, the Department of Human Resources S9402issatisfied that the bill will allow the Stateto havemoreflexibility and success in help-ing Oregon families become self-sufficientthan would be possible under current law.Sincerely,GARYWEEKS.Director.Mr.HATFIELD. In Oregon, we are re-ducing our welfare roles by trainingour workers and putting people to work.Thisisbeingaccomplishedthrough a concerted effort of local.State and Federal officials striving to-gether towards a common goal of put-ting people to work. We are dem-onstrating that welfare reform is an in-tegrated system of job training, childcare,personalresponsibility,and health care.Mr.BINGAMAN.Mr.President.today the Senate will vote to changethe Nation's welfare system. While Ihope these changes will make people'slives better. I greatly fear that thesechanges will do far more harm thangood.Let me say I believe the countryneeds welfare reform, and I stronglysupport some portions of this bill. I support requiring all able-bodied re-cipients to work, turning welfare of-fices into employment offices, provid-ing adequate child care and requiringstrong child support enforcement. Thisbill achieves some of these goals, but Iam deeply concerned that it will pushmore people into poverty instead oflifting them out.I am encouraged by the President'scommitment to pursue these concernsand come back next year to proposechanges to this legislation. In fact, Iwishwehadincorporatedthose changes in this bill.I have been hopeful that this Con-gress would achieve real welfare re-form. A good billwould encourageadults to work without threatening thewell-being of children or legal immi-grants or the States that need welfareassistance most. I originally voted forwelfare reform legislation in the Sen-ate with hopes of ultimately achievingthis goal.Unfortunately,thishas nothap- pened. In the highly politicized envi-ronment in which we find ourselves, Ifear that we are trading an admittedlyimperfect system for one that mayprove to be far worse for our Nation'schildren and poor. That is why I am voting against the conference reportbefore us.I have been persuaded that this billwill hurt New Mexico. While under thisbill, States may have substantial dis-cretion on how they administer welfarebenefits, it is equally clear that theywillhavesubstantiallyless moneywith which to administer those bene-fits.I believe this bill will increase thenumber of children living in poverty inour State. Relative to other States.low per capita income states like NewMexico will suffer. According to theNew Mexico Human Services Depart-ment, the number of families on wel-fare is increasing in New Mexico\u2014fromCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEan 18.400 caseload in 1989 to 34.000 casesper month in 1996. New Mexico cannoteasily absorb fundrng cuts when thecaseloadisgrowing and theState budget is not.This bill requires progressively morehours of work, from a greater percentof each State's caseload every year.with States losing cumulatively morefunding each year they fail to hit theirtargets. While I am a strong proponentof work requirements as an integralpart of welfare reform. I am skepticalof this approach.Currently,unemploymentin New Mexico is 6.8 percent, higher than thenational average of 5.3 percent. Whilewe have experienced a recent period ofhigh job creation, many of those newjobs are concentrated in our urban cen-ters and are not likely to be accessibleto those who live in rural areas. Andwhat will happen to New Mexico in theevent of an economic downturn, whenrates of job creation are not so high?This bill provides a penalty of a 5 per-cent cutinFederal funds forthe State's block grant that will be in-creased to a maximum of 21 percent cutshould targets be missed in consecutiveyears. The National Governors' Asso-ciation ENGA] shares the concern thatmany States will have difficulty inmeeting the work requirements. Thiswill leave States with the choice ofusing State and local funds for edu-cation,training, and childcare, or throwing more people off the rolls so itwill be easier to hit their work targets.or cutting far back on benefits.The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-et Office has said that, over 6 years,this bill falls $12 billion short of thefunding needed to meet the work re-quirements of thislegislation,and about $2.4 billion short in child care re-sources. Currently, the caseload in NewMexico is growing. Who will be forcedto pick up the shortfall? State andlocal governments will.Last year in New Mexico, 239,000 re-cipients in 87,000 households relied onfood stamps. About $28 billion in sav-ings realized by this bill will be in foodstamps. Such cuts to funding benefitserode the integrity of the safety net forthose who need it most. I say againthat we are trading in an imperfectsystem for one that may prove muchworse.Our common goalisto eliminatepublic assistance as a way of life whilepreserving temporary protections forthose truly in need. We can do thiswithout denying the basic needs of in-nocent children and without drivingState and local governments furtherinto debt. I look forward to voting forthe necessary amendments to this leg-islation in the next Congress.Mr. DOMENXICI. Mr. President, I ampleased that the welfare reform con-ference report includes a suggestion Imade to the conferees.Before final passage in the Senate, Isuggestedthat wedeleteadirect spending appropriation that was in theSenate-passed bill\u2014section 2211(e) (5).August 1, 1996This provision would have given theSocial Security Administration ESSA]$300 million in entitlement funding foradministrative costs associated withwelfare reform.Although itis important to makesure SSA gets the funds it needs to im-plement welfare reform, I oppose creat-ing new entitlement spending for Fed-eral agencies. -Asan alternative, I suggested thatwe build upon a process that is alreadyin current law and which adjusts thediscretionary spending caps to accom-modate additional funding in the ap-propriations process for SSA to do con-tinuing disability reviews.I am pleased that the conferees ac-cepted this approach.Let me also clarify one issue.The language in the conference re-port provides that the chairman of theHouse Budget Committee must takeback the cap adjustment in the eventthe President vetoes the bill.For the record, we do not need thisexplicit authority in the Senate. Thechairman of the Senate Budget Com-mittee already has the authority to re-verse adjustments of this kind in theevent the legislation does not becomelaw.Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the conference reportand welfare reform.The Congress and the administrationhave worked now for over 3 years to re-form the shameful situation in whichmillions of Americans on welfare findthemselves. Parents seeking work arediscouraged from doing so by the cur-rent system. Teenage mothers languishalone in households without the sup-port of their children's fathers andoften without proper adult supervision.Welfare as we know it has allowedthese societal ills to fester and drainincreasingly large amounts of publicassistance funds. The current systemhas made it too easy for young men tofather children without assuming ei-ther the financial or emotional respon-sibilities of parenthood. For too long,society has assumed the responsibilityof caring for poor children with welfarechecks, while not placing expectationsof accountability upon the young par-ents. Too many families face the dailyburden of survival. unemployment, andsociety's suspicion of their unwilling-ness to change their situation.The provisionsof this conferenceagreement can ensure that our welfaresystem will finally reflect a respect fortwo of the most fundamental values ofour society\u2014an adherence to the Amer-ican work ethic balanced with a com-passion for those truly unable to careforthemselves.Thisbillredirects hard-earned tax dollars toward achiev-ingemploymentopportunitiesfor adults and improvements in the qual-ity of life of children.First and foremost, it eliminates thepossibility of receiving public assist-ance without any intention of makingsome kind of a contribution to societyin return. Beneficiaries will be aware August 1, 1996that from the day they receive theirfirst check, the clock will be ticking.Society is fulfilling an obligations tohelp them get back on their feet. andthey in turn are obligated to makeevery effort to receive job training oreducation and to find employment. Theemployment of parentswillenrich their children not only financially, butmorally as well. In watching their par-ents benefit from educational opportu-nities and engage in gainful employ-ment. children may embrace a valuablework ethic and eventually be betterable to free themselves from the cycle:of poverty and welfare dependence inwhich they are currently entrapped.States will also have an incentive tohelp beneficiaries find work. Welfareoffices should become employment of-fices as States strive to move recipi-ents into the work force in order toearn a performance bonus from theFederal Government.The conference bill also holds thehope of protecting children and reduc-ing welfare spending by attacking theproblem of unmarried teen parenthood.Welfare will no longer encourage theproliferation of single and uneducatedparents by automatically and uncondi-tionally underwriting the mothers whobear children out of wedlock. Childrenborn out of wedlock are shown by stud-ies to be three times more likely to beon welfare as adults than their peers.By implementing this bill, however,the Federal Government will requireStates to combat this problem andhopefully prevent itin a number ofways. First, paternity must be estab-lished for all children born out of wed-lock at birth as a condition for receiv-ing assistance, and fathers will be re-quired to pay child support and set agood example for their children by en-gaging in either private sector or com-munity service jobs. Mothers must livewith an adult parent or relative or inan adult-supervised, strictly run Sec-ond Chance Home where they can learnskills necessary to the proper manage-ment and care of a child and household.A further condition of receiving assist-ance is a commitment to educationaladvancement.'Youngmothers muststay in a school or training program asa condition of continuing to receivewelfare checks.This welfare reform bill will addi-tionally work to prevent a new genera-tion from entering into the cycle ofearly parenthood and welfare depend-ence by making it a national goal tolower teen pregnancy rates. It estab-lishes a national campaign that will as-sure the creation of teen pregnancyprevention programs in at least 25 per-cent of American communities by 1997.It includes two amendments which Iauthored with the intent of combatingthis problem. One will require the Jus-tice Department as well as the Statesto crack down on what studies show isa class of older men\u2014many of thempredatory\u2014who father the children ofyoung girls in the majority of teenpregnancy cases. The second amend-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEment requires States to reserve a por-tion of their social service block grantfunds for programs and services thateducate young people about the con-sequences of premarital pregnancy. Aswe reduce the number of teens who be-come pregnant, we will be increasingthe number of children who are able toenjoy a childhood without deprevation.There are other aspects of this legis-lation which have been framed with theprotection of children in mind. For ex-ample. minor children continue to re-ceive Medicaid even if their parentslose coverage as a penalty for not get-ting off of welfare into job training andwork. Families can also be eligible fortransitional Medicaid coverage as theymove from welfare to work. These pro-visions are vital as many parents cur-rently refrain from finding jobs andmoving off welfare for fear of losingthe medical coverage for their childrenthat welfare provides.Mr. President, this bill provides asignificant improvement over the Sen-ate-passed bill in allowing States toprovide needy children of parents whogo off of welfare with vouchers throughthe title XXblock grant. The legisla-tion also answers the all-importantquestion of who will care for the chil-dren as their mothers and fathers moveinto the world of education and work.We have designated $13.8 billion\u2014a sub-stantial increase\u2014to be spent just onchild care over the next 6 years. and wehave retained child care health andsafety standards. Moveover, we will notpenalize mothers with children underthe next 6 years, and we have retainedchild care health arid safety standards.Moreover, we will not penalize motherswith children under the age of 6 who donot accept employment because theycannot findor afford childcare.I would have preferred the retention ofthe Senate provision in this regardwhich allowed the mothers of childrenage 6 to 11 who cannot find adequate.affordable child care to stay home withthem without penalty.Mr. President, this is a good bill--agiant step forward from the welfarestatus quo\u2014but it is no more perfectthan any other bill that has passed theSenate on a big. complicated problem.I am especially concerned by the foodstamp provision which is a real breakwith what was agreed to in the Senate-passed bill. It limits the receipt of foodstamps by jobless individuals who danot have children to 3 months out of a3-year period and allows no hardshipexemptions. This is far harsher thanthe Senate provision which allowedjoblessindividualstoreceivefood stamps for 6 months out of each yearas well as a 20-percent hardship exemp-tion. Food stamps are also now cut forhouseholds receiving energy assistance.a proposal not included in the Senatebill. The conference report also cuts.the cap on the shelter deduction by $42and takes away food stamps for morefamilies with children who pay overhalf their income for housing. And I re-main very concerned about the ban onS9403food stamps. Medicaid, and other as-sistance for legal immigrants: it has no.good place in a welfare-to-work bill.As the President has urged. we mustkeep these issues in mind for repair inthe future even as we recognize thatthis legislationisdefinitely an im-provement in the current welfare pro-gram. In voting for this bill. we will re-alize an historic opportunity to meetPresident Clinton's call to \"end welfareas we know it.' We will have also prov-en to the American people that theFederalGovernmentiscapableof bringing about change through biparti-san cooperation.This is not the end of welfare reformbut itis the largest step forward wehave taken to improve the way Amer-ica cares for its poor. and tries to makereal for them the dreams of equal op-portunity. which is the driving impulseof our history.I thank the Chair and yield the floor.Mr. GRAHAM. I wonder if my col-league could address one point on thisbill.I notice that the term 'Federalmeans-tested public benefit\" was de-fined in previous versions of the bill.However, in this conference report, nodefinition is provided.Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understandingthat the Parliamentarian noted thatthe previous definitions of \"Federalmeans-testedpublicbenefit\"were broad enough to include discretionaryspending.AccordingtothePar- liamentarian, that inclusion caused thedefinitiontoviolateSection 313(b) (1) (D) of the Byrd rule, which pre-vents reconciliation legislation fromextending its scope to items that pro-vide merely incidental deficit reduc-tion, that is, discretionary programs.Therefore, when the bill was consid-ered in conference, I understand thatthere was an intentional effort to en-sure this provision complied with Byrdrule by omitting the definition of thatparticular term.In other words, then. the term Fed-eral means-tested public benefit' '\u2014if itis to be in compliance with the Byrdrule\u2014does not refer to discretionaryprograms. I would assume that pro-grams such as funding for communityhealth centers, as well as the maternaland child health block grant. would notbe impacted.Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senatorfor clarif,'ing that point.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I be-lieve our last Senator. other than theleader and myself.is Senator THUR-MOND.andhe would like 8 minutes. Wehave plenty of time. so I give him 8minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina.Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference reportto H.R. 3734. the Personal Responsibil-ity and Work Opportunity Reconcili-ation Act of J996. This legislation re-forms welfare to emphasize fundamen-tal American values. It rewards workand self reliance, promotes personal re-sponsibility. and renews a sense of hope S9404inthefuture.Additionally, the billslows ofFederal welfarespending, thusreducingtheFederal budget over 6years. The measure does provide suffi-cient increases in spending to protectvulnerable populations.This Congress previously passed twowelfare reformbills. The Presidentsubsequently vetoed those bills, despitehis 1992 campaign pledge to end welfareas we know it. I hope as we send himanother bill, that the President will fi-nally keep his pledge on this issue, andsign the bill.Mr. President. more than 30 yearsago the Federal Government declareditsWaron Poverty. Since then, thenumber of individuals receiving aid tofamilies with dependent children hasmore than tripled. Over two-thirds ofthese recipients are children. The in-crease in the number of children re-ceiving public assistance is closely re-lated to the dramatic increase in birthsto unmarried women, particularly toteenage young women. Mr. President.the War on Poverty has inflicted manycasualties.Multiplegenerationsof children have grown to adulthood, con-tinuing welfare as a way of life. Moth-ers and children have been abandoned.Families have been destroyed by long-term dependence on Government. TheWar on Poverty has been cosdy, bothin terms of human suffering and tax-payer dollars spent.Incontrast,thisreform steps to 'promote stable familiesand discourage illegitimacy. We recog-nize many children in America are vul-nerable. In response to this need, thebill guarantees they will continue toreceive the support they need. In doingso, the prospects of children in welfarefamilies are greatly improved.Mr. President, the measure before usis built on five main principles, whichI believe are supported by residents ofSouth Carolina and by the Americanpeople in general. I would like to brief-ly summarize these pillars of welfarereform.First. welfare should not be a way oflife. By placing lifetime limits on bene-fits, this bill ensures that welfare willbe temporary assistance to those whoare in need.The second principleis work. notwelfare. Able-bodied beneficiaries will,for the fit-st time ever, be required towork for their benefits. This principleis designed to restore dignity to the in-dividual and fairness to the system.Third. welfare for noncitizens and fel-ons will be limited. The bill providesadequateexceptionsforemergencybenefits, forrefugees. and for thosewho have contributed to this Nation bypaying taxes for 10 years or throughmilitary service.Fourth, the bill encourages personalresponsibilityto haltrisingillegit- imacy rates. This legislation seeks tocounter that trend by increasing ef-forts to establish paternity and enforcechild support orders. Furthermore, thebillencouragestheformationand maintenance of two-parent families.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEFinally, this legislation returns re-sponsibilityandflexibilitytothe States. The national Government hasan obligation to promote the generalwelfare of the United States. At thesame time, we know that those who areclosest to the problem are better ableto provide for the specific welfare ofneedy individuals. This bill establishesgeneral guidelines and provides broadcash welfareandchildcareblock grants. With this flexibility States candesign programs that meet local condi-tions and particular needs.Mr. President, like the two vetoedbills that preceded it,thisbill hasmany provisions that will encouragework and education, lessen dependencyon the Government, and foster an envi-ronment to reduce unwed and teenpregnancy. The legislation also ensuresthat needy Americans will receive awide range of services including cashassistance.childcare.food stamps.medical care. child nutrition. and dis-ability payments. The bill also con-tains strong provisions related to childsupport enforcement, child protection,foster care, and adoption assistance.I compliment the managers of thebill who have brought historic reformto our welfare system. This bill de-serves our support. I thank the Chairand yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Mexico.Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes offour side to Senator FORD to go alongwith whatever he has.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes on ourside to the Senator from Kentucky.Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank myfriend from New Mexico for allowingme to have a couple minutes.Mr. President, I think we need to bevery careful to put this bill into per-spective. Yes. it will modify a systemthat no one defends. Yes. it will giveStates more flexibility to deal withtheir poorest citizens. Yes. it will pro-vide more for child care than H.R. 4,easing one of the greatest barriers forthose on welfare who want to work. Allof these things are good reasons forsupporting this bill.But I find some of the predictions ofwhat this bill will do to be a bit of astretch. It is being suggested by somethat this bill will reduce the povertyrate, the illigitimacy rate. the teenpregnancy rate. the crime rate, andjust about every other kind of rate youcan imagine. We hear that this bill pro-vides dynamic opportunities for edu-cation and training arid is the oppor-tunity that people who are poor in thiscountry have been asking for.Well, I hope the strongest supportersof this bill are right. Sometimes I won-der when Ilisten to some of thesespeeches just how many poor peoplesome of my colleagues have ever met.Maybe they could come to eastern Ken-tucky. Maybe then they could under-stand how difficult it is to determineAugust 1, 1996whether a lack of personal responsibil-ity or a lack of opportunity is thegreater cause of poverty.For those of us in the middle of thepolitical spectum, this is a tough vote.When I hear some of the predictionsabout what this bill will do, I am skep-tical. I have a hard time figuring outhow it will affect my State.We have been doing some innovativethings in Kentucky with welfare re-form. We are one of the 10 States leftthat has not obtained a Federal waiverfrom welfare laws\u2014something you hearso much about in Washington today.Yet we are 1 of the top 10 States in re-ducing our welfare rolls\u2014reducing wel-fare rolls without a waiver\u201423-percentreduction since January 1993. We havetried a lot of things to put people towork. Our current Governor is lookingat even broader changes\u2014maybe thisbill will allow him to do most thingswithout having to worry about a waiv-er request. and that is a good thing.But when I talk to those in my Stateabout why our welfare rolls have comedown, the most important reason I hear about is the improvement in theeconomy. I remember how tough thevote was in 1993 on the deficit reduc-tion package. I believe that vote had alot to do with the strength of our econ-omy today. In many ways. that billmay have been much more importantin reducing welfare rolls and puttingpeople to work than the welfare bill be-fore us today.And speaking of predictions, Ire- member the predictions that opponentsof deficit reduction made in 1993. Theysaid the 1993 deficit reduction packagewould cause a recession, cost jobs. in-crease inflation, cause interest rates torise, fail to reduce the deficit below$200 billion, and shake up the stockmarket. Guess what. Mr. President?Our friends who made these predictionswere zero for six. That kind of battingaverage won't even get you in theminor leagues. Just this morning. welearned that the economy grew in thesecond quarter at an extremely strongannual rate of 4.2 percent. We have ahealthy, growing economy. and the def-icit has been cut from $290 billion to$117 billion and may go below that.These are important reasons why thewelfare rolls are down in my State by23 percent.Some of our colleagues who madethose wrong predictions about the 1993deficit reduction package are the sameones making the boldest predictionsabout what this welfare bill will do. SoI am skeptical.I am willing to support. and will sup-port, this conference report for thesteps it takes in the right direction.But we need to monitor the impact ofthis bill very carefully. About the onlything we know for sure is that it willreduce the growth in welfare spendingby about $55 billion over the next 6years. We hope it will achieve some ofthe other things that are being pre-dicted today. and at least give our Gov-ernors and Statelegislatures more August 1, 1996flexibilityin experimenting and de-signing programs which address pov-erty. I hope that we will see more suc-cess at the State level. But somehow, Iam also quite certain that as we mon-itor the impact of this bill, we willquickly find Out that this is not theend of the welfare reform debate, andthat future Congresses will find thereis much more work to be done. I thankthe Chair and yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Mexico.Mr. DOMENICI. Senator RoTh Start-ed off today following me. Since he isthe chairman of the committee thatwrote most of this, we thought it might be appropriate that he give theclosing argument. We have saved timefor him. I yield 5 minutes to SenatorRoTh.Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in theselast few minutes before we put August1,1996, into the history books as theday we end the welfare system as weknow it, I will close with a few obser-vations and some important acknowl-edgments.Last February, after welfare reformhad been vetoed twice, the Nation'sGovernors restarted today's legislationby reaching a unanimous agreement toreform welfare. Coy. John Engler ofMichigan testified before the FinanceCommittee later that month and putthis entire debate into its proper per-spective. Hesaid:Just consider the Washington Posthead- line describing what the governors' policy\u2014adopted unanimously with the support of ourmost conservative and most liberal governorand everybody in between\u2014meant.The Post headline read, \"Governors reformplan would break with 60 years of policy.\"Governor Engler went on to say:Remember what the governors propose ischanging a Law that has been the basis offederal policy for 60 years and remember howcounterproductive these policies have been.They punish parents who work too much.They punish mothers and fathers thatwant to stay together.They punish working families who savemoney.They reward teenagers who have babiesout of wedlock, and the List is longer.Mr. President, this 60-year-old wel-faresystemrewardsthebehaviorwhich leads to poverty and punishesthe behavior which leads Out of pov-erty. Yes, it is time to end this system.Mr.President,thislegislationis about personal responsibility and workopportunity. Work is not only aboutearning our daily bread. Work is an in-tegral part of the human condition. Aparents work also teaches the valuesnecessary to prepare the next genera-tion for its responsibilities.We can all be proud of our worktoday because it will make a profounddifference in the lives of millions ofAmericans.It will go down as one of the mostimportant legislative achievements notonly in this Congress. but in many,many years.This is a historic week for a historicCongress. In a matter of weeks, weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEhave moved from gridlock to winninggold medals. Welfare reform iscer- tainly one of our gold medal achieve-ments.I end by again thanking Senator Do-MENICI for his leadership in orchestrat-ing this legislation through the proc-ess. I want to extend my thanks to theFinance Committee conferees, SenatorC1-iiFEE.Senator GRASSLEY, SenatorHATCH, and Senator SiMPSON for theirextraordinary assistance and coopera-tion.The contributions of Senator NICK-LES,Senator GRAMM,andSenator SANTORUM as we moved through theconference cannot be overstated. Theyplayed key roles in assuring this legis-lation would meet all of our objectives,especially with respect to tough workrequirements.Let me compliment the majorityleader, Senator Lorr, getting this con-ference report completed. This is amajor accomplishmentinthebrief time of his leadership position.Our former majority leader and col-league. Bob Dole deserves as muchcredit for this legislation as anyone.When the tough decisions needed to bemade, and there were plenty throughthis process, he demonstrated the lead-ership we all look to.Iextend my congratulations andthanks to those Members in the Houseof Representatives who have worked sohard on this issue. It was a privilege towork with Chairmen BILL ARCHER.CLAY Siw, BILL G000LING, and TOMBLILEY over these months.I extend the thanks of everyone toboth the majority and minority staffsof the leadership, the Finance Commit-tee,especially LindyPaull,Frank Polk, Ginny Koops, Dennis Smith,the Budget Committee, and the Agri-culture Committee,fortheir work.There are too many to name individ-ually and I would not want to fail tomention anyone. I do thank each ofthem.I also extend those same thanks tothe respective staffs in the House, mostespeciallytoRonHaskins.Matt Weidinger, Cassie Bevin, and MargaretPratt at the Committee on Ways andMeans.We should remember that until a fewweeks ago, Medicaid was included inthis package, so the staffs at Financeand the House Commerce Committeewho worked on Medicaid should be rec-ognized.especially Susan Dull,the First Heinz Fellow working in Con-gress.Of course, the committee work can-not be done without the help of thosestaff members at Legislative Counselsin both the Senate and House, espe-ciallyRuthErnst.andMarkMathiesen.I extend our thanks to those at theCongressional Budget Office, especiallyJean Hearne. Robin Rudowitz, Sheila.Dacy,JustinLattice,andKathyRuffin:theCongressionalResearchService, theS9405General Accounting Office, especially,Greg Dybalski and Jerry Fastrup.Let me mention something else thatis historical about this day which has.been overlooked.I know of no other time in which con-gressional and State officials and staffshave worked so closely together on anissue.For months. Governors John Engler.Tommy Thompson, and Mike Leavitthave given so generously of their time,support, and the power of ideas. Theytruly deserve the thanks of the Amer-ican people.They have donated the talent and ex-pertiseoftheirstaffs,especially LeAnne Redick, Kathy Tobin. who alsoworked on this legislation as a staffmember of the Finance Committee. Jo-anne Neumann and Mary Kay Mantho.Mr. President. this will indeed be aday to remember. Thank you and con-gratulations to all the Republicans inthe House and Senate who stuck to ourprinciples and stuck together to makethis a reality. Together we have madea difference.Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I be-lieve we have a few moments left.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has 7 minutes and 15 seconds.Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 5 minutes,then yield the balance to our leader.While I have during the day givendeference to this being a very biparti-san effort, and while I have from timeto time and during the day said we areglad the President is going to sign thismeasure. I take a few minutes of myclosing time to thank the Republicansin the U.S. Senate and Republicans inthe U.S. House, because I think it isobvious the President of the UnitedStates came into office promising theend of welfare as we know it, and for Zyears during his administration he hadDemocrats in the Senate and Demo-crats in the House and no welfare re-form was achieved.Now, while we are glad to have thePresident saying, \"Yes, I will sign thisbill,\" I do not think it ought to escapeanyone that there would be no welfarereformif the Republicans had nottaken control of the U.S. House andthe U.S. Senate.I believe I can saythat with a degree of certainty, be-cause I worked on reconciliation billsand budget bills that called for reformfor at least 10 years and nothing hap-pened.So I say thank you to the Americanpeople who electedtheRepublicanMembers to the House and RepublicanMembers to the Senate, because to-night we celebrate a very, very signifi-cantachievement.Aswemovedthrough the Chamber of the Senatewith our efforts to get a balanced budg-et,I say to most Republicans it wastruly a difficult job to stand here andask you to vote for all those toughitems. as we moved a budget resolutiontoward balance, and a reconciliationbill, a big bill changing the law. only to,find that the President did not agree.I believe tonight the fruits of that ef-fort are going to be realized and a pro-gram that has not worked for millions S9406ofAmericans will begin to work intheir behalf, as it works for all Ameri-cans who get jobs and assume personalresponsibility. For tonight we say if 60years ago, or even 30 years ago, or even10 years ago, if we would have lookedat this program and said it is inconsist-ent with everything that is good aboutAmerica. for it locks people in povertyand denies them the interest and en-thusiasm to get a job\u2014for many, manyyears the welfare laws of America wereadministered by people who were wor-ried about the sociological problems ofthe poor.I am hopeful that across America theoffices that are helping welfare peoplewill be job training, will be jobs-ori-ented, will be talking about trainingand education, and how people can getoff welfare instead of finding ways toassure them that they can stay on.This bill is going to say most Ameri-cans work, and we are going to askthat welfare recipients work. We willgive them training. We will give themchild care. But we will say, you oughtto work because through work, you getresponsibility, and through responsibil-ity, you and your families get the joyof living.Second, simple as it sounds, we aregoing to ask parents to take care oftheir children. We stress personal re-sponsibility. I can predict that acrossthis land, as millions of welfare recipi-ents who are not working and havechildren get jobs, guess who will be thehappiest about it? Their children. Forthey do not like it any more than any-one else that they are locked in, and soare their parents, in poverty.Third, we are going to change theculture of welfare. How obvious it is\u2014had we changed this culture a few dec-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEades ago and said the principle of wel-fare is a short-lived assistance whileyou attempt to get ajob and take careof yourself, we would not have the wel-fareproblem we haveinAmerica today.Fourth, we will end the futile andcumbersome regulations of the FederalGovernment and its bureaucrats whoset such stringent requirements thatthey assume a degree of arbitrarinessthat people cannot even make sense ofgetting on and off of welfare, and thoserunning them inthe State govern-ments are constantly looking throughfive volumes of regulations to see justwhat they can do.Fifth, and finally, and this shouldnot go in any sheepish manner as if weare embarrassed to say it, we are goingto save money. What is wrong withthat? The taxpayers of America havebeen paying for a program that doesnot work. They will be paying now fora program that at least has a chance ofworking.I am very hopeful those leaders, in-cludingtheCatholichierarchyof America. who I generally talk to andseek advice from, I am hopeful thatthey understand there is a lot more towelfare reform and to tiying to helpthe poor people than to continue pro-grams that exchange money and givethem benefits, for they, too. may findthem more responsible and more inde-pendent and doing for.themselves. I be-lieve this has a chance of working, andI think when we adopt it tonight, it isgoing to be historic.I ask unanimous consent that a de-tailed analysis of the savings to theFederal budget in all categories, madeby June O'Neill, dated August 1 be printed in the RECORD.August 1, 1996There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in theRECOiD, as follows:U.S. CONGRESS.CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFIcE.Washington,DC. August 1. 1996.Hon. PETE Act of 1996. The bill would re-place federal payments under the currentAid to Families with Dependent Childrenprogram with a block grant to states, re-strict the eligibility of legal aliens for wel-fare benefits, modify the benefits and eligi-bility requirements in the Food Stamp pro-gram. increase funding for child care pro-grams. and tighten the eligibility require-ments for disabled children under the Sup-plemental Security Income program.Although the estimate assumes that thebill will be enacted by September 1. 1996, itsimpact on direct spending and revenues in1996 is estimated to be negligible. The billwould reduce federal spending by $3.0 billionin 1997 and by $54.1 billion over the 1997\u20142002period, as well as increase revenues by $60million and $394 million over these respec-tive periods. Detailed tables are enclosed.For the most part, the underlying assump-tions and methodology are described in CBO's estimates for the House- and Senate-reported versions of the bill (see House Re-port 104\u2014651 and Senate Print 104\u201459).In addition to its federal budgetary un-pacts, the bill would have a significant un-pact on the budgets of state, local, and tribalgovernments. A statement on the intergov-ernmental and private-sector mandates inthe bill is also enclosed.If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide them.Sincerely.JUNE E.

AUGUST 1. 1996 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF). The bill would require a state tocarry Out a corrective action plan if it deter-mines that the rate of child poverty in-creases by five percent in a given year as aresult of carrying Out its new program forneedy families. Depending on how this re-0\u2014591\u2014594\u2014597\u2014608\u20146180\u201457B\u2014609\u2014597\u2014608\u201461Bo3232333538\u2014634\u2014e.642\u2014634\u20143.64447217 August 1, 1996reduction in federal funding for an entitle-ment program under whichthe federalgov- ernment Spends more than $500millionannu- ally is considered a mandate only if state.local, or tribal governments lack the author-ity under that program to amend their ownfinancial or programmatic responsibilities tocontinue providing required services.The bill does not specify how this child-poverty requirement would be enforced. Onthe one hand, if a state would be allowedsimply to submit a corrective action planbut would not be required to take action toreduce child poverty, then the requirement.by itself or in combination with the otherchanges would not constitute a mandate be-cause the state would have the flexibility toreduce caseloads and benefit levels in re-sponse to the federal requirements and re-duced federal funding. On the other hand, ifthe bill would require a state to reduce childpoverty (and a mechanism was developed toenforce that requirement) then it may con-stitute a mandate when it is combined withthe funding reductions contained in the billand the work requirements.Even if the requirement is stringently en-forced, however, states may still have suffi-cient flexibility to meet all the requirementsof the bill without devoting more state fundsto the TANF program. States, not an outsideparty, would determine whether the rate ofchild poverty has increased by 5 percent. Inaddition, the majority of people currentlyreceiving Aid to Families with DependentChild (the program that TANF would re-place) are already in poverty, so that rate ofchild poverty might not increase signifi-cantly even if these people lose benefits.Child support. The bill would mandatechanges in the operation and financing of thestate child enforcement systems. The pri-mary changes include using new enforcementtechniques. eliminating a current $50 pay-ment to welfare recipients for whom childsupport is collected, and allowing formerpublic assistance recipients to keep a greatershare of their support collections. The netsavings from these mandates would exceedthe costs by $200 million to $500 million an-nually over the next six years.Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits forAliens and Supplemental Security Income.CBO estimates that the new mandates con-tained in the portion of the bill titled Re-stricting Welfare and Public Benefits forAliens would not be significant. However,the bill would reduce the size of an existingmandate. Current law requires states thatsupplement federal Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) either to maintain their sup-plemental payments levels at or above 1983amounts or to maintain their annual expend-itures at a level at least equal to the levelfrom the previous years. Once a state electsto supplement SSI federal law requires it tocontinue in order to remain eligible for Med-icaid payments. Because the bill would re-strict eligibility for SSI. primarily for aliensand disabled children, states would no longerhave to maintain their supplements for theseindividuals, CBO estimates that states couldsave roughly $750 million annually by fiscalyear 1998.Orher Titles. Two other titles of the bill\u2014Child Nutrition and Food Stamps\u2014containintergovernmental mandates, but the totalcost of the mandates would be significantlyless than the $50 million threshold.PRIVATE SECTOR MANDATESThebill contains several private sectormandates as defined in Public Law 104-4.CBO estimates that the direct cost to theprivate sector of those provisions would be$65 million in fiscal year 1997 and would totalabout $1.0 billion over the five-year periodfrom 1997 through ZOOl, as shown in the sup-port provisions of the bill include a require-ment that employers provide information onall new employees to new-hire directoriesmaintained by the states. This provisionwould impose a direct cost on private sectoremployers of approximately $10 million peryear once it became effective in 1998. Basedon data from the Bureau of the Census, CBOestimates that private employers hire over30 million new workers each year. Even so.the cost to private employers of complyingwith this mandate would be expected to berelatively small. Many states already re-quire some or all employers to provide thisinformation,sothatafederal mandatewould only impose additional costs on a sub-set of employers. In addition, employerscould comply with the mandate by simplymailing or faxing a copy of the worker's W\u20144 form to the state agency, or by transmit-ting the information electronically.Requiremenr on Sponsors of New Immigrants.The bill would also impose a new require-ment on individuals who sign affidavits ofsupport for legal immigrants by making fu-ture affidavits legally binding. This require.ment would impose a direct cost on the spon-sors estimated to be $5 million in 1997, risingto $400 million in 2001. This estimate rep-resents the additional cost to sponsors ofproviding the support to immigrants thatwould be required under the bill. The addedcosts are larger after th first three years be-cause of the new responsibility sponsorswould have to provide support after a three-year deeming period.Changes in the EarnedIncomeCredit. Fi- nally. the bill would make several changes inthe Earned Income Credit. The bill wouldmodify adjusted gross income by disregard-ing certain losses, expand the definition ofdisqualified income and index the threshold.and strengthen compliance. The Joint Com-mittee on Taxation estimates that the directmandate cost of these changes would be $60million in 1997, increasing to $68 million in2001. These estimates include only the reve-nue effect of the changes in the credit, andnot the effect on federal outlays.Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President. after18 months, we are about to pass welfarereform. It has been a long, divisive de-bate about the direction our Nationwill follow on fundamental social pol-icy. The initial bill, approved by theHouse last year. I think, by virtuallyany standard, was an extreme piece oflegislation. As a result, it enjoyed veryS9413little public support. Twice the Presi-dent vetoed extreme legislation, andthat resulted in far more bipartisan co-operation in the ensuing months,It is clear that there is a consensuson many concepts relating to welfarereform. Most of us believe the currentsystem is not working. that welfaremust be reformed, that welfare as away of life must end. There is a consen-sus about the need for work, that able.bodied people should work, that thereshould not be welfare for those who areunwilling to work. There is a consensusabout the need to allow States flexibil-ity and a recognition that South Da-kota is different from New York anddifferent from California. There is aconsensus that the lack of child care isa major barrier to work, that Statesneed to provide adequate funds to helpparents afford it, that the current lawwith regard to health and safety stand-ards must be maintained and even im-proved, and that child care needs to be-come more available and certainlymore affordable.So there are points on which there iscommon ground and a great deal ofagreement. The welfaredebatehas come a long way since those earlymonths when the President felt com-pelled to veto that extreme legislation.There have been many areas where bi-partisan progress in reducing the bar-riers that I have just discussed hasbeen made. The debate began on wel-fare reform with not $1 for child caremoney, with not $1 for child care to beprovidedunderanycircumstances.Now, in this legislation, there is $14billion to assist parents' efforts to se-cure child care.The debate began over a House billwith absolutely no guarantee of Medic-aid coverage for families under any cir-cumstances. Now families moving fromwelfare to work will continue to re-ceive health care during a 1-year tran-sition period.We have made bipartisan progress inother areas, too. This bill improves theNation'schildsupportenforcementsystem. It improves the Nation's sup-plemental security program for the dis-abledchildrenof our country. Wedropped the proposals to block grantfood stamps and eliminate the nationalnutrition safety net, and we droppedproposals to block grant child abusefunds, which would have underminedour Nation's child protection system.So. Mr. President, this bill does rep-resent progress. In these areas, and inothers. I think it is fair to say that wehave come a good distance. But in a de-mocracy everybody has to make theirown assessment. We have our own in-ternal comfort zone. We have our ownsense of what isright. From phonecalls I have received from my State ofSouth Dakota, and letters I received.from across the country, the views are'as diverse outside Washington as theyare here in the Senate.Every Senator, every Representative,and the President of the United Statesmust make his or her own judgment S9414anddraw his or her own lines. It is bet-ter than when we started. We beganhaving a thresholdfor which therecould be agreement and consensus onitems that I have discussed. Thought-ful people will disagree about where wego from here, how we can assess thatprogress,and whether ornotthis marks enough progress to stop now.For many, including this Senator, it isa tough call.There is no crystal ball. Nobody canpredict with certainty the effect of thisbill. It will improve, in some ways, thewelfare system that we have right now.I think that is a given. But will it helpmove welfare recipients to work? Wecan only hope that it does. Will it en-sure that children are protected? Wecan only hope that it does.Is there a guaranteed safety net forchildren in the future? On that answer,in my view, Mr. President, the answeris not even hopeful. The answer, in myview, is no. Is this the last point? Isthis the only point? There are others.But the fact is that this importantissue affecting 100 percent of the futurepopulation is not resolved. On thatissue, we can do better.We all want reform. We want to re-quire people to work. But we also wantto protect children who can't protectthemselves.We have to be careful to balancethose goals. The need a meaningfulsafety net for children\u2014a guaranteethat they will not pay for the mistakesor circumstances of their parents\u2014ought to be paramount for every one ofus as we make our decision tonight.Mr. President, we need vouchers toensure children's basic needs are metwhen their parents reach the time lim-its, and you can't find vouchers in thisbill\u2014not to any meaningful extent. Weneed a contingency for emergencies.When we went through the last reces-sion,this country drew down morethan $6 billionin emergency AFDCfunds an 18-month period. These werethe resources necessary to provide thesafety net, especially for children whootherwise had nothing\u2014$6 billion. Youknow what is in this bill? We haveabout $2 billion in contingency funds.We may be more than $4 billion under-funded the next time we have a reces-sion in this country. Then what hap-pens?The level of nutrition cuts continueto concern me as well. I am not com-fortable reducing food stamp benefitsforfamilies with children who paymore than 50 percent of their income inrent. We do not treat the elderly thatway, and we should not. And we shouldnot treat children that way, either. Nu-trition cuts have nothing to do withwork, nothing to do with reformingwelfare. It is an attack on the essentialnutritional safety net in this country,and we ought to recognize it as that.I support strong work requirements.But the work requirements in this billare inadequately funded. This is some-thing that we ought to be concernedabout, and the Congressional BudgetCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEOffice says that most States in thecountry, when this legislation passes,willfail to meet the work require-ments. They will not even be close.We all agree that the lack of afford-able child care is a barrier to work.The Senate and House bills said moth-ei-s with elementary school childrencould not be sanctioned or terminatedfrom assistance if they don't find childcare or cannot afford it, but the con-ference bill precludes sanctions onlyfor mothers with children under 6. Thedistinguished Senator from Connecti-cut addressed this point earlier thisafternoon. I am concerned that this isan impossible choice for mothers. Amother's choice is to go to work inorder to receive assistance, leaving achild of 7 or 8 alone after school, or notto go to work and lose the help sheneeds to feed and clothe her child.What a choice. Mr. President, that isnot a choice that you and I and the restof this body can be comfortable with.Frankly, I am very troubled aboutthe treatment of legal immigrants.There is no assistance for illegal immi-grants,and perhaps thatisappro- priate. But this bill attacks legal im-migrants. I am not talking about thosewho cross our borders in the dead ofnight. Individuals who have followedthe rules, paid taxes in this country.and gone to fight in other parts of theworld for this country are now going tobe told that there is nothing, no helpwhatsoever,evenwhentheydes- perately need it through no fault oftheir Own.It was 100 years ago that my grand-parents came to this country with thepromise of 160 acres of soil. They camewith a lot of hopes and dreams aboutwhat this country could provide forthem and their grandchildren and forall of the Daschles to follow. Theycame here for freedom. They came herein the belief that this would be a betterlife. We joked about the Governmentbetting you 160 acres of land that youcould not survive it on for 5 years inSouth Dakota. If you could survive for5 years, it was yours. They got off therailroad, they built a sod house, andsurvived. But the Government gavethem the opportunity to survive, gavethem the license to be Americans, andI am here 100 years later because thathappened.We do not have any more land togive, but I sure hope we can still givedreams. I hope that there are still peo-ple Out there who believe that the free-dom that they can find in this greatcountry of ours, for all of the thingsthis country can provide, ought to beample reason to come to this countryand give it their best.But we are saying we are not going tohelp you: we are going to punish you ifyou even try. That is not American.My grandparents could not have comewith this law in effect 100 years ago.So, Mr. President, itis with somesadness that we have come to the con-clusion that we cannot do better thanthis. But we are going to pass this leg-August 1. 1996islation tonight with the understand-ing that there are some very severe de-ficiencies. Is it an improvement overwhat we passed a year ago? Yes. Can wedo better? I think we all know in ourheart of hearts that the answer to thatis also yes.I hope that we can agree when it issigned into law that we will go back,without much time to waste, and at-tempt as best as we can to fix those de-ficiencies so we do not punish children,so we do not send the wrong message topeople who want to be Americans, sowe recognize that this country is stillall that it can be, so we can work to-gether to make it an even better one.I yield the floor.Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader.Mr. LOTr. Mr. President, I believewe have some 2'/z minutes left, and be-yond that I will use my leader time.Mr. President, over the years we havewatched a program that we startedsome 60 years ago with very good in-tentions to help the weak and thegenuinely poor people in this countryto be able to get some degree of tem-porary assistance to help them exist.We have watched over the years asthe taxpayers of this country workedhard to try to look after their families,tried to get clothes to put their chil-dren in school, and pay their taxes.Then they began to wonder, who wasthinking about them? Because theysaw this program continue to grow andbuild, and they saw it continue to costmore and more billions of dollars, andthey saw abuses. Then they started toworry. What about the children thatare getting locked into this system ofwelfare dependency?Over the years it moved in that di-rection\u2014to where we have disaffection.on all sides; those who pay the bills forthe welfare program and those who areon the program. People ask: Who is itreally helping? Is it really giving peo-ple a lift out of poverty, or it is it lock-ing them in? Does it really help thechildren when the parents are not ableto get a job, they do not have thetraining, the education, nor the daycare to be able to really get a job? Whois the real loser? The children have be-come the losers of this program. It hasbecome a program of dependency with-out a way out. That is what this bill isreally about.I am happy that the Senate is aboutto take this final action on this monu-mental accomplishment, a bipartisanaccomplishment on a bill that is enti-tled\"PersonalResponsibilityand Work Opportunity Act of 1996.\" We callit welfare reform, but that is the realtitle. That is what it is really about\u2014personal responsibility; taking advan-tage of the program when you reallyneed it on a temporary basis, to giveyou an opportunity to exercise your re-sponsibilities and get off the systemand get into a job\u2014work opportunity.That is the American way; to have an August 1, 1996opportunity to get what you need tem-porarily with training to go out andget ajob and look after your family.It has been a long haul with morethan a few dead-ends. But we stuckwith it. We forged the kind of com-promises that were needed to move itahead, and at last we have come to ourdestination:endingthedestructivewelfare cycle. That is what this is allabout.There is more than enough credit togo around. But I think special tributeclearly should be given to the Senatorfrom Delaware. Senator ROTH. He haspulled off a gold medal performancethis week. He was lead chairman on thewelfare reform bill. He was the chair-man that negotiated the agreement onthe small business tax relief bill, andhe was the lead participantin the health insurance reform legislation: atremendous week. We are all indebtedto Senator RoTh for that great work. Iknow it has been exhausting, but Iknow you are extremely proud of theaccomplishment that you have in thisbill and those other bills.Of course, the venerable chairman ofthe Budget Committee. Senator Do-MENICI, hangs in there. It was going tobe maybe just a few hours and then itlooked like it was going to be the full10 hours. He has to do it over and overagain. He has been a partner with theSenator from Delaware. They havedone a great job. He is the most knowl-edgeable Member that we have on howwe deal with these budget issues.Senator NICKLES. at my request, wasrepresentative of the leadership in a lotof the negotiations. That youngsterfromPennsylvania,SenatorRICK S.wroRuM. he was great. He came tothe floor one night. He did his job. Heknew his subject matter. He has beenworking on itfor2 years\u2014actuallylonger than that. I guess about 4 years.He really knows the intricacies of thisbill. It has been bipartisan, House andSenate. The vote in the House. 328 to101. That looks mighty broad to me inits support and its bipartisanship.In the Senate. Senator BREAUX wasinvolved and helpful as we went along.Senator LIEBERMAN. I read his article. Ibelieve. in a New York newspaper lastweek, an excellent article. So I thinkwe have truly made this bipartisan. Itis an effort of which we can be proud.Also. I have to say this. A lot of cred-it goes to the man whom I succeeded asmajority leader. Bob Dole worked onthis effort, pushed this effort, wouldnot let it end, helped get it through.not once but twice, and was committedto getting it done again this year forthe third time. Without his leadership.without his determination. without hiscommitment. we would not be here to-night passing this welfare reform pack-age. In my opinion, it should truly becalled the Dole Welfare Reform Pack-age.The last time I spoke on the Senatefloor about welfare, Iexpressed thehope then that President Clinton wouldnot again veto the reform bill that weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEhad come up with on welfare. And I didhave an opportunity over the past 2weeks to talk with him about it. Therewere some changes made that he hadhoped for in the bill, and so I am, frankly, greatly satisfied that he hasannounced he will. indeed, sign this billinto law.So now our country begins a greattransition. It will be complicated anddifficult and probably will require finetuning on our part in the future, butwe have made a start. We have made acommitment. We signed on to the blue-print for the most profound restructur-ing of public assistance since the NewDeal.This legislation will end the Federalentitlement to welfare and replace itwith block grants to the States. All byitself, that makes this landmark legis-lation.But theflexibilityforthe States and the Governors, I think, willwork well. They are close to the prob-lems. They will be able to use themoney where it is needed the greatestto help the people who need it themost.More than that, for the first timeever we are legislatively imposing timelimits on the receipt of welfare on anendless basis, and for the first timeever we are applying a meaningfulwork requirement that can help recipi-ents make the move\u2014and we know it isnot always an easy one\u2014from depend-ence to independence.That is what we desire and we hopefor all Americans. This bill responds toa consensus among the American peo-ple by ending most welfare for nonciti-zens. It strengthens our child supportenforcement and paternity establish-ment requirements. It combats fraudand abuse of welfare programs and willsave the taxpayers about $54.5 billionover the next 6 years.We can be proud of this package. andwe can build on it in the months aheadas we seek to improve Medicaid andother programs of assistance to theneedy. We are going to be working withthe Governors to make sure that thisbill sets the pattern for a new era of co-operation between the States and theFederal Government.Again. I thank everyone whose dili-gence and patience brought us this far.There is an old saying: \"Well begun isonly half done.\" Today. the herculeantask of comprehensive welfare reformis, indeed, well begun and much morethan half done.With the lessons we have learned inthis effort, we can finish the job for thebenefit of both the taxpayers of Amer-ica and the poor in the months ahead.I yield the floor.Mr. President.

Change in reference. 110 STAT. makes the following findings:(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successfulsociety which promotes the interests of children.(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhoodis integral to successful child rearing and the well-being ofchildren.(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families withchildren had a child support order established and, of that54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due.Of the cases enforced through the public child support enforce-ment system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to familieswith dependent children (in this section referred to as \"AFDC\")has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds ofthese recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of childrenreceiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no fatheris present.(A)(i) The average monthly number of the number of children receiving AFDC bene-fits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992,the total number of children in the United States aged0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.(B) The Department of Health and Human Serviceshas estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDCbenefits within 10 years.(C) The increase in the number of children receivingpublic assistance is closely related to the increase in birthsto unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percent-age of live births to unmarried women increased nearlythreefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and birthsis well documented as follows:(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teenpregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991.The overall rate of nonmarita.1 pregnancy rose 14 percentfrom 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overallpregnancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percentbetween 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000married women in 1980 to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and PUBLIC LAW104\u2014193\u2014AUG.22, 1996110 STAT. 2111if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all birthsby the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy mustaddress the issue of male responsibility, including statutoryrape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage preg-nancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe andis linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are signifi-cantly older.(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's, the ratefor girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.(B) Data indicates that at least half of the childrenborn to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Avail-able data suggests that almost 70 percent of births toteenage girls are fathered by men over age 20.(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that amajority of such mothers have histories of sexual and phys-ical abuse, primarily with older adult men.(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birthon the mother, the child, the family, and society are welldocumented as follows:(A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outsideof marriage are more likely to go on public assistanceand to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. Thesecombined effects of \"younger and longer\" increase totalAFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 percentfor 17-year-olds.(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantiallyhigher risk of being born at a very low or moderatelylow birth weight.(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely toexperience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as morechild abuse, and neglect.(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely tohave lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations,and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents them-selves.(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces thechances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.(F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times morelikely to be on welfare when they grow up.(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homeswere born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as thatof children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced(37 percent). While many parents find themselves, throughdivorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facingthe difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, thenegative consequences of raising children in single-parenthomes are well documented as follows:(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families withchildren under 18 years of age have income below thenational poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households with children under 18 years of ageare below the national poverty level.(B) Among single-parent families, nearly \u00bd of themothers who never married received AFDC while only\u00bd of divorced mothers received AFDC. 110 STAT. 2112PUBLIC LAW104\u2014193\u2014AUG.22, 1996(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assist-ance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when theyreach adulthood than children not born into families receiv-ing welfare.(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatestrisk of bearing low birth weight babies.(E) The younger the single-parent mother, the lesslikely she is to finish high school.(F) Young women who have children before finishinghigh school are more likely to receive welfare assistancefor a longer period of time.(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of birthsto teenage mothers under the aid to families with depend-ent children program, the food stamp program, and themedicaid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school performance and peeradjustment.(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cog-nitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greaterlikelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times morelikely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than arechildren from intact 2-parent families.(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youthaged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentagesof single-parent households have higher rates of violentcrime.(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses withinthe State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent livedprimarily in a home with both parents. In contrast tothese incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000children in the Nation's resident population were livingwith both parents.(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisisin our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that preventionof out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlockbirth are very important Government interests and the policycontained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (asamended by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to addressthe crisis.SEC. 102. REFERENCE TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.Except as otherwise specifically provided, wherever in this titlean amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to or repealof a section or other provision, the reference shall be consideredto be made to that section or other provision of the Social SecurityAct.SEC. 103.

It demands personalresponsibility, and puts in place tough child supportenforcement measures. It promotes family and protects children.This bipartisan legislation is significantly better thanthe bills that I vetoed. The Congress has removed many of theworst provisions of the vetoed bills and has included many ofthe improvements that I sought. I am especially pleased thatthe Congress has preserved the guarantee of health care for thepoor, the elderly, and the disabled.Most important, this Act is tough on work. Not only doesit include firm but fair work requirements, it provides$4 billion more in child care than the vetoed bills \u2014\u2014 sothatparents can end their dependency on welfare and go to work \u2014-andmaintains health and safety standards for day careproviders.The bill also gives States positive incentives tomove people into jobs and holds them accountable for maintainingspending on welfare reform. In addition, it gives States theability to create subsidized jobs and to provide employers withincentives to hire people off welfare.The Act also does much more to protect children than thevetoed bills.It cuts spending on childhood disability programsless deeply and does not unwisely change the child protectionprograms.It maintains the national nutritional safety net,by eliminating the Food Stamp annual spending cap and the FoodStamp and School Lunch block grants that the vetoed billscontained,in addition, it preserves the Federal guaranteeof health care for individuals who are currently eligible forMedicaid through the AFDC program or are in transition fromwelfare to work.Furthermore, this Act includes the tough personalresponsibility and child support enforcement measures that Iproposed 2 years ago. It requires minor mothers to live at homeand stay in school as a condition of assistance. It cracks downon parents who fail to pay child support by garnishing theirwages, suspending their driver?s licenses, tracking them acrossState lines, and, if necessary, making them work off what theyowe.Page 1 of3 For these reasons, I am proud to have signed thislegislation.The current welfare system is fundamentallybroken, and this may be our last best chance to set it straight.I am doing so, however, with strong objections to certainprovisions, which I am determined to correct.First, while the Act preserves the national nutritionalsafety net, its cuts to the Food Stamp program are too deep.rnong other things, the Act reinstates a maximum on the amountthat can be deducted for shelter costs when determining ahousehold's eligibility for Food Stamps. This provision willdispropor\u2014tionately affect low\u2014income families with children andhigh housing costs.Second,I am deeply disappointed that this legislationwould deny Federal assistance to legal immigrants and theirchildren, and give States the option of doing the same. MyAdministration supports holding sponsors who bring immigrantsinto this country more responsible for their well-being. Legalimmigrants and their children, however, should not be penalizedif they become disabled and require medical assistance throughno fault of their own. Neither should they be deprived of foodstamp assistance without proper procedures or due regard forindividual circumstances. Therefore,I will direct theImmigration and Naturalization Service to accelerate itsunprecedented progress in removing all bureaucratic obstaclesthat stand in the way of citizenship for legal immigrants whoare eligible. In addition,I will take any possible executiveactions to avoid inaccurate or inequitable decisions to cut offfood stamp benefits \u2014\u2014forexample, to a legal immigrant who hasperformed military service for this country or to one who hasapplied for and satisfied all the requirements of citizenship,but is awaiting governmental approval of his or her application.Page 2 of 3 In addition toindividuals, denialwill shift costs toclinics that serveStates electing tofaced with seriouslegal battles.placing an undue hardship on affectedof Federal assistance to legal immigrantsStates, localities, hospitals, and medicallarge immigrant populations. Furthermore,deny these individuals assistance could beconstitutional challenges and protracted I have concerns about other provisions of this legislationas well.It fails to provide sufficient contingency funding forStates that experience a serious economic downturn, and it failsto provide Food Stamp support to childless adults who want towork, but cannot find a job or are not given the opportunityto participate in a work program. In addition, we must work toensure that States provide in\u2014kind vouchers to children whoseparents reach the 5-year Federal time limit without findingwork.This Act gives States the responsibility that theyhave sought to reform the welfare system. This is a profoundresponsibility, and States must face it squarely. We will holdthem accountable, insisting that they fulfill their duty to movepeople from welfare to work and to do right by our mostvulnerable citizens, includingchildren and battered women. I challenge each State to takeadvantage of its new flexibility to use money formerly availablefor welfare checks to encourage te private sector to providejobs. The best antipoverty program is still a job. Combinedwith the newly increased minimum wage and the Earned Income TaxCredit \u2014\u2014whichthis legislation maintains \u2014\u2014 H.R.3734 willmake work pay for more Americans.I am determined to work with the Congress in a bipartisaneffort to correct the provisions of this legislation that gotoo far and have nothing to do with welfare reform. But, onbalance, this bill is a real step forward for our country, forour values, and for people on welfare. It should represent notsimply the ending of a system that too often hurts those it issupposed to help, but the beginning of a new era in whichwelfare will become what it was meant to be: a second chance,not a way of life. It is now up to all of us \u2014\u2014 Statesandcities, the Federal Government, businesses and ordinarycitizens \u2014-towork together to make the promise of this newday real. WILLIN1 J.

Ten years ago, Governor Castle and Iwere asked to cochair a Governors Task Force on Welfare Reform, and wewere asked together on it, and when we met at Hilton Head in SouthCarolina, we had a little panel. And 41 governors showed up to listento people who were on welfare from several states.So I asked Carol Rasco to find me somebody from our statewho had been in one of our welfare reform programs and had gone to work.She found Lillie Harden and Lillie showed up at the program. And I wasconducting this meeting and I committed a mistake that they always telllawyers never to do: never ask a question you do not know the answerto.(Laughter.)But she was doing so well talking about it, as you saw howwell\u2014spoken she was today \u2014\u2014 andI said,'Lillie, what's the best thingabout being off welfare?\" And she looked me straight n the eye andsaid, \"When my boy goes to school and they say what does your mama doPage 1 of5 for a living, he can give an answer.\" I have never forgotten that.(Applause.)And when I saw the success of all of her children and thesuccess that she's had in the past 10 years, I can tell you, you've hada bigger impact on me than I've had on you. And I thank you for thepower of your example, for your family's. And for all of America, thank you very much. (Applause.)What we are trying to do today is to overcome the flaws ofthe welfare system for the people who are trapped on it. We all knowthat the typical family on welfare today is very different from the one that welfare was designed to deal with 60 years ago. We all know thatthere are a lot of good people on welfare who just get off of it in theordinary course of business, but that a significant number of people aretrapped on welfare for a very long time, exiling them from the entire community of work that gives structure to our lives.Nearly 30 years ago, Robert Kennedy said, \"Work is themeaning of what this country is all about. We need it as individuals,we need to sense it in our fellow citizens, and we need it as a society and as a people.\" He was right then, and it's right now.From now on, our nation's answer to this great socialchallenge will no longer be a never\u2014ending cycle of welfare, it will be the dignity, the power and the ethic of work. Today, we are taking anhistoric chance to make welfare what it was meant to be: a second chance, not a way of life.The bill I'm about to sign, as I have said many times, isfar from perfect, but it has come a very long way.Congress sent me two previous bills that I strongly believe failed to protect our children and did too little to move people from welfare to work. I vetoed both of them.This bill had broad bipartisan support and is much, muchbetter on both counts.The new bill restores America's basic bargain of providingopportunity and demanding in return responsibility. It provides $14 billion for child care, $4 billion more than the present law does. It is good because without the assurance of child care it's all but impossible for a mother with young children to go to work.It requires states to maintain their own spending on welfare reform and gives thempowerful performance incentives to place more people on welfare in jobs. It gives states the capacity to create jobs by taking money now used for welfare checks and giving it to employers as subsidies as incentives to hire people.This bill will help people to go to work so they can stop drawing a welfare check and start drawing a. paycheck.It's also better for children. It preserves the national safety net of food stamps and school lunches. It drops the deep cuts and the devastating changes in child protection, adoption, and help for disabled children. It preserves the national guarantee of health care for poor children, the disabled, the elderly, and people on welfare \u2014\u2014 themost important preservation of all.It includes the tough child support enforcement measures that, as far as I know, every member of Congress and everybody in the administration and every thinking person in the country has supported for more than two years.It's the most sweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents inhistory.We have succeeded in increasing child support collection 40percent, but over a third of the cases where there's delinquencies,involve who cross state lines. For a lot of women and children, the only reason they're on welfare today -\u2014theonly reason --isthat the father up and walked away when he could have made a contribution to thePage 2 of 5 welfare of the children. That is wrong. If every parent paid the childsupport that he or she owes legally today, we could move 800,000 womenand children off welfare iinrriediately.With this bill we say, if you don't pay the child supportyou owe we'll garnish your wages, take away your driver's license, trackyou across state lines; if necessary, make you work off what you pay --whatyou owe.It is a good thing and it will help dramatically toreduce welfare, increase independence, and reenforce parentalresponsibility. (Applause.)As the Vice President said, we strongly disagree with acouple of provisions of this bill. We believe that the nutritional cutsare too deep, especially as they affect low-income working people andchildren.We should not be punishing people who are working for aliving already; we should do everything we can to lift them up and keepthem at work and help them to support their children. We also believethat the congressional leadership insisted in cuts in programs for legalimmigrants that are far too deep.These cuts, however, have nothing to do with thefundamental purpose of welfare reform. I signed this bill because thisis an historic chance \u2014\u2014 whereRepublicans and Democrats got togetherand said, we're going to take this historic chance to try to recreatethe nation's social bargain with the poor. We're going to try to changethe parameters of the debate. We're going to make it all new again andsee if we can't create a system of incentives which reenforce work andfamily and independence.We can change what is wrong. We should not have passedthis historic opportunity to do what is right. And so I want to ask allof you, without regard to party, to think through the implications ofthese other non\u2014welfare issues on the American people and let's worktogether in good spirits and good faith to remedy what is wrong. t/Je canbalance the budget without these cuts, but let's not obscure thefundamental purpose of the welfare provisions of this legislation whichare good and solid, and which can give us at least the chance to end theterrible, almost physical isolation of huge numbers of poor people andtheir children from the rest of mainstream America. We have to do that.(Applause.)Let me also say that there's something really good aboutthis legislation. When I sign it we all have to start again. And thisbecomes everybody's responsibility. After I sign my name to this bill,welfare will no loner be a political issue. The two parties cannotattack each other over it. Politicians cannot attack poor people overit.There are no encrusted habits, systems and failures that can belaid at the foot of someone else. We have to begin again. This is notthe end of welfare reform, this is the beginning. And we have to allassume responsibility. (Applause.)Now that we are saying with this bill we expect work, wehave to make sure the people have a chance to go to work. If we reallyvalue work, everybody in this society \u2014\u2014 businesses,non\u2014profits,religious institutions, individuals, those in government \u2014\u2014 allhave aresponsibility to make sure the jobs are there.These three women have great stories. Almost everybody onwelfare would like to have a story like that. And the rest of us nowhave a responsibility to give them that story. We cannot blame thesystem for the jobs they don't have anymore. if !t doesn't work now,it's everybody's fault \u2014- mine,yours, and everybody else. There is nolonger a system in the way. (Applause.)Page 3 of 5 I've worked hard over the past four years to create jobsand to steer investment into places where there are large numbers ofpeople on welfare because there's been no economic recovery. That'swhat the empowerment zone program was all about. That's what thecomxnunity development bank initiative was all about. That's what oururban Brownfield cleanup initiative was all about -\u2014tryingto givepeople the means to make a living in areas that had been left behind.I think we have to do more here in Washington to do that,and I'll have more to say about that later. But let me say again, wehave to build a new work and family system. And this is everybody's responsibility now. The people on welfare are people just like thesethree people we honor here today and their families. They are human beings.And we owe it to all of them to give them a chance to comeback.I talked the other day when the Vice President and I wentdown to Tennessee and we were working with Congressman Tanner'sdistrict, we were working on a church that had burned. Arid there was apastor there from a church in North Carolina that brought a group of hispeople in to work. Arid he started asking me about welfare reform, and Istarted telling him about it. And I said, \"You know what you ought todo?You ought to go tell Governor Hunt that you would hire somebody onwelfare to work in your church if he would give you the welfare check as a wage supplement, you'd double their pay and you'd keep them employedfor a year or so and see if you couldn't train them and help theirfamilies and see if their kids were all right.\" I said, \"Would you do that?\"He said, \"In a heartbeat.\"I think there are people all over xnerica like that.(Applause.)I think there are people all over America like that.That's what I want all of you to be thinking about today \u2014-whatare we going to do now? This is not over, this is just beginning. TheCongress deserves our thanks for creating a new reality, but we have to fill in the blanks. The governors asked for this responsibility; nowthey've got to live up to it. There are mayors that haveresponsibilities, county officials that have responsibilities. Everyemployer in this country that ever made a disparaging remark about thewelfare system needs to think about whether he or she should now hiresomebody from welfare and go to work. Go to the state and say, okay,you give me the check, I'll use it as an income supplement, I'll trainthese people, I'll help them to start their lives and we'll go forwardfrom here.Every single person needs to be thinking \u2014- everyperson in America tonight who sees a report of this who has ever said adisparaging word about the welfare system should now say, \"Okay, that'sgone.What is my responsibility to make it better?\" (Applause.)Two days ago we signed a bill increasing the minimum wagehere and making it easier for people in small businesses to get and keeppensions.Yesterday we signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill which makeshealth care more available to up to 25 million Americans, many of them in lower-income jobs where they're more vulnerable.The bill I'm signing today preserves the increases in theearned income tax credit for working Lamilies. It is now clearly betterto go to work than to stay on welfare -\u2014 clearlybetter.Because ofactions taken by the Congress in this session, it is clearly better.And what we have to do now is to make that work a reality.Ive said this many times, but, you know, most Americanfamilies find that the greatest challenge of their lives is how to do a good job raising their kids and do a good job at work. Trying toPage 4 of 5 balance work and family is the challenge that most Americans in theworkplace face. Thankfully, that's the challenge Lillie Fiardens had toface for the last 10 years. That's just what we want for everybody. ewant at least the chance to strike the right balance for everybody.Today, we are ending welfare as we know it. But I hopethis day will be remembered not for what it ended, but for what it began\u2014-anew day that offers hope, honors responsibility, rewards work, andchanges the terms of the debate so that no one in America ever feelsagain the need to criticize people who are poor on welfare, but insteadfeels the responsibility to reach out to men and women and children whoare isolated, who need opportunity, and who are willing to assumeresponsibility, and give them to opportunity and the terms ofresponsibility. (Applause.)Now, 1d like to ask Penelope Howard, Janet Ferrel, LillieHarden, the governors and the members of Congress from both parties whoare here to come up and join me as I sign the welfare reform bill. QMr.President, before you sign the bill, can you tell uswhether you think it's right to regulate tobacco or nicotine as a drug?THE PRESIDENT: You know, Wolf, under the law, I have towait until the 0MB makes a recommendation to me. I think we have toanticipate things. I can't say more than that right now.(The bill is signed.) QMr.President, some of your core constituencies arefurious with you for signing this bill. What do you say to them?THE PRESIDENT: Just what I said up there. We savedmedical care. e saved food stamps. e saved child care. We saved theaid to disabled children. e saved the school lunch program. We savedthe framework of support. What we did was to tell the state, now youhave to create a system to give everyone a chanceto go to work who isable-bodied, give everyone a chance to be independent. And we did \u2014- thatis the right thing to do.And now, welfare is no longer a political football to bekicked around. It's a personal responsibility of every American whoever criticized the welfare system to help the poor people now to movefrom welfare to work. Thats what I say.This is going to be a good thing for the country. we'regoing to monitor it and we're going to fix whatever is wrong with it. Qwhatguarantees are there that these things will befixed, Mr. President, especially if Republicans remain in control ofCongress?THE PRESIDENT: That's what we have elections for.END 11:33 "}
