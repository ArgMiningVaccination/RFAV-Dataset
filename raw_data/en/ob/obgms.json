Healthy Cooking Classes Trace Your Meridians to Improve Your Health If you've ever heard of acupuncture, then you may understand that there are certain points on the body that corre- spond to different organs. There are actually A LOT of points, and when certain points are connected, they form a me- ridian: an energy pathway for the particular organ with which it corresponds. Think of it like a power line. And, what happens when the power line is down? That's right, no energy!, So, by using our fingers to \"trace\" these meridian lines or energy pathways, we can make sure that the power lines are up, and our organs have the energy they need to help us be healthy. Following are the meridian pathways and how to \"trace\" them: To trace the Stomach meridian : Start with one finger below the center of each eye, follow an imaginary line down the body, and end at the lateral (outside) edge of the second toe. To trace the Spleen meridian : Start with one finger on the medial (inside) edge of each big toe, follow an imaginary line up the body, and end at the outside of the ribs, di- rectly below the chest. To trace the Heart meridian : Start with a finger in the armpit and follow an imaginary line down the arm, ending at the medial (inside) edge of the little finger. Repeat on the opposite side of the body. To trace the Small Intestine merid- ian: Start with a finger on the lateral (outside) edge of the little finger and follow an imaginary line up the arm, ending directly in front of the ear. Repeat on the opposite side of the body. To trace the Bladder meridian : Start with one finger on the inside corner of each eye, follow an imaginary line up over the head, down the back of the body, under the foot, and ending at the lateral (outside) edge of the little toe. To trace the Kidney meridian : Start with one finger on the bottom of the center of the ball of each foot and follow an imaginary line up over the foot and up the body, ending in the hollows below each clavicle (collar bone). To trace the Circulation/Sex meridian : Start with one finger on the outside of the nipple and follow an imaginary line across and down the arm, ending at the medial (inside) edge of the middle finger. Repeat on the opposite side of the body. To trace the Triple Warmer (thyroid, pancreas, and adrenals) meridian : Start with one finger on the lateral (outside) edge of the ring finger and follow an imaginary line up the arm, ending at the outside edge of the eyebrow. Repeat on the opposite side of the body. To trace the Gallbladder meridian : Start with one finger at the outside corner of each eye, follow an imaginary line up over the head, down the body, underneath the foot, and coming up to end at the lateral (outside) edge of the fourth toe. To trace the Liver meridian : Start with one finger on the lateral (outside) edge of each big toe and follow an imaginary line up the body, ending at the front of the lower rib cage. To trace the Lung meridian : Start with one finger on the front side of the shoulder where you might wear your sus- penders; follow an imaginary line down the arm and end at the medial (inside) edge of the thumb. Repeat on the oppo- site side of the body. To trace the Large Intestine meridian : Start with one finger on the medial (inside) edge of the index finger and follow an imaginary line up the arm and end at the side of the nose. Repeat on the opposite side of the body. To trace the Governing meridian : Start with one finger on the tailbone in back and follow an imaginary line up the back, up over the head, and ending at the center of the top of the lip. To trace the Central meridian : Start with one finger on the top of the pubic bone in front and follow an imaginary line up the body, ending at the center of the bottom lip. Each meridian has a partner; that is why they are grouped in pairs above. It is best to trace each meridian three times each at least once per day. Upon beginning this exercise, watch for signs of increased energy, body cleansing, and other changes in health. For more specific information on your meridians, consult one of the naturopaths at Herbs, Etc. Herbs Etc / NITE./NCC 503. East Broadway Mt.

Laingsburg, MI 48848 After all the spring cleaning, the warm weather comes, rewarding us with trips to the beach and other outdoor activities. If you want to tone your body for summer to be fit enough to participate in the softball game or not wear your cover -up all day at the beach, here are some nutritional tips and safe, natural supplements to get you on your way. First, eat breakfast. Break the fast that your body has been in all night and give your metabolism some kindling to get its fire burning! Also, aim to drink half your body weight in ounces of water daily. The body is largely composed of water and needs water to function and properly eliminate waste. Eat more protein and good fats. What makes us fat and causes health problems is actually too much sugar. For quality protein, find some free range, hormone free, organic meats and eggs. Vegetarians will need to eat a wide variety of vegetables. Aim for a ratio of at least 1 gram of protein for every 4 grams of sugar consumed. And, make sure you are getting enough good fats in your diet, like real butter, olive oil, flaxseed oil, fish oil, and coconut oil. When you don't have enough good fats, your body won't release un- healthy fat, it won't make its hormones, Toning for Summer by Doc. Howard Herbs Etc. and you will crave more sugar! Consider taking Collatrim . This unique protein supplement promotes the building of lean mus- cle tissue and increases the body's fat burning ability. For weight release, take six to nine capsules at night before bed. To improve joints and skin, take daily with meals. The herbal combination SF aids weight release by stimulating the body's detoxification proc- esses. It is also helpful for digestion, inflam- mation, and the immune system. Dieter's Cleanse is an herbal cleansing pro- gram designed to release toxic build -up result- ing from chemicals in our food, water, and envi- ronment. It also improves nutrient absorption and glandular function, serving to jump start a weight release program. Adding 1 drop of grapefruit essential oil into a glass of water daily will help the body to breakdown fat and release toxins. One or two drops of this oil can also be applied externally on key areas. For more specific suggestions, make an ap- pointment with one of the naturopaths at Herbs, Etc., to thoroughly evaluate your diges- tion and glandular systems. If these are out of balance, any weight release efforts can be seriously impaired. Get started 989 -773-3636.
