During consultations, Eli utilizes Quest9 Quantum Biofeedback along with homeopathy, herbs, Integrative Energetic Medicine, and Pranic Healing to help her clients find balance. Her goal is to empower clients to make informed decisions about their own life and health care. The Quest9 is a Class II Medical Device that utilizes EPR (Electro-Physiological Reactivity) Biofeedback, an advanced technology that detects and harmonizes thousands of imbalances in the body brought on by physical, chemical, toxin, pathogen, emotional stress and/or nutritional deficiency. This advanced form of biofeedback measures stress reactions to over 12,000 precise signatures of substances ranging from minerals, to vitamins, to 100's of chemicals, toxins, pathogens and much more, which is an entirely different way to look at our relationship to these items in terms of stress. Instead of quantities in blood tests, we look at what people react to, explore why and determine remedies that can bring the body back into balance. We work with sophisticated shapes of electrical energy that are so precise that we can actually see the brainwaves change positively in response to entrainments with them. EPR Biofeedback is unique among bioenergetic devices in that it provides an intelligent auto-focusing aspect to the two-way flow of energy and information. For instance, as a training program is in progress, the system will monitor your responses and automatically adjust & balance for maximum benefit & minimal stress.
