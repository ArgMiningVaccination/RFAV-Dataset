So, what is a government grant? [As we've written about before](http://blog.grants.gov/2017/02/07/new-series-what-is-a-grant/), a federal grant is one form of federal financial assistance in which the main purpose is to carry out a public purpose. In such a grant, this is typically done by transferring anything of value (typically funding) from the federal agency to a non-federal entity. The phrase \"government\" grant, on the other hand, is not an official term, but rather a common way people refer to a grant that is awarded by a governmental entity to another entity. In the U.S., this generally refers to the federal, state, or local government levels. On Grants.gov, we only have federal grant postings.

Restoring Balance to California's Russian River Region Wine growers near California's Russian River sometimes need to use river water to spray on their grapes and protect them from a coming frost. When this happens, endangered and threatened fish species, including coho salmon, Chinook, and steelhead, can at times be blocked from swimming upstream due to the resulting lower water level.

This week, we are highlighting a few of the most recent success stories. Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program In early August, three entities, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, [announced a nearly 50 percent reduction in Veterans experiencing homelessness since 2010](http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/29697/federal-agencies-announce-veteran-homelessness-cut-more-than-half-since-2010/).

Instead, your go-to resource for information about student funding opportunities is the website of the United States Department of Education, [ED.gov](http://www.ed.gov/). So you're telling me that Grants.gov does not offer grants for education? Grants.gov does, in fact, offer federal government grants for education-related programs. It's important to understand, however, that these education grants are for organizations, institutions, local governments, and - in some cases - businesses to implement an education-related program.

Included in this broad group are charities, schools and universities, environmental protection groups, religious and faith-based organizations, social welfare and advocacy groups, scientific institutions, non-governmental agencies, and many more. Although 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofits are the most well-known, there are over 20 different types of classifications. If you're interested in learning more on this topic, here are two authoritative sources of information: [Charities & Nonprofits](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-section-501-c-3-organizations) and [Title 26 Internal Revenue Code, Subtitle A\u2014Income Taxes, Chapter 1\u2014Normal Taxes and Surtaxes, Subchapter F\u2014Exempt Organizations, \u00a7501](http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=26\u00a7ion=501). Grants for Nonprofits Many federal grants are available to nonprofit organizations, including those with or without 501(c)(3) classification. In the Grants.gov Search page, we split nonprofits between those that have and do not have 501(c)(3) status because this is a distinction made both by federal awarding agencies and by authorizing legislation for the grant programs.

Meeting these goals requires approaches that integrate the traditional disciplines of the Earth sciences, as well as innovative and complementary use of models and data. 2) [Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Food Emergency Response Network Cooperative Agreement](http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=286933) The Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) currently comprises federal, state, and local government regulatory laboratories with varying capacities to perform threat agent testing.
