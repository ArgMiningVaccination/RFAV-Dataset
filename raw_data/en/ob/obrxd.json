Your Special Needssbmc523 PatientGuide2012 m1 8/16/12 4:04 PM Page 5saint barnabas medical center4Advance Directives It is Saint Barnabas Medical Center's policy to honor decisions made by patients admitted to the hospital concerning their medical care and patient's advance directive to the fullest extent of the law. An advance directive may be a living will, a health care proxy or a combination. It is mandated by the State of New Jersey that all adult patients admitted to the hospital be asked if they have an advance directive. If you have already prepared such a document, please be sure to bring a copy to the hospital upon your admission or have someone bring a copy for you for placement in your medical record. An advance directive is an effective means of maintaining control over your medical care if you become unable to make decisions. We encourage you to discuss issues concerning your medical care with your family, friends and health care professionals and to consider seriously the advantages of preparing an Advance Directive. Please speak to your nurse for more information. The hospital recognizes that there are times that we may be providing care and treatment to you on an outpatient basis. In most of these outpatient areas, should something happen to you that would require emergency care, the staff will ensure that you are transferred to our emergency department. The emergency department will then inquire if you have an advanced directive and the staff will then honor your directive.Saint Barnabas Medical Center will not modify the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against anyone based on whether or not that person has executed an advanced directive. Bioethics Committee The Bioethics Committee is available free of charge to assist patients, families, and health care professionals who are faced with difficult medical decisions. The Committee, comprised of nurses, physicians, clergy, lay people, social workers and others, can help clarify such issues as patient rights, end of life decisions and interpretation of the Advance Directive (Living Will). Consultation is available on a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week basis by calling the Operator and asking for a Bioethics Consultation. Organ and tissue donation The concept of organ and tissue donation deserves thoughtful consideration by everyone, for one donor can change the lives of up to 75 individuals. The Uniform Anatomical Giving Act, a federal law, now requires hospitals to perform specific blood tests for all patients who may be a candidate for organ or tissue donation in the future as part of their routine care. For more information about organ donation, or to obtain an organ donor card, contact the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network at 1.800.SHARE.NJ, or call the SBMC Liaison at 973.322.8226 or ext. 28226.

Your rights while you are a Medicare hospital patient You have the right to receive all the hospital care that is necessary for the proper diagnosis and treatment of your illness or injury. According to federal law, your dischargedate must be determined solely by your medical needs,not by \"DRGs\" or Medicare payments. You have the right to be fully informed about decisions affecting your Medicare coverage and payment for your hospital stay and for any post-hospital services. You have the right to request a review by Healthcare Quality Strategies Inc. (HQSI), formally the Peer Review Organization PRO, of any written Notice of Non- coverage that you receive from the hospital stating that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. HQSI are groups of doctors who are paid by the Federal Government to review medical necessity, appropriateness and quality of hospital treatment furnished to Medicare patients. The address and phone number of the agencyfor your area is: Healthcare Quality Strategies Inc., 557 Cranbury Road, Suite 21, East Brunswick, New Jersey08816-4026. Telephone 732.238.5570 Talk to your doctor about your stay in the hospital You and your doctor know more about your condition and your health needs than anyone else. Decisions about your medical treatment should be made between you and your doctor. If you have any questions about your medical treatment, your need for continued hospital care, your discharge, or your need for possible post-hospital care, don't hesitate to ask your doctor. The hospital's Case Manager, at ext. 25005, will also help you with questions and concerns about hospital services. sbmc523 PatientGuide2012 m1 8/16/12 4:04 PM Page 9saint barnabas medical center8If you think you are being asked to leave the hospital too soon Ask a Case Manager for a written notice of explanation immediately, if you have not already received one. This notice is called a \"notice of non-coverage.\" You must have this notice of non-coverage if you wish to exercise your right to request a review by the State Quality Improvement Organization. The Quality Improvement Organization for New Jersey is Health Care Quality Strategies Inc., also known as HQSI. The notice of non-coverage will state either that your doctor or the PRO agrees with the hospital's decision that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. If the hospital and your doctor agree, HQSI does not review your case before a notice of non-coverage is issued. But HQSI will respond to your request for a review of your notice of non-coverage and seek your opinion. You cannot be made to pay for your hospital care until HQSI makes its decision, if you request the review by noon of the first work day after you receive the notice of non-coverage. If the hospital and your doctor disagree, the hospital may request HQSI to review your case. If it does make such a request, the hospital is required to send you a notice to that effect. In this situation, HQSI must agree with the hospital or the hospital cannot issue a notice of non- coverage. You may request that HQSI reconsider your case after you receive a notice of non-coverage. But since your HQSI has already reviewed your case once, you may have to pay for three days of hospital care before HQSI completes this reconsideration.If you do not request a review, the hospital may bill you for all the costs of your stay beginning the day following the day of the receipt of the hospital notice of non- coverage. The hospital, however, cannot charge you for care unless it provides you with a notice of non-coverage.Post-hospital Care When your doctor determines that you no longer need all the specialized services provided in a hospital, but you still require medical care, he or she may discharge you for post- hospital care to a skilled nursing facility, home care or hospice and palliative care program. The discharge planner at the hospital will help you arrange for the services you may need after your discharge. Medicare and supplemental insurance policies have limited coverage for skilled nursing facility care and home care. Therefore, you should find out which services will or will not be covered and how payment will be made. Barnabas Health recognizes the importance of providing the patients it serves with a complete continuum of care. After being discharged from the hospital individuals have access to a wide range of post acute care services to choose from including services provided by Barnabas Health to ensure their health care goals are met. Please consult with your physician or discharge planner for more information. Do not hesitate to ask questions.

Everyone has a role in making health care safe \u2014 physicians, health care executives, nurses, technicians and patients to name a few. Health care organizations across the country are working to make health care safety a priority. You, as the patient, play a vital role in making your care safe by becoming an active, involved and informed member of your health care team. The \"Speak Up\" program urges patients to get involved in their care. Here is how... SSpeak up if you have questions or concerns, and if you don't understand, ask again. It's your body andyou have a right to know. PPay attention to the care you are receiving. Make sure you're getting the right treatments andmedications by the right health care professionals. Don't assume anything. EEducate yourself about your diagnosis, the medicaltests you are undergoing, and your treatment plan. AAsk a trusted family member or friend to be youradvocate. KKnow what medications you take and why you take them. UUse a hospital clinic, surgery center, or other type of health care organization that has undergone rigorous on-site evaluation against established, state-of-the-artquality and safety standards, such as that provided by The Joint Commission.

Color-Coded Wristbands As part of the admission process you will receive a patient identification arm bracelet. This bracelet is very important and will be checked by different members of the health care team before you receive any tests, treatments, procedures or medication. You should check the bracelet before it is applied to your wrist to make sure the personal information such as the spelling of yourname, age and birth date are correct. Please do not remove your identification bracelet prior to being discharged from the hospital. Saint Barnabas Medical Center has joined with other areahospitals and health care facilities in using a standardized color-coded system for identifying important patient risks such as allergies and risk for falls. By standardizing these colors, we reduce the risk of making a mistake related to these important risk factors. As part of our partnership, we encourage you to remove any \"For - Cause\" bracelets that may be confused with this extremely important communication tool. Should you choose to continue to wear your \"For-cause\" bracelet(s), we will request that you complete a special form. Safe Surgery - Safe Procedures Having to undergo surgery or a procedure can be frightening. We at Saint Barnabas Medical Center want you to know some of the very important safety steps that we take before and during each surgery to enhance your safety. First, when you and your physician determine that surgery or a procedure is the treatment of choice, your physician will need to provide very specific surgical continued on next pagesbmc523 PatientGuide2012 m1 8/16/12 4:04 PM Page 15saint barnabas medical center14information to our Operating Room staff just to schedule your case. This information includes the type of surgery, location of the surgery and whether the surgical procedure is limited to your right or left side. In preparation for your surgery or procedure, various staff members will need to confirm your identity and will review with you what kind of surgery you are having and the part of your body to be operated on. This information is used to double-check the information provided by your surgeon and recorded in our records. In addition, we will use other sources of information such as x-rays, scan results and the surgical consent to double and triple check the information. Just prior to the beginning of your surgery, your surgeon will mark the surgical site as part of our safety strategy. In the event that the site cannot be directly marked, we will use a secondary marking system developed by the hospital. While you are in the operating room, your surgeon and other health care providers that will be part of your surgical team will again, review this information to confirm that this information is correct. This process is known as \"Time Out .\" All of these steps are designed to reduce the risk of a medical error and enhance the safety of our patients. Preventing Infections Fighting infections While you're in the hospital to get well, you should know that there is the possibility of developing an infection. The single most important thing you can do to help prevent infections is to wash your hands and make sure that everyone who touches you - including doctors and nurses also wash their hands. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are a suitable substitute for soap and water in most cases. You will see these handcleanser dispensers throughout the hospital in convenient locations. You, your family and friends should wash hands: 1. after touching objects or surfaces in the hospital room 2. before eating3. after using the restroom It is also important that your healthcare team wash their hands with either soap and water or with an alcohol- based hand cleaner every time, both before and after theytouch you. Healthcare providers know to practice hand hygiene, but sometimes they forget. You and your family should not be afraid or embarrassed to speak up and ask them to wash their hands. Happy birthday to you! Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. That's about the same amount of time that it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice. With or without soap Alcohol-based hand cleaners are as effective as soap and water in killing germs. To use, apply the cleaner to thepalm of your hand and rub your hands together. Keep rubbing over all the surfaces of your fingers and hands, including between your fingers until they are dry. sbmc523 PatientGuide2012 m1 8/16/12 4:04 PM Page 16saint barnabas medical center 15Influenza (Flu) Vaccine The virus that causes influenza (flu) changes often. Because of this, the influenza vaccine is updated each year. Protection develops about 2 weeks after the vaccination and may last up to a year. Influenza is a serious disease that spreads from one infected person to others. Flu season in the United States is from Novemberto April each year. Who should get the \"flu shot\"? The Influenza vaccine will be offered to all patients ages 6 months and older. The influenza vaccine is offered from October 1 to March 31 each year. Please contact your nurse for more details. Pneumococcal (Pneumonia) Vaccine The pneumococcal vaccine protects you from diseases due to bacteria called pneumococcus. The most common disease is pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease can lead to serious illness and even death. Who should get the \"pneumonia shot\"? OAll patients age 5- 64 who have diabetes, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), kidney disease or HIV. OAll adults 65 years of age or older if they have not received the vaccine previously. OAnyone over 2 years of age who has long-term health problems.

Your Health And Safety - Preventing MRSAVaccinations Help stop the spread of MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) \"Staph\" is a type of bacteria commonly carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people and does not cause an infection. At other times, this bacteria can and does cause infections. Staph infections often appear as a pimple or boil on the skin and are treated without antibiotics. But, if left untreated, the staph infection can get worse and spread to the bloodstream or lungs causing serious illness. MRSA is a staph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics. This makes treating the infection moredifficult. Anyone can get a MRSA infection. It is more common in hospitals and nursing homes where peoplehave a weakened immune system but it is now becoming more common in the community as well. To prevent others from getting infected with MRSA OIf you think you have a staph skin infection, see your health care provider right away. Follow their directions regarding treatment, medication, and wound care. OKeep skin infections covered; pus and drainage can easily spread infection to others. ODo not share personal items such as towels, razors, bar soap or clothing that may have come in contact with the infected area. OWash towels, bedding and clothes in hot water and bleach and use a dryer with hot air to kill the bacteria. OWash your hands thoroughly with soap, water and friction. It is not necessary to use an antibacterialsoap. OTell all health care providers that you have or had astaph or MRSA infection. If needed, your nurse can provide you with more information on other types of Multi-Drug ResistantOrganisms (MDRO) such as VRE and C. difficile.sbmc523 4:04 PM Page 17saint barnabas medical center16Preventing Surgical-Procedure Site Infections Keeping you safe and avoiding infections is a number one priority to us. The doctors, nurses and other health care providers at our Medical Center adhere to the following steps to prevent surgical site infections: OCleaning their hands with an antiseptic agent just before surgery. OCleaning their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub before and after caring for each patient. OWearing special hair covers, masks, gowns and gloves during surgery. OGiving you specific antibiotics at specific times before your surgery starts. OIf needed, removing some of your hair immediately before surgery using special clippers. OCleaning the skin at the site of your surgery with a special cleanser that kills germs. Your Help In Preventing Surgical Site Infections Most patients who have surgery do well. But sometimes patients get infections. Nationally, this happens to about 3 out of 100 patients who have surgery. Patients and their family members can help lower the risk of surgery/procedure related infections in the following ways: Days or weeks before surgery when you meet with your doctors: OLet the surgeon and anesthesiologist know if you are allergic to any medication and what happens when you take it. OTell the surgeon and anesthesiologist if you have diabetes or high blood sugar. OQuit smoking. Talk to your doctor about how you can stop smoking. The day or night before surgery: OFollow any instructions that your surgeon or hospital staff has given you. ODo not shave near where you will have surgery. If hair removal is necessary, that will be done through a special technique by the surgical team.Shaving can irritate your skin making it more susceptible to infection.After your surgery: OMake sure that we remember to wash our hands before providing care to you. Remember to wash your hands too. OAvoid touching or having family or friends touch the surgical wound or dressing. OVisitors should clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub before and aftervisiting you. If you do not see them clean their hands, ask them to clean their hands. If family or friends are not feeling well, ask them not to visit. OBefore you go home, your doctor or nurse will explain everything you need to know about taking care of your wound. Make sure you understand how to care for your wound before leaving the hospital. OAlways clean your hands before and after caring for your wound. OBefore you go home, make sure you know who to contact if you have questions or problems after you get home.

Here are six easy things you can do: 1. Wash your hands frequently using soap and warm water. Rub your hands really well for at least 15 seconds. Always clean your hands before touching or eating food and after you use the bathroom, take out trash, change a diaper, visit someone who is ill, or play with a pet. 2. Make sure health care providers clean their hands. Before they treat you, ask them if they have cleaned their hands. Health care providers should wear clean gloves when they perform tasks such as taking throat cultures, pulling teeth, taking blood, touching wounds or body fluids, and examining your private parts. Don't be afraid to gently remind them to wear gloves. 3. Many diseases are spread through sneezes and coughs. When you sneeze or cough, the germs cantravel 3 feet or more! Cover your mouth and nose to prevent the spread of infection to others. Keep tissues handy at home, work and in your pocket. Be sure to throw away used tissues and then clean your hands. Avoid sneezing or coughing into your hands,use the fold area of your elbow to provide protection. 4. As part of our Infection Control Program, we may need to require you and/or your visitors to wear specific Personal Protective Equipment such as a disposable gown, face mask and/or gloves. In order to protect you and your loved ones, signage placed outside your room will instruct visitors to see thenurse before entering the room. Please encourage your visitors to comply with the use of the Personal protective Equipment - for your protection and theirs. 5. If you have experienced surgery or an invasive procedure and have a wound, it is very important that you follow the instructions provided by your nurse in order to avoid a possible infection. Please do not touch or remove the dressing unless instructed by your nurse. 6. If you are sick, stay away from other people. Stay home if you have a fever. Call work or school and let them know you are sick. When you go for medical treatments, call ahead and ask if there's anything you can do to avoid exposing people in the waiting room. These steps can help in preventing the spread of colds, the flu, and many other diseases. Other important information that can help prevent infections during your stay include the following facts: a. If you have a catheter inserted in your vein: A central venous catheter (line) is put into a large vein so you can get intravenous (IV) medicines,blood, fluids and/or nutrition. The line can stay in place for days or weeks. Everyone (you and your health care team members) should cleanse their hands before and after touching the line. Health care team members will check the skin around your line site every day for signs of infection (redness, warmth, increased drainage or pain). They will also check every day to see if the line is necessary. b. If you have a catheter inserted in the bladder: Your chance of infection increases the longer your catheter remains in place. Tell your nurse if the urinary catheter comes out or it you have pain, pressure, orthe sudden urge to urinate. c. If you need a ventilator, also known as a respirator or breathing machine:A ventilator is a machine that helps you breathe and supplies extra oxygen to the lungs. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a lung infection you can get while connected to the ventilator. To prevent a lunginfection: The head of the bed may be elevated. You may receive medicines to prevent ulcers and blood clots. The health care team will check you each day to seeif you can try breathing on your own. Follow the breathing instructions you get from your health care team. Ask your nurse or doctor about the influenza and pneumonia vaccines (shots). Refrain from smoking which can lead to infections. If you smoke and need help to stop, please tell your nurse. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor about the best ways to control your blood glucose. High blood glucose can increase your risk of infection.sbmc523 PatientGuide2012 m1 8/16/12 4:04 PM Page 19saint barnabas medical center18Medications Your medication list Whenever you visit the hospital or your physician, it is important that you bring a list of medications and dosages with you.

Please take a minute to review this information that contains basic safety tips about reducing the risk for falling. It is the policy of the hospital that a bed alarm be placed on any patient assessed to be at risk for a fall. Falls (why they can happen) The risk of falling and possible injury resulting from falls affects everyone. The chance of falling may increase due to individual risk factors such as health factors, mobility, and the medication you take. These risk factors can affect muscle strength, balance and coordination and increase your risk for falling. Chances for falling may also increase with age because of body changes in muscle and bone strength, vision, hearing and in coordination. What you can do to reduce your risk of falling OTell your doctor about any medical conditions you have, any falls you may have had, any weakness you feel in your muscles or \"leg problems.\" Heart disease and high blood pressure can cause dizziness. Difficulty with bladder control can also cause falls while \"running to the bathroom.\" It is important for your doctor to know what your health is like and how you feel. OMake sure your doctor knows all the medication you take even over the counter medications, vitamins, herbals and supplements. Always take yourmedication exactly as prescribed. Talk to your doctor about the side effects of the medications you are taking. Even over the counter medications can cause side effects such as dizziness or drowsiness. OFollow the nurses' instructions and use the patient call bell for assistance. ODon't get up too quickly.
