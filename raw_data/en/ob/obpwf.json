Naturopathy's Herbal Teas -Our Dedication to \"Ingredients\" and \" Mastery of Blending\" - All herbal teas are made from \"Organic\" ingredients. Herbs grown in areas of high environmental pollution or using large amounts of pesticides are likely to be contaminated with heavy metals and chemicals, which can cause a more significant burden on the body than the benefits. These herbs cannot fulfill their natural healing properties, so we only use organic ingredients for our herbal teas. - The blender directly sources herbs from the local farmers when they are in season. The key to herbal teas is to use herbs grown at the right time of year and in safe cultivation methods and soil. To ensure the safety and quality of most of our herbal ingredients, our blenders go directly to the source to purchase them from small farms. We also remove any foreign substances by visual inspection when blending, and each blend is carefully handcrafted. - Great tasting, so you can keep on drinking it. The \"Golden Balance of Benefits and Taste\" was born from the experience of a naturopathic doctor. Dr. Ozawa's blends of herbal teas were formulated based on his many years of experience as a naturopathic doctor. The key to making herbal teas that maximize the natural benefits of herbs while also achieving a great taste is to understand herbal properties based on practical experience and be able to blend them with a fine-tuned harmony of taste and flavor. Naturopathy's herbal teas combine elements of both, so you can enjoy the benefits and taste the goodness. Made by a naturopathic doctor, our blends are guaranteed to be reliable and beneficial. We hope you and your family will discover Naturopathy's herbal teas to help improve your health. Instruction Add 2 teaspoons of tea to 8 oz of boiling water. Cover and steep for 5 minutes.

It helped me to urinate! - Feels like it's working Drinking this can help you urinate faster and reduce swelling. I also recommend it because it relieves fatigue in my body. I would like to continue taking it. "}
