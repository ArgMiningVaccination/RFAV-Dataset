Effect of early treatment with fluvoxamine on risk of emergency care and hospitalisation among patients with COVID -19: the TOGETHER randomised, platform clini cal trial. Reis et al. Lancet Global Health. 27 Oct 2021. (NCT04727424 ) Fluvoxamine is a commonly used SSRI antidepressant and 1 receptor (S1R) agonist hypothesized to impact COVID -19 through its anti -inflammatory activity This RCT assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine (n=741; 100 mg twice daily for 10 days) vs. placebo (n=756) in preventing hospitalization among high -risk symptomatic adult COVID -10 patients in Brazil from 20 Jan - 5 Aug 2021 Eligibility criteria included: o presenting to an outpatient care setting with an acute clinical condition consistent with COVID - 19 and symptoms beginning within 7 days of the screening date, or positive rapid test for SARS - CoV-2 antigen don e at the time of screening , or patient with positive SARS -CoV-2 diagnostic test within 7 days of symptom onset o having at least one known risk factor for progression to severe disease Median age 50y; 58% women; 95% self -identified as mixed race; average days with symptoms before randomization Primary outcome: composite endpoint of hospitalization was defined as either retention in a COVID -19 emergency setting or transfer to tertiar y hospital due to COVID -19 progression during up to 28 days of follow up 79 (11%) participants in fluvoxamine group had a primary outcome event compared with 119 (16%) in the placebo group (5% absolute risk reduction) o 87% of events were hospitalizations o Relative risk was 0.68 (95% Bayesian credible interval: 0.52 - 0.88) o Randomization was stopped on Aug 5 as the probability of superiority of 99.8% surpassed the prespecified superiority threshold Findings were more pronounced in the per -protocol analysis (patients with high adherence (>80%); RR 0.34, 95% BCI, 0.21 - 0.54) No statistically significant evidence of modification of treatment effect in pre -specified subgroups of age, sex, days since symptom onset, smoking status, or comorbiditie s No significant differences between groups for pre -specified secondary outcomes, although suggestive benefits of fluvoxamine were observed for several such as length of hospitalization o 17 deaths in fluvoxamine group and 25 in placebo group; OR 0.68 (95% C I 0.36 -1.27) o In per -protocol population, t here was one death in fluvoxamine group and 12 in placebo group ; OR 0 .09 (95% CI 0 .01-0.47) No significant differences in number of treatment emergent adverse events in the two groups Limitations : variability in standard of care for treatment of early COVID -19; low rate of vaccination of the study population (6%) so further study is needed to exa mine effect in vaccinated populations Implications : Results provide compelling evidence of fluvoxamine's benefit in reducing morbidity among high -risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID -19; these findings could have important implications for clinical management of outpatient COVID -19 given fluvoxamine's safety, tolerability, ease of use, low cost, and widespread availability 2. Effect of Antithrombotic Therapy on Clinical Outcomes in Outpatients With Clinically Stable Symptomatic COVID -19. The ACTIV -4B Randomized Clinical Trial . Connors 11 Oct 20 21. ACTIV -4B Outpatient Thrombosis Prevention Trial of the potential benefit of a nticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy among symptomatic but clinically stable outpatients aged 40 -80y with COVID -19 From Sept 2020 -June 2021, r andom 1:1:1:1 allocation of 657 patients t o aspirin 81 mg once daily, prophylactic -dose apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, therapeutic -dose apixaban 5.0 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily for 45 days Adjudicated primary c omposite outcome : all-cause mortality, symptomatic v enous or arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular or pulmonary cause o Trial was stopped early (after ~9% enrollment) because of unanticipated very low event rate 558 randomized patients initiated treatment o Median time from diagnosis to randomization=7 days (IQR, 3 -10) o Median time from randomization to study treatment initiation=3 days (IQR, 2 -5) age -59), women, 12.7% Black patients o 18.3% had di abetes, 19.9% history of smoking, 35.3% hypertension, median BMI 30.1 There were 3 adjudicated primary composite events o Risk was 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.6%) in the prophylactic apixaban apixaban group, and 0.0% (0.0% to 2.8%) in the placebo group Risk differences compared with placebo for bleeding events were 2.0% (95% CI, 12.9%) who initiated th erapy in the aspirin, prophylactic apixaban, and therapeutic apixaban groups, respectively, although none were major Limitations : Study was conducted prior to June 2021, limiting generalizability to period of Delta variant predominance and high vaccination rates; potential efficacy of more immediate intervention cannot be ruled out Implications : Among symptomatic clinically stable outpatients with COVID -19, treatment with aspirin or apixaban compared with placebo did not reduce the rate of a composite clinical outcome 3. Colchicine in patients admitted to hospital with COVID -19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open -label, platform trial . RECOVERY Collaborative Group. Lancet Respir Med. 18 Oct 2021. Some anti -inflammatory regimens have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in pati ents with severe COVID -19; colchicine is safe and inexpensive and has a wide range of anti -inflammatory effects, including inhibition of the nucleotide binding domain (NOD) -like pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome which is activated in COVID -19 This is the first large RCT of efficacy and safety of colchicine in hospitalized COVID -19 patients o 177 hospitals in the UK and 2 each in Indonesia and Nepal , Nov 2020 -March 2021 o Randomized to usual care (n=5,730) or usual care plus colchicine (n=5,610; 1 mg at randomization, followed by 500 g 12h later, then 500 g twice a day for 10 days total or until hospital discharge) o Mean age 63.4y, median time since symptom onset 9 days (IQR 6 -12), 94% were receiving cortic osteroids at randomization Primary outcome : There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who died within 28 - days between the two groups (1173 [21%] patients in the colchicine group vs 1190 [21%] patients in the usual [95% CI 0\u00b793 o Similar results across all pre -specified subgroups (including age, sex, ethnicity, level of respiratory support , use of corticosteroids ) and in exploratory analysis by baseline CRP Secondary outcomes: no difference s between groups in median time to discharge from hospital alive (10 days in both groups) , or probability of being discharged alive within 28 days, or composite outcome of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death Implications : This large , well -powered randomized trial with more than 2000 deaths found no evidence of a mortality benefit of colchicine among hospitalized COVID -19 patients VACCINE s Safety 4. Adverse Effects after BNT162b2 Vaccine and SARS -CoV-2 Infection, According to Age and Sex. Dagan et al. NEJM. 27 Oct 2021. Updated report of previously published study presenting subgroup data by age (10 -year age groups) and sex on adverse events following Pfizer -BioNTech vaccination or natural SARS -CoV-2 infection Myocarditis o After vaccination, the risk was increased mostly among young male adolescents and adults (16 - 39 years ), with 8.62 excess events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 2.82 to 14.35) o After infection, the risk was increased in both age categories ( 16-39 and 40 years) and in both male and female adolescents and adults, with 11.54 excess events per 100,000 pers ons (95% CI, 2.48 to 22.55) in young male adolescents and adults Limitations : Due to small numbers of events and wide confidence intervals in certain subgroups, results should be interpreted with caution Implications : Small increased risk of myocarditis was observed after both vaccination and SARS -CoV-2 infection and was more pronounced after natural infection Efficacy 5. Laboratory -Confirmed COVID -19 Among Adults Hospitalized with COVID -19-Like Illness with Infection -Induced or mRNA Vaccine -Induced SARS -CoV-2 Immunity \u2014 Nine Sta tes, January - September 2021 . Bozio et al. MMWR. 29 Oct 2021. Among adults with COVID -19-like illness hospitalization at 187 hospitals in 9 states from Jan -Sept 2021, investigators compared the odds of having PCR -confirmed COVID -19 between unvaccinated pati ents with a previous SARS -CoV-2 infection and patients who were fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine and had no prior documented infection o Prior infection or vaccination occurred 90 -179 days before hospitalization o Patients who did not receive SARS -CoV-2 testing >14 days before hospitalization were excluded 7,348 patients met eligibility criteria; 1,020 hospitaliza tions were among previously infected and unvaccinated persons, and 6,328 were among fully vaccinated and previously uninfected Odds of laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 among hospitalized patients were greater than five times higher among previously infected, unvaccinated patients than among fully vaccinated patients (aOR = 5.49; 95% CI = 2.75 -10.99) o The effect was more pronounced amo ng patients aged >65y (aOR=19.57) than for those aged 18-64y (aOR -2.57; p for interaction = 0.05) o Similar results were observed in secondary analyses that considered Delta variant predominance or considered different time intervals since previous infection or full vaccination Limitations : Limited data to assess relative protection of vaccination versus infection by product type , age or time since infection or vaccination; potential misclassification if vaccinated individuals are less likely to seek testing and may in fact have been infected; possible confounding by behavioral differences between groups Implications : All eligible individuals should be vaccinated, including those previously infected with SARS -CoV-2 IMMUNOLOGY 6. Cytokine signature and COVID -19 prediction models in the two waves of pande mics . Cabaro et al. Scientific Reports . 21 Oct 2020. This study was designed to determine if there are common patterns of cytokines between two waves of the pandemic (Italy) in individuals with mild or severe/critical forms of COVID -19 and whether machine learning approach could be useful to identify cytokines which might predict clinical disease First wave was defined as March -May 2020 with 65 individuals + 49 controls; Bio -Plex multiplex Human Cytokine and Growth factor kits were used to determine concentration of ~27 proteins o A significant increasing trend of IL -1, IL -1ra, IL -2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, across the three groups (ControlsMild COVID -19Severe COVID -19); groups defined by WHO clinical scores; severe patients were significantly older than mild or controls o Linear Discri minant Analysis (LDA) recognized the three groups based on (accuracy 0.96, 95% CI: (0.91, 0.99)); IL-6, IL-8, and IP showed either diagnostic and /or prognostic classification performance , with an AUC>0.95 in at least 2 out of t he 3 groups (Control vs mild+severe COVID -19; mild vs control+severe COVID -19; severe vs control+mild COVID -19) o Classification and Regression Tree (CART) indicated that IL -6 discriminated controls and COVID - 19 patients; combination of IL -6 and IL -8 defined disease severity (overall accuracy was 0.85; 95% CI: (0.77, 0.91)) Second wave , Sept -Oct 2020, 36 patients + 15 controls; fewer cytokine s were significantly different between clinical groups o Differences and increasing trends of IL -1, IL -1ra, IL -2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM -CSF, -, were the three groups -19Severe -19); only IL -1ra, IL-2, IL-6 and IFN - concentrations were significantly higher in serum of mild and severe COVID -19 patients compared to controls o CART analysis was carried out using data of the 2nd wave as test sample. Test accuracy was 0.68; 95% CI: (0.54, 0.80), with a low sensitivity for the discrimination of severe COVID -19 and low specificity for mild COVID -19 patients o Challenge of this prediction model with data from the 2nd wave achieved an a ccuracy of 0.83; 95% CI: (0.68, specificity of 0.73, indicating IL-6 as the best predictor of COVID -19 Limitations : Treatment approaches change d between waves , and potential confound ers were not controlled for in the analysis (i.e., steroid use) ; sample sizes were relatively small per group - especially in second wave Implications : Serum cytokine patterns may provide biomarkers useful for COVID -19 diagnosis or prognosis "}
