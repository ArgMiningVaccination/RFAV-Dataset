The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based informati on on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technologies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research or ganizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review prio r to their release. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence report s and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality.

PsycINFO were searched from 1995 to March 2, 2009 inclusive. Review Methods: Standard systematic review methodology was employed. Eligibility criteria varied by question, but overall, specified studies reported in English, excluded qualitative designs, and limited populations to those unselected for pre-existing risk (except for Q2). Study designs and outcomes varied by research question. Results: One hundred and thirty-seven publications were eligible in total for this review. Q1: Key elements of FH: Eighty-nine studies were eligible fo r this question of which 59 reported FH and data on subsequent or current disease in subjects. The varied definitions of positive FH were consistently associated with elev ated relative risks, but their valu e in predicting future risk or detecting current disease was difficult to assess without considering further information on other risk factors or the available preventive interventions. Q2: Accuracy of FH Reporting. Thirty- seven studies evaluated accuracy and showed relatively high specificity and low sensitivity across all disease categories. Q3: Uptake of preventive interventions. Two studies evaluated the impact of FH-based risk and the evidence was in sufficient to establish any effect on change in clinical preventive behavior or uptake of interventions. Q4: Harms of FH taking. Three studies evaluated the impact of FH-bas ed risk information on psychological outcomes and indicated no evidence of significant harm. Q5: Factors affecting FH collection: The evidence base for addressing Q5 is heterogeneous and limited to six studies exploring th e association between various factors and family history reporting, documenta tion and discussion. Conclusions: Our review indicates: (Q1) Many FH de finitions showed low discriminatory accuracy in predicting disease risk in individuals but further research is warranted; (Q2) accuracy of reporting is higher for relatives without, than those affected by, a given disease; (Q3) there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of FH-based risk asse ssment on preventive behaviors; (Q4) there is limited evidence to assess whether the provision of FH-based personalized risk assessment results in adverse outcomes; (Q5) th ere is little evidence on factors affecting FH reporting and collection in primary care.

Executive Summary Background Family history (FH) represents the integrati on of shared genomic and environmental risk factors.1 First degree relatives (1DR s) share half their genomic information (roughly one copy of 30-50,000 genes), and also behaviors, lifestyles, beliefs, culture, and physical environment, so their disease experience may offer a clue to shared susceptibiliti es. This suggests that a 'low tech' clinical approach-family hist ory-might be a practical and usef ul way to target interventions and disease prevention efforts to those most at ri sk. There is empirical evidence to support the common observation that a positive FH confers an extra risk for many diseases: for example, detailed meta-analyses have convincingly demons trated the association between having one or more 1DRs and risk of a numb er of common, complex disorders. However, appreciation that there is a link between FH and di sease risk needs to be matched by evidence-based approaches to capturing and using such information in different clinical contexts. This systematic review attempts to address five key issues relevant to the practical value of systematically collecting FH information in prim ary care practice; what are the most useful elements of FH for assessing dise ase risk; can we be confident th at individuals report FH for common diseases sufficiently and accurately; does systematic coll ection and use of FH information lead to positive health outcomes, and are there associated harms; what factors promote or hinder collecting and using FH information? The focus of this review is FH collection with in the primary care context, where unselected populations present the full range of disease risks, where primary ca re practitioners undertake the activity, and where the goal is chronic disease risk assessment and prevention as an end in itself. Scope and Purpose of the Systematic Review This systematic review addresses five research questions (Q) relating to routine use of FH information in risk assessment for complex disorders, as follows: Q1. What are the key elements of a family hi story in a primary care setting for the purposes of risk assessment for common diseases? Q2. What is the accuracy of the family history, and under what conditions does the accuracy vary? Q3. What is the direct evidence that routinely getting a family history will improve health outcomes for the patient and/or family? Q4. What is the direct evidence that routinely getting a family history will result in adverse outcomes for the patient and/or family? Q5. What are the factors that encourage or di scourage obtaining and using a family history? Research recommendations from each of these five questions were to be drawn together to answer Q6 in the conclusion. Q6. What are future research directions fo r assessing the value of family history for common diseases in the primary care setting? 1 Methods The five key research questions required inte rrogation across different domains of primary research literature. Therefore, standard systematic review methodology was employed, but eligibility criteria varied between questions. Fo r all questions, these cr iteria were guided by discussion with the technical expert panel and partners. Bibliographic databases searched for this review included: Controlled Trial Register (CCTR)\u00ae, and PsycINFO. Years searched were 1995 to March 2, 2009 inclusive. Eligibility criteria included English studies eval uating collection of FH for all diseases, with the exception of Q1 where we limited studies to those evaluating primary cancers (breast, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, a nd lung), cardiovascular diseases , mental health disorders, diabetes, asthma, and atopy. Interventions were de fined as a structured/s ystematic collection of FH (Q1, 2, 3, and 4) or as correla tes or factors facilita ting or hindering the co llection of FH (Q5). Populations were limited to those unselected for ri sk and typical for primary care settings with the exception of Q2. Study designs varied by research question; we excluded case control studies for Q1, observational studies for Q3 and Q4, a nd qualitative studies for all questions. The outcomes also varied with each research questio n and included disease incidence, metrics of accuracy, uptake of recommended preventive inte rventions, harms (e.g., psychological distress), and quality of FH collection. For research Q1, the analysis was aimed at comparing the discriminatory accuracy of different definitions of 'positive' FH, which mi ght be used in routine clinical practice. Recognizing that the time and re sources available for FH taking in these settings may be very limited, we developed a categorization of FH defin itions to reflect the 'complexity' of the task (category A to E). It is important to note that this initial attemp t at categorization is based on a notion of 'likely effort required', not on any a priori notion of the information value of the pedigree itself. Our rationale is that the FH definition which balances 'adequate' predictive validity with least effort (lowest category) might be the most likely to be useful in routine primary care settings. Results The search yielded 32,444 unique citations. During three levels of title and abstract screening, 31,190 articles were excluded. A to tal of 1,254 citations pr oceeded to full text screening. After the final eligibil ity screening, 137 publications were eligible for data extraction. Question 1. What are the Key Elements of a Family History in a Primary Care Setting for the Purposes of Risk Assessment for Common Diseases? Sixty-one reports of 59 studies were identified which met the eligibility criteria, reported FH definitions, and presented data which could be analyzed.2-62 In addition, one paper63 did not present data which could be included in the main analysis, but was descriptively summarized because the data were direct ly relevant to the research question. A further 17 papers64-80 were eligible but did not define FH, and 10 papers81-90 did not report interp retable data. These are 2 excluded from the results below. No studies a ddressing lung cancer or ovarian cancer were identified. Breast Cancer Two longitudinal,3,4 and two cross-sectional,5,6 studies were included. Four definitions of 'positive FH' based on affected re latives were examined in five analyses. For the longitudinal analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.06- 0.26, and specificities 0.86- 0.95. The range of positive predictive values (PPVs) was 0.01-0.05 , and negative predictive values (NPVs) 0.98- 0.99, for breast cancer prevalences up to 2.5 percent in the study samples. Fo r the cross-sectional analyses, the sensitivities were 0.05 and 0.15, w ith corresponding specificities of 0.97 and 0.90. The PPVs were 0.01 and 0.09 and NPVs were 0.99 and 0.95, for prevalences of 0.7 and 5.4 percent, respectively. Only a few discrete FH definitions were av ailable for comparison, and there were too few data points to examine the area under the curve (AUC) from summary receiver operator characteristics (SROC) curves. The most sensitiv e FH marker for risk of future breast cancer appeared to be 'at least one aff ected 1DR'. Conclusions regarding FH definitions used in a cross- sectional (prevalence screening) approach are not possible because an insufficient number of studies were available with a range of defin itions, although the rationale for FH in prevalence screening where other modalities exist is unclear. Colorectal Cancer One longitudinal analysis (based on two separate cohort studies),7 and two cross-sectional studies,8,9 were included. Four definitions of 'positive FH' were examined in multiple analyses, all focusing on 1DRs. The interpre tation of the longitudinal analys es is limited because only one criterion for positive FH was used, (i.e., at leas t one affected 1DR). Sensitivities of 0.13 and 0.14 were obtained for the male and female cohorts with a specificity of 0.92 for both. For both cohorts, the PPVs were 0.02 and th e NPVs 0.99, for underlying colorectal cancer frequency in these two cohorts of approximate ly 1 percent. For the cross-se ctional analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.00 to 0.20, and specificities 0.88 to 1.00. The range of PPVs was 0.00 to 0.07 and NPVs of 0.96 or higher, for overall colorect al cancer prevalences ranging from <1 to 4.5 percent. The AUC for cross-sectional studies for category C FH definitions was 0.64.(based on one study). The results suggest that a simple definition of 'positive FH' ( 1 1DR) is the most sensitive for prediction, but if the underlying disease prev alence was similar to those populations studied, only 2 percent of people fulfilling this definition would actually go on to develop colorectal cancer (CRC) in the subsequent 16-20 years. Th e cross-sectional studie s produced a range of sensitivities with similarly lo w PPVs for detecting current dise ase. The findings provide no definitive evidence of the superiority of one definition over any other for predicting future risk of colorectal cancer or assessing the likelihood of cu rrent disease. Prostate Cancer Four longitudinal, 10-13 and two cross-sectional,14,15 studies were included. Ten discrete definitions of 'positive FH' were examined. For the longitudinal analyses, the range of 3 sensitivities was 0.00-0.21, and spec ificities 0.88-1.00. Omitting one st udy using mortality as the outcome, the range of PPVs was 0.11-0.26, and NPVs 0.92-1.00, for prostate cancer prevalences up to 8.7 percent. For the cross-sectional an alyses, range of sensitivities was 0.01-0.26 and specificities 0.91-1.00. The were 0.02-0.14 and NPVs 0.96-0.98, for prostate cancer prevalences up to 8.7 percent. The majority of definitions available for anal ysis were based on 1DRs and, for longitudinal studies, the overall AUC for category B FH definitions wa s 0.51 and for category, C was 0.93. This suggests a step up in the overall accuracy of cl assification of future risk of prostate cancer when FH of 1DRs generally is taken into account compared with sp ecifically parental or sibling history. It was not possible to calculate this metric for cross-sectional studies. The utility of using FH to predict risk of future prostate cancer or detect current disease depends on which of sensitivity, specificity, and overall classifica tion accuracy would be pr ioritized in routine practice. Coronary Heart Disease Five longitudinal,16-20 and three cross-sectional,21-23 studies were included. Seventeen discrete definitions of 'positive FH' were analyz ed. For the longitudinal analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.03-0.51 and sp ecificities 0.66-0.98. The range of PPVs was 0-0.13 and NPVs 0.66-0.98, for coronary heart disease (CHD) prev alences up to 10.4 perc ent. For the cross- sectional analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.07-0.70 and specificities 0.53-0.98. The range of PPVs was 0.08-0.31, and NPVs 0.83-0.98, for CHD prevalences up to 20.7 percent. Generally speaking, the highest sensitivities for prediction of future CHD risk were observed for the FH definition, 'at least one affected pare nt', although these also had lower specificities than other FH definitions. For category B FH definitions, the AUC was 0.57. For the assessment of possible current disease, the definition 'at le ast one affected 1DR' had a sensitivity of 70 percent, but it was derived from a single study in which the know ledge of disease status may have influenced awareness of FH. The findings are not sufficiently defi nitive to indicate a specific FH definition as the most efficient fo r screening or prediction of future CHD, but provide the foundation for considering how to approach such analyses. Stroke Three longitudinal studies 24-26 were included, allowing examination of three separate definitions of 'positive FH', all relating to parental illness. The range of sensitivities was 0.05-0.33, and specificities 0.71-0.98. The range of PPVs was 0.0.02-0.08 and NPVs 0.96-0.98, for prevalences of stroke up to 3.9 percent. There were no cross-sectional studies. Many of the analyses were derived from one study, 25 and do not provide definitive evidence for the utility of any particular FH definition for predicting the risk of stroke in the future. The AUC for these category B FH definitions was 0.43. Diabetes Five longitudinal,27-31 and 12 cross-sectional,32-43 studies were included, along with the findings of a cross-sectional study63 designed to examine different FH definitions but which did not have analyzable data. Twenty different de finitions of 'positive FH' were analyzed. 4 For the longitudinal analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.02-0.47, and specificities 0.79- 1.0. The range of PPVs was 0.02-0.38, and NPVs 0.86-0.99, for underlying diabetes prevalences up to 16.2 percent. For the cross-sectional anal yses, the range of sensitivities was 0.02-0.83 and specificities 0.44-0.99, for prevalences up to 17.4 percent. One cross-sectional study63 reported the results of applying a three-le vel, FH-based, risk stratificati on system to representative U.S. adult survey data, where the ove rall diabetes prevalence was a pproximately 6.6 percent. Three FH definitions were applied, with sensitivit ies of 0.19-0.48 and specificities of 0.70-0.94. PPVs were 0.05-0.15 and NPVs were 0.95-0.98. Overall, category C FH definitions for prediction of future disease risk ( 1 affected 1DR) had an AUC 0.43. The cross-sectional analyses ex amined a wide range of definitions, but many were assessed within the same study. Some of the highest sensitivities in the review were observed for the cross-sectional diabetes data, although the expect ed trade-off with specificity was also noted. The AUC figures for category B, C, and D FH definitions were similar (0.69, 0.71, and 0.64, respectively) suggesting no useful step up in discriminatory accuracy with extension of FH enquiry beyond 1DRs.. If the findings were replicated in further studies, they might suggest utility in using simple FH markers in preliminary triaging for diabetes screening. Asthma and Atopic Disease Sixteen studies (17 publications) were included, four longitudinal, 44-46,48 eleven cross- sectional,2,49-58 and one59 which was treated as cross-sectiona l, presenting a followup analysis of a random sample of another eligible study.58 Four studies45,46,48,57 were relevant to atopic disease alone, ten2,49,51-56,58,59 to asthma alone, and two44,52 presented analyses for both asthma and atopic disease. Ten separate definitions of 'positive FH' were analyzed. For the longitudinal analyses of atopy, the range of sensitivities was 0.15-0.64, and specificities 0.44-0.91. The range of and NPVs 0.7-0.84, for atopy prevalences up to 38.6 percent. For the cross- sectional analyses of atopy, the range of sensitivities was 0.23-0.48, and specificities 0.56-0.83. The ra nge of and NPVs 0.68-0.74, for atopic disease prevalences up to 36.2 percent. For the longitudinal asthma analyses, th e range of sensitivities was 0.18-0.69 and specificities 0.43-0.91. The range of PPVs wa s 0.17-0.25 and NPVs 0.86-0.89, for an asthma prevalence of 14.8 percent. For the cross-sectiona l analyses, the range of sensitivities was 0.04- 0.76 and specificities 0.46-0.99. For the childhood studies only, the rang e of PPVs was 0.08-0.51 and NPVs 0.82-0.92, for asthma prevalence up to 19.8 percent. For the two adult studies, the PPVs were 0.07, 0.13, and NPVs 0.96 and 0.98, respectively, for prevalences of asthma of 3.1 and 5.5 percent. The longitudinal and cross-secti onal atopy studies did not have su fficient independent data to undertake an AUC analysis. The longitudinal as thma analyses also focused on early childhood onset, and were all based on a single study. There seemed to be a clear increase in sensitivity with looser definition of FH, and a concomitant reduction in specificity, but the discriminatory accuracy was poor (AUC of 0.56). For the cross-sectional studies, category B FH definitions had AUCs of 0.73 (father had asthma) to 0.78 (mother ha d asthma) and category C definitions had an AUC of 0.67, suggesting that identifying disease in one parent provides maximum predictive information. For both disease outcomes (asthma and atopy), the cross-se ctional studies were potentially subject to differential reporting of FH according to awareness of disease status. 5 Mental Illness One longitudinal,60 and one cross-sectional,62 study were included. Both examined outcomes to 26 years of age, and presented data on pred iction of major depressive disorder (MDD); one study60 also examined the mood disorder as an outcome condition, considered a more appropriate measure in childhood and adolesce nce. The longitudinal study60 followed up the third generation of a family study in which the grandparents of th e participants formed th e inception cohort. Four definitions of 'positive FH' were examined. For the longitudinal analyses of MDD, the range of sensitivities was 0.72-0.83 and specificities 0.40-0.59; for mood disorder, th e range of sensitivities was 0.73-0.83 and specificities 0.42-0.63. The range of PPVs fo r MDD was 0.14-0.18 and NPVs 0.92-0.95; for mood disorder, the corresponding metrics were 0.24-0.31 and 0.89-0.92. The overall prevalence of MDD for this study was 11.2 percent, and of mood disorder was 18.6 percent. A relatively high proportion of participants met at least one of the definitions for positive FH (44.1-62.7 percent), reflecting the constitution of the original cohort. The cross-sectional analyses produced sensitivities of 0.12 and 0.24 a nd specificities of 0.85 and 0.96, respectively. The PPVs and 0.45, and NPVs were 0.79 and 0.78, respectively, for a prevalence of MDD of 23.2 percent. For prediction of MDD and mood disorders up to early adulthood, all three FH definitions produced sensitivities at the high end of the range observed in this review. They were derived from a single study and their app licability to routine primary care practice is unclear. For the cross-sectional study, only two FH definitions we re examined, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the utility of either for screening for underlyi ng MDD. It was not possible to calculate AUC for any of this data. Question 2. What is the Accuracy of the Family History, and Under What Conditions Does the Accuracy Vary? A total of 37 publications evaluated the accuracy of reporting FH and were eligible for data extraction. There were 16 studies that evaluate d accuracy of reporting cancer FH. These studies recruited probands with breast cancer, 91-94 colorectal cancer,95-97 prostate Sarcoma,103 melanoma,105 and unspecified cancer.106 Subjects were pr edominately from specialized settings or cancer registries , which would suggest high risk of spectrum and selection bias. Twelve studies evaluated accuracy in persons with mental health disorders that included persons with Schizophrenia,107-109 persons with dementia or depression,110-113 and mixed disorders.114-117 Nine studies evaluated other diseases that included Parkinson's disease,118-120 diabetes,121-124 hypertension,121,123,125-127 and other cardiovascular disease.123-125,128 One study collected family history but reported only on the accuracy of info rmant age of onset rather than accuracy of disease status in the relatives; as such the re sults were not extracted for our research question.118 The methods for FH collection varied across stud ies as did the questions or tools used to collect FH. Some used highly standardized in struments and others used dichotomous probing (presence or absence of disease in any relative). Methods used to ve rify relatives' disease status were primarily multimodal (medical records, disease or death registry, contact with relative) and relatives for whom verification could not be obtained were excluded from analyses. 6 Most studies probed the accuracy of reporting the same disease as that within the proband/ informant, but some studies probed a variety of disease outcomes, for exam ple any cancer or any mental health disorder. Overall, specificity across all disease types and with varying modes of FH collection was consistently high. Sensitivitie s were lower and generally more variable depending on the disease outcome. Some of the mental health disorders showed the lowest sensitivities, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease showed the highest values. Several studies evaluated predictors of accur acy in reporting FH. Factors related to the proband/informant includes age, gender, disease stat us, education level, race, marital status, type of disease, setting, and insurance status. Predictiv e factors associated with the relatives include, degree of relation, type of 1DR, disease subgr oup, age, gender, and time since diagnosis. No clear trend emerged with age, gender, or educa tion level of the informants and their impact on accuracy. No clear pattern across diseases emerges with the exception that there was a consistent trend towards increased accuracy of reporting re lating to 1DRs compared to 2DRs or 3DRs; however, the majority of studies evaluated only 1DRs. Overall, these 37 studies had a high risk of spectrum bias (populations high ly selected and not reflective of primary care), verification bias (different methods used inconsistent ly), and masking bias which may cause an overestimation of accuracy. Question 3. What is the Direct Evidence That Routinely Getting a Family History Will Improve Health Outcomes for the Patient and/or Family? We selected studies that identified the imp act on health related outcomes of systematic collection of FH in a typical, non-selected pr imary care/general population. Only two studies were identified after full text review. 129,130 Both studies were uncont rolled before-after designs and focused on breast cancer risk assessment, in cluding FH collection, as the target intervention. In both studies, there was limited improvement in the clinically relevant process measure of mammography screening. In one study129 mammography screening improved from 76 to 93 percent, however, the matched sample was sma ll (n=29) and the change in screening did not reach statistical significance (p=0.057). There was no differentiation of the improvement in breast screening habits between the different risk strata. In the second study there was also limited improvement in adherence to mammography in all women (p=0.796) and for each age group (40-49; >=50 years old). Further, in women with high breast cancer risk (relative risk >=1.7) the adherence fell from 81 percent (17/21 ) to 71 percent (15/21), although this did not reach statistical significance (p<0.317). Both studies also demonstrated improvements in adherence to other process measures: breast self exam (BSE) and clinical breast exam (CBE). Both studies were at risk of se lection bias sufficient to affect the interpretation of the results. Question 4. What is the Direct Evidence That Routinely Getting a Family History Will Result in Adverse Outcomes for the Patient and/or Family? Three studies met all eligibility criteria. 131-133 These comprised a randomized controlled trial 133and two uncontrolled before after studies.131,132 Each of studies recruited patients from single 7 British primary care office network with the number of respondents recruited varying and response rates of 19, 29, and 64 pe rcent respectively. The proportion of recruited patients completing survey items at all time points was 91, 89, and 76 percent re spectively. Th ese studies suggest that structured FH collection and f eedback of familial risk information had no deleterious psychological effects on patients at 6 to 12 weeks after FH intervention. One study131 further identified the relationship between breas t cancer familial risk status and psychological impact. As well as having no deleterious psychol ogical effect in any of the risk groups, for women who were at or just above average ri sk, the FH risk assessment may have led to appropriate reductions in perceived risk. Question 5. What are the Factors That Encourage or Discourage Obtaining and Using a Family History? Six studies were identified, four of whic h were undertaken in primary care offices.134-137 The other two studies' populations were derived from patients bei ng screened in the general population.138,139 Four studies were cross-sectional.135,136,138,139 The remaining two studies were a direct observational study137 and a prospective cohort study w ith a baseline cross-sectional survey.134 Factors associated with FH collection or discussion were the primary outcomes of interest of three studies.136,137,139 These data were retrieved in the other three studies from sub analyses presented in these publications.134,135,138 Two studies only recruited female patients.136,138 The identified outcomes of interest were: FH documented in medical records;134,136 FH discussed by doctor, either confirmed by direct observation137 or patient survey;135,138 and self reported FH.136,139 Women appeared to be better in formants than men were and younger physicians were more enthusiastic about discussing FH. There were disparities in FH collection and reporting in underserved groups, specifically non-white ethic groups,136,139 those with lower educational status,139 and those on state health insurance.137 The evidence base for addressing Q5 is heter ogeneous and limited to six studies exploring the association between various factors and FH reporting, documentation and discussion. In most studies the nature of the FH disc ussed or reported was not clearly identified, often just reported as dichotomous variables. Repres entativeness of these surveys is also limited by response bias and recall bias. Collectively, these issues limit the generalizability of the study findings, hence caution should be observed in applying this inform ation to clinical situations in primary care. Discussion and Conclusions This review was designed to inform a broad ra nge of questions which ultimately address the clinical value of using FH in chronic disease risk assessment and prevention. The findings from studies reviewed in Q1, Q2, and Q5 should inform the nature and content of future FH tools, which should be developed according to the context in which the tools are being applied. A tool used for an initial general FH screening enquir y, such as during a new patient intake visit or routine physical examination, woul d generally be less focused than one developed for a specific purpose, such as identifying possible familial ri sk in a woman concerned because of a breast cancer diagnosis in a sibling. Th e starting point should be clar ifying the minimal FH dataset necessary for each purpose, taking account of th e evidence for accuracy, re call, and relevance of each piece of information. 8 1. Very few studies were designed to address Q1 directly, and the metrics reported usually related to strength of association between FH a nd disease incidence or prevalence rather than discriminatory ability when applied to individual patients. Our analyses were based largely on a re-examination of data generated for other re search purposes. In most cases, positive FH, however defined, had no more than modest ability to correctly classify fu ture risk of complex disorders in individuals. This is logical, because, by definition, they are not high penetrance single gene disorders. The required level of pr edictive accuracy depends on the purpose of the FH assessment, and the benefits, risks, and costs of decisions made based on the risk assessment. In principle, the definition of 'positive FH' which combines adequate predictive accuracy with the least effort to obtain it would be most suited to busy primary care settings. Recommendations for direction of future research: Further clarification of the purpose of FH ta king in primary care settings is required, so that future assessments of the utility of FH are based on an appreciation of the level of predictive accuracy that is required for the specific situation. The evidence base requires studies designe d explicitly for the purpose of examining the predictive ability of different 'minimum ' FH definitions. This requires adequately powered, longitudinally designed studies in wh ich detailed, extensive, clearly defined and documented FH components comprise the 'exposures', in which participants are followed up for a period which is clinically meaningful, in which adequate measures are taken to control bias, and in which the primary metrics relate to individual risk prediction. FH items should be formally examined alongside other recommended or readily accessible risk factors, in orde r to identify the extent to which they provide (or need to provide) useful independent and/or incremental discriminatory ability. 2. The accuracy of self reported FH has implications for the correct risk assessment and management of patients. Accurate reporting of the absence of dis ease (specificity) appears to be more common than accurate reporting of presence of disease (sensitivity) across different disease areas. Estimates of sensitivity s how greater variation and the ma gnitude varies with different diseases. Although, there is limited evidence, accuracy of recall and reporting may be influenced by both patient and informant (relative) factors, and by the method used to collect FH. Accuracy of FH reporting may also be dependent on the method of collection, which is related to the disease area however, further evaluation is needed. Recommendations for direction of future research: Future studies in accuracy should be undertaken in populations reflective of the primary care setting and representative of the spectrum of disease risk. Future studies should endeavor to bette r characterize the a ttributes of the informant/proband and especially the relatives; the potential of these factors to influence the accuracy of reporting should be consistently evaluated. Future evaluation should be undertaken in the ar eas of asthma and atopy, affective mental health disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. 3. Within primary care populations, there is very limited evidence to support or refute the effect on risk-reducing behavior changes of taking a FH and us ing it to personalize risk of developing respective conditions. Recommendations for future research: 9 10 Well designed trials are required that comp are the impact of FH-based, personalized risk advice with standard of care on ri sk reducing behaviors in populations at different risk levels (incl uding population risk). The outcome s of interest need to be clinically relevant, either leading to imp roved mortality or morbidity or surrogate measures with strong evidence of links to improved health outcomes. Concurrent qualitative studies should also be considered. Proposed trials should be based on evidence fr om systematic reviews to ensure that prescribed risk-reducing beha viors are evidence-based. 4. In primary care populations, there is very limited information to evaluate direct harm incurred from the routine practice of taking FH and using it to personali ze risk information. Recommendations for future research: Trials of FH taking as an intervention s hould include capture of data to examine the full range of potential impacts on individuals of FH collection and implementation strategies based on familial risk identifi cation, both negative and positive. Concurrent qualitative studies should also be consider ed. Baseline data on psychological status should be captured so that this can forma lly be adapted for use in outcome analyses. To enable appropriate evaluation of psyc hological harm, context-specific measures need to be developed and validated. 5. In order to assess the conten t validity of systematic FH t ools we need to know not only the factors that affect the recall of FH (Q2) but also those factor s that affect the collection and use of FH. Thus far, there is limited informa tion on collection and discussion of FH in primary care, with no factors identified that are associ ated with the use of the FH. There is some suggestion that populations from underserved communities are less likely to report and have the opportunity to discuss FH, but th e level of evidence is weak. Recommendations for future research: Further research is required to clarify the most important patient and practitioner factors that may affect th e collection and use of FH. This likely requires the development of theoretical frameworks to gui de appropriate design, and to ensure that methodologies adequately address the many potential biases and in teractions between factors which may be encountered. The most important studies are those that address factors directly relevant to primary car e practice, including highlighting patient factors which promote inequity in the application of effective interventions Where inequities are identified, interventions should be designed to ameliorate these factors in future trials and service provision. Such research could include analyses of national population and practitioner survey databases. While research should focus on clinically relevant outcomes, it should also include process evaluations to identify factors that affect the successful implementation of the FH interventions. Evidence Report Chapter 1. Introduction Background According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost half of Americans live with at least one chronic condition, and chronic diseases account for 70 percent of all deaths in the United States, one third of potential years of life lost before 65, and three quarters of medical care costs.140 Although the role of important risk fact ors such tobacco, nutrition, and physical activity are well known, there ar e many unknown factors that contribute to risk and which prevent completely accurate individualized risk assessment across a range of diseases. Nevertheless, it is possible that a traditional, 'low tech' approach to risk assessment-family history-might be practical and useful for wide spread application, to assist in identifying particular risks carried by indi viduals, in order to target in terventions and efforts on disease prevention. Family history (FH) represents the in tegration of shared genomic and environmental risk factors. 1 First degree relatives (1DRs) share ha lf their genomic information (roughly one copy of 30-50,000 genes), and so their disease experience may offer a clue to shared susceptibilities, even in the absence of a comp lete understanding of the molecular etiology of a given condition. While FH assessment is a core a pproach in clinical genetics, FH may offer much more than the possibility of identifying re latively rare inherited diseases which follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Approached as a 'black box' FH may prov ide information on the influence of genetic variants which, collectively , act to increase or decrease disease susceptibility, and on other familial factors which alter risk (such as shared behaviors and lifestyles). Family history may therefore be a cost effective way of tapping into 'integrated' disease risk information. 141 For most common chronic diseases, the impact of a positive FH has been recognized. For example, a population-based study in Utah observed that 14 percent of families accounted for 72 percent of the premature corona ry heart disease (CHD) in the state, and 11 percent of families accounted for 86 percent of premature cerebrovascular disease; 142 in another study 30 percent of middle-aged British men w ho report a FH of CHD experience a 71 percent excess risk of CHD themselves over 10 years.143 Further, we are aware of the individual roles of obesity and FH in predicting the development of diabetes, but in combination, the predictive value increases from around 20 to 40 percent. Support for this approach also comes from a detailed meta-analysis,144 in which the association between having one or more 1DRs and risk of a number of common, complex disorders was convincingly demonstrated. However, there are important issues that need to be addressed regardi ng the overall utility of using FH information in primary care settings. The first issue relates to the capture of FH information in itself. For FH information to be useful, there should be some confidence that patients are able to report it accurately and cons istently. This has been addressed for some cancers in a previous review.145 Secondly, there should be evidence that health professionals in primary care can capture such inform ation accurately. Previous reviews145,146 have examined FH tools and demonstrated that the systematic use of a FH tool improves accuracy and completeness Appendixes and Evidence Tables for this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/famhis timprov/famhimp.pdf . 13 of information capture. It appears that the crucial issue is use of a tool, ra ther than its specific format, although further research may clarify whether any particular attri butes (such as patient- completed versus professional-completed, or electr onic versus paper) offer specific advantages for use in particular settings. An important issu e which needs to be addr essed is the 'minimum FH dataset' necessary for application in pr imary care settings for chronic disease risk prediction.147-151 It is important to bear in mind that pr imary care practitioners face constraints in relation to capturing FH information,152 and cannot necessarily replicate the practice of genetics specialists in completing detailed, three generational pedigrees. A broader, but crucial question is that of the overall benefi ts and harms of capturing FH information. Like any health care interventi on, FH-based risk assessment carries resource implications and opportunity costs. Thus, its im pact on health outcomes, both beneficial and harmful, should be assessed objectively in or der to promote evidence-informed practice and policy. Overall Evaluation Approach In approaching these questions, we have borro wed from a range of evaluative frameworks including: methods developed in diagnostic and screening test research (applied to assessing individual FH items for their predictive valid ity, and for the assessmen t of accuracy of FH reporting): methods for the assessmen t of the effectiveness and safe ty of clinical interventions (applied to FH taking as a delib erate clinical intervention); and classical epidemiological methods (applied to the assessment of factors wh ich promote or hinder FH taking as a routine clinical activity). Scope and Purpose of the Systematic Review This systematic review addresses six research questions relating to the analytic validity, the clinical validity, and the clinical utility of routinely using FH info rmation in risk assessment for complex disorders, as follows. 1. What are the key elements of a family history in a primary care setting for the purposes of risk assessment for common diseases? 2. What is the accuracy of the family history, and under what conditions does the accuracy vary? 3. What is the direct evidence that routinely getting a family history will improve health outcomes for the patient and/or family? 4. What is the direct evidence that routinely ge tting a family history will result in adverse outcomes for the patient and/or family? 5. What are the factors that encourage or discourage obtaining and using a family history? 6. What are future research directions for a ssessing the value of family history for common diseases in the primary care setting? Regarding research question 1, the specifi c disease categories of interest were: breast, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers cardiovascular and heart disease stroke diabetes 14 15 asthma and allergies (atopic disease) major depression and mood disorders in addition, key elements for consider ation were information relating to: ancestry number of affected or unaffected relatives lineage age of onset sex or gender relationship (first degree, second degree) Question 6 is addressed by drawi ng together the evidence from que stions 1 to 5 and therefore is not evaluated separately. The fo cus of this review is on using FH in primary care contexts, and as an intervention mainly for chronic disease risk assessment in large population groups, not assessment of rare genetic disorder s in high risk groups. This has driv en the eligibility criteria for studies towards: study populations with the range of disease risk seen in primary care and general settings study settings where primary care providers su ch as family physicia ns, internists, nurse practitioners, and obstetricia ns are taking family hist ories and assessing risk family history taking as an intervention car ried out by primary care practitioners and directed primarily towards chronic disease ri sk assessment and prevention as an end in itself chronic disease prevention inte rventions evaluated in primary care or general populations with an inherent range of disease risks, but not selected because of special high risk (genetic or otherwise) The focus on study populations \"unselected\" fo r high risk implies gr oups of participants, which represent a full range of ri sks, potentially from very low to very high, by definition with clustering around an \"average\" value. These populati ons reflect the context of professional and patient decision-making in primary care - patients with a wide range of ri sks are encountered, but most are neither particularly high nor particularly low risk. This situation is dis tinguished from that where patients and their prov iders already have reason to susp ect high disease risk, as such populations are more homogenous and are designed to exclude individuals who are likely to be average and low risk. While findi ngs from 'unselected' populations may possibly be applicable to high risk groups, the c onverse cannot be assumed. Family history taking is a health care interv ention and its evaluation requires as much attention to potential bias as any other intervention. An im portant potential confounder in assessing this intervention is pre-existing awar eness of family illness. Living with a serious disease within a family can influence risk perceptions and health behaviors,153,154 quite independently of any intervention by a health pr ofessional. This means that the effect of FH taking as a deliberate clinical activity can only be meaningfully assessed using well-designed studies that can address confoundi ng and bias. Family history taking is also an inherently complex intervention and needs to be separated from other activities, such as genetic testing. Chapter 2. Methods Analytic Framework The analytic framework is a schematic repr esentation of the stra tegy for showing the relationships between the primary exposure, which is the collection of family history (FH), and the outcomes of interest for each research ques tion (Q). Figure 1 shows the inter-relationships among the six research questions being a ddressed in this systematic review. The framework shows the logical connection between the research questions, commencing with the accuracy of clients reporting their family history (FH) (Q2). If we consider a key purpose for collecting family history, as a test to screen or identifying clients who might be at an altered risk for developing the same disease, th en the selection of the optimal items that will comprise a comprehensive FH should be consider ed; evaluation of the ev idence for those items that are most predictive of s ubsequent disease development is sought in (Q1). Evaluation of the evidence for the impact of collecting FH is addressed in the third research question (Q3). The potential for harmful outcomes as a result of collecting FH will also be addressed (Q4). The context in which FH is collected and factor s that may facilitate or hinder its collection also have bearing on the validity of collecting FH (Q5). These cont extual factors (Q5) and those related to accuracy of reporting (Q2) may influen ce the optimal selection of items to be included within a set constituting adequate FH collection for risk assessment in a primary care setting (Q1). Following the systematic collection of FH in a population representative of primary care, the uptake of prevention, screen ing, and other interventions are important outcomes of benefit that may result. The strength of the evidence fr om studies addressing Q1 through Q5 will inform future directions for assessing the value of FH on common chronic diseases in the primary care setting (Q6). Search Strategy Bibliographic databases searched Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR)\u00ae, and PsycINFO. Years searched were 1995 to March 2, 2009 inclusive. Our broad based s earch was not restricted by disease type, and yielded a very large num ber of titles and abstracts; as su ch, we limited the search to 1995 forward. Detailed search strategies are listed in Appendix A. We reviewed a limited number of grey literature sites, including NCPEQ and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). In addition, we retrieved and evaluated references from eligib le studies that were no t captured in our search. Hand searching was not undertaken.

A ll levels of screening were done in web-based ware (SRS) (TrialSt at Corporation, Ottawa, Ontario Canada). Standardized forms and a training manual explai ning the criteria were developed and reviewed wit creening ed for use in SR S (Appendix B). All eligible udies from full text screening were abstracted onto a data form according to predetermined ctor transferred the da ta onto these forms, and another checked the answers for accuracy before they were entered into SRS. Data entries were verified by the inv sidered the ssessment of quality separately for each research question. For Q 1, the large number of studies and di sease types, which served in part, to stratify studies by sim ar risk for biases. The study designs for the eligible studies of Q1 were classified as lon 3 of the QUADAS were not applicable to collecting FH from info dies. before bias (mea Systematic Review Soft h the screeners (Appendix B). For the title and abstract phase, two reviewers evaluated each citation for eligibility. Ar ticles were retrieved if either one of the reviewers judged it as meeting eligibility criteria or if there was insufficient in formation to determine eligibility. For s of full text articles, two screeners came to consensus on the identification, selection, and abstraction of information. Disagreements that c ould not be resolved by consensus were resolved by one of our McMaster re search team members. Data Extraction Appropriate data collection form s were develop stcriteria. One data extra estigators responsible fo r summarizing the different report results sections. Quality Assessment Given the diversity of research questions a nd eligible study designs, we con awere grouped by study design il gitudinal and cross sectional. Cohort studies where FH was a ssessed at the same point as disease outcome was ascertained were considered cross sectional studies. For quality assessment we selected questions on method of sampling, and participation rates for the cross sectional studies; we evaluated method of disease outcome ascertainment, method of family history ascertainment, and an accounting of withdrawals for all study designs (see Appendix B forms for the specification of the criteria). For Q2, the Quality Assessment of Dia gnostic Accuracy Assessment (QUADAS) was selected and all but four items within the 14 criteria were applicable for the \"index test\" of collecting FH. Appendix B details the criteria and the method of standardizing responses. Criteria from items 3, 4, 12, and 1 rmants and verifying the diseases in relatives. In applying these QUADAS items, we assumed that the index test (FH collection) and th e reference test were equivalent across stu Appendix B shows the modifications and inte rpretation of the QUADAS for this question. There were two different desi gns among studies eligible for research Q3 and Q4; for the randomized clinical trials, the Jadad scale 155 was used to evaluate inte rnal validity. For the after study design no formal scale was available, critical appraisal was undertaken for the risk of selection and outcome biases. For eligible cross s ectional studies for research Q5, selection thod of sampling) and response bias were evaluated. 26 Summarizing our Findings: Descriptive and Analytic Approaches A q omes for all ether and treated as a single study with the m rted for presentation of summary sults.

Clinical erall discriminatory acc r each taken , TN, nitions to notion of 'likely effort required', not on any a priori notion of the info t imated th e area under the curve (AUC) and the index Q* and are ualitative descriptive approach was used to summarize study characteristics and outc research questions. Multiple publications on the same study cohort were grouped tog ost curre nt data repo re racteristics, as well as study results, were created. Meta-analysis was not appropriate for any of the research questions. It was not undertaken for Q1 because of significant clinical he terogeneity across studies, and because many observations were compared within studies, therefore the studies were not completely independent. Similarly, it was not undertaken in Q2 be ss studies, too few studies for some disease cat egories, or insufficient data (no measures of variance). There were an insufficien t number of studies and Q4 for meta-analysi and methodological heteroge neity was significant for eligible studies in Q5. For research Q1, the purpose of the analysis wa s to compare the discriminatory accuracy of specific FH items and definitions of 'positive' FH which might be used in routine clinical practice. The ideal method would have been a meta -regression analysis to assess the contribution of the different variables of intere st (ancestry, lineage, age of onset, etc) to ov uracy. However, no studies were identified which permitted such an analysis. In order to address the research question, therefore, a simpler, alternative a pproach was developed. Fo study, all definitions of 'positive FH' which were associated with analyzable data (see below) were recorded and, within disease condition, sim ilar FH definitions (e.g., 'mother', 'father', 'at least one 1DR', etc.,) were grouped for comparison. We approached the definitions from a pragmatic clinical perspective, rather than epid emiological perspective so that in studies with multiple definitions we combined data from mutually exclusive categories into inclusive categories. For example, the category 'affected mother' included data from the categories 'mother only' and 'both parents'. Thus, the category \"affected mo ther\" should generally be to mean, \"affected mother, whether or not the father also affected. We extracted the actual numbers of true and false positive and negative results (TP, FP and FN) according to these definitions, or estimated these numbers based on reported proportions. We calculated sensitivities, and sp ecificities with the accompanying 95 percent confidence intervals (CI). Recognizing the primary care context for the review, in which the time and resources available for FH taking may be very limited, we de veloped a categorization of FH defi reflect the 'complexity' of the task (Table 2). It is important to note that this initial attempt at categorization is based on a rmation value of the pedigree itself. We suggest that the FH definition that combines 'adequate' predictive validity with least effort (l owest category) might be the most likely to be useful in routine primary care settings. Summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curves were estimated to assess the effec on accuracy of different FH definitions within each major disease group. The SROC curve mimics the receiver operator char acteristic (ROC) curve and is a way to measure the diagnostic accuracy across different studies. We est their standard errors. The value of Q* i ndicates overall accuracy by finding where sensitivity and specificity are equal. Since Q* is defined by the point where sensitivity and specificity 27 equal, Q* may not address the clin ical usefulness of the test when sensitivity and specificity are not equally important in practi ce. Note that a minimum of three studies with the same FH definition would be required for this computati on. Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata/SE 8.0 for Windows (Stata Corporation) or MetaDiSc.156 Additionally, data points entered into the analyses had to be independent; as such , we selected the most inclusive FH definition within each family history category (Table 2) . For example, data from a single study report values for greater than or equal to one parent, mother, and father would not be independent; th data from greater than one parent was select ed to include in the SROC analyses.

A draft version of this report was circulated to 10 peer reviewers (see Appendix E). The reviewers represented clinicia ns and expert in family me dicine/primary care, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, gene tics, and family history. The reviewers were provided with a standardized form to solicit feed back on the methods of the review, the presentation of the information and the interpretation of the results. Where possible, comments and suggestions were incorporated. Chapter 3. Results Figure 2 details the flow of studies and the fi nal subset for reviewi ng. The search yielded 32,444 unique citations.

A further 17 papers64-80 were eligible but did no t define FH, and 10 papers81-90 did not report interpretable data. These are excluded from the results below. Note on Interpretation of Results Data are presented below for both longitudina l and cross sectional analyses. The most common approach toassociation (i.e., how many times higher the inciden ce or prevalence of the disorder is in people with the FH than people without). The metrics used can include relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR) and others. These do not pr ovide an estimate of i ndividual probability of disease. For this systematic review, FH is a pproached as if it was a 'test', and predictive accuracy metrics are used to judge performance. definition is considered to be t 'calibration poin fo the 'FH test'. The longitudinal analyses prov tio predict the occurr uture disease in in analyses provide an estimate of how well di f individuals who currently have and do not have the disease of interest. Longitudinal studies examine prediction of future cases, while cross sectional studies examine current disease. Four metrics are ance of different FH definitions: Sensitivity - provides an estimate of the proportion of future or current cases which are correctly identified by the particular 'positive' FH de Specificity - provides an estimate of the proportion of individuals destined to be disease-free who are correctly identified by not meeting the particular FH definition Positive predictive value (PPV) - indicates the proportion of indivi duals who meet the particular FH definition who will actually develop or currently have the disease Negative predictive value (NPV) - indicates the proportion of individuals who do not meet the particular FH definition who will remain disease free or do not currently have the disease. PPV and NPV are influenced by the underlying prevalence of the dis ease i tion studied - the higher the prevalen ce, the higher the PPV and the lo wer the NPV, and vice versa. Sensitivity and specificity are not influenced by disease prevalence.

Four definitions of 'positive FH' based on affected relatives were exam in five analyses, all focusing on first degree relati ves (1DRs) in some combination. They all fel into Category C or E (see Table 2, Chapter 2); in addition, one study examined parental consanguinity. Three of the studies reported the st rength of association between positive FH (i affected relatives) and breast cancer risk in terms of relative risk or odds ratio. Depending on the FH definition used, these ranged from 1.37 to 2.83. A relative risk of 0.66 for the associatbetween parent consanguinity and breast cancer was reported 5 but the data in this report examined for a FH of affected relatives. Thes e data are presented for each FH definition in Webtable 4, Appendix C. Predictive accuracy. Figures 3 to 6 present sensitivity and specificity data for these FH definitions. For the longitudinal analyses, the range of se nsitivities was 0.06-0.26, and specificities 0. 0.95. The range of positive predictive values (PPVs) was 0.01-0.05, and negative predictive values (NPVs) 0.98-0.99, for breast cancer preval ences up to 2.5 percen For the cross-sectional anal yses, the sensitivities were 0.05 and 0.15, with corresponding specificities of 0.97 and 0.90. The PPVs were 0.01 and 0.09 and NPVs were 0.99 and 0.95, for prevalences of 0.7 and 5.4 percen t, respectively. It was not possible to calculate AUC. Conclusion. These analyses were limited by the very few discrete FH definitions available for comparison, and the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of underlying disease frequenthe study samples, length of followup, method of disease ascertainment, and other factors. With the exception of the parental consanguinity analysis, the definitions of positive FH use in these studies were consistently associated w ith elevated relative risks (Webtable 4), (i.e., a positive FH of cancer in relatives), at a population level. However defined, it was also a ris ctor for future brefawh the presence of current breast cancer (in cross-sectional studies). Within the analyses examined, the most sensitive FH marker for future breast cancer appeared to be 'at least one affected 1DR': this is a 'low complexity' approach to FH (see Table 2). In the single longitudinal study which used it, this definition correctly id entified 26 percent of women who went on to develop breast cancer within 4-8 years (w ith a false positive rates of 12 percent). 3 The proportio of participants with a positive FH defined thus who actually developed breast cancer within 4- 33 years was 5 percent. PPV is dependent on underl ying disease frequency, which was 2.5 pe Thus, it can be tentatively concluded that a si mple definition of positive FH, based on one 1DR (assumed female) with breast cancer, appeared to be associated with the highest sensitivity for future breast cancer risk within 4-8 years, but that, as always, the predictive ability in practice depends on the breast cancer prevalence in the patient population to whom it was being applie These observations need to be rep licated in further studies which also clarify the contribution of FH information to overall risk prediction based on othrcent. d. er established risk factors. Conclusions garding FH definitions used in a cross-sectional (prevalence screening) approach are not fficient analyses were availa ble with a range of defi nitions. However, there ould not appear to be a rationale for breast can cer screening triage on th e basis of FH in the con nal study scored less well across almost all items because of incomplete reporting, makre possible because insuw text of widespread access to effective alternative screening technologies. Quality assessment. The two longitudinal studies and one of the cross-sectional studies 6 scored highly on all or most quality assessment it ems despite that fact that two of the published reports4,6 did not indicate clearly that the same met hod of FH ascertainment had been applied to all participants. Overall, these studies were judged to be at low risk of significant bias. One cross-sectio5 ing it difficult to judge the likelihood of important bias. See Webtable 5, Appendix C. 34 Figure 3.

A large range of FH definitions were exam ined in these studies, ranging from ver he e s FH may be a useful factor to take into account in triaging indi viduals for diabetes screening (i.e., screening for undetected prevalent disease). The AUC fi gures suggest that no further discriminatory accuracy is obtained by going bey ond simple FH definitions, (i.e., limited enquiry about 1DRs only). If these findings were replicated, it is possi ble that meeting a simple FH criterion might be sufficient to merit a second stag e screening test such as fasting glucose, where health care resource constraints present limits to universal screening using clinical tests. Again, the underlying prevalence of diabetes in the popul ation should be taken into account as this affects the predictive value of any FH definition. Quality assessment. The longitudinal studies generally sc ored highly on quality assessment items. For one,30 it was possible that ascertainment of di abetes may not have been blinded to FH status, and in two studies28,31 this was not adequately reported. One longitudinal study had more than 20 percent attrition over 4 years;28 the participants were elderly men, the attrition is likely to have reflected mortality, and a higher rate of diab etes incidence in those lost cannot be excluded. y simple to very complex. Almost all indicated a positive association between FH and risk of diabetes. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of how diab etes was defined, t underlying diabetes risk in the population, length of followup, and other characteristics. Taken overall, the analyses suggest that using FH to predict future ri sk of diabetes may have som utility, and that category B definitions (specifyi ng 1-2 affected relatives) achieve higher overall discriminatory accuracy than category C definitions . However, the relationship between diabete prevalence and PPV should be taken into account. 50 Two other longitudinal studies fa iled to report data on attrition.27,29 Almost all of the cross- sectional stu ubject to possible exposure information bias , in that awareness of disease status may h , many cross-sectional studies included self- report of diabetes in their outcom of awareness of FH status.

The i ssues of concern consiste across all four were the possibility of ascertainment of atopy or asthma outcome being influenced by awareness of FH status, and the possibility for differences in method of capture of FH information.46,48 Followup rates were suboptimal for one study,45 and not adequately reporte another.46 An issue across all the cros s-sectional studies was the possi bility of awareness of FH influencing disease definition or ascertainment, and/o reporting. In all, except four re ports of three independent studies,51,55,58,59 the possibi selection bias through non-probability sampling a nd/or sub-optimal partic ipation rates could n be dismissed.

In contrast, the cross- sectional study was initially es tablished as a population-based st udy although fewer than half of the original participants were included in the analysis considered here. The prevalence of major depression was high (almost a quarter of the study group); like the other study, the method of assessing FH was likely m plete and deta iled than would be obtained in a primary ca ore com r consultation based on patient self-reporting. For th e two FH definitions examined in this study, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the value of using FH alone to screen for presence of major depression. Taking all of these issues into account, it is difficult to extrapolate the findings to typical primary care settings. If similar predictive valu es were obtained in st udies conducted in less selected populations and with more typical data collection pr ocedures, parental history of depression might offer useful information rela ting to identifying youth and young adults at risk. Quality assessment. The longitudinal study 60 scored high across all quality assessment criteria, likely reflecting its unusual prospectiv e multi-generational desi gn. The cross-sectio study62 (which was in fact a cross-sectional analysis of an origin al prospective cohort stu assessed as being potentially prone to bias in relation to indepe ndence of assessment of FH and disease outcome, and selection bias through sub- optimal participation rate at the point the analysis was performed.

General Approach to Evaluating Accuracy reporting of FH ) represents the test res that are true (both positive and negative outcomes). If individual s reporting FH were 100 percent accurate, they would correctly iden tify all relatives with the di sease and all those withou d f metrics may be used to convey accuracy and from these, sensitivity and sp e underlying prevalence of the nterest population (in this case, a positive FH). We therefore aimed to pr esent sensitivity and where this is reported in, or c ould be calculated from, eligible papers as the metric reflecting accuracy of self-reporting. Where this was not av ailable, we reported other metrics of accuracy s eporting of FH by the informant\" as the \"index test\", and required that there be comparison to a \"gold standard\" (representing the real or true disease state). We use the term informant to re flect that in some instances the person reporting family history may be a proxy respondent who knows the individual for whom family history is being evaluated. In this context, sensitivity in dicates how accurate inform ants are at identifying relatives who truly ha f rting igh nsiti only a few relative disease will be reported as diseas reporting is highly specific, only a few and ults t the in the specificity s with the likely that accuracy of porting one's FH will be influenced by factors relating to both the informant and the relatives; ical ation on a ntal Accuracy of a test (in this case proportion of all isease. A number o ecificity are not influenced by th characteristic of i uch as percent agreement. In this systematic review, we considered \"r ve the dis e. I e-free. Conversely, if eas repo is h ly se ve, relatives who are truly disease-free are misreported as having cancer. It is rethe method of capturing the FH data is also an important consideration. As there is no clear \"gold standard\" against which the accuracy of se evaluated, we decided to accept the following refere nce standards disease in the 1DRs and 2DRs, or higher, of the informant: 1) the relative's medical record, 2) c f status by the relative's physician, 3) death certificate, 4) disease registry, and 5) di in question. No t all research da in med records were elig or this review as we excluded studies that did not provide complete accuracy information including those databases that provided inform t ositives only. Data from th ese studies would not assist us in understanding the true accuracy of respondents providing their FH. luated the accura cy of reporting e for dat extraction, and reported data separa tely for spouses and genetic rela tives. The majority of papers (n=16) evaluated accuracy of reporting cancer FH , in persons who had cancer (breast, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, lymphoma, melanoma, Ew ing's or mixed cancers) or who were being s 12 studies that evaluated accuracy of reporting FH for me health disorders and these included persons with mood disorders, and schizophrenia. The remaining studies evaluated persons with Parkinson's disease (n=2), persons with cardiovascular/hypertension re lated problems (n=3) or persons with diabetes (n=2) and two studies 123,124 with populations from longitudinal cohorts that had mixed diseases (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and asthm lf-reporting of FH is esence or absence of for the pr onfirmation o rect confirmation by the relative ible as sources of verification ftabase s that conta he number of true p A total of 37 publications eva FH, were eligibl creened for cancer.

A total of 16 studies evaluated accuracy of reporting cancer FH. These st recruited informants (probands) with breast cancer,91-94 colorectal can ovarian cancer,100 mixed cancers (breast, ovarian, colorectal) phoma, melanoma, and unspecified cancer. Nine studies were case series in design and se ven were case control st udies for probands with breast,91 colorectal,95-97 ovarian,100 and prostate98 cancers, and lymphoma.104 In the case-referent studies, controls were derived from a range of sources including: th e general population (age- matched),91,100,104 informants' spouses and general practice rosters,97 patients who had undergone colonoscopy but were free of polyps,96 and healthcare administration databases.95,98 The case series studies, all collected FH from subjects with cancer who were recruited from specialized clinics or registries. One study103 evaluated a sample of deceased relatives of the probands; the challenges and potential errors of death certification and registries were the focus of this paper. Method of family history collection in informants/probands. The methods of cancer FH collection varied. Six studies used face to face interviews,91,95,97,99,103,106 six used mailed surveys,92,94,96,98,102,105 three used tele phone interviews,93,101,104 and one study did not report the mode of collection.103 Generally, the specific type of FH questions were not specified, but probed information predominately re lated to degree of the relative. Method of disease verificati on in informants/relative. The methods used to verify relatives' cancer status were primarily multimodal and included: review of medical records (including cancer regist ry) and death registry;92,94,103,106 face to face interview or postal survey of relatives;101 postal survey alone;96,105 and contact with physic ian of deceased relative.99 Three studies91,98,102 used medical records alone, and five st udies used linkage with cancer registry alon93,95,97,100,104e. Disease status was verified in both affected and unaffected relatives in all but five studies.91,94,99,102,105 Study outcomes. Some studies examined only specific can cer family histories, while others examined all cancers of interest. Four studies95,97,100,104 examined reporting of any type of cancer in relatives while the remaining studies examin ed cancers that matched that of the probands. Tables 5 to 9 show the findings according to th e cancer reported in the relatives; we show the major cancers identified in (Q1) which include br east, ovarian, colorectal , and prostate (other cancers were reported much less frequently). We also include the three studies evaluating lym104 105 10phoma, melanoma, and unspecified cancers. In general, specificity across all cancer type s and with varying m odes of collection was consistently high (Tables 5 to 9). For reporting of breast cancer FH, specificities of 91 to 100 percent were reported; for colon cancer, 91 to 99 percent; for ovarian cancer, 96 to 100 percent; for prostate cancer, 93 to 99 percent. For lymphom a in relatives, rates were equally high. Two studies using population controls and samples from large registries100,104 showed that specificiti were not altered by the type of cancer reported in relatives; sensitivities were higher for cancers at more common sites (for example breast and lung) and lower for less common sites (such as leukemia, and lymphoma). The sensitivity varied by the cancer of interest; for reporting of relatives with breast cancer, the range was 72 to 95 percent (Tables 5 to 9); for colon cancer o 90 percent; for ovarian cancer, 42 to 83 percen t; a tF 66 either the method of collecting cancer FH, or the method status, on sensitivity. of verification of relatives' reported rted ietic cancer, and ovarian cancers (sam with r t was also difficult to com sistent. evaluated the effect of education level using a variety of cate es showed ovaria n cancer and longer education (>10 years) had decreased sen and 3DRs were identified overall, sug t the as cancer, and were referred to a tertiary level oncology center. Although th ere are some challenges There were five case control studies95,97,98,100,104 that allowed direct comparison of reporting accuracy between affected and unaffected informan ts. In general, there were not significant differences between cases and controls with rega rds to specificity. However, controls repo lower sensitivities in lymphoma for 1DR with hematopo104 ple size very low for this cancer).95 In contrast, higher sensitivitie s were reported in controls of relatives with colorectal cancer.95,97 Predictors of accuracy in cancer FH were not consistently evaluated across all the studies probing accuracy of self reported cancer FH. F actors related to inform ants that have been evaluated in eligible studies include age, gender, education level, and race, and marital status, type of cancer, setting, and insurance status. Fact ors associated with relatives include, degree of relation, type of 1DR, age, gender, cancer site /type, and time since diagnosis. We summarize the factors most frequently evaluated. Eight studies91,95-97,100-102,104 evaluated the age of the inform ant as a predictor of accuracy with mixed results. Four studies showed that younger age (<50 and 50-59) was associated higher specificity,104 or that accuracy increased overall with younger age95,100,101 while one96 showed decreased accuracy with you nger age and three found no age effect.91,97,102 No clea trend emerges, and the type of cancer does not se em to be a factor. I pare across studies as the manner in which age intervals were categorized was not con Six studies95-97,101,102,104 examined an association betw een the informant's gender and accuracy, and no general trend was observed. One study95 suggested higher a ccuracy in reporting relatives with ovarian cancer by women than men. Another study101 suggested lower specificity of reporting relatives' cancers by men compared to women. Six studies95-97,101,102,104 gorizations; none showed any effect with th e exception of two studies. These studi that for subjects with sitivities100 for reporting all types combined and br east cancer alone and those with college versus high school education had increased accuracy in subjects with breast cancer genetic syndromes.94 Four studies93,94,97,102 examined associations between accuracy and the degree of relative whose status was being reported. There was a consistent trend towards increased accuracy of reporting relating to 1DR compared to 2DRs or 3DRs. One study 97 noted challenges in confirming the true status of 2DRs and that fewer 2DRs gesting the potential for reporting and confirmation biases. Two studies100,104 showed tha type of 1DR (for example parent versus sibling) did not affect the high specificity rates and did not differ for controls or cases; the sensitivities were slightly lower for daughters and sisters of controls only.100 Quality and risk of bias in studies. Webfigure 1, Appendix C deta ils the nine individual items used to evaluate risk of bias. We summar ize the three primary flaws observed within this group of studies. The risk of spectrum bias was high, given that seven of the studies were case control in design (indicating th e presence of spectrum bias as not representative of range of persons within primary care) and the remaining populations had cancer and were recruited from specialized settings. For example, one study 92 involving informants affected by breast cancer w restricted to those aged under 40 years, one thir d of whom were affected by bilateral breast 67 in characterizing the spectrum of patients with cancer, some studies included very high risk or atypical cancer patients, particularly for breast cancer, rather than pa tients with all levels of risk for tely aining co nfirmation) were excluded from the analyses.

Partial or differential biases may lead to overestimation of accuracy.157 The disease status was verified in both affected and unaffect ed relatives in all but five studies91,94,99,102,105 suggesting that partial verification bias was limited. However, even in the studies that adequa attempted to evaluate the status of unaffected relatives, many subjec ts with incomplete data (due to linkage problems, or difficulty ascert some studies, up to 31 percent92 of relatives could not have their disease status verified. Another study103 showed that 11 percent of death certificates were inconclusive and that up percent of certificates for deceased relatives could not be located.103 Reported difficulties included, errors in medical records or pathology reports,92,103 death of relative prior to registry formation or other form of record keeping,92 emigration of relatives, incorrect addresses for relatives or contact information for h truction of files,102 and inability to secure consent from the relatives in question.102 Blinding those verifying cancer stat us in relatives to the status of the informant was less of a issue in these cancer accuracy stud ies. For some studies the use of record linkage strategies w independent of the stat us of the relatives.100,104 Lack of blinding could lead to differential interpretation particularly where the informati on contained in medical charts is ambiguous due to lack of blinding might be less likely to have occurred in studies where verification was ed on cancer or hospital registries, and wh ere the diagnoses would have been checked through a separate process. However, there are othe r errors associated with linking databases that can lead to misclassification of di sease status. Overall, blinding of data collectors to the status of the relative or the informant wa s not undertaken in the majori asking bias. Summary. There were 16 studies evaluating accur acy of reporting cancer FH. These studies recruited probands with breast cancer,91-94 colorectal cancer,95-97 prostate Sarcoma,103 melanoma,105 unspecified cancer.106 pr edominately from specia settings or canc The methods of cancer FH collectio n varied as did the questions or tools used to collect FH Similarly, the methods used to verify relatives' cancer status were primarily multimodal and relatives for whom verification could not be obtained were excluded from analyses. Some studies examined only specific cancer family histories, while others examined all cancers of interest. Overall, specificity acro ss all cancer types and w ith varying modes of collection was consistently high (>90 percent); sensitivities were lower and generally more variable (40 to 90 percent) depe nding on the cancer types. Two large studies using data linkages to registries 100,104 s tives; that sensitivities were higher for cancers at more common sites and lower for less common sites. Five case control studies showed no significant differenc es between cases and controls with regards to specifi city although controls reported lo wer sensitivitie s in lymphoma,104 and in colorectal cancer.95,97 Predictors of accuracy in cancer FH were not consistently evaluated across all studies. Factors that have been evaluated in eligible studies include informant age, gender, education level, and race, and marital status, type of cancer, setting, and insurance status. Factors associated with relatives include, degree of relatio n, type of 1DR, age, gender, cancer site/type, 68 and time since diagnosis. No clear trend emerges with age, gender, or education level of the informants and the impact on accuracy. There was a consistent trend towards increased accuracy of reporting relating to 1DR co mpared to 2DRs or 3DRs. Overall, these 16 studies are at high risk of spectrum and verification biases, which may cause an overestimation of accur acy (see Webfigure 1, Appendix C). Table 5.

As such, the accuracy within these studies represents th e accuracy between t methods of collecting family and medical history from relatives or informants. Although the primary interest of this systematic review is on accuracy of reporting by the proband rather tha the informant and on FH rather than medical hist ory, we recognize that this may not be the no within this clinical area. We al ert the reader to this difference and where possible we attempt to present data that most likely reflects accuracy of FH rather than MH. Figure 39. A schematic representation of collecting FH (I ndex test) in typical manner (A) and in persons w mental health disorders (B)(C) Abbreviations: FH=family history; MH=medical history General study characteristics. Our systematic review identified 12 studies that evalu the accuracy of collecting FH in persons with me ntal health disorders. One study collected FH but reported only on the accuracy of informant age of onset rather th an accuracy of disease status in the relatives; as such, the results were not extracted for our research question.118 We grouped the remaining 11 studies based on the primary diagnosis of the probands; in the majority of studies, the subjects who were queried about FH were the relatives (predominately 1DR) of the probands. The disease outcomes for thes e studies were not restri cted to those of the probands alone, but tended to include a variety of mental health disorders. Within studies evaluating mental health disorder s, we include a series of st udies with a mixed population of elderly with both dementia and depression. There were three studies th at evaluated relatives of persons with schizophrenia;107-109 three studies (four publications) that evaluated re latives of, or persons with, dementia and depression;110-113 and, four studies that evaluated rela tives of persons with mixed disorders including depression and anxiety,114,115 personality disorders alone,117 and combined schizophrenia anProbands/ Controls / Proxy Relatives FH Probands /Controls INFORMANT FH Relatives MH A B Relative Relatives (Other) FH C 81 Sc ethod of FH collection in informants/probands.

Three studies107-109 evaluated relatives (and some informants) of subjects with predominately schizophrenia related di sorders. Although two of these studies108,109 included relatives of controls subjects, the results were not stratified by cases and controls; all three studies were therefore case seri es in design. The informants in each study were based on the FH reported by 1DRs although, with the exception of one study,107 the characteristics of these relatives were poorly described. M instrument to collect FH (Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria, FH-RDC) and included additional standardized diagnostic questions specific to symptoms for schizophrenia and related subtype disorders (Table 10). Method of verification in informants/relatives. All thr tudies used multiple stra (termed b te diagnosis (BED)) that included direct interview (including FH and diagnostic criteria), medical r ecords when available, and dia gnosis by one or more expert clin Study outcomes. All studies evaluated FH for schizophr enia and related subtype disorders; one study 109 included history of bipolar related disorders and additional categories such as alcohol a e 10 det he accu for these studies; the presentation of res s those of ary schizophrenall subtypes is not shown). Overall, these three studies show consistently high specificity and poorer sensitivity. The sensitivity rates for schizo phrenia were moderate (72 to 68 percent) in two studies, 107,109 but very low in another study (25 percent).108 Related subtypes of schizophrenia, for example schizoaffective or atyp ical psyc , had l tivities (v from 0 to 55 percent across studies ); this suggests that the dia gnostic subtype may be a factor affecting the estimates of sensitivity. The sensi tivity estimate for bipolar disorders was percent) compared to schizophrenia (68 percen t) in the same study.109 One study109 evaluated factors likely to affect th e false positive rate , including subject d attributes such as, previous hospitalization, ee s est estima ician s. buse.

For the informf ctive disorder increased false positives. These findings suggest that difficulties in informant perceptions of psychiatric behaviors account for the inaccuracies. Another study107 found no significant association between the type of 1DR and estimates of accuracy. Quality and risk of bias in studies. All three studies were at high risk for spect informants were predominately relatives of the probands who were recr uited from specialized clinics. In all studies, it was di fficult to ascertain which relatives (or informants) refused or were unable to participate in the study, suggesting high risk of selection bias. With the exception of one study,109 there was also a high risk of partial verification bias as it was not clear why s informants did not receive the reference standard test. Similarly, no attempts were made to seeverification of disease status in relatives who ct interview. 107-109 In two studies107,108 it is likely that FH colle ction (index test) may have been included in the BED (reporting unclear) su ggesting the potential fo r incorporatio Only one study stated explicitly that the diagnos ticians were masked to both the status of the relative and the proband prior to undertaking the reference test.109 However, masking proband status is likely to have minimal impact given that the informants were the subjects of these studies. 82 Summary.

All studies used a standardized test (FH-RDC) to collect FH from informants and similarly used standardized psychiatric diagnostic test s to establish dis within the relatives. Overall, these three studies sh ow consistently high specificity and poorer sensitivity; sensitivity varied with the diagnostic subgrouping. The single study109 that evalu schizophrenia and bipolar disorde e studies were at high risk for selec tion and verification bias es likely leading to overestimation of accuracy. Dementia and Depress Population. Four case series studies110-113 by the same primary aut hor evaluated geria subjects with dementia and depression. One of these studies110 collected FH of 1DRs and t spouses and tionship); as such the results of this study do no t reflect accuracy of true FH and the data are not presented here. The studies evaluated relatives of patients with Alzheimer's dementia, mdepression, or both di sorders; one study 111 included data from the probands' accuracy of medical history as well. Controls subjects and their relatives were recruite d in all three studies from the general population; the proportion of these varied with each study and not all results were stratified for this group. The informants in all studies were predominately 1DRs, but small numbers of spouses, 2DRs, and other relatives we re also included. The method of rec relatives was not well described and information on those relatives refusing participation was not reported. Method of FH collection in informants/probands. FH was collected in all studies using th FH-RDC instrument and included the use of othe r diagnostic screening . Method of disease verification in informants/relatives. Status of the index subjects was determined using standardized psychiatric inst ruments to diagnose dementia and depression. Study outcomes. The studies evaluating this geriatri c group showed that probands/controls and informants (predominately 1DR) are more accurate in identifying which relatives do not have dementia and depression (specificity range from 74 to 99 percent) . All erence in sensitivities for diagnosing dementia (21 to 23 percent) compared to depression (34 to 46 percent) (Table 10) ; sensitivity of anxiety disorders was lowest across all studies (7 or 8 percent). One study 111 estimated accuracy of probands and c ontrols using two different forms of interview with the reference standard being the psychiatric criteria interview; similarly, they probed relatives using these two different methods . Their findings suggest that probands/controls have higher sensitivity in reporting dementia FH (82 percent) than do their relatives (23 perc this difference did not hold for diagnosing depre ssion in family members (sensitivity 46 versus 42 percent). It is difficult to interpret these findings given that so little in formation other than and gender was provided about proba nds and controls; it is not cl ear how the cognitive status the probands may have influen ced these results. Two studies112,113 showed some differences sensitivity for relatives of probands (38 percent) compared to rela tives of controls (12 versus 16 83 per t es studies by the same primary author evaluated geriatric subjects with dementia, major depression, or both; one study presented informant pair data not not extracted.110 All studies used a standardized test (FH- similarly used standardized diagnos tic psychiatric tests to esta h nia, as these represented a very small proportion of subjects and the outcome of this stud subjects in most studies. In general, it was difficult to disentangle which of the info stan es ded by the use of informant pairs, which may include information from or about spo s cent) when diagnosing any psychiatric disorder; specificities we re higher (93 to 97 percent) and did not differ markedly fo r this psychiatric outcome. Quality and risk of bias in studies. All the studies evaluating re latives and probands with dementia and depression were at high risk of spectrum and selection bias; no information abou relatives that did not partic ipate was provided. A single study111 was not found to be at risk for either type of verification bias (partial or differential) or masking bias. The timing of the index and reference standard tests was not clearly sp ecified in any study. Given the limited number of studies, there is a high risk for bias leading to overestimation of accuracy within this group of studies. Summary. Four case seri110-113 consistent with FH accuracy and wasRDC) to collect FH in informants and blish disease within the relatives. All studies with in this patient group would suggest that probands and informants are better at identifyi ng relatives that do not have depression or dementia. However, these studies are at high risk of bias, and the result s should be interpreted with caution. Other Disorders of Mental Health Population. There were four additional studies that collected FH from populations with affective or anxiety and depression disorders,114,115 personality disorders,117 and persons wit bipolar affective disorder, majo r depression, schizoaffective s ubstance abuse, and substance addictions.116 This later study was grouped within the ca tegory of mixed disorders rather than schizophre y was any anxiety disorder. A ll studies were case series in design; however, three studies included healthy subjects and their relatives.114,116,117 At least two informants were sought per index 114,116,117 rmants were relatives (sharing genetic material) and which were not. Method of FH collection in informants/probands. FH was collected in all studies using dardized instruments (Table 10). Method of disease verification in informants/relatives. In all studies, confirmation of disease status was obtained usi ng BED by independent clinicians. Study outcomes. Table 10 shows the specific disease outcomes. We have reported those with the highest specificity or frequency of diagnoses. The presentation of results in these studi is confoun uses of probands or spouses of their relatives. A single study117 evaluated the degree of agreemen t (kappa) between the proband self- reporting versus their relative's direct reports; this study showed very low agreement (ranging from -0.1 to 0.21) suggesting that probands and relatives provide differe nt perspectives on the presence of a variety of pers onality disorders. Another study114 showed widely varying estimate of sensitivity (from 23.6 to 52.5 percent) depending on the type of anxiety disorder; specificity varied from 68 to 89.2 percent. Accuracy of both proband self-reporting and relative self- reporting for mental disorders showed higher sensitivities and lower specificities overall; no consistent effect of age and gender or type of relative on accuracy was found. 84 Similar results were shown in a study that evaluated anxiety disord ers in probands with predominately affective disorders; low sensitivitie s (6 to 19 percent) and higher specificities (97 to 9 . y re for e iety a nd depression disorders, personality disorders, and persons with bipolar, major depression, schizoaffective s ubstance abuse, and substance addictions.116 FH was er; BED was used in all studies to determine the relatives were more accurate in reporting who l 9 percent) were observed.116 This study also showed some e ffects of female index subject on accuracy for some anxiety disorders, suggesti ng some over-reporting and lo wer accuracy overall A final study115 showed lower sensitivities and higher sp ecificities when reporting FH of anxiet disorders; however the magnitude of the estimates for anxiety disorder sensitivities were almost triple those reported in another study.116 The authors conclude that the FH tool used is not adequate for specialty settings, but suggest that it may be appropria te as a screen in primary ca settings.115 Quality and risk of bias in studies. Webfigure 2, Appendix C details QUADAS ratings these studies. All the studies had high risk of spec trum bias, as the subjects would not be typical within a primary care setting. As with most studies in the mental health ar ea, it is difficult to determine which of the relatives did not have thei r disease status verified suggesting high risk of bias for both partial and differen tial verification. Masking of the clinicians who determined th BED was not an issue in these studies. Summary. There were four additional studies that collected FH from populations with affective or anx114,115 117 collected in a structured and st andardized mann atives. In gene ral, probands and status of the reldid not have affective or anxiet y related disorders; sensitivit ies for major depression and any psychiatric disorder were higher than those for anxiety disorders and levels of agreement were very low for personality disorders. As a group, these studies represent a broad group of menta health illnesses, and still show a consistent tr end with respect to accuracy. However, all these studies are at high risk for sp ectrum and differential biases. 85 Table 10.

This same study reported the percent agreement between the informants and relatives self-reporting as a functi on of the diagnostic criteria. The fi ndings showed lower kappa values for liberal diagnosis criteria (0.41, 95 percent CI 0.23-0.59) than for defin ite diagnostic criteria (0.80, 95 percent CI 0.53-1.00) for any 1DR relative. A similar trend was reported for siblings of the informants.

Within this sa me study, a smaller subsample was selected and verification of disease status in the relatives showed that informants (either cases or controls) were more accurate in identifying relatives who did not have Parkinson's disease.119 The sensitivity markedly declined as the certainty of disease improved.

The study findings would suggest that offspring (in comparison to siblings or parents) had lower sensitivities ( 60 versus 100 percent) and specificities ( 99 percent). Quality of studies. Several areas of potenti al biases were noted w ithin these two studies. Three biases, selection, verifi cation, and masking, were judged most likely to affect study outcomes and are summarized here; all relevant QUADAS items are detailed in Webfigure 3 Appendix C. As both ADAS item 1). In addition, one study119 did not specify how a subsample, chosen for purposes of validation, was selected and showed unequal number of controls (only 20 controls and 76 cases). Both studies attempted to evaluate affected and unaffected relatives and as suc risk of partial verification bias was low (QU ADAS item 5). Both studies used multiple methods to verify the disease status of the relatives (for example, self-reporting of relative and ne mination) and these were clea rly described. However, both studi es were prone to differential verification bias, as confirmation of deceased or incapacitated relatives' necessitated different reference standard methods (QUADAS item 6). In addition, both studies asked additional questions for those who responded 120 hose who had at least one Parkinson's symp tom; informants and relatives who responded n or who had no positive symptoms we re assumed to be disease free. The risk of biasing due to lack of blinding durin g interpretation of the in dex or reference was not consistent across studies. Although a high proportion of proxy informants (63 percent were 1DR) were used in one study, these 1DRs were excluded from further data collection;120 the second study did not clarify any exclusions due to participation as proxy informant (QUADAS item 10).119 The data collectors were not blinded for all methods used to verify the status of the relative i Summary. Two studies evaluated ac curacy of reporting in pe rsons with Parkinson's disease.119,120 Both studies used multimodal strategies for establishing disease status within 1DRs. One population-based study showed that in formants were more accurate at identif relatives without the disease (speci ficity); this study also showed that cases were more accurate than controls (68 percent versus 45 percent) in correctly identifying relatives with Parkinson's disease (sensitivity).120 A second study119 also showed that informants were more accurate at identifying relatives without Parkinson's disease for the diagnostic certainty categories of \"definite/ probable\" and \"d efinite\". Their findings suggest th at the degree of certainty of diagnosing Parkinson's disease, impacts the level of agreement between informants and relatives self-reporting of dis ease status. This trend in accuracy was not affected by the type of interview, type of 1DR, or the life status of the relative. Given that there is risk of bi as in more than one area within so few studies, we judge t there is high risk of bias affecting the interpretation of the results, likely causing an overestimation of accuracy. 91 Ac nd self-administered questionnaire123,124 were used to capture FH (Table 11). as s percent) versus siblings (72 percent); specificitie s (98 percent) were not altered by rs and ences nly not have the disease. Quality of these four stud s rch questio nnaire involving relatives.121,124,126 Study outcomes and direction of findings.

Another study123 compared accuracy for reporting for mothers and fathe showed slightly higher sensitivities for mothers (56 versus 65 percent); there were no differ in specificities (97 percent) (Table 11). Another study121 showed high specificity (98 percent) with lower sensitivity (53 to 61 percent ) for both methods of verification (either interview with the sibling or with c linical data). One study122 reported only concordance values varying by paternal grandparent s (kappa=0.76) and mother (kappa=0.90). Quality and risk of bias in studies. Webfigure 4, Appendix C shows the QUADAS rating for these studies. All studies included s ubjects with the disease, but two studies123,124 selected subjects that were representative of primary car e and therefore less prone to spectrum bias. O one study121 was at risk for differential verification bias as not all records or death certificates were found for all potential subject s. Masking bias was difficult to assess in most studies for the reference standard. Summary. Four studies evaluated the accuracy of reporting FH of diabetes in subjects with diabetes,122 hypertension or diabetes,121 and from cohorts with mixed diseases.123,124 FH was captured in a standardized manner and verifi cation included contact with relatives, self- administered questionnaire, or cl inical assessment. Overall, sp ecificities ranged from 97 to 98 percent and sensitivities varied from 53 to 87 percent. When reporting FH of diabetes, subjects are more accurate at identifying relatives that do ies would suggest that th e risk of bias was low. Accuracy of Self-reporting of Cardiovascular Diseases FH Population. Six studies evaluate d healthy students,126 subjects with hypertension,125 hypertension or diabetes,121 definite or probable m yocardial infarction (MI),128 and two studie evaluated probands from longitudinal study cohorts with and without a variety of diseases including stroke, hypertension, MI and diabet es. Three studies were case series in design,121,125,126 two were longitudinal designs,123,124 and one case control.128 Method of FH collection in informants/probands. A variety of methods were used to capture FH (Table 11) but all were well described and standardized. Method of disease verification in informants/relatives.

Another study124 compared accuracy of reporting of hypertension in parents and siblings, and showed lower sensitivities (56 versus 76 percent) but higher specificities (84 ver for siblings. A single study121 showed the opposite trend w ith higher sensitivities (90 percent) and lower specific ities (55 to 78 percent). Heart disease: Four studies evaluated accuracy of reporting cardiovascular disease123,124,128 MI,123,125 and stroke.123 One study125 evaluating concordance with reportin eement for fathers than mothers (Table 11). Another study123 showed accuracy of reporting of disease in mothers relative to fathers (Table 11); generally specificities (91 to 98 percent) were higher than sensitivities. Sensitivities were lowest for stroke (42 to 51 percent) and highest for death by heart disease (72 to 81 perc ent) with variable differences in parental gender due to the disease endpoint. A similar trend with higher specificity was shown in another study124 and no appreciable differences were obser ved when reporting on disease in parents or in siblings. In contrast, a case control study128 showed higher sensitivities (83 to 95 percent) for both cardia heart disease and all heart disease for both cases and controls; sp percent. Other factors affecting accuracy: One study eval uated the impact of differing positive family history definitions with broad cl assification (for example heart at tack at any age) or narrower parameters (for example, heart attack <55 years).123 This study showed that broader definitions of FH increased true positives, and positive predictive values and sensitivities. Three studies ev One study123 showed age of the proband did not impact accuracy. Another study124 showed that older adults (55 or older) had a greater probability of disagreement, however this varied with four diseases evaluated. Similarly, there were so me variations for the type of relative; fo example older probands with cardiov ascular disease had greater prob ability of disagreement w reporting disease in siblings and spouses than in parents. Across all dis eases evaluated, no clear trend emerges. Comparison of cases and controls within one stud128 For 2DR relatives, the pattern between sensitivities (76 to 80 percent) and specific percent) was less pronounced. In another study proba nds with disease report ed les relatives and for all disease t ypes except cardiovascular disease.124 In two other studies the presence of a risk factor for a disease123 or having the disease128 did not affect estimates of accuracy re lative to those that were free of the disease or risk factor. Quality and risk of bias in studies. Webfigure 5, Appendix C shows the QUADAS ra for these studies. Three of the studies123,124,128 had large population base d samples representative of primary care. Relative to these studies, those with smaller sample sizes studies were prone differential bias. It was difficult to assess the risk of masking bias for the reference standard most studies. Criteria for subject selection and wit hdrawals were well described in most studies Summary. Six studies evaluated accuracy of reporting hypertension,123-125 hypertension or diabetes,121 definite or probable MI,123,128 and stroke123 in their relatives, pr edominately 1DR. FH was captured in a standardized manner for all studies and verification included contact w relative (interview or postal ques tionnaire), or death certificate or medical record.

In line with the decisi on to identify the highest level of evidence, only published inte rvention studies (RCTs, contro lled trials, and uncontrolled before-after studies), where the intervention was the systematic collection of FH and this was compared to current or control clinical practice, were included for this question. Webtable 30 identifies those studies excluded, primarily beca use the design was not the specified intervention study design. Studies Reviewed Only two studies were identified for data abst raction after full text review of 34 studies. 129,130 Both were uncontrolled before-after studies and focused on br east cancer risk assessment, including FH collection, as the target intervention. The employer study focused on telephone based risk assessment (including systematic FH collections) in female patients at their place of work. In the study,129 all 8,900 women employees were sent electronic mail and there was a poster campaign about the breast cancer telephone risk assessment service. Five per cent (444) took up the service a nd 343 completed the telephone survey, with 189 agreeing to divulge their na mes and addresses, enabling followup. These 189 subjects were sent a followup postal questionnai re at 8 months, achieving a response rate of 72 percent (136). The baseline telephone survey and followup pos tal survey enquired about the outcome measure of mammography, as well as repor ting clinical breast exam (CBE) and breast self exam (BSE). In the other study130 participants were recruited, on a walk-in basis, through six community pharmacies and two health promotion events for women aged 18 years or older. Prior to intervention, respondents completed a baseline surv ey (as indicated in Table 12). The risk factor data (including FH) was input into a breast cancer risk assessment tool. This tool used the Gail model for risk calculation, which requires in formation on the number of 1DRs with breast cancer. This was followed by a pharmacist consultati on to discuss individual breast cancer risk, supplemented by written information. All women, irre spective of risk status, were encouraged by the pharmacist to follow American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for BSE, CBE and mammography. As with the employer study, the ba seline and followup surveys enquired about adherence to mammography, (together with adhere nce to CBE and BSE). the conditions o 101 Out factors (including FH) wom e, moderately increased, r markedly increased breast cancer risk.

Further, a high proportion of the 343 wo initially recruited had a FH of breast cancer with 10 percent ( 34) having a 1D ast cancer before the age of 50. Of the 136 women who comple ted both telephone survey a followup postal survey, 52 percen t (70) reported changing breast screening behavior. There w a statistically significant improvement in th e two risk reducing behaviors: Mam ening improved from 76 to 93 percent but the matched sample was small (29) and the change in screening did not reach stat istical significance (p=0.057). There was also improveme (34 to 62 P<0.001) and CBE (82 to 92 percent: p<0.0137). Ther e was no differentiation of the improvement in breast screening habits between the different risk strata. The community pharmacy study drew participan ts from women attending pharmacies and heart health events, and no specific data were presented regarding repr esentativeness. Their analyses indicate that 21 of 140 (15 percent) participants were a ssigned to the high risk category (1.7 percent r anmammography and CBE cindicate that this study ha s lim There was limited improvement in adherence to mammography in all women (p=0.796) and each age group (40-49; >= 50 years old). Further, in high breast cancer risk women (with re risk >=1.7) the adherence fell from 81 percent (17/2 reach statistical signifi cance (p<0.317). Results were also presented for other process measures: the proportion of women performing BSE increased from 31 to 56 percent, while mean BSE performed over 6 months increa sed from 2.79 to 4.1. Both metrics identified statistically significant changes (p<0.001). Changes in CBE were less dramatic with an increa from 86 to 91 percent (p<0.09). However, in younger women (aged 40- 49) the change was slightly more significant with improvement in CBE from 81 to 99 percent (p<0.025). 102 Table 12.

If it is assumed that the 4 percent (343) of invited patients who pa rticipated and completed the base line survey were more health conscious, then there is also a potential for recall bias. Over th e 8 months of the study response rate fell from 77 percent of the 444 particip ating women completing the baseline telephone survey, to 31 percent (136) at followup. The te lephone-based breast risk assessment intervention took place at the same time as a Breast Canc er Awareness Month at one employer, making it difficult to determine whether the improvement in breast screening behavior was a direct consequence of the telephone-based service. 104 The community pharmacy study was described as a 'randomized, paired, pre-post study', which is misleading. In our assessment, it was an uncontrolled pre-post study in which before- after outcomes f idu ts as p a ta.

Similarly, the recruit re different from the general po in other ways: baseline mammography screening le atched data indicated population already had a high BSE rate. The external validity of the results was also affected by non-response to followup survey and, as by authors, the study was und for some of the outcome measures. The low particip ation rate (5 percent) is a weakne study, but it probably represents a realistic situation when an ope n invitation for risk is offered to the general uninformed populati on. Both uptake of this service and follo screening would be improved if recommended by the woman's usual physician. In th community pharmacy study, the subjects were recr uited through a local sc reening campaign, and no data was available on the representativeness of the recruited women. Like the employer study, the proportion of women at high br east cancer risk and the base line screening behavio higher than expected for an unselected U.S. popul ation.

The two other studies131,132 were both uncontrolled before -after studies with different interventions. One131 evaluated the psychological impact of collecting cancer FH information through a postal questionnaire distributed to a ll patients in the 35 to 65 age group, followed by individualized assessment of th eir genetic risk of CRC and br east cancer (where appropriate). General anxiety and cancer worry were assessed at baseline and 4 to 6 weeks after risk information feedback using the STAI and a multidimensional cancer worry scale, respectively. resentative of primary care populations. The adverse psychological outcomes of interest identified at full text review included perceived risk,158,160,162,166,168,169 and perceived vulnerability and worry.131-133,158,162,168 In line with our decision to id entify the highest level of evid ence, only published intervention studies (RCTs, controlled trials, and before-after studies), where intervention was the systematic collection of FH and this was compared to curren t or control clinical pr actice, were included for this question. Webtable 30 identifies those studi es excluded, primarily because they were not the required intervention study design. Studies Reviewed After reviewing 38 studies at full text, only three studies met all eligibility criteria. 131- These studies recruited patients from single British primary care offices with the number of respondents recruited varying from 100 to 666 and response rates of 19, 29, and 64 percent. Descriptions of each study are given in Table 13. A sample size calculation was provided in on of the studies.133 The proportion of recruited patients co mpleting survey items at all time points was 91, 89, and 76 percent respectively.131-133 One paper133 described a randomized controlled tr ial (RCT) comparing general anxi health status and specific FH measures between c ontrol patients receiving a general health check and intervention patients who comp leted a FH risk assessment with the health check. Outcomes were measured using the self-administered short form (six items) Spielberger State-Trait Inventory (STAI) and the five item Perception of Health Questionnaire at baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 months after first visit. The 12-it em FH concerns measure (adopted from sel administered Psychological Consequences Questi onnaire) was also completed at 2 weeks and 3 months. The health check comprised two visits: baseline to record standard health check variables and, in the intervention arm, the self-c ompleted FH questionnai re. Two weeks later results of the health check and FH questionnaire were reported back to the patient, including recommended action. The 2 week outcome survey was completed immediately after this 106 T g immediately before and afte with the short form STAI.

This corresponded to a significantl y higher anxiety score for the intervent and 2 weeks post clinic visit (p=0.014). The mean scores for the intervention and control groups at 3 months were not significantly different (34.2 and 34.8 respectively). When comparing perception of health scores at different time points, the only significant change between the groups was that a larger proportion of the FH intervention group gave a more pessimistic response between baseli difference between the two he second study 131 analyzed participants in two groups.

The STAI at baselin and 4-6 week followup were similar (35.8 and 35.1 respectively) , corresponding to no statistically significant difference observed in anxiety. Similarly, most other cancer worry measures identified no statistically significan t change following the intervention, with the exception of a small reduction in participan ts' p Of the remaining participants, most were interviewed to clarify details of their FH, which to further designation into 'higher risk' and 'fal se positive' groups, the latter comprising patients deemed not actually to be at high risk after further enquiry. For both 'h igher risk' and 'false positive' groups, no difference between baseline and followup responses to general anxiet cancer worries scales was observed. However, both of these groups showed higher baseline cancer risk perception scores compared to the lower risk group (p<0.001 for 'higher risk' gr and p=0.003 for 'false positive' group). In the third study132 124 patients attended the primary care office-based genetic clinic, 121 completing the pre- and post-clinic STAI and 91 returning the 12th week. Eighty-nine patients completed the survey at all 3 time point s. Fifty-four percent (67/124) of patients attended clinic due to concerns about possible familial illness, and 35 percent (43) attendepregnancy plan risk was assessed by primary care providers (family doctor and health visitor) against regional guidelines, literature, and standard texts. Forty percent ( 50) of patients had a FH with genetic component, however only 7 percent (9) require d specialist input .

Of 2,715 women in the sampling Discourage Obtaining and Using a Family History? General Approach Initially there was limited clarity on the breadth and depth of this research question. After extensive review of the diverse literature in this area and a series of discussions with the technical expert panel, we focused the reviewed publications on studies that clearly identified the association between factors that facilitate or inhibit the process of collecting, discussing, and/o using FH. Within the group of studies collecting FH, studies evaluating the association betw self reported FH and other factors were sepa rately collated. The process of FH collection, discussion and use can be influenced by attributes of the patient, the heal th care professional, and the setting in which the FH is identified. In line with the overall scope and purpose of the revie the patients were from popul ations representative of a primary care setting, while the practitioners would have been primary car e providers (as discussed in Chapter 2). Studies Reviewed Of the six studies identified, four were undertaken in primary care offices 134-137 and in t population.138,139 our studies wF ervational study137 and a prospective cohort study with a baseline cross-sectional survey.1 Factors associated with FH coll ection or discussion were the primary outcomes of interest of three studies.136,137,139 This relevant data from the othe r three studies were retrieved from subanalyses presented in these publications.134,135,138 Two studies only recruited female patients.136,138 The cross-sectional survey s recruited between 500 a nd 149,332 subjects. The direct observational study followed 4454 patient visits and the cohort study surveyed 163 patients. In Murff et al.,136 patients with at least one visit to the primary care provider over the previous year were randomly selected from 11 primary care practice site s in the Greater Boston area. As well as medical record review, the consenting patients completed a telephone survey. This survey identified sociodemographic factor s and satisfaction with health care. Only 2,858 women were included in the sampling frame fo r the study. The average age of the women was 47.6. The response rate was 62 perc ent (1,803) with responders mo re likely to have had a mammogram performed in the last 5 years. Fletcher et al.,135 also randomly mailed questionnaires to 6,807 of 31,959 patients aged 35 to 55 years old in a single large multispecialty group practice about FH of color ectal cancer and scr eening experience. Tw enty-eight per cent (1,854) of this sample completed the postal survey, with 19 per cent (355) of these respondents reporting a FH of colorectal cancer. In Karliner et al.,138 the sample was derived from 14,490 women in the San Francisco area who had had a mammographic screening in the previous 2 years and completed a baseline questionnaire at the time of screening. The quest ionnaire identified women's familial risk using the Gail model.

Pinsky et al.,139 also sampled from a large cross-sectional survey o s general population aged 55 to completed the FH section o tives and gender of respondents. Further, th e relationship with vari ous socio-demographic factors was also identified. In Acheson et al., 137 researchers directly observed consultations of 138 community family physicians over 2 separate days (4 months apart) , with a standardized c onsultation encounter too (modified Davis Observation Code). The study was restricted to family physicians practicing in North East Ohio, although the profile of the physicians was representative of physicians throughout the U.S. The observa tion was supplemented by a review of medical records, physician surveys, and field notes. Full details of the FH information was only extracted from medical records in the latter half of the study. The study by Volk et al., 134 also recruited from a single primary care office in B Amwith 15 percent (163) com ical records scrutinized for FH information and compared to the information collected on t survey. tcomes In the six studies, the FH outcome was pr edominantly a dichotomized variable. The outcomes of interest were: FH documented in medical records; 134,136 FH discussed by doc either confirmed by direct observation137 or patient survey;135,138 and self reported FH.139 study findings FH recorded in medical records. Murff et al.,136 noted a comprehensive cancer FH assessment was more likely to be documented in white patients' medical records (84 percent sus 67 percent in non whites), and in patien ts where English was the first language (94 percent English versus 85 percent), both with p<0.001. When dichotomized by age (less than 40 or 40 years and older) the ethni c difference remained. In the under 40 group, FH of breast cance interviews occurred in 30 percent of white women, compared to 15 percent of African Americans and 11 percent of Hispanics (p<0.001 ). No information was presented on provider factors (practitione r and setting). Volk et al., 136 identified a different factor in FH co llection, the type of condition in electronic health records (EHR) in U.S. pr imary care practice. Forty- seven percent of EHRs had a FH recorded (93/189). Compared to the postal FH survey, the EHR collected FH of diabetes, breast cancer, CHD, but 90 percen t of positive family histories of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and colon cancer were b Rs, the survey also identified further FH details on glaucoma, osteoporosis, and diabetes leading to alteration in their familial risk status (94.7, 95.0, and 73.8 percent of positive fam histories, respectively, changed risk status). FH discussed in consultation. Acheson 137 identified the FH information discussed in consultations. FH was discussed in 24 percent of consultations. This study differentiated bet 113 factors that influenced discussion of FH between newly registered patients at the doctors' and established patients. Recently appointed phy sicians (as indicated by being in practice for fewer years) were more likely to discuss FH with established patients (p=0.02). In addition, 25 percent of residency trained prac titioners discussed FH with esta blished patients compared to percent of non-residency trained practitione rs (p=0.06). There was no association with practitioners who offered prenatal care. In the case of patient factors: the age, gender, health and ma rital status were explored for established and new patients office 70 . The only significant association was that older established patients wer ts, le being addressed in the consultation in bot y or n with younger women (p<0.0001), women who had had a routine physical exa (p=0.0001), and women concerned about breast cancer (p=0.006). In 5 women younger than 50 were less likely to be asked about their FH of colon or rectal cancer with 39.1 percen t asked [95 percent CI: 36.1-42. 0%] compared to 72.2 percent ask t (11.8 percent), lung (10.1 per cent), colorectal (9.4 per ) d r rveyed e less likely to discuss FH than younger esta blished patients (age 15 to 44, 24.8 percent; 65 years or over, 17.6 percent; p<0.001) Further, patien ts with Medicare insurance were less likely to be asked about FH. Family history was discussed in 61 percent of physical examinations with new patien compared to 44 percent of such checks in established patients. During these checks, femapatients were more likely to discuss FH. When FH was discussed this seemed to extend the consultation time and be associated with other problem h new and established patients. Kartliner et al., 138 surveyed women who had attende d mammography screening. The study explored multiple factors associated with clinicians discussing cancer FH. Jewish ancestry, education, language of interview, insurance status , previous cancer inves tigations, and worr risk perception were not associat ed with clinicians discussing cancer FH. However there was an associatio mination in the last year Fletcher et al., 13 ed in those 50 years and ol der [95 percent CI: 70.0-76.4%]. Factors associated with self-reporting FH. Pinsky et al.,139 noted in a cross-sectional survey that male respondents reported less FH of cancer than female respondents. The most common family histories reported were breas cent), and prostate cancer ( 7.3 percent), with lymphoma (0.6 percent), vaginal (0.1 percent and testicular cancer (0.4 percent) being less commonly reported. Further, it appeared liver an bone cancers were over-reported while lymphoma , melanoma, bladder cancer, and testicula cancer were under-reported. Minority groups (Black, Asian, Hispanic ) reported lower rates of FH compared to the non-Hispanic white group (p<0.01). Respondents with less than 8 years education also had lower rates but this group onl y represented about 1 pe rcent of the su population. 114 Table. 15 Factors associated with impr oved FH collection and utilization Factors Associated With Improved FH Collection in Medical Records Factors Associated With Medical Practitioner Discussing FH Factors Associated With Improved Self-reporting of FH Patient factors: White (compared to 139 rtery disease) Not on state health Age: mixed picture, in age group for colorectal Women Higher education status cers: other ethnic groups) 136 Certain medical conditions (diabetes, breast cancer, coronary a 134insurance137 Patients who worry about breast cancer 138 White non-Hispanics (compared to other ethnic groups) 139 139 one study more likely to discuss in younger age group for all conditions, 137 while in another study in older Certain common can breast, lung, and colorectal 139 cancer135 Practitioner factors: Practitioners in same practice for fewer years 137 Resident-trained 137 Setting: Routine physical examination in established patients, 137 particularly women137,138 Abbreviations: FH=family history Quality Assessment of Studies In three of the identified studi es the characteristics of res pondents and non-respondents wer identified with the respondents being older than non-respondents. 134-136 One study examined other sociodee mographic factors, noting responde nts were more likely to be Caucasian,135 while another survey, respondents had slightly more FH recorded in their medical charts and were more likely to have performe d BSE and mammography screening.136 Of the five studies that used cross-sectional surveys, the response rate was 80 percent or over in three studies, two of which were based in primary care,134,136 and the other was a population-based survey.139 Of the remaining two studies, a telephone su rvey had a 63 percent response rate138 and a primary care- based postal survey achieve d a 27 percent response.135 In most studies the nature of the FH discussed or reported was not clearly identified, often just reported as dichotomous variables. Only four of the six studies actually took place in primary care offices, and three of these were based in practices within the greater Boston area.135,136,138 Representativeness of these surveys is also limited by response bias and re call bias, for example Murff et al.,136 recruited older women and the responders were more likely to have had mammography screening.

What are the Key Elements of a Family History in a Primary Care Setting for the Purposes of Risk Assessment for Common Diseases? As discussed in Chapter 1, for FH to be useful in chronic disease risk assessment, it is not enough for patients to report, and pr ofessionals elicit, FH informa tion accurately: it is necessary to clarify which elements of FH ar e most useful for disease prediction.150 In specialist genetics settings, the gold standard, comp rehensive, three generation pedi gree forms the foundation for identifying specific potential disease inheritance patterns, such as autosomal recessive or X- linked dominant.171,172 However, in a primary care context, the goal is usually to identify an individual's overall level of familial risk, without necessarily seeking out specific patterns, though this is not precluded. Since, by definition, co mplex disorders are not likely to display an easily discernable, high penetran ce pattern of inheritance, it is reasonable to take a simpler approach in which FH elements (e.g., type of rela tive, closeness of relationship, gender, age of onset, etc.) are combined and their predictive vali dity examined empirically. In principle, the FH definition which combines useful predictive power with least effort to obtain is likely to be the one best suited for routine appli cation. Some insight into the 'inf ormation value' of different FH definitions might be useful in developing ev idence-based, primary care-oriented FH tools, 151 which could then be evaluated against appropriate control interventions for the effect of their use on health outcomes. A large number of studies were identified th at provided data releva nt to this question, although they were mostly not designed for the an alyses performed here. Only a very few reports were designed to examine different definitions of 'positive FH', and almost all assessed FH as a possible risk factor for disease in classical epidemiological approaches. Many of the cross- This review was designed to inform a broad range of questions (Q) which ultimately addres the clinical value of using family history (FH) in chronic disease risk assessment and prevention in primary care. The evidence derived from questions (Q) 1, 2, and 5 was designed to inform primary care providers of the most efficient elements of FH information, and approaches to collection, which might be best suited to routine application, given the constraints that ar e faced such as limited time availability. This draws together the most in formative components of an individual's FH fo future or current disease risk, th e factors, which influence accuracy of reporting, and the factors which stand in the way of, or promote, the actual collection of FH data. In addition, if primary care providers are to be persua ded that systematically collect ing and interpreting FH is a beneficial activity, they need to be provided with the most robust evidence of the benefits of thi intervention in improving patients' health outcomes, and any significant adverse effects. The evidence for these issues was derived from questions 3 and 4. Appendixes and Evidence Tables for this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/famhis timprov/famhimp.pdf . 117 sectional studies were potentiall y subject to outcomes: it is possible that some participan information bias, in relation to both exposures and ts knew their FH more accurately because they were affected by the condition in question, and most all studies, the strength of association between FH and dis ease frequency was assessed at a population level, using relative risks, odds ratios, and related metrics. However, assessing the utility of FH for risk assessment in ind en FH to devel op a disorder compared to those who do not have the FH. Rather, the n e e issue ough some analyses covered a wide range of FH definitions, we observed that most studies define d FH largely in terms of first degre y feth A pragmatic approach wa finitions. For example, rather than separating out mutually exclusive FH categories (e.g., 'affected brother only' versus 'aff at ing in ich needs to be considered, is whether the way in which FH was captured in t e ation. The factors influencing accuracy of re porting were examined as part of Q2. vice ve rsa. In al ividual patients requires examination of di scriminatory accuracy metrics: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. The question is not so much ' how many times more likely\" are people with a giv question is more of the nature, 'What is th e chance that, given this FH, this person will go o to develop this disease in the time period of interest?\" Even for the most common complex disorders, most people 'at risk' do not actually go on to develop th e disease, therefore even larg relative risks may actually be associated with ve ry small absolute risks over a 5 or 10 year period. Even though most studies included did not re port predictive metrics, or were not even designed to address Q1, it was still possible to extract sufficient data to begin to explore th of interest. We examined FH definitions in longi tudinal and cross-sectiona l studies, appreciating that they provided different in sights: the former are designed to address prediction of future disease, and the latter reflect screening for current disease. Alth e relatives (1DRs), and only a few drew in information on a broader set of relatives. Ver w reports provided a rationale for the specific FH definition, and it was not possible to assess e value of criteria such as age of ons et or lineage in any meaningful way. s used in approaching individual FH de ected brother and sister') for analysis, we co mbined categories and compared presence of th FH characteristic versus absence of that FH charact eristic (e.g., 'affected br other, irrespective of status of other relatives' versus 'no affected brother, irrespective of status of other relatives'). This permitted the assessment of that single FH characteristic ('affected brother' or 'unaffectedbrother') as if it were the only que stion that a health professional asked the patient, thus allow some sense of its predictive ability as a simple screening or triage question in and of itself. Overall, the discriminatory accuracy was genera lly modest, for most FH definitions used isolation. This is not su rprising - as noted previously, complex disorders do not have a strong or highly penetrant genetic component, and therefore it would be illogical to expect a very high predictive value for FH, however defined. Also not surprisingly, the most sensitive FH definitions were usually those, which were very loose, (e.g., a minimum of one affected relative, whether or not further specified). From a theore tical perspective, it woul d be expected that a simple, loose definition such as this would have highest chance of picking up people genuinely at high risk, but would also identify many false pos itives. The more elements required to define 'positive' FH, the less sensitive and more sp ecific the definition, again to be expected. Another factor, wh hese studies was reflective of routine clinic al practice. For some studies, for example, th multigenerational cohort studies, it is clear that FH ascertainment was in no way typical of primary care practice. However, many of the definitions were simple and probably reflect the types of answers that would be re ceived even if elicited verbally as part of an office consult 118 As part of this review, we developed a notional categorization system (Table 2) to reflect the effort required to obtain the minimum inform ation implied by any given FH definition. We wished to take account of the time constraints under which many primary care practitioner work, and the possible limitations of immediat e knowledge, which patients might bring to a consultation. The use of electronic medical r ecords (EMR) might permit the easy assembly of more extensive FH and render th e distinctions in the table ir relevant. Also, decision-suppo systems based on EMRs would facilitate the im plementation of FH scoring systems, which represent the next 'step up' in FH assessment, taking into account information on factors such as family size, time at risk, etc.173 In contrast, a prac titioner who may only have time to use a few 'screening questions' might be well served by knowing the absolute minimum level of information that needs to be elicited for a give n level of predic tive accuracy. While the category A-E framework is not intended to be definitive, we were able to provide some evidence thatype of a s rt t this pproach might be useful. For exampl e, for prevalence studies of diabetes, the AUC valu and e. However, if a pos t on wit ent ary ic (lack of disease in relatives is correctly identified). e for category D showed no improvement in discriminatory accuracy over categories B C. If these observations are vali d, it would indicate that simple , targeted questions about first degree relatives would be as informative as more extensive enquiry for identifying individuals at risk of undiagnosed diabetes. While these analyses can only be regarded as preliminary, theysuggest an approach for future research. Having gained some insight into the performance of specific FH definitions in predictive chronic diseases, the appropriate question is to ask next, is how they perform when considered with information on other risk factors. Depending on the disease in question, a clinician is unlikely to disregard other risk factors and base a risk assessment on FH alon itive FH significantly improved the predictive ab ility of other established factors, then it might make the difference in th e choice of preventive interventi ons, and/or in promoting risk reducing health behaviors. It was beyond the scop e of this review to model the incremental predictive value of particular FH definitions combined with other risk fact or variables, but this would be a logical exte nsion of this enquiry. It is impossible to draw an overarching conclusi on from the analyses conducted for Q1, and i was not possible to assess the performance of FHs across a range of disorders. The tables detailing predictive value alongs ide disease prevalence were c onstructed to permit comparis h different clinical contexts, and to give a sense of the highes t likely achievable predictive utility, within the constraints of the data. In cons idering these data, it is necessary to clarify the underlying prevalence of the condition in the popul ation of interest, whether the purpose is stratification of future disease risk (and the ti me frame) or triaging for screening for curr disease, and the way in which FH information may or may not be combined with other risk factor information for a holistic assessment of an individual patient. Q2. What is the Accuracy of the Family History, and Under What Conditions Does the Accuracy Vary? In order for FH to be of valu e in clinical decision making, patients must possess, and prim care practitioners be able to ascertain, accurate family health information. Assessing accuracy requires a clear idea of an appropriate gold standard\u2014what patients 'should' know, and what clinicians 'should' be able to obtain. In simple te rms, an 'accurate' FH could be considered to be one which is sensitive (disease in relatives is corre ctly identified) and specif 119 In order to fully explore the question of accu racy of reporting we did not restrict the population to those within a primar y care setting as we correctly an ticipated that there would few accuracy studies within this population. In this regard, the majority of studies evaluated subjects with the disease or first degree rela tives (1DRs) who are by definition at high risk. Overall, the applicability of these findings from specialized clinical settings to primary care settings may be limited; the high risk of spect rum bias would tend to cause overestimation in accuracy. Although, the attributes of the probands (or informants) were described, those of t relatives (for example, gender or even the relati on to the proband) were not, particularly in studies within the mental health area. Overall, the few rigorous studies , which fully evaluated accuracy consistently, sugge informants are more accurate in identifying which relatives are free of the disease (specificity) than in identifying relatives who have been affected by cancer (sensi tivity). This trend was generally consistent across all di sease groups, except heart disease; there was some variation the rates for sensitivity. For example, in the mental health area, rates of sensitivity were consistently very low (>40) but in cancer FH they were higher (~ 80 percent). Similarly, in tho studies that reported sensitivity for both cases and controls, there is variation between the different disease areas; for example, sensitivities in relatives of controls probed for Parkinson' disease were much lower than those obse be he sted that in se s rved in assessments of controls in breast cancer studies at ld t ore complete information on their FH after their init be re s ust s). It was challenging to isentangle medical history and FH in some of the studies within mental health; similarly, in this ar ev i presence of disease with e Our findings also suggest that FH reporting may be more accurate for 1DRs than second degree or beyond, although few studies examined accura cy in the latter. Sim ilarly, attributes of the informants and relatives have not been consis tently evaluated; in those limited studies th did examine this factor, there was no clear pattern in the attributes of the informant or those of the relative that influence accuracy results. Th e methods used to collect FH and the disease category is likely to account for this inconsiste ncy. We also have little insight into which informant characteristics are asso ciated with more accurate reporting; future evaluations cou consider formally examining factors such as sex, age, and cultural backgro und. It is possible tha informants affected by cancer may seek out m ial diagnosis, but we were unable to confirm this within this literature. The accuracy of reporting by probands, member s of the population or relatives cannot completely separated from the performance of tools to gather such data. We observed great variation in methods used to coll ect FH that ranged from simple dichotomous questions, to mo complex standardized tools that had established psychometric prope rties. In the area of mental health, FH is an important component in establ ishing the presence of disease, and as such wa included in both the index test and the reference standard; that is the FH of the relative (not j medical history) formed part of the case defi nition of what was also collected in order to establish the presence of the disorder (for exam ple in bipolar disorder d ea FH included a broader conceptualization whic h included relatives such as \"spouses\". Future aluation within mental health studies would be strengthened by clarifying these differences. es evaluating accuracy used a multimo dal approach to establishing the Most stud in the relatives. In part, this was necessitated by the status of the relatives; for example, clinical examination could only be undertaken in relatives that are alive. As such, there will always be a high risk of bias for differentia l verification irrespective of the different diseas categories evaluated. It is impossible to comment on which gold st andard is 'best' for judging accuracy, but we recognize that multiple strategies are necessary to capture the status of all relatives. 120 Future efforts to improve accuracy of reporti ng would be improved by explicit consid of whether sensitivity or specificity is the pr imary goal, which is dependent on the clinical context and purpose of a FH orie nted strategy. For example, maximizing sensitivity prioritize the goal of missing as few 'at risk' family histories as possible, and is consistent with a polic which the potential benefits from finding potential cases carry more wei ght than the potentia costs and harms of investigating individuals or families with false positive histories. In contras maximizing specificity prioritizes avoiding the potential costs and harms of false positives, and consistent with a policy that directs limited resources towards only identifying individuals ofamilies with the greatest likelihood oferation s y in l t, is r being at significant disease risk, at the cost of missing som ether a a f tivity in that ns se ice. Anonymous tele phone-based risk assessment services may attract patients already aware of their strong family histories (and/or othe r risk factors) due to concerns about insurance e true positives. In general, we might expect that the accuracy of FH reporting will improve in future, as current initiatives lead to more awareness on the pa rt of the general public. It is not clear wh this will be countered by the effect that incr eased population mobility has on people's abilities to keep up to date with the health of more distant family members. Q3. What is the Direct Evidence That Routinely Getting Family History Will Improve Health Outcomes for the Patient and/or Family? AND Q4. What is the Direct Evidence That Routinely Getting Family History Will Result in Adverse Outcomes for the Patient and/or Family? These two research questions were identified as being complementary, and were therefore approached together in this discussion. While the literature contains many observationa l studies examining the association between awareness of familial disease risk and patient risk behavior, psychological distress and uptake oservices (see Webtable 30 fo r list of observational studies) th ey do not identify the temporal sequence from risk awareness to change in rele vant outcomes. Thus, they do not provide clear evidence that family history collect ion and/or risk identification as a deliberate clinical ac itself leads to changes in health outcomes. As demonstrated in the review, there is very limited information available from such robust intervention studies. The focus of this review was to inform prim ary care practice, and we identified few studies conducted in a general population or non-specialist context. This is not surprising, considering when familial risk assessment is offered to general populations (not specially selected for risk), the response rate is usually low. In the reviewed studies, the FH collection interventio were predominately integrated in multifactorial risk assessment tools particularly in the two studies examining improvements in health outcom es (Q3). Although these studies were not in a primary care office setting, they did approach the general population through respondent- initiated enquiry. These models suggest that the modality of risk assessment may affect the u of this serv 121 disc the nt e adverse effects of FH collection and risk assessment (Q4), only three sma individuals are aware that ey are at low familial risk, confirmation of status on familial risk assessment would be exp gp However, to fully assess the psyc llecti on and use as an approach to chronic disease risk prediction, va lidated context-specific tools n eed to be developed. Further, other than psychological distress, studies of o erse outcomes were not identified (e.g., reduction in screening behavior). 130 Finally, it is important to note that, even if FH collection and risk assessment had a positive net redu Q5. What are the or Discourage r nterpretation of the data. , e is ion, (e.g., rimination. This may be particularly the situation if the assessment is associated with similarly anonymous telephone based genetic counseling. However, in patients unaware of implications of their FH, in-office asse ssment followed by their personal physician's recommendation may be the preferred option. Irrespective of the mode and type of FH asse ssment, the impact on risk-reducing behavior remains unclear. We identified evidence that sugg ests that incorporating FH collection into multifactorial risk assessment increased screening rates for breast cancer risk, but direct evidence for other conditions is lacking. Incorporating FH collection into a multifactorial risk assessme tool leads to difficulties in disentangling the effe ct of the FH intervention from other factors. When considering th ll studies were identified. They suggest th at FH collection and risk assessment increases general anxiety in the short term , with scores returning to pre-intervention levels by 6 to 12 weeks. While the short term impact of interventi on is increased anxiety, the process of reviewing the FH may also reassure the c linic attendees. On the other hand, if th ected to make no difference to the score. To some extent, these findings mirror those of enetic testing for adult onset diso rders, in which the consistent finding is that genetic test results rovoke short-term increases in anxiety which return to baseline levels within 1-2 months. 174,175 hological effect of FH co ther adv effect on risk reducing behavior, this does not provide evidence that the prescribed risk- cing behavior leads to improved health outcomes. Factors That Encourage Obtaining and Using a Family History? Although 'taking a FH' is a core activity in primary care, 176 little is known about the factors that encourage or inhibit it. We identified only a few studies that addressed this question and they were very heterogeneous and did not provi de a clear understanding of the factors that improve the appropriate collection and use of FH information in non-specialist settings, whethe for general application in comp lex disease risk assessment or screening patients with more evident familial disease who requi re more focused FH collection. In many cases FH collection and use is presented as a dichotomized variable, limiting the i Despite the difficulty of synthesizing these st udies, some observations are possible. To do so it is necessary to consider together studies which examined the likelihood that FH was discussed with those which examined whether FH was recorded in patient records as a proxy for the sam underlying activity, (i.e., that FH wa s collected, recorded, and acted upon ). On this basis, there tentative evidence to sup port the importance of: 1) patient fact ors such as gender, age, educat their ethnic group, the nature of their health insurance, 2) provider factors such as younger or older practitioners, whether or not they were residency-trained, 3) the condition of interest the FH of some cancers appears more likely to be reviewed than other conditions), and 4) the context, including whether the consultation fo cuses on a specific disease or not, physical 122 examinations, whether or it is a new patient c onsultation, whether or not the patient brings specific disease concerns. There is insufficient evidence on whether organi zational factors such as electronic records, make a meaningful difference to FH ca health pture or recording. In a previous review,145 we not in he e cannot consider that these methods necessa prac f data points availa ve an indication onl of the possib finitive ana family ed that the use of FH tools was associated wi th more accurate and complete recording of FH information than non-systematic approaches, but it is not clear whether pr oviding such tools itself promotes their routine use. Limitations The studies reviewed in this report were limited to those published in English; however, t impact of any language bias is offset by the opt imal applicability to En glish speaking countries for which this report was prepared. Given the scope of the research questions, we limited our search from 1995 to March 2009. We acknowledge that the 1995 publicat ion date cutoff may have excluded some studies. 177,178 Similarly, due to restraints of time and resources, grey literature was explored in a limited manner. In considering the elements of FH which provide most value in predicting risk of disease (Q1), we re-analyzed data for a large number of studies, most of which were not primarily designed to address the goals of this review. We took at face value the defi nitions of FH as they were described in the source reports, and did not contact author s for confirmation. Neither did we attempt to assess the likely accuracy of FH reporting, nor take into account the method by which it was collected (although t is h was noted as a descriptive item). We grouped together data from studies that were very heterogeneous, in terms of study population and definitions of disease outcome. While almost all studies in dicated that FH information was captured by structured interview or self-c ompletion questionnaire, w rily replicate the quality of information that might be obtained by a primary care titioner in a clinical setting. Finally, the AUC calculations were restri cted by the number o ble. The findings presented should therefore be considered to gi le predictive ability of different FH items, ra ther than to be a de y lysis. In the context of accuracy (Q2), we did not re strict studies according to the manner in which FH was collected and considerable variation in the methods used was observed. Almost universally, studies included the collection of FH based on self-reporting (from either the proband, informant, or relative) and are theref ore dependent on the individual respondents' knowledge of their history. This represents a lim itation on FH taking in pr actice rather than a limitation specifically of this systematic review . Additionally, eligible studies evaluating the accuracy of FH reporting did not use the same method to ascertain FH or verify status within all relatives. As such, interpretation of the metric s of accuracy was limited to the methods of FH ascertainment and verification used in these studies. Finally, when ev aluating and comparing quality of studies, we assumed the inde x and reference tests were similar. In examining the effects of FH taking on behavi or (Q3) and adverse effects (Q4), the review was limited to populations and se tting applicable to primar y care. We acknowledge that systematic FH collation and interpretation in spec ialist setting may provide evidence relevant to primary care but the scope and pragmatic consid erations limited the focus of the review. The emphasis on very specific clinical behavioral outcomes also does not allow for exploration of other effects on the part of patient s, such as seeking out more ex tensive information from 123 members as a result of having been asked \"the fi rst\" set of questions on FH. Further explora of the ethico-legal and sociation l aspects would have added a valuable perspective to the review, but ther ort s s; however, we determined that incorp orating a comparison of ols, in addition to the origin al questions, was not feasible, an d altered the already broad focus of the review.

In consultation with our TEP and partners, we co nsidered the issue of how different FH tool might relate to the review question to been examined in a p generic FH tools.179 examined cancer and generic tools applicable to primary care settings.146 Conclusion Firstly, we explore the implicati ons of the individual questions. 1. The main analysis drew on data from studies designed to address ot her primary question but yielded some useful quantitative information, which indi cates the likely upper limit on predictive utility of different FH definitions for the diseases of interest, where FH is used in isolation as a risk factor. The analysis was constrained by the definitions of FH used in the primary studies, but we developed a notional approach to categorizing FH definitions to assist interpretation of their workload impact in routine clinical settings. In and of themselves, very few of the specific FH items or combinations examin ed had more than modest ability to predict future disease risk in individuals. In general, the leas t constrained definitions (e.g., at least affected 1DR, with no other information requi red) were generally associated with higher sensitivities and lower specificities. This conclusion is not surprising, since a very high predictive ability based on FH al one would imply a disorder with a strong genetic element and high penetrance. For complex disorders, even modest independent discriminatory ability might provide clinically useful predictive information in combination with other risk indicators r available It is worth noting the importance of consideri ng the complexity of the FH definition itself and its relationship with the type of risk info rmation it conveys. The most complex defin particularly those which incorporate lineage (Cat egory E, Table 2, Chapter 2), appeared to designed to identify Mendelian- type patterns of inheritance. 182 As such, they would therefor expected to identify rare populat ion subgroups with a \"genetic ve rsion\" of a complex disorder. Such an approach is, by definition, likely to be highly specific and but rather insensitive. In contrast, a positive FH based on a very simple definition might provide a marker which picks outa higher than average 'familial loading' for a di sorder, but has no need to consider detailed pedigree information. This approach would be characterized by higher sensitivity but lower specificity. The purpose of the FH assessment in primary care (to pick out subgroups for further genetic assessment or to work out more general familial disease loading) merits further discussion. Recommendations for direction of future research: Further clarification of the purpose of FH ta king in primary care settings is require so that future assessments of the utility of FH are based on an explicit distinction between, for example, disease risk assessmen t as part of routine preventive care (e.g., 124 the routine physical examination) in which other risk information is taken into account, triage for screening (e.g., selecti ng people for formal tests of glucose tolerance), or applying genetic referral/test ing guidelines in patients who appear to have a prominent familial disease history, in whom genetic disease is suspected. The evidence base requires studies designe d explicitly for the purpose of examining ich FH items should be formally examined alongside other recommended or readily accessible risk factors, in or tent to which they provide useful independent and/or incremen ility. .

Concurrent qualitative studies should the predictive ability of combinations of individual FH items.

Accuracy of FH repor ting appears to be dependent on the method of collection, which is related to the disease area. Accurate repor ting of the absence of disease (specificity) appears to be grea ter than accurate reporting of pr esence of disease (sensitivity) across different disease areas. Estimates of sensit ivity show greater variation and the magnit varies with different diseases. Although, there is limited evidence, accu racy of recall and reporting may be influenced by both patient and in formant (relative) factors, and by the method used to collect FH. Recommendations for direction of future research: Future studies in accuracy should be undertaken in populations reflective of th primary care setting and represen tative of the spectrum of disease risk. Future should endeavor to better ch aracterize the attributes of the informant/proband and especially the relatives; the potential of th ese factors to influence the accuracy of reporting should be consistently evaluated. Future evaluati on should be undertaken in the areas of asthma and atopy, adiseases, and diabetes. 3. Within primary care populations, there is ve ry limited evidence to s upport or refute the effect on risk-reducing behavior changes (e.g., lifestyle change s or uptake of recommended clinical interventions) of taking a FH and using it to personali ze risk of developing respective conditions. Recommendations for future research: Well-designed trials are required that co mpare FH-based, personalized risk advic with standard of care on risk reducing behavi ors in populations at di fferent risk le (including population risk). The outcomes of in terest need to be clinically relev either leading to improved mortality or morbidity or surrogate measures with strong evidence of linkalso be considered. Proposed trials should be based on evidence fr om systematic reviews to ensure that prescribed risk-reducing beha viors are evidence-based. 125 4.

C qualitative studies should also be consider ed. Baseline data on psychological status should be captured so that th is can formally be adjusted for use in outcome analyses. To enable appropriate evaluation of psyc hological harm, context-specific measure need to be developed and validated. 5. In order to assess the content validity of sy stematic FH tools we need to know not only at affect the recall of FH (Q2) but also those factors that affect the collection and use . Thus far, in this population, there is lim ited information on col b FH. There is some suggestion that populations from underserved communities are less lik to report and have the opportunity to discu ss FH, but the level of evidence is weak. Recommendations for future research: Further research is required to clarify the most important patient and practitioner factors that may affect th e collection and use of FH. This likely requires the development of theoretical frameworks to gui de appropriate design, and to ens methodologies adequately address the many potential biases and in teractions between factors, waddress factors directly relevant to pr imary c patient factors which promote inequity in the application of effective intervention Where inequities are identified, interventions should be designed to ameliorate these factors in future trials and service provision. Such research could include analyses onational population and practitioner survey databases. While research should focus on clinically relevant outcomes, it should also include process evaluations to identif y factors, which affect the successful implementatio the FH interventions. The findings of this systematic review pose as many questions as they answer, but they do not undermine the general view that FH taking is a worthwhile act ivity in primary care settin The evidence base for FH-based assessment and intervention is not well-developed, but absencof evidence ng suggest that such concerns may be u rigorous evaluations of FH taking and FH-based ri sk interventions. There is consistent evidenc a previous report 145 that FH tools (albeit for cancer) promote higher quality information ture than non-systematic approaches. The findi ngs from this systematic review begin to gest how to choose FH items to populate tools and emphasize the importance of considering rpose (to what use will FH info rmation be put?) and context (t ime available, and nature of ical encounter). Finally, although this systematic review identifi ed the paucity of relevant evidence for many portant issues, the findings do not negate the \"extraordinary pote 126 127 gen def amily practice, in partic is characterized informan ograms) in family-oriented clinical prac tice may be used for purposes which go beyond specific disease risk assessment, for example to assess the impact of \"family health\" (broadly ined) on an indi vidual's well-being.184 F continuity of the relationship between, patients, families, and practitioners. Thus, in the real rld, FH may be pieced together over time an d decision-making may be incremental as more ation emerges. A deeper appreciation of th e context in which FH is captured, interpreted, d acted upon is important as further FH ba sed interventions are developed and evaluated. Reference List 1.

(Selection) We are interpreting this to be representative of the spectrum of patients seen within family practice or primary care, which should include all levels of severity or disease duration. The population would be representative of those seen in practice where the test is likely to be applied (primary care settings and providers). Note that this criterion speaks more to generalizability than to a true selection bias. We considered issues of generalisability in terms of a) demographic features (prevalence, age, gender, b) disease characteristics (severity and duration), and c) co-morbidities or differential diagnosis. Note method of recruitment and characte ristics of those recruited. YES: Subjects represent spectrum of subjects seen within primary care settings. NO: Not that case control studies are considered by QUADAS to be a NO for this item, but we do not consider this to be a fatal flaw. Subjects that appear to represent a limited portion of the spectrum of patients with respect to disease severity, or duration, or risk for positive family history. Our review did not exclude studies that included subjects from specialty clinics or relatives of persons with the disease. As such, these relative may also be considered to be \"high risk\" for the disease (as the subjects patients may appear to be recruited because of high risk for family history and are scored NO. UNCLEAR: Description of participants is partial and there is uncertainty of the severity or duration of the disease. 2) Were the selection criteria clearly described? (Selection) Look for a clear definition of the eligibility criteria (both inclusion and EXCLUSION criteria). Note the criteria used to select BOTH the proband/control and the relatives/ informants. YES: Appears that sufficient description of the eligibility criteria , the process of recruiting for both the probands/ informants and the relatives. NO: All relevant information for selection processes is not reported. The following information may be omitted or poorly described: a) how the probands/ informants were selected (possibly how the proxy informants were selected) b) how the relatives were selected UNCLEAR: Only partial information is reported and don't feel you have enough information to score this item. B-5Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 3) Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target intervention? (Misclassification) The reference standard is the method used to determine the presence or absence of the target condition. The reference standard is therefore an important determinant of the diagnostic accuracy of a test. Estimates of test performance are based on the assumption that the index test is being compared to a reference standard which is 100% sensitive and specific. Not applicable to this systematic review as we limited this review to including studies that used methods of the reference standard that we consider to correctly classify the target condition. 4) Is the reference standard and index test short enough to be reasonably sure the target condition did not change between the two tests? (Misclassification) This problem may lead to misclassification bias as the disease may progress to a more advanced stage or there may be spontaneous recover. We do not anticipate that this is the context for family history, whereby the interval within which testing occurs will cause family history to be altered. Not applicable to this systematic review. B-6Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 5) Did the whole sample or a random selection of the sample receive verification using a reference standard of diagnosis? (Partial Verification bias) This item concerns to partial verification bias which occurs when not all of the study participants re ceive the reference standard (in our context, confirmation of the TRUE disease status). This is a form of selection bias. Sometimes the reason only a part of the sample receives the reference standard is because knowledge of the index test results influence the decision to perform the reference standard. Please note that in the context of family history, the reference standard can only be applied to the family members or relatives. The probands or informants are in es sence the \"index test\" even though we are interested in the accuracy of the probands/ informants. We consider the whole sample to be ALL relatives for which the proband or informant provided information (including \"Don't know\" status). YES: All relatives that the proband identifies/ reports upon represent the whole sample of relatives. As such, some form of verification is attempted for all identified relatives. NO: Not all relatives receive verification via the reference standard. As such, we consider partial verification bias to be present in the following situations: 1) Knowledge of the index test will determine which relatives are reported to have the disease status. Often UNAFFECTED relatives do not have their disease status verified by any method (assume proband/informant report is the truth of the disease status); in this case, the disease status is verified in the AFFECTED relatives only. In this situation the outcomes of sensitivity and specificity cannot be computed. 2) Relatives for which the proband/ informant indicates \"Don't know status\" are excluded and do not have their disease status verified (no reference standard testing). 3) Relatives that are DECEASED ; as such they are excluded from having any verification undertaken (no reference standard testing). 4) Relatives that are UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE in interviews or further clinical testing are excluded from having any verification method (no reference standard testing). UNCLEAR: Insufficient information to determine whether partial verification was present. B-7Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review B-86) Did the patients receive the same reference standard regardless of the index test? (Differential Verification Bias) \"Differential verification bias occurs when some of the index test results are verified by a different reference standard. This is especially a problem if multimodal types of reference standards are used. For example, differential verification bias usually occurs when relatives who are testing positive (have the disease) based on the proband report \"index test receive\" a more invasive or extensive reference standard than those with a negative test result. In most accuracy studies evaluating the reporting of family history, there is the use of more than one met hod to verify the disease status of the relative and we have restricted these to interview with relative, medical record, disease or death registry, and contact with the subject physician. Using multi-modal approaches to verification of disease status seems to be necessa ry for this area of research; relatives may be deceased, live afar, or are incapacitated because of disease or frailty. It is expected that most studies will be unable to use a single reference standard method (f or example interview with the relative) for all identified relatives. Verification can occur by different methods for different relatives or verification using multiple methods on the SAME relative (and a hierarchy of selection for disease status is used) [See Elbaz 2003 2 In the latter case, some authors state decision rules at which of the multiple tests will be considered to reflect the truth of the disease status of the relative. In the area of mental health disorders, they will often consider \"multiple informants\" as the \"reference\" standard\" and only include relatives for which there were \"verification\" reports from more than one informant. YES: All relatives received the SAME reference standard (for example, all living relatives were interviewed, and all deceased relatives had a proxy informant (for example interview with a spouse of the deceased relative). NO: All relatives did NOT receive the same references standard: 1) This item can indicate that some of the relatives received a DIFFERENT reference standard. For example, consider the case where: a) UNAFFECTED relatives have their disease status checked with medical records alone rather than interview or disease or death registry b) POSITIVE SCREEN relatives get a physical examination but those screening negative do NOT get a physical examination. c) DECEASED relatives have their disease status checked through medical records or interviews of other relatives (rather than neurological exam received by living relatives). c) From all informants/relatives who were identified and provided some initial information, only those available for direct interview are provided with more extensive testing (for example with diagnostic mental health instruments); these relatives/ in formants receive more extensive evaluation (i.e. different and additional reference standard tests). UNCLEAR: Some information provided but insufficient to determine this item. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 7) Was the reference standard independent of the index test (i.e. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? (Incorporation bias) \"When the result of the index test is used in establishing the final diagnosis, incorporation bias may occur. This incorporation will probably increase the amount of agreement between index test results and the outcome of the reference standard, and hence overestimate the various measures of diagnostic accuracy.\" This item is not applicable in tests that do not use multiple tests as part of the reference standards . The index test in this systematic review is the reporting of family history by the probands or informants. There are some special situations where informants are unable to provide family history information (for example they are too ill); in these situations, proxy family members are asked to provide the family history. These same family members, who served as proxy informants, may also be asked about their own disease status and may have knowledge of the responses they gave on behalf of the informant. We view this as an issue of masking bias, not incorporation bias. In the mental health area, family hist ory is often included as part of a list of criteria to determine the di sease status of either the proband OR the relative. In addition to inquiring about family history, the verification of the disease is established by asking probands or relatives a checklist of symptoms or other questions related to establishing diagnostic criteria. Thus, in this situation, there is the potential for incorporation bias, as the knowledge of the family history OR details of the presence or absence of symptoms (provided by the informant or proband) may be used to establish the mental health disorder within the relative. In some studies evaluating probands with mental health disorders, the authors make it very clear that different instruments were used to collect family history from the proban ds and from the relatives. In this case, although family history is collected from both the proband/informant and the relative, we are assuming this is NOT incorporation bias. The response of the proband/ informant is independent and is not included in the information collected to establish disease within the relative. YES: The index test (proband/ informant) reporting of family history is NOT included in the determination of the disease status of the relatives. NO: The index test (proband/ informant) reporting of family history is included in the determination of the disease status of the relatives. UNCLEAR: Some information provided but insufficient to determine this item. B-9Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 8) Was the execution of the index test described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the test? (Incorporation bias) We are looking for sufficient detail for REPLICATION of the index test. This should include details of the \"questions\" used to probe family history, and if possible the degr ee of relative (for example 1DR, 2DR, etc). Additionally, in studies evaluating probands with mental health disorders, note the sequence when family history was collected. We fully anticipate that there will be differences in the ways in which family history is collected across studies. If reported, evaluate the manner in which \"don' t know\" information was captured and classified. NB: We are aware that even if the method is replicable, it may not capture the quality of the manner in which FHx was captured; that is the study describes in detail the question used to probe family history, but the question is not well structured and may lead to poor or erroneous responses from the proband/informant. In this case, although the method was \"replicable\", we do not evaluate this as NO for QUADAS; rather we comment on the nature of the question. YES: If the manner in which FHx was collected is well specified (for example, standardized questions, or instrument are detailed). NO: There is no information about the manner in which FHx was probed (for example the questions asked) or the methods used to collect the information (not clear if a standardized format was used). UNCLEAR: Indicate that a standardized instrument was used, but do not know what was probed. Partial information is provided but not enough to score this item. 9) Was the execution of the reference standard described in sufficient detail to permit its replication ? (Incorporation bias) In the case of the reference standard, we are looking for sufficient detail to be able to REPLICATE how disease status was established. In the case where interview of the relative is used as a reference standard, any additional probing (for example questions to establish presence of mental health disorder) should also be described. Note that in most studies multi-modal approaches were used to establish the disease status of the rela tive. As such it is important that the authors describe how 1) deceased versus living relatives had their disease status verified, 2) positive versus negative status relatives (based on index test) had t heir disease status verified, 3) relatives that were unable to be contacted or participate, and 4) relatives for which no additional information could be obtained. If reported evaluate how \"don't know \" information was captured and classified. YES: Indicate the manner in which the disease status was established in relatives (self report, medical chart, linkage with registry, physical examination, etc). Note how missing information or \"don't know\" (due to inability to get records for example) are handled. NO: The information is insufficient to replicate the reference standard. UNCLEAR: Indicate methods for some of the multiple sources used to verify the disease status within relatives but insufficient information to score this item. B-10Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 10) Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? (Blinding) We assume this bias to be associated with the collection of data from the researchers and is related to \"review bias\" or blinding . Family history collection from probands/ informants generally precedes contact with relatives for subsequent verification. As such the data collectors would typically not be awar e of the true disease status of the relative when collecting family history from the informant. However, for some diseases, pro xy informants (often relatives) are used when informants are incapacitated or deceased). In the context of this systematic review, bias can occur when the proxy members used to provide family history are also the relatives who are used to verify their own or others disease status. They are not blind to their previous report of the disease status of their own health or that of other relatives. YES: Index test results were inte rpreted without knowledge of the relatives' disease status. If proxy in formants (i.e. relatives) had their disease status verified by means other than interview (for example medical record linkage or clinical assessment), OR the proxy informants who are relatives were excluded from the pool of relatives in the analysis, then scor e YES for this item. NO: Index test are not interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard. Also, the potential for masking bias is likely, when the proxy informants (i.e. relatives) were used and then these SAME relatives were then asked to confirm their own or other relatives disease status by interview only. UNCLEAR: Partial description is prov ided but not enough information to score this item. B-11Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 11) Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the index test? (Blinding) We assume this bias to be associated with the collection of data from the researchers and is related to \"review bias\" or blinding . Contact with the relatives is dependent on some minimal information or screening provided by the proband/informant. However, there is the possibility that the data collectors who contact the relatives (or check their medical records, etc.) ar e not blind to the report given by the proband/informant. Specifically, we look for a description specifying the masking of the dat a collectors of the reference standard. In the mental health area, data co llectors ask relatives a series of screening questions to determine the presence of a mental health disorder. Subsequently, their responses to these questions are used by an EXTERNAL diagnostician to determine the status of the disease. Although, in some cases it is not clear if the data collector was blind to the report from the i ndex test (proband/informant report), we do accept the external diagnostician as being blind in this case. YES: Study reports or methods describe blinding of data collectors or diagnostician verifying the disease status of the relative. NO: Study reports or methods confirm lack of blinding of the data collector to their disease status base don the informant report of family history. UNCLEAR: Blinding for some of the verification methods but not all of the methods is provided or there insufficient information to judge this item. 12) Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice? (Misclassification) QUADAS instructions suggest that if the interpretation of the index test is fully automated and involves no interpretation then this item may not be relevant and can be omitted from the quality assessment tool. However, the inte rpretation of the family history collection (index test) may require some judgement and depends on what is asked of the proband/informant or relative. Clinical data in the context of family history collection in primary care, could refer to information from direct observation, or access to proxy informants (such as a 1DR who may accompany the proband). It is unlikely that a primary care physician may have access to medical records, disease registries and death registries with information about the status of the relatives . In the context of this systematic re view, this item will not discriminate between studies; we will omit this item. B-12Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 13) Were un-interpretable/ intermediate test results reported? (Misclassification) In the context of family history colle ction it was difficult to define what results were \"uninterpretable\". We assu me that this item is interpreted to apply to disease status classification when the proband/informant (index test) did not know the disease status of the relative. Similarly, the disease status of the relative (reference standard) is not known or cannot be confirmed (for example, medical records may not have been easily obtained, or were inconclusive with regards to the disease status, or self report was unclear). In many studies (particularly mental health disorders) many of the relatives were excluded from the analysis and as such this is an issue of partial verification or a case of differential verification. In the context of this systematic review this item could not be disentangled from partial and differential verification bias and was not applicabled B-13Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (OUADAS) 1 QUADAS ITEM (Topic/Bias ) Interpretation for Family History OMAR Review 14) Were withdrawals for the study explained? (Misclassification) \"This occurs when subjects withdraw from the study before the results of either the index test or reference standard test are known. Note that the subjects considered in the context of the review include both the proband/informant sample AND the relatives/proxy sample. If patients differ systematically from those that remain in the analysis, then there is the potential for bias. We consider the sample of relatives to be those reported from the probands/ informants during the index test. As such, some studies do not specify the total sample of relatives reported; rather they report the number of relatives/ informants for which data was available. Potential subjects recruited can include those that are 1) alive, 2) deceased and a best proxy is found, 3) incapacitated to be interviewed and a best proxy is found, Potential recruited subjects are likel y to be excluded if 1) they refuse to participate, or b) a proxy informant is not found. In some studies, subjects were further excluded if there was not a match 9 YES: If all probands/ informants are accounted for in a flow diagram or reporting details; this includes t he number of subjects as follows: 1) those recruited 2) providing consent or refusing consent 3) for which a proxy respondent could not be provided 4) unable to complete the family history collection (for example due to frailty) 5) number not able to contact If all relatives (identified by the pr oband/ informants/ or registry) are accounted for in a flow diagram or reporting details; this includes the number of subjects as follows: 1) ALL relatives identified by the probands/ informants/ registry 2) relatives who gave consent or those refusing consent 3) unable to complete family history 4) for which a proxy informant could not be found 5) who were deceased 6) could not be contacted 7) unable to get verification of disease status NO: If all informants who entered the study are not accounted for.
