Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in [Section IV](#_Section_IV._Application_1). When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. [Part 1. Overview Information](#_Part_1._Overview) [Part 2. Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits applications that will advance understanding of vaccine regimens and immune responses that sustainably suppress viral loads in HIV-infected individuals. Applications should propose small, multi-arm, comparative clinical trials designed to identify correlations between levels of induced immune response and HIV virologic control. Vaccines may be combined with adjuvants and/or other modifiers of the immune response to HIV. HIV-infected persons currently require lifelong treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The development of therapeutic vaccines that induce HIV-controlling immune responses could end the need for lifelong treatment. However, it has proven exceptionally difficult to induce protective immune responses using vaccination strategies. Despite a number of clinical trials, effective products have not been developed. Substantial evidence suggests immune responses can reduce viral loads (VL) in HIV-infected persons. Some individuals naturally suppress VL to very low levels without cART. These elite controllers often produce CD8 T cell responses recognizing specific HIV peptides. Other individuals maintain very low VL after cART is withdrawn. The CD4 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in these post-treatment controllers display enhanced functional activity. Finally, some infected individuals develop broadly neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies (bNAb) that exhibit antiviral activity when cloned, manufactured and administered passively to infected animals and humans. Together, these observations suggest HIV should be susceptible to vaccination-induced, immune-mediated control. However, robust correlates of immune-mediated VL control in HIV-infected humans have yet to be identified, and there are sizable gaps in both our knowledge about the most effective mechanisms for suppressing VL and how to sustainably maintain protective responses. Chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation persist in HIV-infected individuals despite VL suppression with cART. These conditions have a variety of effects on immunity that may interfere with vaccine responsiveness. One prominent aspect of the dysregulation is T cell exhaustion, characterized phenotypically by upregulated expression on T cells of \"checkpoint\" receptors like PD-1. In experimental models of HIV infection, and in human cancer patients, therapeutic blockade of checkpoint pathways can increase and/or broaden T cell responses. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies for HIV may benefit from co-administration of immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory agents that antagonize suppressive checkpoint or inflammatory pathways. The VL rebound that follows withdrawal of cART is thought to result from activation of HIV reservoirs comprised of latently infected cells containing integrated HIV DNA. The latently infected cells may be invisible to the immune system if they do not express sufficient levels of HIV antigens. It may be possible to expose these quiescent reservoirs through the use of latency reversing agents (e.g. HDAC inhibitors, PKC agonists, TLR7 agonists). However, some reservoirs may reside within \"sanctuaries\" that are inaccessible to cytotoxic T cells. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies targeting HIV reservoirs may benefit from co-administration of agents that activate latent reservoirs to induce the expression of antigens and/or disrupt the capacity of HIV to hide within sanctuary sites. Perhaps the largest challenge to therapeutic vaccine strategies is the capacity of HIV to escape from immune responses. The dominant T cell responses elicited during acute HIV infection typically target regions of the virus that can mutate without substantially diminishing viral fitness, and the HIV reservoirs in patients on cART are replete with proviruses harboring mutations that have escaped from dominant T cell responses. Therapeutic vaccine strategies may need to overcome the robust priming of these dominant but ineffective responses. Rather, such strategies may need to target conserved regions of HIV that are unable to mutate without compromising viral fitness. Unfortunately, those responses naturally tend to be subdominant, if present at all. Thus, therapeutic vaccine strategies may need to overcome \"original antigenic sin\" to break natural immunodominance hierarchies in order to prime or boost responses to subdominant conserved regions and/or expand the breadth of responses, perhaps by including and excluding specific regions of the HIV genome in vaccine constructs. In addition to evading recognition by T cells, HIV also escapes from B cell responses. Moreover, carbohydrates shield HIV virions, making it difficult for antibodies to bind and neutralize their envelope glycoproteins. Nevertheless, some individuals produce measurable titers of bNAb that recognize many HIV variants. Much effort is currently focused on learning how to coax the immune system to produce bNAb more efficiently. Researchers are designing sets of immunogens engineered to guide the de novo maturation of bNAb-producing B cells. While primarily designed for preventive HIV vaccines, some of these constructs may be useful in therapeutic settings as well. Interestingly, preventive vaccine trials have suggested non-neutralizing antibodies also can protect against HIV, perhaps via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or phagocytosis. Thus, the induction or administration of HIV-specific antibodies may be an important component of HIV therapeutic vaccine strategies. The goal of this FOA is to support research that will advance understanding of vaccine regimens and immune responses that sustainably suppress viral loads in HIV-infected individuals. Specifically, it will support hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies utilizing small, comparative, multi-arm, clinical trials of virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals on cART. Vaccination approaches that aim to sustainably elicit, boost and/or activate HIV-specific T cells, NK cells, antibodies, or other effector mechanisms are responsive to this FOA, as are approaches that aim to elicit combinations of protective mechanisms. This FOA will also support a follow-on trial designed to confirm the observed correlations between specific immune response and virologic control and to further optimize the response. The goal is to incrementally develop effective therapeutic vaccination strategies by methodically increasing our understanding of protective responses and then working iteratively to improve the potency of those responses. In lieu of a second trial, an adaptive trial design can be proposed. The target population is HIV-infected individuals virologically suppressed by cART. Accordingly, the proposed readout assays should be chosen to quantify the effects of the therapeutic interventions on measures of persistent virus production and/or the active HIV reservoir in this population (e.g. single copy assays, cell-associated HIV RNA assays). The use of functional assays (e.g. viral inhibition/suppression assays) and extensive characterization of responses pre- and post-vaccination is encouraged, as is the development and use of novel immune and virologic assays. The proposed interventions must include vaccines, perhaps in combination with adjuvants and/or other modifiers of the immune response to HIV. To ensure timely initiation of the proposed studies, applicants are strongly encouraged to use agents already approved for human use or agents that are ready to be tested in clinical trials, particularly for the first trial. The initial trial must open to enrollment within 12 months of award and can be conducted at no more than 2 clinical research sites located within the United States. Specific areas of interest Applications including the following types of research will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed: Clinical Trial and Regulatory Support All clinical trial planning activities for the first trial must be completed by the time of application.

Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [NOT-OD-13-030](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-13-030.html). Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Are positive or negative results likely to advance understanding about the immune responses induced by vaccination and their ability to control HIV? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Do the PD(s)/PI(s) have sufficient time and expertise to implement complex, high-risk clinical trials? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Is the approach sufficiently innovative to justify risks to study participants and the required resources? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? Does the analysis include an appropriate sample size justification and power calculation, or an acceptable non-statistically powered justification? Will the chosen interventions and approaches test the hypothesis? Will the studies advance understanding of the immunological mechanisms that can be induced by vaccination to sustainably suppress viral loads in HIV-infected humans? Are the endpoints appropriate? Is sufficient data provided or referenced to support the proposed assays? Will the assays measure the impact/correlation of the induced immune response(s) on virologic control? Was a follow-on trial (or adaptive design) proposed and justified? Were appropriate criteria proposed for determining whether the results from the first trial warrant additional trials aimed at further strengthening or focusing the relevant immune responses? In the event that those success criteria are not met, was an alternative strategy for the follow-on trial proposed and justified? Is the overall proposed strategy consistent with an iterative approach to improving HIV therapeutic vaccine regimen? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Does the application adequately address Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) compliance as appropriate? Are potential ethical issues adequately addressed? Is it likely that the first trial can begin within 12 months of the award? Are the Milestone Plan and regulatory approaches realistic and feasible? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Is there sufficient support, either internally or through consortium agreements, to comply with NIAID policies for regulatory activities, clinical trial oversight, laboratory and pharmacy activities, and data and safety monitoring? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Not Applicable Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Not Applicable Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by NIAID, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: [Appeals](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-11-064.html) of initial peer review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this FOA. Applications will be assigned to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this FOA. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council. The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123). Refer to Part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/laws/revisedlep.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an \"assistance\" mechanism (rather than an \"acquisition\" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below. The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for: NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below: NIAID Project Scientists will be responsible for: Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. Areas of Joint Responsibility include: A Steering Committee (SC), composed of the Principal Investigator(s), Key Personnel, representatives from sites, representatives from laboratories, and one NIAID representative, the NIAID Project Scientist (). The SC will have primary responsibility for facilitating the conduct and monitoring of studies and reporting study results. As the components of the SC may be geographically dispersed, the SC should meet with monthly conference calls, supplemented as necessary by face to face meetings. Each full member of the SC will have one vote. The NIAID Project Scientist will have voting membership. Awardee members of the Steering Committee will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the Steering Committee. Dispute Resolution: Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16. When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161) [A final progress report, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the ] [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement.
