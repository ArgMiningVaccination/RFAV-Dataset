New York-based technology start-up [Plasma Nutrition](https://www.becomeio.com/) developed a process that treats ingredients with plasma, which may increase the ingredient's absorption in the human body. They first tested this process on whey protein and found [favorable results](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2017/07/11/Process-that-treats-whey-with-gas-plasma-boosts-bioefficiency-developers-claim) in a randomized, controlled trial. Recently, a published study found that this plasma process may help [increase the bioavailability of BCAAs as well](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2018/06/27/BCAA-bioavailability-may-increase-with-plasma-treatment-study-suggests). Meanwhile, California-based [Tamarack Biotics](https://tamarackbiotics.com/) developed technology [that treats raw milk using ultra violet radiation](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2017/10/03/New-protein-ingredient-made-of-non-pasteurized-milk-is-biggest-nutritional-advance-in-the-last-100-years-says-founder) instead of pasteurization. This means the milk can avoid the very high temperatures that pasteurized milk goes through, keeping all the nutrients of raw milk while removing the dangerous pathogens. The company is also marketing the resulting treated dairy ingredient under the brand name TruActive. It is, however, still in regulatory limbo and not yet available for sale. The [first study on the ingredient](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2018/10/22/UV-treated-raw-milk-linked-to-immunity-boost-study-suggests) was published in Frontiers in Immunology, where researchers found a link between TruActive and increased vaccine response in older adults. Another target audience for the company are elite athletes. Several studies are being designed to see the potential benefit in this population. Interested in Sports Nutrition?
