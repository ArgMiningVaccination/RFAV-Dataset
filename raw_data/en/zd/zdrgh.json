To have a work-life balance? Yes. But I know how confusing it can be, especially at first when you're starting your spiritual journey and are feeling heavily disconnected from others around you. So, my attempt today is to show you through some practical examples, that it very much IS possible to bring spirituality to the workplace. Because life should not be about choosing between your roles. Spirituality can and should be an inherent part of every role you play, especially the one that helps you bring bread and butter home! So let's look into some ways to be more spiritual and create a work-life balance for yourself. TIP #1 - Reuse the intermittent spaces between and after work. What do I mean by intermittent spaces? There are pockets of time in our day where we don't have to be doing something, and yet we are. By not allowing ourselves to BE, we deprive our [feminine energy](https://myspiritualshenanigans.blog/feminine-masculine-energy-balance/) from the work place. Here are some examples of what you might be doing, and what you can do instead to use the gaps to be more present. Don't pull out your phone when you are waiting for the elevator to come, or while taking the ride down to town. There are probably many other moments like this, where you have 'a few seconds'. As you identify them, see if you can now use them to tap back into the moment, by being mindful of your surroundings or your breath. Combine your work with movement. Some offices have a great policy of having \"walking meetings\". Try scheduling more of those in your day. As spiritual teacher, [Sonia Choquette](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1401902332/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=myspiritualsh-21&creative=24630&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1401902332&linkId=d9ae73ec557a11c02a96ff13ef723c2e) affirms, walking together can actually bring equilibrium and harmony in conflict. Movement literally helps to keep the energy moving in conversations. Eat mindfully, at least once a day. Even if it means a 10 minute coffee break, give yourself that space and time to just let your mind off of 'work-mode' and into present moment awareness. Make car rides back from work a spiritual experience. Instead of listening to mindless ads on the radio on the drive home, listen to something relaxing that can help you start unplugging and start tuning into yourself. Some gentle music, or chants - have a playlist. Here's [mine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLByJruN-wh7vm-1Cyz0K35Pce_KbIbBZ_), in case you'd like some inspiration. NOTE : I would NOT recommend podcasts, or anything mentally stimulating. Drive time is known to facilitate a connection with our Higher Self, which is only possible when our mind isn't constantly consuming new information. TIP #2 - Do smaller doses of 'subconscious' work. Subconscious programming means continually supplying the mind with higher levels of thoughts. This might not come naturally in a work environment, but you can create it for yourself with simple practices, such as: - Saving the quotes and affirmations you scroll throughout the day, and then reading them every morning as a self-care practice (without using your internet). - Saying a few quick morning affirmations in the bathroom mirror at work, if you don't have time to write them. - While at your seat, reboot yourself. A good example is by closing your eyes for a 30-second visualization where your stress dissipates, and bright white Light recharges your body. You might enjoy this [60-second energy reset tool](https://myspiritualshenanigans.blog/product/60-second-energy-clearing-tool-meditation/)to help cleanse any upsetting energy you've picked up. - If you're too shy to reboot with your eyes-closed, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding rule (also great for anxiety and stress). This [article](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/behavioral-health-partners/bhp-blog/april-2018/5-4-3-2-1-coping-technique-for-anxiety.aspx)describes the rule beautifully. TIP #3 - Create a work-life balance by being more feminine in your approach. Again as a highly masculine-energy driven society, we want to accomplish so much and yet, we are never appreciative of how far we've come. And how can we be, if we hardly ever have time to reflect on our achievements or even pause to think about what we've done? Cultivate the habit of acknowledging your efforts. This can look like reflecting on what you did in the day, and giving yourself a pat on the back. And then seeing how much you've done in the day, saying \"this is good enough\". Also when the time comes, reward yourself for some of the bigger goals you've achieved by consciously taking time off work (which people usually save for 'sick days' or travel only). Whether 10 minutes or 1 hour, have a me-time habit. Start the day on your terms. You will feel more nurtured. If you're looking for some inspiration, I talk in a lot more detail about some of my daily self-love and self-care practices in [this post](https://myspiritualshenanigans.blog/2019/05/25/7-daily-habits-that-bring-results-immediately/). Have cleaner work-time boundaries. Delay the work mode, until you're actually there. Do not jumble up me-time with work-time. This can mean do NOT check or respond to your emails the moment you open your eyes. Be true to yourself and your loved ones. How much time are you spending with yourself, honestly and authentically? Are you cheating on yourself with your work commitments? Ensure your work day doesn't end at the same time as you sleep. Signing out of devices, disconnecting from the internet are essential. TIP #4 - Achieve work-life balance by practicing the spiritual philosophies at work. Spirituality isn't meant to just \"sound good\". Here's how you can start practicing what's been preached to you. Surrender. When you are unable to figure a solution for your problem, SURRENDER. Walk away from your desk, take that 10-minute coffee break we discussed before, and rest be assured, you will come with more inspirations that lead you to the solution. Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. Understand the karmic role of annoying peers. I always find difficult relationships to be our best teachers. Identify the nature of your [Spiritual Contract](https://myspiritualshenanigans.blog/soul-contracts/). It may mean learning to be less of a 'yes-man', for example. Once you can harmonize your dynamic at work, you will experience a greater sense of oneness with everyone. Don't get sucked into the illusion. Do your [karma](https://myspiritualshenanigans.blog/karma/), don't try to manipulate the outcome. In other words, stop feeding the drama of your ego when things don't go your way at work. Time to transcend the temptation to kiss up to people at higher authority and to stop indulging in project politics. NOTE : At the same time, your employer not being able to fulfil your expectations, is a bounce-back at the previous point about practising self-love and voicing your concerns in a gentle and firm way. Bring in minimalism. Minimalism isn't just for the monks. And at work, it can look like a clean desk, an organized calendar and can even reflect on your wardrobe. How would all this be relevant? The less clutter, the more expansive you will feel. And the higher quality of work-life balance you'll create. Tip #5 - Work consciously, whatever you do. Here are some shorter, bite-sized reflections to just make you more spiritual through and through. - Be mindful and less on 'autopilot' - you will make less mistakes that way. - Stop reacting, start responding. You will spend less energy being flustered. - Allow yourself to conform less and think 'outside of the box'. - Work beyond your fears. Sometimes, it means expressing an unpopular opinion. Concluding Thoughts These are just some of the many ways in which spirituality can crossover with work and give you the work-life balance you deserve.
