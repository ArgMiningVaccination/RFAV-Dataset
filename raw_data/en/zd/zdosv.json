Major revisions were needed in a number of areas to accommodate changes in the field of psychi-atric and mental health nursing and to incorporate more recent references as well as evidence-based prac-tice guidelines that may have become available since the previous revision was published. The book is inclusive in that it contains both basic and advanced content, and may be used by nurses seeking certification as generalists as well as nurses seeking certification in advanced practice psychiatric and mental health nursing. It is assumed that the reader of this review guide has completed a course of study in psychiatric and mental health nursing. The Psychiatric Nursing Certification Review Guide for the Generalist and Advanced Practice Psychiatric and Mental Health (PMH) Nurse is not intended to be a basic learning tool. The purpose of the book is twofold. It will assist indi- viduals engaged in self-study preparation for certifi-cation examinations, and may be used as a reference guide in the practice setting. Many nurses preparing for certification examinations find that reviewing an extensive body of scientific knowledge requires a very difficult search of many sources that must be synthe-sized to provide a review base for the examination. The purpose of this publication is to provide a succinct, yet comprehensive review of the core material.The book has been organized to provide the reviewer with test taking strategies and techniques. This is followed by chapters on the Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care, Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychi-atric Nursing, Substance-Related Mental Disorders, Anxiety and Stress-Related Disorders, Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorders, Behavioral Syndromes and Disorders of Adult Person-ality, Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing, Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Child-hood and Adolescence, and The Larger Mental Health Environment. Following each chapter are test questions, which are intended to serve as an introduction to the testing arena. In addition, a bibliography is included for those who desire a more in-depth discussion of the subject matter in each chapter. These references can serve as additional instructional material for the reader. Certification is a process that is gaining recognition both within and outside the profession. For the profes-sional, it is a means of gaining special recognition as a certified psychiatric nurse, which not only demon-strates a level of competency, but may also enhance professional opportunities and advancement. For the consumer, it means that a certified nurse has met certain predetermined standards set by the profession.PrefaceixFront/End Matter Title Chapter 6.

Everyone has a personal learning style, but we all must proceed through the same process to think. Thinking occurs on two levels--the lower level of memory and comprehension and the higher level of ap-plication and analysis (ABP , 1989). Memory is the abil-ity to recall facts. Without adequate retrieval of facts, progression through the higher levels of thinking can-not occur easily. Comprehension is the ability to under-stand memorized facts. To be effective, comprehension skills must allow the person to translate recalled infor-mation from one context to another. Application, or the process of using information to know why it occurs, is a higher form of learning. Effective application relies on the use of understood memorized facts to verify in-tended action. Analysis is the ability to use abstract or logical forms of thought to show relationships and to distinguish the cause and effect between the variables in a situation. As applied to testing situations, the thought pro- cess from memory to analysis occurs quite quickly. Some examination items are designed to test memory and comprehension, while others test application and analysis. An example of a memory question is as follows: Clients' initial response to learning that they have a terminal illness is generally: A. Depression B. Bargaining C. Denial D. AngerWe all respond to testing situations in different ways. What separates the successful test taker from the un-successful one is knowing how to prepare for and take a test. Preparing yourself to be a successful test taker is as important as studying for the test. Each person needs to assess and develop their own test taking strategies and skills. The primary goal of this chapter is to assist potential examinees in knowing how to study for and take a test. STRATEGY #1 Know YouRSElf \u0088 When faced with an examination, do you feel threat-ened, experience butterflies or sweaty palms, have trouble keeping your mind focused on studying or on the test questions? These common symptoms of test anxiety plague many of us, but can be used advanta-geously if understood and handled correctly (Divine & Kylen, 1979). Over the years of test taking, each of us has developed certain testing behaviors, some of which are beneficial, while others present obstacles to suc-cessful test taking. You can take control of the test tak-ing situation by identifying the undesirable behaviors, maintaining the desirable ones, and developing skills to improve test performance. STRATEGY #2 DEvElop YouR \u0088 ThinKinG SKillS Understanding Thought Processes In order to improve your thinking skills and subsequent test performance, it is best to understand the types 1 Test Taking Strategies and Techniques 2ChApTER 1 Test Taking Strategies and Techniques Building Your Thinking Skills Effective memorization is the cornerstone to learning and building thinking skills (Olney, 1989). We have all experienced \"memory power outages\" at some time, due in part to trying to memorize too much, too fast, too ineffectively. Developing skills to improve memo-rization is important to increasing the effectiveness of your thinking and subsequent test performance. Technique #1 Quantity is NOT quality, so concentrate on learning im-portant content. For example, it is important to know the various pharmacologic agents appropriate for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), not the specific dosages for each medication. Technique #2 Memory from repetition, or saying something over and over again to remember it usually fades. Developing memory skills that trigger retrieval of needed facts is more useful. Such skills are as follows: Acronyms These are mental crutches that facilitate recall. Some are already established such as PERRL (pupils equal, round, reactive to light), or PAT (paroxysmal atrial tachycardia). Developing your own acronyms can be particularly useful since they are your own word associ-ation arrangements in a singular word. Nonsense words or funny, unusual ones are often more useful since they attract your attention. Acrostics This mental tool arranges words into catchy phrases. The first letter of each word stands for something that is recalled as the phrase is said. Your own acrostics are most valuable in triggering recall of learned informa-tion since they are your individual situation associa-tions. An example of an acrostic is as follows: Kissing Patty Produces Affection stands for the four types of nonverbal messages: Kinesics, Para - language, Proxemics and Appearance. ABCsThis technique facilitates information retrieval by using the alphabet as a crutch. Each letter stands for a symp-tom, which when put together creates a picture of the clinical presentation of the disease. For example, the characteristics of the disease and symptoms of osteoar-thritis using the ABC technique are as follows: a) Aching or pain b) Being stiff on awakening c) Crepitus d) Deterioration of articular cartilage e) Enlargements of distal interphalangeal joints f) Formation of new bone at joint surfaceTo answer this question correctly, the individual has to retrieve a memorized fact. Understanding the fact, knowing why it is important, or analyzing what should be done in this situation is not needed. An example of a question that tests comprehension is as follows: Shortly after having been informed that she is in the terminal stages of breast cancer, Mrs. Jones begins to talk about her plans to travel with her husband when he retires in two years. The nurse should know that: a. The diagnosis could be wrong and Mrs. Jones may not be dying. b. Mrs. Jones is probably responding to the news by using the defense mechanism of denial. c. Mrs. Jones is clearly delusional. d. Mrs. Jones is not responding in the way most cli-ents would. In order to answer this question correctly, an indi- vidual must retrieve the fact that denial is often the first response to learning about a terminal illness and that Mrs. Jones' behavior is indicative of denial. In a higher level of thinking examination question, individuals must be able to recall a fact, understand that fact in the context of the question and apply this understanding to explaining why one answer is correct after analyzing the answer choices as they relate to the situation (Sides & Cailles, 1989). An example of an ap-plication analysis question is as follows: Mr. Smith has just learned that he has an inoperable brain tumor. His comment when the nurse speaks to him later is \"This can't possibly be true. Mistakes are made in hospitals all the time. They might have mixed up my test results.\" The nurse's most appropriate re-sponse would be to: a. Refer Mr. Smith for a psychiatric consultation. b. Neither agree nor disagree with Mr. Smith's comment. c. Confront Mr. Smith with his denial. D. Agree with Mr. Smith that mistakes can happen and tell him you will see about getting repeat tests. To answer this question correctly, the individual must recall the fact that denial is often the initial response to learning about a terminal illness; understand that Mr. Smith's response in this case is evidence of the normal use of denial; apply this knowledge to each option, un-derstanding why it may or may not be correct; and ana-lyze each option for what action is most appropriate for this situation. Application/analysis questions require the examinee to use logical rationale, which demon-strates the ability to analyze a relationship, based on a well-defined principle or fact. Problem-solving abil-ity becomes important as the examinee must think through each question option, deciding its relevance and importance to the situation of the question.3 Strategy #3 Know the Content Words that rhyme can also be used to jog the mem- ory about important characteristics of phenomena. For example, the stages of group therapy can be remem-bered and characterized by the following, according to Tuckman (1965): FormingStormingNormingPerforming Setting content to music is sometimes useful for re- membering. Melodies that are repetitious jog the mem- ory by the ups and downs of the notes and the rhythm of the music. Links connect key words from the content by us- ing them in a story. An example given by Olney (1989) for remembering the parts of an eye is: IRIS watched a PUPIL through the LENS of a RED TIN telescope while eating CORN-EA on the cob. Additional memory aids may also include the use of color or drawing for improving recall. Use different colored pens or paper to accentuate the material being learned. For example, highlight or make notes in blue for content about respiratory problems and in red for cardiovascular content. Drawing assists with visualiz-ing content as well. This is particularly helpful for re-membering the pathophysiology of the specific health problem. The important thing to remember about remem- bering is to use good recall techniques. Technique #3 Improving higher level thinking skills involves exercis-ing the application and analysis of memorized fact. Small group review is particularly useful for enhancing these high level skills. It allows verbalization of thought processes and receipt of input about content and thought process from others (Sides & Cailles, 1989). Individuals not only hear how they think, but how oth-ers think as well. This interaction allows individuals to identify flaws in their thought process as well as to strengthen their positive points. Taking practice tests is also helpful in developing ap- plication/analysis thinking skills. These tests permit the individual to analyze thinking patterns as well as the cause-and-effect relationships between the ques-tion and its options. The problem-solving skills needed to answer application/analysis questions are tested, giving the individual more experience through practice (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). STRATEGY #3 Know ThE ConTEnT \u0088 Your ability to study is directly influenced by organiza-tion and concentration (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). If effort is spent on both of these aspects of exam prepa-ration, examination success can be increased.g) Granulation inflammatory tissue h) Heberden's nodes One letterRecall is enhanced by emphasizing a single letter. The major symptoms of schizophrenia are often remem-bered as follows: Affect (flat) AutismAuditoryhallucinations ImagingThis technique can be used in two ways. The first is to develop a nickname for a clinical problem that when said produces a mental picture. For example, \"a wan, wheezy pursed lip\" might be used to visual-ize a patient with pulmonary emphysema who is thin, emaciated, experiencing dyspnea, with a hyperin-flated chest, who has an elongated expiratory breath-ing phase. A second form of imaging is to visualize a specific patient while you are trying to understand or solve a clinical problem when studying or answering a question. For example, imagine an elderly man who is experiencing an acute asthma attack. You are trying to analyze the situation and place him in a position that maximizes respiratory effort. In your mind you vi-sualize him in various positions of side lying, angular and forward, imaging what will happen to the man in each position. A second form of imaging is to visual-ize a specific situation while you are trying to answer a question. For example, if you are trying to remember how to describe active listening or physical attend-ing skills, see yourself in a comfortable environment, facing the other person, with open posture and eye contact. Rhymes, music & links The absurd is easier to remember than the most com-mon. Rhymes, music or links can add absurdity and humor to learning and remembering (Olney, 1989). These retrieval tools are developed by the individual for specific content. For example, making up a rhyme about diabetes may be helpful in remembering the pre-dominant female incidence, origin of disease, primary symptoms and management, as illustrated by: There once was a womanwhose beta cells failed,She grew quite thirstyand her glucose levels sailed,Her lack of insulin caused her toincrease her intakeAnd her increased urinary outputwas certainly not fake,So she learned to watch her dietand administer injectionsThat kept her healthy, happyand free of complications.4ChApTER 1 Test Taking Strategies and Techniques Preparation for Studying: Getting Organized Study habits are developed early in our educational experiences. Some of our habits enhance learning, al-though others do not. To increase study effectiveness, organization of study materials and time is essential. Organization decreases frustration, allows for easy re-sumption of study, and increases concentrated study time. Technique #1 Create your own study space. Select a study area that is yours alone, free from distractions, comfortable, and well lighted. The ventilation and room temperature should be comfortable since a cold room makes it dif-ficult to concentrate and a warm room may make you sleepy (Burkle & Marshak, 1989). All your study materi-als should be left in your study space. The basic premise of a study space is that it facilitates a mind-set that you are there to study. When you interrupt study, it is best to leave your materials just as they are. Do not close books or put away notes as you will just have to relocate them, wasting your study time, when you do resume study. Technique #2 Define and organize the content. From the test giver, se-cure an outline or the content parameters that are to be examined. If the test giver's outline is sketchy, develop a more detailed one for yourself using the recommended text as a guideline. Next, identify your available study resources: class notes, old exams, handouts, textbooks, review courses, or study groups. For national standard-ized exams, such as initial licensing or certification, it is best to identify one or two study resources that cover the content being tested and stick to them. Attempt-ing to review all available resources is not only mind boggling, but increases anxiety and frustration as well. Make your selections and stay with them. Technique #3 Conduct a content assessment. Use a simple rating scale such as the following: 1 = requires no review2 = requires minimal review3 = requires intensive review4 = start from the beginning Read through the content outline and rate each con- tent area (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). Table 1-1 provides a sample exam content assessment. Be honest with your assessment. It is far better to recognize your con-tent weaknesses when you can study and remedy them, rather than thinking during the exam how you wished you had studied more. Likewise with content strengths: if you know the material, do not waste time studying it.Table 1-1 \u0084 Sample Content Assessment Exam Content: Theories & Skills Category: Provided by Test GiverRating: Provided by Examinee Group dynamics 2 Group process 2 Behavior modification 3 Crisis intervention 1 Reality therapy 4 Communication process 3 Interviewing skills 3 Self-care 4 Decision making 1 Legal/ethical issues 2 Cognitive techniques 2 Mental status evaluation 3 Problem solving 3 Community resources evaluation 3 Nursing process 3 Nursing theory 2 Role theory 3 Change theory 2 Communication theories 2 Organizational theory 2 Research design 2 Research evaluation 2 Research application 2 Team building 3 Conflict management 2 Teaching/learning skills 3 Supervisory skills 3 Observation skills 3 Evaluation skills 2 Nursing diagnosis 3 DSM IV 3 Grief and loss theory 3 Death and dying 2 Stress management theory 2 Stress management skills 4 Family dynamics 2 Assertiveness training skills 3 Motivation skills 4 Houseman, C.

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.5 Strategy #3 Know the Content your peak study times and using techniques to maxi- mize them. Technique #1 Study in short bursts. Each of us have our own biologic clock that dictates when we are at our peak during the day. If you are a morning person, you are gener-ally active and alert early in the day, slowing down and becoming drowsy by evening. If you are an evening per-son, you do not completely wake up until late morning and hit your peak in the afternoon and evening. Each person generally has several peaks during the day. It is best to study during those times when your alertness is at its peak (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). During our concentration peaks, there are mini- peaks, or bursts of alertness (Olney, 1989). These alert-ness peaks of a concentration peak occur because levels of concentration are at their highest during the first part and last part of a study period. These bursts can vary from 10 minutes to 1 hour depending on the extent of concentration. If studying is sustained for 1 hour there are only two mini-peaks; one at the begin-ning and one at the end. There are 8 mini-peaks if that same hour is divided into 4, 10-minute intervals. Hence it is more helpful to study in short bursts (Olney, 1989). More can be learned in less time. Technique #2 Cramming can be useful. Since concentration ability is highly variable, some individuals can sustain their mini-peaks for 15, 20, or even 30 minutes at a time. Technique #4 Develop a study plan. Coordinate the content that needs to be studied with the time available (Sides & Cailles, 1989). Prioritize your study needs, starting with weak areas first. Allow for a general review at the end of the study plan. Lastly, establish an overall goal for yourself--something that will motivate you when it is brought to mind. Table 1-2 illustrates a study plan developed on the ba- sis of the exam content assessment in Table 1-1. Con-ducting an assessment and developing a study plan should require no more than 50 minutes. It is a wise investment of time with potential payoffs of reduced study stress and enhanced exam success. Technique #5 Begin now and use your time wisely. The smart test taker begins the study process early (Olney, 1989). Sit down, conduct the content assessment, and develop a study plan as soon as you know about the exam. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! Getting Down to Business: The Actual Studying There is no better way to prepare for an examination than individual study (Dickenson-Hazard, 1989). The responsibility to achieve the goal you set for this exam lies with you alone. The means you employ to achieve this goal do vary and should begin with identifying Table 1-2 \u0084 Sample Study Plan Goal: Achieve a passing grade on the certification exam.

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.6ChApTER 1 Test Taking Strategies and Techniques helpful. Ways to be active include: taking notes on the content as you study; constructing questions and an-swering them; taking practice tests; or discussing the content with yourself. Also, using your individual study quirks is encouraged. Some people stand, others walk around, and some play background music. Whatever helps you to concentrate and study better, you should use. Technique #8 Use study aids. Although there is no substitute for in-dividual studying, several resources, if available, are useful in facilitating learning. Review courses are an excellent means for organizing or summarizing your individual study. They generally provide the content parameters and the major concepts of the content that you need to know. Review courses also provide an op-portunity to clarify not-well-understood content, as well as to review known material (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). Study guides are useful for organizing study. They provide detail on the content that is important to the exam. Study groups are an excellent resource for summarizing and refining content. They provide an op-portunity for thinking through your knowledge base, with the advantage of hearing another person's point of view. Each of these study aids increases understanding of content and when used correctly, increases effective-ness of knowledge application. Technique #9 Know when to quit. It is best to stop studying when your concentration ebbs. It is unproductive and frus-trating to force yourself to study. It is far better to rest or unwind, then resume at a later point in the day. Avoid studying outside your morning or afternoon concen-tration peaks and focus your study energy on your right time of day or evening. STRATEGY #4 BEComE TEST -wiSE \u0088 Most nursing examinations are composed of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). This type of question re-quires the examinee to select the best response(s) for a specific circumstance or condition. Successful test tak-ing is dependent not only on content knowledge but on test taking skill as well. If you are unable to impart your knowledge through the vehicle used for its conveyance, i.e., the MCQ, your test taking success is in jeopardy. Technique #1 Recognize the purpose of a test question. Most test questions are developed to examine knowledge at two separate levels: memory and application. A memory question requires the examinee to recall and com-prehend facts from their knowledge base, while an Pushing your concentration beyond its peak is fruitless and verges on cramming, which in general is a poor study technique. There are, however, times when cram-ming, a short-term memory tool, is useful. Short-term memory generally is at its best in the morning. A quick review or cram of content in the morning can be useful the day of the exam (Olney, 1989). Most studying, how-ever, is best accomplished in the afternoon or evening when long-term memory functions at its peak. Technique #3 Give your brain breaks. Regular times during study to rest and absorb the content are needed by the brain. The best approach to breaks is to plan them and give yourself a conscious break (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). This approach eliminates the \"day dreaming\" or \"wan-dering thought\" approach to breaks that many of us use. It is better to get up, leave the study area and do something nonstudy related for longer breaks. For shorter breaks of 5 minutes or so, leave your desk, gaze out the window or do some stretching exercises. When your brain says to give it a rest, accommodate it! You will learn more with less stress. Technique #4 Study the correct content. It is easy for all of us to be-come bogged down in the detail of the content we are studying. However, it is best to focus on the major con-cepts or the \"state of the art\" content. Leave the de-tails, the suppositions, and the experience at the door of your study area. Concentrate on the major textbook facts and concepts that revolve around the subject mat-ter being tested. Technique #5 Fit your studying to the test type. The best way to pre-pare for an objective test is to study facts, particularly anything printed in italics or bold. Memory enhancing techniques are particularly useful when preparing for an objective test. If preparing for an essay test, study generalities, examples, and concepts. Application tech-niques are helpful when studying for this type of an exam (Burkle & Marshak, 1989). Technique #6 Use your study plan wisely. Your study plan is meant to be a guide, not a rigid schedule. You should take your time with studying. Do not rush through the con-tent just to remain on schedule. Occasionally study plans need revision. If you take more or less time than planned, readjust the plan for the time gained or lost. The plan can guide you, but you must go at your own pace. Technique #7 Actively study. Being an active participant in study rather than trying to absorb the printed word is also 7 Strategy #5 Apply Basic Rules of Test Taking Technique #4 Practice, practice, practice. Taking practice tests can improve performance. Although they can assist in eval-uation of your knowledge, their primary benefit is to assist you with test taking skills. You should use them to evaluate your thinking process, your ability to read, understand and interpret questions, and your skills in completing the mechanics of the test. Exam resources, including sample questions for the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) cer-tification exams, are available online at: http://www.nursecredentialing.org/Certification/ExamResources.aspx STRATEGY #5 Appl Y BASiC RulES \u0088 of TEST T AKinG Technique #1 Follow your regular routine the night before a test. Eat familiar foods. Avoid the temptation to cram all night. Go to bed at your regular time (Nugent and Vitale, 1997). Technique #2 Be prepared for exam day. It is important to familiarize yourself with the test site, the building, the parking, and travel route prior to the exam day. If you must travel, arrive early to allow time for this familiarization. It is helpful to make a list of things you need on the exam day: pencils, admission card, watch, and a few pieces of hard candy as a quick energy source. On exam day allow yourself plenty of time to arrive at the site. Wear comfortable clothes and have a good breakfast that morning.application question requires the examinee to use and apply the knowledge (ABP , 1989). Memory questions test recall, but application questions test synthesis and problem-solving skills. When taking a test you need to be aware of whether you are being asked a fact or to use that fact. Technique #2 Recognize the components of a test question. Multiple-choice questions may include the basic components of a background statement, a stem, and a list of options. The background statement presents information that facilitates the examinee in answering the question. The stem asks or states the intent of the question. The op-tions are four to five possible responses to the question. The correct option is called the keyed response and all other options are called distractors (ABP , 1989). Know- ing the components of a test question helps you sift through the information presented and focus on the question's intent (see Table 1-3 ). Technique #3 Recognize the item types. Basically two styles of MCQs are used for examinations. One requires the examinee to select the one best answer; the other requires selec-tion of multiple correct answers. Among the one-best-answer styles there are three types. The A type requires the selection of the best response among those offered. The B type requires the examinee to match the options with the appropriate statement. The X type asks the ex-aminee to respond either true or false to each option (ABP , 1989). Most standardized tests, such as those used for nursing licensure and certification, are com-posed of four or five option-A type questions. Table 1-3 \u0084 Anatomy of a Test Question Background statement A woman brings her 65-year old mother in to see a clinical nurse specialist because she is concerned that it is now a month since her mother was widowed, and she continues to be tearful when talking about the loss and wants to visit the grave regularly.

Ifyouareeasilydistractedbysound,considerus- ing earplugs (these may be available at the testing center; check before using your own). Personalitemssuchasbooks,laptopcomputers, iPods, cellular telephones, food, or drink are not al- lowed during testing; secure these items elsewhere. Arrive30minutesbeforetheappointedtesting time. Ifyouarenotcomfortable takingexamsusinga computer, consider taking a practice exam usually available at the examination site.

Sample online questions for each ANCC certification exam are available at: http://www.nursecredentialing. org/Certification/ExamResources.aspx Knowwhattodoifyouexperienceanyelectronic or other difficulties during the examination. In ad- dition to addressing the issue at the test site, you should also notify the certifying board (inform ANCC about problems during exam using the post-test survey). STRATEGY #6 pSYCh YouRSElf up: \u0088 TAKinG A TEST iS STRESSful Although a little stress can be productive, too much can incapacitate you in your studying and test taking (Divine & Kylen, 1979). For persons with severe test anxiety, interventions such as Cognitive Therapy, Sys-tematic Desensitization, Study Skills Counseling and Biofeedback have all been used with some success (Spielberger, 1995). Techniques derived from these ap-proaches can influence the results achieved by chang-ing attitudes and approaches to test taking and thereby reducing anxiety. Psyching yourself up can have a posi-tive effect and make examinations a nonanxiety-laden experience (Dickenson-Hazard, 1990). The following techniques are based on the principles of successful test taking as presented by Sides & Cailles (1989). Incor-poration of these techniques can improve response and performance in examination situations. Technique #1 Adopt an \"I can\" attitude. Believing you can succeed is the key to success. Self-belief inspires and gives you Technique #3 Understand all the directions for the test. Know if the test has a penalty for guessing or if you should attempt every question (Nugent and Vitale, 1997). Technique #4 Read the directions carefully. An exam may have sev-eral types of questions. Be on the lookout for changing item types and be sure you understand the directions on how you are to answer before you begin reading the question. Technique #5 Use time wisely and effectively. Allow no more than 1 minute per question. Skip difficult questions and re-turn to them later or make an educated guess. Technique #6 Read and consider all options. Be systematic and use problem-solving techniques. Relate options to the question and balance them against each other. Technique #7 Check your answers. Reconsider your answers, espe-cially those in which you made an educated guess. You may have gained information from subsequent ques-tions that is helpful in answering previous questions or may be less anxious and more objective by the end of the test.

Don'tchangeananswerwithoutagoodreason, such as having misread the question.9 Bibliography is not the end of the world unless you allow it to be. It is best to deal with the failure and move on, otherwise it interferes with your success. Technique #8 Persevere, persevere, persevere! Endurance must un-derlie all your efforts. Call forth those reserve energies when you have had all you think you can take. Rely upon yourself and your support systems to help you maintain a sense of direction and keep your goal in the forefront. Technique #9 Motivation is muscle. Most individuals are motivated by fear or desire. The fear in an exam situation may be one of failure, the unknown, or discovery of imperfec-tion. Put your fear into perspective; realize you are not the only one with fear, and that all have an equal op-portunity for success. Develop strategies to reduce fear and use fear to your advantage by improving the imper-fections. Desire is a powerful motivator, and you should keep the rewards of your desire foremost in your mind. Whatever motivates you, use it to make you success-ful. Reward yourself during your exam preparation and once the exam has been completed. You alone hold the key to success; use what you have wisely. SummARY \u0088 This chapter has provided concepts, strategies, and techniques for improving study and test taking skills. Your first task in improvement is to know yourself: how you study and how you take a test. You should use your strengths and remedy the weaknesses. Next you need to develop your thinking skills. Work on techniques to improve memory and reasoning. Now you need to organize your study and concentrate on using your strengths and these new and improved skills to be suc-cessful. Create a study space, develop a plan of action, then implement that plan during your periods of peak concentration. Before taking the exam, be sure you un-derstand the components of a test question, can iden-tify key words and phrases, and have practiced. Apply the test taking rules during the exam process. Finally, believe in yourself, your knowledge, and your talent. Believing you can accomplish your goal facilitates the fact that you will. BiBlioGRAphY \u0088 American Board of Pediatrics. (1989).

Without a success atti-tude, the road to your goal is much harder. We all stand an equal chance of success in this world. It is those who believe they can who achieve it. This \"I can\" atti-tude must permeate all your efforts in test taking, from studying, to improving your skills, to actually writing the test. Technique #2 Take control. By identifying your goal, deciding how to accomplish it, and developing a plan for achieving it, you take control. Do not leave your success to chance; control it through action and attitude. Technique #3 Think positively. Examinations are generally based on a standard that is the same for all individuals. Every-one can potentially pass. Performance is influenced not only by knowledge and skill but by attitude as well. Those individuals who regard an exam as an opportu-nity or challenge will be more successful. Technique #4 Project a positive self-fulfilling prophecy. While prepar-ing for an examination, project thoughts of the posi-tive outcomes you will experience when you succeed. Self-talk is self-fulfilling. Expect success, not failure, for yourself. Technique #5 Feel good about yourself. Without feeling a sense of positive self-worth, passing an examination is difficult. Recognize your professional contributions and give yourself credit for your accomplishments. Think \"I will pass,\" not \"I suppose I can.\" Technique #6 Know yourself. Focus exam preparation and test taking on your strengths. Try to alter your weaknesses instead of becoming hung up on them. If you tend to overana-lyze, study and read test questions at face value. If you are a speed demon when taking a test, slow down and read more carefully. Technique #7 Failure is a possibility. We all have failed at something at some point in our lives. Rather than dwelling on the failure, making excuses and believing you will fail again, recognize your mistakes and remedy them. Failure is a time to begin again; use it as a motivator to do better.

Challenge\u2014viewing change as normal and ob- stacles as opportunities (Johnson, 1997) Absence of mental health may be perceived as uncomfortable to the individual and/or significant others and result in the perception of a need for change. Change \u0088 Definition\u2014process resulting in transformation Planned change\u2014deliberate, goal-directed effort to solve problems; applicable to any system (indi- vidual, family, organization) Process involves the following responses (Huelsko- etter and Romano, 1991):1. Feelings of tension, anxiety, and fear2. A sense of need3. Feelings of hope4. A search5. Decision and goal setting6. Commitment to goals and change 7. Creative behavior 8. Changes in behavior Success of change is dependent on the change agent's ability to facilitate a helping relationship and collaborate with the individual, group, family, or organization. Change involves risk and resistance. It cannot be rushed.Mental health \u0088 Definition\u2014Mental health is a state of psycho- logical and emotional well-being. The mentally healthy individual: a) strives to achieve balance in physical, emotional, social, and spiritual spheres; and b) is able to cope effectively with normal stresses in life and function productively to meet individual, family, and community needs (World Health Organization [WHO], 2005). Factors influencing mental health according to Videbeck (2006) include:1. Individual/Personal factors\u2014including one's biological and genetic makeup, emotional re-silience or hardiness, self-esteem, autonomy and independence, reality orientation, and ability to cope with stressors 2. Interpersonal/Relationship factors\u2014including effective communication skills and strategies, ability to socially/emotionally engage with and help/be helped by another, intimacy, and a balance of connectedness and separateness 3. Social-cultural/Environmental factors\u2014includ - ing positive and realistic social awareness, a sense of community, access to resources, sup-port of diversity, and intolerance of violence Hardiness is viewed as a characteristic of mentally healthy people and involves the following:1. Control\u2014feeling in charge of and able to influ- ence own life 2. Commitment\u2014feeling deeply involved in life and work2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care 12 Chapter 2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care Intervention\u2014treatment according to diagnoses and care plan should be based on scientific theory and includes:1. Psychotherapeutic interventions\u2014may be talking, poetry writing, social skills training, cooking, modeling assertiveness, or expression of feelings 2. Health teaching\u2014about medication, nutrition, sleep hygiene 3. Self-care activities\u2014e.g., relaxation, exercise, spirituality 4. Somatic therapies\u2014e.g., nursing care of clients receiving ECT 5. Therapeutic environment\u2014milieu 6. Psychotherapy (advanced practice role for Psychiatric-Mental Health Clinical Nurse Specialist [PMHCNS] or Nurse Practitioner [PMHNP]) 7. Prescriptive authority & treatment (advanced practice role for PMHNP and in some states PMH-CNS) Interventions can be interdependent (other team members must collaborate) or independent (dis-cussed and determined with client). Evaluation of client responses to nursing action is based on client changes in the following:1. Cognitiona. Giving up irrational beliefsb. Making positive self-statementsc. Improving ability to problem solve 2. Affect a. Decreased anxietyb. Decreased depressionc. Decreased loneliness 3. Behaviora. Adaptive responsesb. Improved coping skillsc. Improved social skills Revisions to plan of care are made as needed and the process continues. The nursing process and all nursing interven- tions occur within the context of the nurse-client relationship. nurse-Client relationship \u0088 Definition\u2014A dynamic, collaborative, therapeu- tic, interactive process between the nurse and the client Purpose\u2014to create a safe climate wherein clients feel free to reveal themselves and their concerns and feel comfortable to try out new ideas and behaviors Change is effected by nurses within the nursing process. the nursing proCess \u0088 Assessment\u2014Data are collected in a continuous, comprehensive, accurate, and systematic manner. Interviews are usually conducted with clients and others to complete the nursing history. Relevant data for adult patients include:1. Appearance2. Presenting problem3. Personal and family history4. Medical and psychiatric history5. Physical status6. Mental status a. Reaction to interview b. Behavior (speech, ADL, etc)c. Level of consciousnessd. Orientatione. Memoryl. Comprehension 7. Sociocultural a. Socioeconomic statusb. Life values and goalsc. Social habits\u2014including drinking and drug use d. Sexual behaviore. Social support network 8. Spiritual status a. Philosophy and meaning of lifeb. Sense of oneness or spiritual integrityc. Relatedness to God or higher power d. Relatedness to people and nature See Chapter 10 for information regarding assess-ment of children. Diagnoses are made according to: 1. North American Nursing Diagnosis Asso- ciation (NANDA) (See Examples in Clinical Chapters) 2. Standard classification of mental disorders, i.e., The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnosis and Statistical Manual (DSM IV-TR) or International Classification of Disease (ICD-10-CM) Planning provides goals and actions that ar e: 1. Specific2. Individualized3. Collaborative13 Communication 4. Resistance\u2014client attempts to keep anxiety- provoking thoughts and feelings out of aware- ness by disrupting the interactional process with avoidance, acting out, forgetting, silence, lateness, etc. Nursing response is to make ob-servations and support client in dealing with anxiety. 5.

Touching nurse inappropriately Nurse must set limits and encourage client to dis-cuss meaning of behavior. Psychotherapy\u2014use of relationship and communi- cation to change feelings, attitudes, and behaviors1. Supportive\u2014expressing feelings, exploring choices 2. Re-educative\u2014learning new ways of belief and behavior 3. Reconstructive\u2014deep emotional and cogni-tive restructuring Clinical supervision\u2014use of more experienced practitioner or peers to \"obtain feedback on in- terventions and analyze the emotions particular clients generated; this process allows nurses to be objective about their reactions and to decen-ter emotions\" (Delaney & Lettieri-Marks, 1997, p. 134) that may interfere with the nurse-client relationship. CoMMuniCation \u0088 Definition\u2014Continuous process by which infor - mation is transmitted between people and their environment Goal\u2014understanding Process of communication (See Figure 2-1 ) All behavior communicates some message. Verbal messages include the written and spoken word. Nonverbal messages are observed by the receiver in four ways: Phases of nurse-client relationship (Peplau, 1952) 1. Orientation\u2014begin as strangers a. Client\u2014seeks or is brought in for help; communicates needs and expectations b. Nurse\u2014responds to client; explains pa- rameters of relationship; gathers data; listens and clarifies areas of concern; establishes rapport; negotiates contract that establishes frequency and duration of sessions, specifies type of work to be done, clarifies fees if any, and lays groundwork for termination 2. Identification a. Client\u2014responds to help offered by nurse; explores deeper feelings; identifies with nurse and may be dependent, active, and compliant b. Nurse\u2014structures relationship to focus on client and facilitates expression of prob-lems and feelings; avoids fostering unnec-essary dependency; encourages self-care 3. Exploitation\u2014working a. Client\u2014more independent in accessing services and working in partnership to interpret behaviors; begins to try out new behaviors b. Nurse\u2014supports client and explores feel- ings and problems at client's pace; deals with resistances, encourages risk taking, and facilitates achievement of goals 4. Resolution\u2014terminationa. Client\u2014engages in new problem-solving skills and coping behaviors; views self positively and plans for future; may de-compensate when anticipating separation b. Nurse\u2014reviews goals and accomplish- ments; shares own feelings and assists cli-ent to express feelings about relationship and separation Phenomena that occur in nurse-client relationships1. Therapeutic use of self-application of nurse's own personality characteristics within the in-teraction to facilitate healing. 2. Transference-client experiences emotional reaction towards nurse based on unconscious feelings that originated in past relationships. Nursing response is to confront distortions of reality gently in order to facilitate client self-awareness. 3. Countertransference\u2014nurse responds to cli- ent with feelings from own earlier conflicts. Nurse must increase self-awareness and ac-cess supervision to assist in dealing with client more effectively.14 Chapter 2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care 1. Kinesics\u2014body motion, i.e., facial expression, posture, position of arms and legs, eye contact, touch 2. Paralanguage\u2014tone of voice, inflection, em- phasis, pauses, sighs, laughter 3. Proxemics\u2014use of personal space, territorial- ity, i.e., backing away or moving closer, selec-tion of a particular seating arrangement 4. Appearance\u2014personal image, i.e., clothing, makeup, hair, beard Nonverbal messages may be congruent with verbal messages or they may conflict with them. Culture and social class influence perceptions and values that influence how communication is trans-mitted and received. Type of relationship also influences type of communication:1. Therapeutic communication takes place be- tween the nurse and client and focuses on the client's thoughts, feelings, behavior, and roles with the expectation that the active listening of the nurse will help the client explore, under - stand, and change. 2. Social communication is less goal oriented, more superficial, and does not necessarily in-volve the expectation of help. Although nurse-client relationships may involve some social communication, the main component is therapeutic communication.Therapeutic Communication includes: Active listening or physical attending skills 1. Comfortable environment\u2014privacy, low noise, soft light 2. Facing the other person and leaning towards him/her 3. Open, relaxed posture4. Eye contact Attitudes and behaviors that build trust and rapport1. Nonjudgmental, positive Congruence between verbal and nonverbal behaviors (Johnson, 1997) 7. Stated purpose of interaction8. Being unhurried; giving undivided attention 9. Being sensitive and responsive to nonverbal communication 10. Listening11. Being professional but warm, accepting, sup- portive, and objective 12. Recognizing and accepting culture-specific attitudes and behaviors 13. Using understandable and acceptable language 14. Being aware of own feelings and how they af- fect one's behavior 15.

Nurse self-disclosure can enhance or inhibit thera- peutic communication depending on its use. Like all interventions, it requires timing and judgment. Its use, according to Auvil and Silver (1984) de-pends on:1. Nurse's theoretical framework\u2014i.e., more likely to occur if wor king from a humanist per - spective than from a psychoanalytic or behav-iorist approach 2. Stage of the relationship a.

Design culturally responsive programs that are available, accessible, appropriate, acceptable, and adoptable to decrease underutilization of mental health services by ethnic groups. 9. Show respect and acceptance to clients in ways they understand. 10. In completing cultural assessments, nurses should examine the cultural influences of basic elements of care including (Keltner, Schwecke, & Bostrom, 2007):a. English, nonverbal or culturally-related preferences related to touch, etc.) b. Orientation (identification with a specific group, following traditions, beliefs, etc.) c. Nutrition (preferred & \"feel good\" foods, and avoided foods) d. Views of health\u2014including culturally based beliefs about mental health/illness, how one develops illness, beliefs about what is needed for treatment, and how wellness is achieved and \"cure\" is defined e.

Assess the degree to which the client has as- similated the predominant culture; do not assume. 4. Perform a Cultural Assessment to determine from the client and the client's reference group their emic (native) view of what is con-sidered normal and abnormal in both prob-lem definition and expectations for treatment and care. 5. Intercultural communication a. Adapt activity level, tone of voice, and remarks to the cultural background of the client. b.

Liaison nurses use knowledge about \"systems, change, organizations, problem solving, stress, crisis, interpersonal relationships, communica-tion, and sociocultural concepts\" (Walker & Price-Hoskins, 1992, p. 267). See Chapter 11 for more information. Milieu \u0088 NOTE: Although the primary focus of psychiatric hospitalization has evolved to that of crisis sta-bilization, the nursing role in creating and main-taining a therapeutic environment is important. Because all treatment environments affect patient care and outcomes, information about milieu ther - apy is presented here and within the mental disor - ders chapters, as a cue to all psychiatric nurses to value the elements of a therapeutic environment regardless of setting, whether inpatient, residen-tial, outpatient, or community. Definitions 1. Therapeutic environment\u2014physical and psy- chosocial surr oundings as an integrated, inter- related whole acting as the treatment agent in a variety of settings (Watson, 1992)19 Principles of Prescriptive Authority measure of safety/toxicity of a drug (e.g., with small differences between toxic and effective doses, lithium has a low thera-peutic index). b. Examples of receptor mechanisms include:(1) Agonists\u2014drugs that activate recep- tors; can be full, partial or inverse (2) Antagonists\u2014drugs that block recep- tors sites, generally retuning the re-ceptor conformation back to the same state that exists without an agonist present\u2014can be competitive (with ag-onist for receptor) or noncompetitive 5. Pharmacogenetic research goals include identification of variant alleles that alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; and why patients differ in the way drugs are metabolized. Principles of prescribing 1. General guidelines (Buppert, 2008) a. Prescribe the right drug at the right time for the right indication for the right person. b. Follow the practice protocols/guidelines for prescribing at the site of advanced nursing practice. c. Before prescribing, obtain the following information:(1) Known allergies (2) Other prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal preparations the patient is currently using (3) For female patient, ascertaining the possibility of pregnancy (see Table 2-1) and/or breastfeeding\u2014obtain appropriate laboratory testing as indicated (4) Any liver or kidney dysfunction, other health condition that can affect ab-sorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drug (5) Any cardiac condition, suicide/ homicide ideation, symptoms of psychosis, mania/hypomania (6) Personal or familial experiences with the medication (what worked/did not work, side effects experienced, and tolerability of adverse side effects) d. Address any contraindications, cross- sensitivities, and drug interactions. e. Inform patient of potential adverse ef- fects and ask whether patient wants to accept risk of side effects (documentation advised).3. Medication administration and education4. Attitude therapy\u2014active friendliness, passive friendliness, kind firmness, no demand 5. Modeling healthy behavior as participant in community 6. Intervening to influence attitudes, behaviors, and relationships in therapeutic way as de-scribed by Greene (1993):a. Clarifying and correcting perceptions of current stressors b. Identifying thoughts and feelings evoked by stressors c. Examining how thoughts and feelings in- fluence behavior d. Evaluating the extent to which coping be- haviors are adaptive or effective e. Identifying alternative adaptive coping strategies f. Testing of identified alternative coping strategies in milieu prinCiples o F presCriptive \u0088 authority (for advanced practice psychiatric & mental health (PMH) nursing) Prescriptive authority and treatment is a function of advanced practice PMH nurses as granted by federal and state law (nurse practice act) in the jurisdiction of nursing practice (ANA, APNA, ISPN, 2007). Most state laws involve advanced practice nurses writing prescriptions through a collabora-tive relationship with a physician or under del-egated authority from a physician (Buppert, 2008). Principles of pharmacotherapy (Sadock & Sadock, 2007; Stahl, 2008)1. Pharmacology\u2014the study of what drugs do and how they do it 2. Psychotropic medications\u2014drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions (also called psychotropics) 3. Pharmacokinetics\u2014\"what the body does to the drug\"\u2014includes absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination 4. Pharmacodynamics\u2014\"what the drug does to the body\" (desired effect and adverse side effects)\u2014site of action (target organs/systems) including receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and carrier proteinsa. Pharmacodynamic considerations include receptor mechanisms, dose-response curve, development of tolerance, de-pendence and withdrawal; includes mechanism of action and therapeutic index (TI)\u2014TI is the ratio of median toxic dose to median effective dose\u2014a relative 20 Chapter 2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care Controlled substances (see Table 2-2 ) 1. The federal government, through the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) oversees prescribing of controlled substances and the granting of license to providers for the purpose of prescribing. 2. Certain conditions must exist before the ad- vanced practice PMH prescribes controlled substances.a. State law in the jurisdiction of practice must allow prescription of controlled sub-stance by the advanced practice nurse.f. Inform patient when to call/return if ad- verse change in condition occurs. g. Other considerations include: (1) Affordability of medication(s) prescribed (2) Inclusion of drug on formulary for the agency or health maintenance organization (3) Potential for abuse of the medi- cation (e.g., methylphenidate, benzodiazepines)Table 2-1 \u0084 Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Categories Category Definition A Controlled studies in humans have demonstrated no risk. B Animal trials show no risk; no evidence of risk in 2nd or 3rd trimester. C Human risk unknown and cannot be ruled out. D Positive risk to fetus; must weigh benefit to pregnant women vs fetal risk. X The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. NOTE: FDA has proposed revision of current pregnancy labeling (eliminating A through X labeling). The proposed labeling would include: a summary of fetal risk, clinical considerations (dosing, risks of not treating, & complications), as well as data upon which the recommendations are made. A summary of the proposed rule is available at: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093310.htm Table 2-2 \u0084 US Drug Enforcement Administration\u2014Schedule of Controlled Substances Schedule Description Examples I Substance has a high potential for abuse, has no medical use in the US, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. heroin, LSD, marijuana II Substance has a high potential for abuse, has a currently accepted medical use in the US with severe restrictions, and abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.amphetamine, codeine, dextroamphetamine, hydrocodone, methadone, oxycodone (OxyContin) III Substance has a potential for abuse less than II, has currently accepted medical use in the US, and may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.codeine with aspirin, acetaminophen/hydrocodone (Vicodin) IV Substance has a low potential for abuse as compared to Schedule III, has currently accepted medical use in the US, and abuse may lead to limited physical and psychological dependence.benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam, oxazepam), phenobarbital, zolpidem (Ambien) V Substance has a low potential for abuse as compared to Schedule IV, has currently accepted medical use in the US, and abuse has a narrow scope for physical and psychological dependence.atropine, buprenorphine (Buprenex), Lomotil, codeine/guaifenesin (Robitussin A-C)21 Family Therapy theories and praCtiCe oF \u0088 individual psyChotherapy\u2014 see Chapter 3 FaMily therapy \u0088 Background 1. Treatment modality that theorizes that the presenting problem displayed by the client with psychiatric symptoms (identified patient) is the result of pathology throughout the entire family system. 2. This family dysfunction is due to imbalances in the system, generally caused by conflict between the marital partners. This conflict is expressed unconsciously by the following behaviors:a. Triangling\u2014another family member is brought in, in order to stabilize the emo-tional process. b. Scapegoating\u2014another family member is blamed. 3. Result of these behaviors is psychiatric symptoms. Therapeutic goals 1. Assisting family members to identify and ex- press their thoughts and feelings 2. Resolving conflict between mar ital partners to decrease need for triangling and scapegoating 3. Assisting parents in working together and strengthening their parental authority 4. Clarifying family expectations and roles5. Practicing different, more constructive meth- ods of interacting Techniques used in family therapy according to Hogarth (1993)1. Joining\u2014finding similarities and matching family's behaviors; respecting their values and hierarchies 2. The family history a. Data are gathered beginning with the par - ents' initial relationship and include each family member in chronological order. b. Information may be recorded in a geno- gram that maps out significant events and relationships over three generations of the family. c. History taking takes focus off identified patient and emphasizes the family as a whole. 3. Encouraging interactions and relationships a. The family, or specific family members, are instructed to discuss a pertinent issue.b. The advanced practice nurse must be registered with the DEA, have applied for, and been granted license to prescribe controlled substances as evidenced by provision of a DEA number, which must be used on all prescriptions for scheduled drugs. Mental health eduCation \u0088 Definition\u2014imparting of knowledge to clients and families Goals according to Walker and Price-Hoskins (1992)1. Offering information about the illness and interventions 2. Helping people recognize symptoms3. Teaching people when and how to intervene for themselves 4. Offering relief from blame and guilt5. Clarifying family expectations6. Instilling confidence that change can occur7. Developing an objective perspective and balance Methods of Learning 1. Lecture2. Discussion3. Modeling4. Observation5. Experiential methods a. Role playingb. Behavioral rehearsal 6. Coaching 7. Audio or video recorded presentation8. Computer-aided instruction 9. Self-instruction a. Keeping a diaryb. Monitoring thoughts, feelings, and behaviors Guidelines for teaching adult learners 1. Assess knowledge base.2. Increase awareness of need for learning. 3. Encourage self-direction.4. Encourage learners to apply material to what they already know. 5. Use mode of learning most useful to the learner, i.e., auditory, visual, or kinesthetic. 6. Repeat as often as necessary, changing and combining methods and modes as required. 7. Accommodate teaching to the client's capacity for learning and attention span, both of which may be affected by illness.22 Chapter 2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care Therapeutic factors of groups (Yalom, 2005) 1. Instillation of hope 2. Universality3. Imparting information4. Altruism5. Corrective recapitulation of primary family of socializing techniques7. Imitative behaviors8. Interpersonal learning9. Group cohesiveness 10. Catharsis11. of groups 1. Homogeneous\u2014members chosen from prese- lected criteria, e.g., sexually abused women 2. Heterogeneous\u2014mix of individuals regarding diagnosis, sex, age, etc. 3. Mixed\u2014sharing an essential feature, i.e., same diagnosis but varying sex, age, etc. 4. Closed\u2014after group begins, no new members are added 5. Open\u2014members and leaders change Types of groups 1. Task\u2014emphasis on accomplishing what needs to be done 2. Teaching\u2014imparting information, i.e., orien- tation to unit 3. Supportive/therapeutic\u2014helping others who share same experience cope with stress and overcome dysfunction, e.g., bereavement, weight loss 4. Psychotherapy\u2014emphasis on person reducing intrapsychic stress, changing behavior, ideas, etc.; may follow a variety of theoretical frame-works, e.g., Psychoanalytic, Tr ansactional Analysis, Rational Emotive, Rogerian, Gestalt, Interpersonal, Bion; advanced practice role 5. Psychoeducational\u2014structured group in- volving teaching, with member disclosure of related thinking and behavioral problems, and homework to put learned information and skills into practice, e.g., groups for family members of the chronically mentally ill and assertiveness training groups 6. Peer support group\u2014sharing stresses related to common situation, e.g., hospice nurses 7. Multiple family\u2014teaching about disease pro- cess and utilizing group process to understand mental health issues; may also refer to a group modality in which the therapist works with one family while other families watch and learn vicariouslyb. Therapist clarifies and interprets the fam- ily's communication. c. Individuals are required to speak for them- selves in expressing feelings and concerns rather than allowing others to speak for them. d. Family members are asked to share re- sponsibility for resolution of problems instead of laying blame. 4. Experiential activities a. Homework\u2014tasks assigned by the thera- pist, which when enacted by the family members further the therapeutic process; completion or failure to complete the task is discussed at the next session. b. Paradoxical prescription\u2014instructions are given to perform the opposite of what is intended in order to produce change. c. Sculpting\u2014enactment of an experience with words omitted that when \"frozen'' is a symbolic representation of the family members' relationships; by asking a fam-ily member to rearrange the \"sculpture,\" change is modeled. 5. Results in family therapy are measured by the degree to which families are moved from dysfunctional to functional patterns. Opti-mal family functioning according to Hogarth (1993) includes:a. Open systems orientationb. Clear boundaries c. Positive links to societyd. Contextual claritye. Clear and congruent communication f. Strong parental Appropriate power distributionh. Autonomous personsi. Warm, caring affective tonej. High self-esteem of membersk. Efficient negotiation and task performance l. Transcendent values of hope and altruism group dyna MiCs & group \u0088 proCess theory Background 1. Groups are complex human systems whose whole is greater than the sum of their parts. 2. Individuals can learn, grow, and change more in groups due to opportunities for feedback and consensual validation. 3. Nurses who participate in groups or advanced practice psychiatric and mental health nurses who serve as group therapists are awar e of the powerful forces harnessed by group work.23 Ethical Considerations for structure and approval. Leader describes group contract (i.e., goals, confidentiality, and communication rules), encourages interaction among group, and maintains working level of anxiety. Members develop initial roles. 2. Storming\u2014Conflict develops regarding con- trol, power, and authority. Anxiety increases and resistance may occur as evidenced by client absence, shared silence, excessive de-pendency on leader, scapegoating, excessive hostility toward leader, formation of sub-groups and acting out. Leader encourages healthy expression of anger. 3. Norming (cohesiveness stage)\u2014Members ex- press positive feelings toward one another and feel strongly attracted to group. Self-disclosure occurs and new roles are adopted. 4. Performing (working phase)\u2014Leader's activity decreases and usually consists of keeping the group on course or dealing with resistance of group and individuals within. Responsibility for group is more equally shared. Anxiety of group is decreased, and energy is channeled to completing tasks. 5. Mourning (termination)\u2014Begins during first phase but is most acutely felt in closed group when it approaches end and in open group when members or leaders leave. Leaders en-courage discussion of ending and expression of pain and loss experienced in grieving process. Members may try to avoid, experience anxi-ety, anger, or regression; they should also be encouraged to reminisce, evaluate, and experi-ence sense of accomplishment and give feed-back to one another (Lasalle & Lasalle, 1991). Transference and countertransference also occur in groups and may be dealt with by group mem-bers as well as leaders. ethiCa l Considerations \u0088 Ethics\u2014branch of philosophy that deals with morality Ethical theories or perspectives according to Sellin (1991)1. Egoism\u2014the right act is the one best for oneself. 2. Utilitarianism\u2014the right act promotes the greatest good for the greatest number. 3. Deontology or formalism\u2014the right act is established by use of ethical principles as follows:a. Autonomy\u2014individuals are respected for themselves and should have control over their own choices whether or not these Basic roles of therapist (Yalom, 2005) 1. Technical expert2. Model setting participant Group dynamic issues according to Long and McMahon (1992)1. Rank\u2014position member holds in relation to other members of the group; members who participate frequently and actively usually rank high in the group and thus have greater influence on group behavior 2. Status\u2014prestige given to certain positions or individuals in a group; members vie for status in group; may be due to member characteris-tics or behavior 3. Group content\u2014what is said in a group, i.e., information discussed 4. Group process\u2014activities in a group, i.e., how interactions occur among members, timing of interactions, roles of members, seating ar - rangements, tone of voice of members, and nonverbal behaviors 5. Sociogram\u2014method of recording group process Group process issues 1. Style of leader a. Autocratic\u2014leader is in charge and controls. b. Democratic\u2014leader shares responsibility with members. c. Laissez Faire\u2014leader is nondirective. 2. Roles of members a. Building or maintenance roles\u2014contrib-ute to group process and functioning, e.g., encourager, gatekeeper, harmonizer. b. Task roles\u2014emphasize completing the task, e.g., initiator, opinion giver, evalua-tor, energizer, information seeker. c. Individual roles\u2014not related to group tasks or maintenance and may inhibit group, e.g., aggressor, dominator, help-seeker, playboy, special-interest pleader, blocker. Therapeutic group norms (Yalom, 2005) 1. Self-monitoring\u2014assuming responsibility for own functioning 2. Self-disclosure3. Procedural norms\u2014spontaneous, interactive4. Group importance to members 5. Members as agents of help 6. Support7. Working in the here and now Group development stages (Tuckman, 1965) 1. Forming (orientation)\u2014Group leader is more directive and active, members look to leader 24 Chapter 2 Essentials of Psychiatric Nursing Care c. Clients can wear their own clothes and keep their own personal effects excluding dangerous objects and valuables that can-not be protected. d. Clients, who with support can live in the community, should be discharged to out-patient care. e. Seclusion and restraint can only be uti- lized when therapeutically necessary, and where all other methods have failed to control violent behavior toward self or others. 4. Right to informed consent a. Voluntary permission can be given by a competent client after procedures to be performed have been explained and are understood. b. Clients often sign forms on admission that cover psychiatric treatment. c. Commitment procedure gives hospital the right to treat involuntary patients. d. Written consent must be obtained for ECT and experimental drugs. 5. Right to refuse treatment a. Clients, including committed patients in nonemergencies, may not be forcibly medicated. b.

If patient is violent toward self or others and all less restrictive methods have failed, patients (including those who have been voluntarily admitted) may be forcibly medicated. d. Nurses must know the laws in their state and assure adequate written documentation. 6. Right to habeas corpus\u2014committed clients may at any time petition the court for release on the grounds that they are sane. 7. Right to independent psychiatric examina- tion\u2014clients may demand evaluation by phy - sician of own choice and must be released if determined to be not mentally ill. 8. Right to outside communicationa. Clients may have visitors, write and re- ceive letters, make and receive phone calls, including those to judges and lawyers. b. The hospital can limit times for phone calls and visitors and deny access when visitors could cause harm to clients or staff. 9. Right to be emplo yed if possible\u2014clients can- not be forced to work, and if they choose to as part of therapy, must be paid minimum wage.are in their best interest or agree with our opinions. If someone decides what is best for another it is termed paternalism. Children, the mentally retarded, and the mentally ill are often thought not to be competent enough to be autonomous. b. Beneficence\u2014promoting the good of oth- ers and preventing them from harm c. Nonmaleficence\u2014responsibility to do no harm; many suggest that it is more im-portant to avoid harm than to do good. Some interpret it as a person's duty to pre-vent someone else from harming a third person. d. Justice\u2014distribution of resources, benefits and burdens fairly among members of a society Ethical principles may conflict with one another so that it is difficult to determine which act produces the most good. From ethical principles client rights have been specified. Right\u2014a just claim that is due an individual or group: rights may be established by policies and/or protected by laws. Important patient rights in psychiatric nursing include:1. Right to privacy a. Confidentiality\u2014no information can be shared about client, including fact of hos-pitalization or whether in therapy. b. Privileged communication\u2014in five states court may not legally mandate nurses to give information obtained in a profes-sional capacity (Stuart & Sundeen, 1991); does not apply to patient records. c. Exceptions: (1) Tarasoff\u2014if therapist is reasonably certain that a client is going to harm someone, must breach confidentiality and inform potential victim. (2) Possible child abuse\u2014many states mandate that cases be reported to authorities. (3) Guardianship or involuntary commit - ment hearings\u2014clinical information must be shared. 2. Right to treatment\u2014patients cannot be held against their will without an individualized treatment plan and certain other standards of care specified by law. 3.

An example is Rogers' Theory of Nursing. b. Inductive theory construction proceeds from the specific to the general. The theo-rist or investigator immerses himself/herself in the data and attempts to gener-ate theoretical statements. An example is Orem's Theory of Self-Care (Riehl & Roy, 1980). 2. Theory serves to:a. Guide research\u2014the theory sets limits on questions to ask and methods to pursue in research. b. Guide practice\u2014after validation from research, theory can give direction to practice. c. Provide a common language between practitioners and researchers. d. Enhance professional autonomy and accountability\u2014theory, supported by research, allows the nurse to predict con-sequences of care, contributing to autono-mous nursing practice (Meleis, 1985).

Often questionnaires are used that must be evaluated for the following:1. Reliability\u2014ability to measure the same trait repeatedly 2. Validity\u2014ability to measure what it is sup-posed to be measuring Statistical data analysis (McCrum-Gardner, 2007; Inferential statistics\u2014to test hypotheses and decide if relationship between variables is supporteda.

Experimental\u2014experimenter uses random sampling, manipulates the independent 37 Nursing Theories 2. Self-care deficit\u2014the inability to provide com- plete self-care; the need for nursing care. Nurs-ing care includes the following:a. Entering into and maintaining nurse- patient relationships b. Assessing how patients can be helped c. Responding to patients' requests and needs d. Prescribing, providing, and regulating di-rect help e. Coordinating and integrating nursing with other services 3. Nursing systems refer to the amount of nurs-ing care a patient requires. Categories are as follows:a. Wholly compensatory\u2014the nurse pro-vides all care. b. Partly compensatory\u2014the nurse and pa-tient provide care. c. Supportive-educative\u2014the patient pro-vides care. The nurse promotes the patient as a self-care agent (Foster & Janssens, 1990). Theory of Goal Attainment (Imogene King) King describes her theory of goal attainment within an open systems framework.1. The three systems in the framework are as follows:a. Personal systems\u2014each individual is a personal system. b. Interpersonal systems\u2014the interaction among human beings c. Social systems\u2014an organized boundary system of roles, behaviors, and practices 2. The theory of goal attainment states that people come together to help and be helped to maintain health. Concepts of the theory are as follows:a. Interaction\u2014goal-directed communication b. Perception\u2014organizing, processing, stor-ing, and exporting information c. Communication\u2014information given from one person to another d. Transaction\u2014observable behaviors of people interacting with their environment e.

Self-care requisites are actions directed toward the pro-vision of self-care. The three categories of self-care requisites are:a. Universal\u2014activities of daily living b. Developmental\u2014specialized activities re- lated to a developmental task or an event c. Health deviation\u2014activities required by illness, injury, or disease38 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing Theory of Nursing (Martha Rogers) 1. The phenomenon central to nursing is the life process of human beings. 2. Assumptions of Rogers' theory:a. The human being is a unified whole pos-sessing his/her own integrity and mani-festing characteristics that are more than and different from the sum of his/her parts. b. The person and environment are continu-ally exchanging matter and energy with each other. c. The life process revolves irreversibly and unidirectionally along the space-time continuum. d. Pattern and organization identify indi-viduals and reflect their wholeness. e. The human being is characterized by the capacity for abstraction and imagery, language and thought, sensation, and emotion. 3. Building blocks of Rogers' theory:a. Energy field\u2014an electrical field in a con-tinuous state of flux b. Openness\u2014energy fields are open to ex-change with other energy fields. c. Pattern\u2014energy fields have patterns that change as required. d. Four dimensionality\u2014energy fields are embedded in a four-dimensional space-time matrix. 4. Principles of homeodynamics are built upon the five assumptions and four building blocks:a. Integrality\u2014the continuous, mutual, si-multaneous interaction between human and environmental fields b. Resonancy\u2014the identification of human and environmental fields by changing wave patterns c. Helicy\u2014the evolving innovative repattern-ing growing out of the mutual interaction of man and environment (Rogers, 1983; Falco & Lobo, 1990) The Adaptation Model (Sister Callista Roy) There are five essential elements of the model:1. Each person is an adaptive system with in-put, internal processes, adaptive modes, and output.a. Input\u2014internal or external stimuli b. Internal processes\u2014coping neu-ral, and endocrine transmitters (2) Cognator subsystem\u2014perception, information processing, judgment, emotion c. Adaptive modes or system effectors(1) Physiological function mode\u2014identi-fies patterns of physical functioning. (2) Self-concept mode\u2014identifies pat-terns of values, beliefs, and emotions. (3) Role function mode\u2014identifies pat-terns of social interactions. (4) Interdependence mode\u2014identifies patterns of human value, affection, love, and affirmation. d. Output:(1) Adaptive response, or (2) Ineffective response 2. The goal of nursing\u2014the promotion of adap-tive responses in relation to the adaptive modes 3. Health\u2014a process of being and becoming an integrated person 4. Environment\u2014conditions, circumstances, and influences affecting the growth and behavior of a person 5. The Nursing Process:a. First-level assessment\u2014behavioral assess-ment; assessment of four adaptive modes b. Second-level assessment(1) Identification of focal, contextual, and residual stimuli (2) Identification of ineffective responses c. Identification of nursing diagnosis d. Goal setting with the client e. Implementation\u2014manipulating focal, contextual, or residual stimuli f. Evaluation\u2014assessment of goal behaviors and possible readjustment of goals and interventions (Galbreath, 1990) Theory of Culture Care Diversity and Universality (Madeleine Leininger)1. The main tenet of the theory is that \"care is the essence of nursing and the central, dominant, and unifying focus\" (Leininger, 1991, p. 35). 2. Other concepts include:a. Culture\u2014the learned, shared, and trans-mitted values, beliefs, norms, and lifeways of a group that guide their actions and decisions b. Cultural care diversity\u2014differences in meanings, patterns, values, or symbols of care, within or between collectivities re-lated to human care expressions c. Cultural care universality\u2014uniform mean-ings, patterns, or symbols that are mani-fest in many cultures and reflect ways to help people d. Cultural and social structure dimen-sions\u2014patterns of structural and orga-nizational factors of a particular culture, including:39 Personality Theories (3) Perceived self-efficacy\u2014the personal evaluation of capacity/ability to orga-nize and execute healthy behavior (4) Activity-related affect\u2014a subjective assessment of the positive or nega-tive emotional consequence of the behavior (5) Interpersonal influences\u2014health be-havior cognitions related to the beliefs and attitudes of others\u2014including norms (expectations of others), social support (encouragement), and vicari-ous models (watch what others do) (6) Situational influences\u2014circumstances that can facilitate or impede health behavior (7) Commitment to a plan of action\u2014in-tention to implement health behavior (8) Immediate competing demands and preferences that can affect health behavior(a) Competing demands\u2014alternative behaviors over which the person has little control, such as work and child-care responsibilities (b) Competing preferences\u2014alter-native behaviors over which the person has high control, such as having a chocolate bar rather than a carrot for a snack. c. Behavioral outcomes that involve:(1) Health promoting behavior\u2014outcome measure of behavior; directed toward attaining positive health outcome such as optimal well-being, personal fulfillment, and productive living. Interpersonal Relations/Psychodynamic Nurs- ing (Peplau)\u2014See Chapter 2 - Nurse-Client Relationship \u0088 (Corsini & Wedding, 2008; Seligman, 2006) Psychoanalytic/Psychodynamic (Sigmund Freud) concepts in the theory of Freud include the following:1. Levels of awarenessa. Conscious\u2014thoughts, feelings, and de-sires a person is aware of and able to control b. Preconscious\u2014thoughts, feelings, and de-sires that are not in immediate awareness but can be recalled to consciousness(1) Religious factors (2) Social and kinship factors (3) Political and legal factors (4) Economic factors (5) Educational factors (6) Technological factors (7) Cultural values (8) Ethnohistorical factors e. Ethnohistory\u2014past facts, events, and ex-periences of individuals, groups, cultures, or institutions that are people-centered and that describe, explain, and interpret human lifeways within a certain culture f. Cultural care preservation or mainte-nance\u2014actions and decisions that help people retain relevant cultural care values to maintain well-being, recover from ill-ness, and face handicaps or death g. Cultural care accommodation or negotia-tion\u2014actions and decisions to help people of a designated culture negotiate for a beneficial outcome with health caregivers h. Cultural care repatterning or restructur-ing\u2014actions and decisions to help clients modify their lifeways for beneficial health care, while respecting their cultural values and beliefs i. Cultural congruent nursing care\u2014actions and decisions tailored to fit cultural values and beliefs (Leininger, 1991) Health Promotion Model (Nola Pender) 1. The Health Promotion Model (HPM) builds on theories of social learning (Bandura) and of reasoned action and planned behavior (Fishbein; Ajzen). The HPM describes the mul-tidimensional interactions between the envi-ronment and persons in the pursuit of health. A main focus of the model is promotion of preventative health behaviors\u2014to optimize health and prevent/limit the infirmities of dis-ease (Pender, Murdaugh, & Parsons, 2005). 2. The HPM focuses on the following three areas:a. Individual characteristics and experiences that involve:(1) Previous health-related behavior (2) Personal factors (biological, psycho-logical, and sociocultural) b. Behavior-specific cognitions and affect that involve:(1) Perceived benefits of action\u2014positive outcomes that will occur with health-related behavior (2) Perceived barriers to action\u2014antici-pated, imagined, or actual blocks that inhibit execution of behavior40 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing 5. Treatment\u2014psychoanalysis: a. Daily therapy sessions are conducted for several years. b. The patient reveals thoughts, feelings, dreams, etc. c. The therapist reveals no personal informa-tion, functioning primarily as a shadow figure. The therapist interprets the pa-tient's behavior for him or her. Psychoanalysis (Carl Jung) The major concepts of Jung's theory are as follows:1. Archetype\u2014unconscious, intangible collective idea, image, or concept; Scroggs (1985) de-fines the main archetypes identified by Jung as follows:a. The Way\u2014the image of a journey or voy-age through life b. The Self\u2014the aspect of mind that unifies and orders experience c. Animus and Anima\u2014the image of gender d. Rebirth\u2014the concept of being reborn, res-urrected, or reincarnated e. Persona\u2014the role or mask one shows to others f. Shadow\u2014the dark side of one's personality g. Stock characters\u2014dramatic roles that ap-pear over and over in folktales(1) Hero\u2014the character who vanquishes evil and rescues the downtrodden (2) Trickster\u2014the character who plays pranks or works magic spells (3) Sage\u2014the wise old person h. Power\u2014symbol, such as the eagle or the sword i. Number\u2014certain numbers that reappear throughout history and across cultures 2. Psychological types\u2014Jung described two attitudinal and four functional types of personalities:a. Attitudinal types(1) Introvert\u2014oriented toward the inner, subjective world (2) Extrovert\u2014oriented toward the outer, external world b. Functional types(1) Thinking\u2014intellectual process involv-ing ideas (2) Feeling\u2014evaluative function involv-ing value or worth (3) Sensing\u2014function involving recogni-tion that something exists, without categorizing or evaluating it (4) Intuiting\u2014function involving creative inspiration, knowing without having the facts (Scroggs, 1985) 3. Collective unconsciousc. Unconscious\u2014thoughts, feelings, and desires that are not available to the con-scious mind 2. Stages of development\u2014according to Freud, each person passes through the following stages of psychosexual development. A person can get stuck in any stage:a. Oral\u2014the focus is on sucking and swal-lowing, gratification of oral needs b. Anal\u2014focus on spontaneous bowel move-ments, control over impulses c. Phallic\u2014focus on genital region, identifi-cation with parent of the same gender d. Latency\u2014focus on coping with the envi-ronment; sexual impulses dormant e. Genital\u2014focus on erotic and genital be-havior, developing mature sexual and emotional relationships 3. Personality structure\u2014the personality has three main components:a. Id\u2014the pleasure principle; unconscious; desire for immediate and complete satis-faction; disregard for others b. Ego\u2014the reality principle; rational and conscious; weighing of actions and consequences c. Superego\u2014the censoring force of the per - sonality; conscious and unconscious; evalu-ating and judging behavior (Scroggs, 1985) 4. Several terms common to psychiatric nursing originated with Freud, including:a. Oedipus complex or Electra conflict\u2014at the age of 4 or 5, the child falls in love with the parent of the opposite sex and feels hostility toward the parent of the same sex. b. Defense mechanisms\u2014conscious or un- conscious actions or thoughts to protect the ego from anxiety (See Table 3-1 ). c. Freudian slips\u2014also known as para-praxes\u2014overt actions with unconscious meanings d. Free association\u2014a method for discover-ing the contents of the unconscious by associating words with other words or emotions e. Transference\u2014feelings, attitudes, and wishes linked with a significant figure in one's early life projected onto others in one's current life f. Countertransference\u2014feelings and at-titudes of the therapist projected onto the patient inappropriately g. Resistance\u2014anything that prohibits a person from producing material from the unconscious h. Fixation\u2014getting stuck in one stage of de-velopment (Scroggs, 1985; Drapela, 1987)41 Personality Theories 3. Complexes: a. complex\u2014an inability to solve life's problems b. Superiority complex\u2014an exaggerated opinion of one's abilities and accomplish-ments, a result of the attempt to overcom-pensate for an inferiority complex 4. The goal of life\u2014to strive for superiority Theory of Individual Psychology (Alfred Adler) Adler saw individuals in a social context; he is con-sidered a social-interpersonal theorist by some. Key ideas include:1. Inferiority feelings as the source of all human strivings 2. Personal growth as resulting from the attempts to compensate for inferiorityTable 3-1 \u0084 Defense Mechanisms Type Defense Mechanism Definition PrimitiveDenial Avoiding the reality of a painful/anxiety-producing situation by refusing to acknowledge it Projection False attribution of the person's own undesirable feelings, thoughts, and impulses onto others (splitting is a form of projection) ImmatureFantasy Symbolic fulfillment of wish or impulse with irrational thought Identification Conscious/unconscious modeling of characteristics of an idealized/ respected person Introjection Unconsciously taking on another person's values/traits and becoming like that person Regression Unconsciously returning to an earlier, more comfortable level of development to avoid emotional discomfort Somatization Transferring emotional distress to bodily symptoms (pains and other ailments) Undoing Conscious behavior to cancel out an unacceptable action that has already been done (heightened superstitiousness) NeuroticDisplacement Shifting of feelings from an emotionally charged person or object to a substitute, less threatening, person or object Dissociation Unconscious separation from emotional pain through temporary but drastic modification of character or sense of personal identity Intellectualization Reasoning or logic used in attempt to avoid intimacy and confrontation with objectionable impulse or affect Isolation Splitting or separating of affect from the rest of a person's thinking Rationalization Using logical or acceptable, but incorrect, reasons or excuses for behavior that is unacceptable to one's self-image\u2014can be conscious or unconscious Reaction formation Substitution of behavior, thoughts, and feelings diametrically opposed to unacceptable ones Repression Considered to be the basis for all defense mechanisms\u2014unconscious exclusion of ideas, feelings, and situations that are unacceptable to the self MatureCompensation An individual consciously making up for a perceived lack in one area by emphasizing strengths in another Sublimation Conscious/unconscious channeling of unacceptable impulses to a primary goal that is socially acceptable Suppression Conscious exclusion of thoughts, feelings, and situations that produce discomfort and some anxiety (active forgetting) Altruism Conscious use of service to others; doing good for others to reduce or avoid negative feelings about self Humor Using comedy to assuage emotions without producing discomfort for self or others\u2014wit is a form of displacement that deflects emotion onto 2008)42 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing c. Preschooler (3-6 years) Initiative\u2014focus on genital needs, pur-pose, task-orientation on vs Inferiority\u2014inadequacy, self-restriction, conformity e. Adolescent (13+ years) Identity\u2014focus on search for self, ideal-ism, confidence vs Identity diffusion\u2014delinquency, psycho-sis, overidentification with heroes, cliques f. Young Adult Intimacy\u2014focus on human closeness, sexual fulfillment, love vs Isolation\u2014distancing behaviors, self- absorption, character problems g. Middle Aged Adult Generativity\u2014focus on productivity, cre-ativity, guiding next generation vs Stagnation\u2014lack of faith, obsessive need for pseudointimacy, early invalidism h. Older Adult Integrity\u2014emotional and spiritual integra-tion, fellowship with others, leadership vs Despair\u2014disgust, fear of death (Erikson, 1963; Whiting, 1997) Theory of Cognitive Development (Jean Piaget) Piaget's stages of development are:1. Sensory-Motor Period\u20140 to 2 yearsa. Stage I\u20140 to 1 month\u2014no distinction between self and outer reality; character-ized by reflexive, uncoordinated body movements. b. Stage II\u20141 to 4 months\u2014response pat-terns begin to be formed; the baby's fist finds its way into his or her mouth. c. Stage III\u20144 to 8 months\u2014response pat-terns are coordinated and repeated intentionally. d. Stage IV\u20148 to 12 months\u2014more coor-dinated responses ensue; child pushes obstacles aside, searches for vanished objects. e. Stage V\u201412 to 18 months\u2014behavior pat-terns are deliberately varied, as if to ob-serve different results; groping toward a goal emerges. f. Stage VI\u201418 months to 2 years\u2014behavior patterns are internalized; symbolic repre-sentation emerges.5. Lifestyle\u2014the unique set of behaviors created by each individual to compensate for inferior-ity and achieve superiority 6. The influence of birth ordera. First-born\u2014happy and secure, the center of attention, until dethroned by the sec-ond child; develops interest in authority and organization b. Second-born\u2014born into a more relaxed atmosphere; has the first-born as a model, or a threat to compete with; develops in-terest in competition c. Youngest child\u2014pet of the family; may retain dependency (Schultz, 1987; Adler, 1983) Theory of Basic Anxiety (Karen Horney) Because of her focus on family, some consider Horney a social-interpersonal theorist. Concepts include:1. A child has two basic needs\u2014safety and satisfaction. 2. When those needs are not met, the child feels hostility. 3. The child represses the hostility, and this leads to basic anxiety. 4. Basic anxiety is a pervasive feeling of being lonely or helpless in a hostile world 5. Protective mechanisms against basic anxiety in relationships include:a. Moving toward people b. Moving against people c. Moving away from people 6. Neurosis\u2014compulsive and unconscious extension of maladaptive childhood mecha-nisms (Scroggs, 1985; Wilson & Kneisl, 1992) thEoriEs of growth and \u0088 dEvEloPMEnt Theory of Psychosocial Development (Erik Hom- burger Erikson)1. The term used in naming each stage identifies the conflict to be resolved during that stage. 2. In each stage, the individual has a particular focus and a task, which results in adaptive or maladaptive characteristics:a. Infant (0-2 years) Trust\u2014focus on oral needs, acquisition of hope vs Mistrust\u2014withdrawal (schizoid or depressive) b. Toddler (1.5-3 years) Autonomy\u2014focus on anal needs, acquisi-tion self-esteem, secre-tiveness, persecution43 Existential/Humanistic Theories 1982). Gilligan has stages of de- velopment in females. social/intErPErsonal thEory \u0088 Theory of Interpersonal Development (Harry Stack Sullivan\u2014the basis of H. Peplau's work)Sullivan focuses on behavior as interpersonal. Ma-jor concepts include:1. Self-system\u2014a construct built from the child's experience, made up of reflected appraisals from the approval or disapproval of significant others 2. Two basic drives that underlie behavior:a. The drive for satisfaction\u2014basic physi-ological drives, e.g., hunger b. The drive for security\u2014a sense of well-being and belonging 3. Anxiety\u2014any painful feeling or emotion that arises from social insecurity or blocks to satis-faction; characteristics of anxiety are:a. Interpersonal b. Can be described; can be observed in behavior c. Attempts to reduce anxiety 4. Security operations\u2014measures are taken by individuals to reduce anxiety, e.g., selective inattention. 5. Mental illness\u2014self-system interferes with ability to attend to basic drives. 6. Therapy is based upon the belief that by ex-periencing a healthy relationship with the therapist, the patient can learn to build better relationships. Therapy is an active partnership based on trust (Sullivan, 1953). Exist Ential/ huManistic \u0088 thEoriEs The theorists focus on experience in the here and now, with little attention to the past. Client Centered Therapy (Carl Rogers) The key concept is that people can become fully functioning persons when they are uncondi-tionally valued. 1. The attributes of the therapist:a. Congruence\u2014inner feelings match outer actions. b. Unconditional positive regard\u2014the thera-pist sees the client as a person of intrinsic worth, likes the client, and treats the client nonjudgmentally. c. Empathic understanding\u2014the therapist is an empathetic, sensitive listener.2. Pre-operational Period\u20142 to 7 years\u2014char-acterized by egocentric thinking expressed in artificialism, realism, and magic omnipotencea. Pre-conceptual Stage\u20142 to 4 years\u2014con-ceptualization begins to emerge, repre-sented in language, drawings, dreams, and play. b. Perceptual or Intuitive Stage\u20144 to 7 years\u2014prelogical reasoning appears, based on appearances; trial and error may lead to discovery of correct relationships. 3. Concrete Operations Period\u20147 to 11 years\u2014characterized by thought that is logical and reversible; the child understands classes, rela-tionships, and part-whole relationships deal-ing with concrete things. 4. Formal Operations Period\u201411 years to adulthood\u2014characterized by the develop-ment of logic and reasoning and second-order thoughts, that is, thinking about thoughts (Pulaski, 1971). Theory of Moral Development (Lawrence Kohlberg)The stages of moral development are:1. Level I\u2014external standardsa. Stage 1\u2014avoidance of punishment; the punishment or power of others deter-mines what is right and wrong. b. Stage 2\u2014desire for reward or benefit; ac-tion is based on getting something in re-turn, in satisfying gratification. There is a sense of fairness and reciprocity, but not a sense of loyalty, gratitude, or justice. 2. Level II\u2014conventional ordera. Stage 3\u2014anticipation of disapproval of others, or \"good boy-nice girl\" orientation; there is conformity to expectations of ap-propriate behavior, seeking approval. b. Stage 4\u2014anticipation of dishonor; behav-ior is oriented toward respecting authority, maintaining social order, and obeying so-cial rules for their own goodness. 3. Level III\u2014principled moralitya. Stage 5\u2014social contract, legalistic orienta-tion; behavior is oriented toward the belief that justice flows from a social contract that assures equality for all. Behavior is geared toward rules and legalities. b. Stage 6\u2014universal ethical principles orientation; behavior is oriented toward universal, ethical abstract principles (Kohlberg, 1984). Theory of Moral Development (Carol Gilligan) Moral development of women is based more upon an ethic of caring and attachment (Gilligan, 44 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing 2. Best known for his description of a heirarchy of basic needs:a. Physiological needs b. Safety needs c. Love and belongingness needs d. Self-esteem needs e. Self-actualization needs (Drapela, 1987; Scroggs, 1985) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (Albert Ellis) Some consider this an existential theory while others refer to it as a \"cognitive\" theory, because the focus is on changing thinking, rather than on feeling or experiencing. Assumptions and key con-cepts include:1. People largely control their own destinies. 2. People act on their basic values and beliefs. 3. People interpret events according to their ba-sic values or beliefs and the interpretation can change. 4. A-B-C-D-E-F of therapy (Seligman, 2006): a. Activating event b. Belief c. Consequences\u2014emotional and/or behavioral d. Dispute (debate) e. Effective rational beliefs (interventions are used to promote change) f. Feelings and behavior change as a result of effective rational beliefs. 5. Irrational beliefs have four basic forms:a. Something should, ought, or must be different. b. Something is awful, terrible, or horrible. c. One cannot bear, stand, or tolerate something. d. Something or someone is damned, as a louse, rotten person, etc. 6. \"Musturbatory\" ideologies have three forms:a. I must do well and win approval or I am a rotten person. b. You must act kindly and justly toward me or you are a rotten person. c. My life must remain comfortable and easy or the world is damnable and life hardly seems worth living. 7. Therapy consists of detecting and eradicating irrational beliefs and musturbatory ideologies by:a. Disputing\u2014detecting irrationalities, de- bating against them, discriminating be-tween logical and illogical thinking, and defining what helps to create new beliefs b. Debating\u2014questioning and disputing the irrational beliefs2. The goal of therapy is to help the client be-come a fully functioning person. The client reaches this goal by:a. Relinquishing facades. b. Banishing \"oughts.\" c. Moving away from cultural expectations and becoming nonconformist. d. Pleasing oneself, as opposed to pleasing others; being self-directed. e. Opening up and dropping defenses. f. Trusting his or her inner self, his or her intuition. g. Becoming willing to be a complex process. h. Accepting others (Rogers, 1961; Scroggs, 1985). Gestalt (Frederick (Fritz) Perls) 1. Here-and-now therapy of immediate expe-riencing, attained by removing masks and facades 2. Involves a creative interaction between thera-pist and client to gain ongoing awareness of what is being felt, sensed, and thought 3. Describes boundary disturbance\u2014lack of awareness of the immediate environment, which takes the following forms:a. Projection\u2014fantasy about what another person is experiencing b. Introjection\u2014accepting the beliefs and opinions of others without question c. Retroflection\u2014turning back on oneself that which is meant for someone else d. Confluence\u2014merging with the environment e. Deflection\u2014a method of interfering with contact, used by receivers and senders of messages 4. Goal of therapy\u2014integration of self and world awareness 5. Techniques of therapy include:a. Playing the projection\u2014taking and experi-encing the role of another b. Making the rounds\u2014speaking or doing something to other group members to ex-periment with new behavior c. Sentence completion\u2014e.g., \"I take respon-sibility for. . . .\" d. Exaggeration of a feeling or action e. Empty chair dialogue\u2014having an interac-tion with an imaginary provocateur f. Dream work\u2014describing and playing parts of a dream (Hardy, 1991) Humanistic/Holistic (Abraham Maslow) 1. When basic needs are met, health and growth will naturally follow.45 Cognitive Theories her imagination. They are repeated until the anxiety is eliminated. (2) In vivo desensitization\u2014in addition to fantasy desensitization, the client actually faces the feared object or situation. 2. Avoidance (aversive) conditioning is the appli-cation of the reciprocal inhibition principle to overcome undesirable responses. An example of avoidance conditioning is the use of the drug antabuse to overcome an alcoholic's un-desirable response of drinking (Wolpe, 1968). Reality Therapy (William Glasser) Focuses on changing present behavior\u2014the basic premise is that everyone who seeks psychiatric treatment is unable to fulfill his or her basic needs and is denying the reality of the world around him or her. Major concepts include:1. Each person has two basic needs:a. The need to love and be loved\u2014each per-son needs to be involved with at least one other person who is in touch with reality and able to fulfill his/her own basic needs. b. The need to feel worthwhile to himself and others\u2014to be worthwhile, one must main-tain a satisfactory standard of behavior. 2. Responsibility\u2014the ability to fulfill one's needs in a way that does not deprive others of the ability to fulfill their needs; the cause of all psychiatric problems is irresponsibility. 3. Role of the therapist:a. Become so involved with the patient that the patient can face reality. b. Reject the behavior that is unrealistic while accepting the patient and maintain-ing involvement. c. Teach the patient better ways to fulfill his/her needs. d. Emphasize behavior, not attitude or emotions. e. Emphasize responsibility and planning to change inappropriate behavior. cognitivE thEoriEs \u0088 Cognitive Therapy (Aaron Beck) While practicing psychoanalysis, Beck discovered that, in addition to the thoughts verbalized during \"free association,\" his patients had a concurrent, second set of thoughts. He called these \"automatic thoughts.\" Automatic thoughts were those that labeled, interpreted, and evaluated, according to a personal set of rules. Beck called dysfunctional au-tomatic thoughts \"cognitive distortions.\" Concepts in cognitive therapy include:c. Discriminating\u2014distinguishing between wants and needs, desires and demands, and rational and irrational ideas d. Defining\u2014defining words and redefining beliefs bEhavioral thEoriEs \u0088 The behavioral theories are generally not con-cerned with thoughts, feelings, or unconscious phenomena, except to view them as \"behaviors.\" The focus of behavioral therapy is on replac-ing maladaptive behaviors with more effective behaviors. Behavior Therapy (Burrhas Frederic Skinner) All behavior is determined by contingencies of re-inforcement (Scroggs, 1985). Important concepts include:1. Operant conditioning (also called instru-mental learning)\u2014the individual performs a behavior that leads to a positive or negative reinforcement, making it either more or less likely that the behavior will be repeated. 2. Schedules of reinforcement\u2014Skinner found that different schedules of reinforcement had different effects on supporting or extinguish-ing particular behaviors:a. Fixed ratio schedule\u2014behaviors are re-warded or reinforced every time they are repeated. b. Variable ratio schedule\u2014behaviors are rewarded randomly. c. Fixed interval schedule\u2014behaviors are rewarded at specific time intervals. e. Random interval schedule\u2014behaviors are rewarded at random time intervals (Skin-ner, 1974; Scroggs, 1985). Reciprocal Inhibition (Joseph Wolpe) A \"process of relearning whereby in the presence of a stimulus a non anxiety producing response is continually repeated until it extinguishes the old, undesirable response\" (Wolpe, 1969, p. 91). Types of reciprocal inhibition include:1. Systematic desensitization\u2014used primarily in the treatment of phobias\u2014the following steps comprise the most common mode of system-atic desensitization:a. Training in deep muscle relaxation b. Listing examples of phobic reactions; arranging them in descending order of intensity c. Desensitization: (1) Fantasy desensitization\u2014while the client relaxes as deeply as possible, the examples are presented to his or 46 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing is modeling, also called imitating or learning by observation. Other concepts include:1. Retention process\u2014verbally encoding an ob-served behavior 2. Motor reproduction process\u2014practicing the motor skills of the observed behavior 3. Reinforcement and motivational process\u2014receiving reward or reinforcement for the be-havior (Scroggs, 1985) Dialectic Behavior Therapy (Linehan) Dialectic Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a form of CBT that also incorporates insight-oriented therapy and is used primarily to treat persons with borderline personality disorder. DBT sessions include weekly 1-hour individual and 2-hour group sessions last-ing 1 year. Emphasis in therapy sessions is on skill building and problem solving (Linehan, Schmidt, Dimeff, 2006). Basic assumptions of DBT: 1. There is a desire for improvement and with support, improvement can be achieved. 2. Any effort is progress, thus failure is not possible. 3. While clients may not have caused all of their problems, they are responsible for the solu-tions; they must try harder or be more moti-vated to change. thEoriEs of coMMunication \u0088 Theories of communication focus on the process of verbal and nonverbal communication between and among people. Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) (Richard Bandler & John Grinder)The assumption behind NLP is that we all create personal models or maps of the world and use lan-guage to represent our models. People \"get stuck,\" not by their situation, but by the choices they per-ceive are available to them because of their maps. Concepts include:1. Representational systems\u2014sensory modalities through which people access information, to include:a. Auditory b. Visual c. Kinesthetic 2. Cues to representational systems\u2014patterns that are associated with representational sys-tems and can be heard or observed1. Elements of the relationship between therapist and client:a. The relationship is a collaborative partnership. b. Therapist and client determine the goal of therapy together. c. The therapist encourages the client to verbalize disagreement with the therapist when appropriate. 2. The process of therapy:a. The therapist explains to the client that:(1) Perception of reality is not reality. (2) Interpretation of sensory input de-pends on cognitive processes. b. Recognition of maladaptive ideation\u2014the client is trained to observe his/her cogni-tive and emotional reactions to events, identifying:(1) The observable behavior (2) The underlying motivation (3) His/her thoughts and beliefs c. Distancing and decentering\u2014the cli- ent practices distancing the maladaptive thoughts. d. Authentication of conclusions\u2014the cli-ent explores his/her conclusions and tests them against reality. e. Changing the rules(1) The client makes the rules less abso-lute and extreme. (2) The client drops false rules from the repertoire and substitutes adaptive rules. Cognitive Behavior Modification (Meichenbaum) Meichenbaum's theory combines the goals of cognitive and behavior therapies to focus on im-proving thoughts and behaviors. A broad range of change strategies are used by CBT therapists in-cluding (Seligman, 2006):1. Strategies to improve thinking (e.g., positive self-talk, reframing, problem solving, Ellis's ABCDEF model) 2. Strategies to improve coping (e.g., visual and guided imagery, bibliotherapy, role playing, cognitive modeling, homework) 3. Strategies to stop rumination and self-defeat-ing behaviors (e.g., flooding, thought stopping, letter writing) 4. Strategies to reinforce positive change (e.g., affirmations, focusing on the positive) Social Learning Theory (Albert Bandura) Bandura's theory combines cognitive and be-havioral theories\u2014the key concept of the theory 47 Theories of Group Behavior and Therapy (1) A message sent from the ego state of Person A is responded to in that ego state. (2) A message sent to an ego state in Per-son B is responded to from that ego state. b. Crossed transactions(1) A message sent from the ego state of Person A is responded to in another ego. (2) A message sent to an ego state in Per-son B is responded to from another ego state. c. Ulterior transactions\u2014messages that oc-cur on two levels(1) The social or overt level (2) The hidden or psychological level 3. Games\u2014recurring sets of ulterior transactions with a concealed motive, e.g., \"Why don't you . . . Yes, but.\" 4. Script\u2014an unconscious life plan 5. Therapy using TA may be done in conjunction with other modes of therapy, e.g., psychoanal-ysis. Therapy process consists of:a. Explanation of TA to the client b. Structural analysis of the client's ego states c. Transactional analysis of the client's interactions d. Game analysis e. Script analysis (Berne, 1961, 1964; Wilson & Kneisl, 1992) thEoriEs of grouP bEhavior \u0088 and thEraPy Many theories already described in this chapter have been applied to group behavior and group therapy, including theories of psychoanalysis, per-sonality, and communication. The theory consid-ered basic to all groups is systems theory. Systems Theory (Von Bertalanffy) According to Von Bertalanffy (1934) the world con-sists of entities called \"systems.\" The theory has frequently been used to explain group behavior. Selected concepts include:1. All systems are hierarchically arrayed and fall into the following categories:a. Suprasystem b. System c. Subsystem 2. A system has three functions:a. Meeting its purpose b. Self maintenance c. Adaptationa. Preferred predicates\u2014e.g., the word \"view\" suggests a visual system. b. Eye-accessing cues\u2014e.g., looking upward suggests a visual system. c. Gross hand movements\u2014e.g., pointing to-ward the ear suggests an auditory system. d. Breathing patterns\u2014e.g., deep abdominal breathing suggests a kinesthetic system. e. Speech pattern and voice tone\u2014e.g., quick bursts of high pitched words suggest a vi-sual system. 3. Language structurea. Surface structure\u2014the sentences that native speakers of a language speak and write b. Deep structure\u2014the full linguistic repre- sentation from which the surface struc-tures of a language are derived c. Ambiguity\u2014the idea that a surface struc-ture may represent more than one deep structure 4. Human modeling\u2014the process of represent-ing something, e.g., the world of experience as represented in language. Modeling involves the following processes:a. Generalization\u2014a specific experience comes to represent the entire category of which it is a member. b. Deletion\u2014selected portions of the world are excluded from the representation cre-ated by an individual. c. Distortion\u2014the relationships among the parts of the model differ from the rela-tionships they are supposed to represent (Bandler & Grinder, 1975, 1976; Wilson & Kneisl, 1992). Transactional Analysis (TA) (Eric Berne) The focus is on the interaction between persons. Concepts include:1. Ego state\u2014frame of minda. Parent\u2014exhibits feelings and behaviors learned from parents and authorities; the parent may be nurturing or critical. b. Adult\u2014exhibits feelings and behaviors of a mature adult, e.g., analysis, perception, and sociability. c. Child\u2014exhibits feelings and behaviors natural to children under 7 years old; the child may be natural or adapted. The adapted child is acting under parental influence. 2. Transaction\u2014verbal and nonverbal communi-cation between two peoplea. Complementary transactions48 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing 4. Multigenerational transmission process\u2014re- lationship patterns and anxiety about specific issues that have been transmitted through the generations 5. Family projection process\u2014assignment of characteristics to certain family members 6. Sibling position\u2014birth order and gender 7. Emotional cutoff\u2014distancing to deal with in-tense unresolved emotional issues 8. Therapy\u2014consists of role modeling and guid-ing family members to:a. Increase differentiation of self from a \"pseudoself\" consisting of beliefs. and values acquired in the family to a highly differentiated self. b. Detriangle\u2014observe one's own effect and control one's participation in the triangle, while maintaining emotional contact (Bo-wen, 1978; Stuart & Sundeen, 1991; Kerr & Bowen, 1988). Structural Family Therapy (Salvador Minuchin) In this theory, the therapist joins the family and works to modify the family structure. Concepts in Structural Family Therapy include:1. The family in transition\u2014the family is con-sidered a social system in transformation that must maintain its continuity and adapt to in-ternal and external stressors. 2. Stages of family development\u2014each stage re-quires restructuring. The stages include:a. Courtship period\u2014when the young per-son reaches adulthood and seeks a mate b. Marriage\u2014when one member moves from the family of origin to create a new family c. Middle years of marriage\u2014when parents must wean themselves from their children d. Retirement and old age\u2014when one spouse may die; adult children may as-sume care provider role. 3. Family structure, which consists of:a. Power and influence\u2014the hierarchy of power and authority; parental authority is advocated. b. Subsystems\u2014sets of relationships or dy-ads formed by generation, gender, inter-est, or function c. Boundaries\u2014rules of who partici-pates with whom. Boundary problems include:(1) Enmeshment\u2014weak or absent boundaries between individuals and/or subsystems; perceptions of self and others are poorly differentiated.3. The whole is more than the sum of the parts. 4. A change in one part affects other parts and/or the whole system. 5. There is feedback or input and output:a. Within the system. b. Between the system and the environment (Von Bertalanffy, 1934; Van Servellen, 1984). Group Theories\u2014See Chapter 2 - Group Dynamics & Group Process Theory: Curative factors of groups (Yalom, 2005) Psychodrama (J. L. Moreno) Psychodrama is a here-and-now action psycho-therapy, a therapeutic drama, used primarily in group settings. The therapist functions as the \"Di- rector\" of the drama chosen by the client. Psycho-drama consists of a three-part process:1. Warm up\u2014the protagonist chooses the time, place, scene, and auxiliary egos for his/her production. 2. Action\u2014the issue or conflict is acted out or relived. 3. Post-action sharing\u2014group members discuss their identification with the subject (Moreno, 1964). faMily thEoriEs \u0088 Family therapies focus on the family as a whole. The family member who has a problem to be dealt with in therapy is known as the \"identified patient.\" Family Systems Theory (Murray Bowen) Bowen applied systems theory to the treatment of dysfunctional families, developing a \"transgenera-tional\" therapy. The main concepts of the theory are:1. Differentiation of self\u2014in the lower the level of self-differentiation, the less adaptive one is under stress. There are two types of differentia-tion of self:a. Differentiating thought from emotionb. Differentiating oneself from one's \"family ego mass\" 2. Triangles\u2014when a two-member alliance, or dyad, becomes emotionally stressed, the members pull in a third member to reduce anxiety. Bowen considers a triangle the basic building block of any emotional system. 3. Nuclear family emotional system\u2014patterns of emotional interaction among family members49 Neurobiological Theories (1) Straightforward\u2014e.g., the mother is directed to assume a parental role. (2) Paradoxical, e.g.\u2014a spouse is directed to encourage the other spouse to have the \"symptom\" more frequently. d. Changes are planned in stages so that changes in one situation or relationship will lead to changes in another. The thera-pist may even create another problem and shift to another abnormal hierarchy before shifting to a normal hierarchy. e. If the strategy does not work within a few weeks, the therapist plans and imple-ments another strategy (Madanes, 1981; Haley, 1987). nEurobiological thEoriEs \u0088 The 1990s were termed \"The Decade of the Brain\" by the National Institutes of Mental Health in order to promote the development of theoretical and practical interventions. Neurobiological theories are based on the following general statements:1. Cognitive and emotional dysfunctions result from multiple causes, such as genetic influ-ences, nutrition, infectious processes, and other pathological conditions that contribute to neurotransmitter imbalances in the brain (Sanford, 1995). 2. Neurotransmitters are chemical substances, found at the synapses between neurons in the central nervous system that influence cogni-tive, emotional, and behavioral functioning by carrying messages from the axon of one neu-ron to the receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron (See Table 3-2 ). 3. At the end of the process, neurotransmitters are either inactivated by enzymatic degrada-tion or taken back into the presynaptic neuron (reuptake). 4. There are thought to be more than a 100 dif-ferent transmitters and many neurons that release more than 1 neurotransmitter (Harris & McMahon, 1997, p. 224). 5. \"Psychotherapeutic drugs are prescribed to manipulate the processes of neurotransmitter production and absorption to reestablish 'nor-mal' neurochemical balance.\" (Sanford, 1995, p. 31) 6. Neuroendocrinology\u2014brain biochemicals, by way of the hypothalamus, stimulate the pitu-itary gland, which affects the endocrine glands along three brain endocrine axes (cascades) (Harris & McMahon, 1997) (See Table 3-3 ).(2) Disengagement\u2014rigid boundaries between individuals and/or subsys-tems; communication and contact is minimal. 4. Tasks of the therapist include:a. Joining and accommodation(1) Maintenance\u2014e.g., joining the family and maintaining family strengths by pointing them out (2) Assessment\u2014e.g., assessing the family structure and transaction patterns b. Restructuring(1) Actualizing family transactional pat-terns\u2014e.g., re-creating communica-tion channels and subsystem boundaries (3) Escalating stress\u2014e.g., blocking trans-actional patterns (4) Assigning tasks within and between sessions (5) Utilizing symptoms\u2014e.g., exaggerat-ing, de-emphasizing or relabeling symptoms; moving to new symptoms (6) Supporting, educating, and guiding (Minuchin and Nichols, 1993; Helm, 1991) Strategic Family Therapy (Madanes and Haley) Strategic Family Therapy, also known as Problem Solving Therapy, is brief therapy that focuses on solving the presenting problem(s) (Haley, 1987; Madanes, 1981). Concepts include:1. Symptom\u2014a behavior that analogically or metaphorically expresses a family problem 2. Problem\u2014part of a sequence of acts between people; the way one person communicates with another 3. Focus of therapy\u2014changing analogies and metaphors 4. Goal\u2014preventing repetition of problem se-quences; introducing more complexity and alternatives 5. Hierarchy\u2014parents are considered respon-sible for and in charge of children. 6. Interventions:a. Decide which family members are involved. b. Design and implement a strategy to shift the family organization so the present problems are not necessary. c. Directives\u2014the therapist tells the family members to do something. Directives may be:50 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing Table 3-2 \u0084 Selected Neurotransmitters & Effects on Mental Health Neurotransmitter Related State Effect of Psychotropic Acetylcholine\u2014Involved in attention, memory, thirst, mood regulation, REM sleep, muscle tone, & sexual behaviorDecreased activity implicated in Alzheimer's diseaseCholinesterase inhibitors increase levels of acetylcholine Antipsychotic action can create imbalance between acetylcholine & dopamine leading to EPS Dopamine\u2014Involved in fine motor actions, thinking, decision making and integrated cognition, & pleasure/reward seeking behaviorIncreased activity implicated in schizophrenia and mania Antipsychotic medications block dopamine receptors & reduce dopamine activity Norepinephrine (NE)\u2014Involved in alertness, focused attention, orientation, learning, memory\u2014 derivative (epinephrine) controls \"fight or flight\" responseDecreased activity implicated in depression Depleted in dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) and Korsakoff's syndrome Transmission & uptake impaired in anxiety/addictionSome antidepressants block reuptake of NE and others inhibit MAO from metabolizing NE Serotonin (5-HT)\u2014involved in mood states; libido; regulation of temperature, aggression and sleep; perception of painDecreased activity implicated in depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Dysregulation implicated in anxiety, violence and schizoaffective disorder and personality disordersSSRIs & some TCAs increase functional activity by blocking serotonin reuptake Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\u2014involved in modulation of aggression, anxiety, and excitationDecreased levels implicated in anxiety disorders Anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) aim to increase GABA function Glutamate (amino acids)\u2014involved in cognition/memory; sustained autonomic functionsExcitotoxicity\u2014neurotoxic at high levels Decreased levels can lead to psychosisPCP & ketamine (NMDA antagonists) trigger psychosis (Hams & 1997; thyroid axis (HPTA) Blunted TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in depression Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) Hyperactive in depression and some anxiety Nonsuppression of cortisol by dexamethasone suppression test in depression Elevated cortisol levels in depressionElevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in gonadal Blunted prolactin response in exogenous obesity Reduces testosterone levels in depression (Harris & McMahon, 1997)51 Miscellaneous Theories 10. Average number of sessions is usually five or six, with clients choosing time between ses-sions to allow for a comfortable rate of change as determined by the client. Crisis Intervention (Donna Aguilera) 1. Types of crises:a. Situational\u2014external events that cause unusual stresses, e.g., hospitalization or divorce b. Maturational\u2014normal processes of growth and development in which there is difficulty with maturation, e.g., adoles-cence and adulthood c. Adventitious\u2014accidental, uncommon, and unexpected events, e.g., fire, earth-quake, or flood (Aguilera, 1990) 2. Phases of crisis intervention:a. Assessment\u2014assessing the precipitating event and the client's perceptions of the event b. Planning of the intervention\u2014evaluating strengths, coping skills, support systems, and alternative methods of coping c. Intervention\u2014treatment lasting 1 to 6 weeks, with the goal of returning the in-dividual to his/her previous level of func-tioning by:(1) Helping the person gain an intellec-tual understanding of the crisis. (2) Helping the person express feelings. (3) Exploring coping mechanisms. (4) Reopening the social world. d. Resolution and anticipatory planning\u2014reinforcing adaptive mechanisms, sum-marizing the process of intervention, and planning for future coping (Aguilera, 1990) Theory of Self-Concept (John Hattie) The attributes of self-concept include:1. A cognitive appraisal consisting of beliefs about self 2. Three aspects:a. Expectations from self and others\u2014high expectations in a dimension or a task can lead to low self-concept and vice-versa. For example, if an average high school athlete expects to become a professional basketball star, his or her high expectation may lead to low self-concept. b. Descriptions of oneself that are: (1) Hierarchical\u2014from a description of a simple, isolated characteristic to a general, all-inclusive description of self (2) Multi-faceted\u2014having numerous dimensionsMiscEllanEous thEoriEs \u0088 Solution Focused Therapy (de Shazer & O'Hanlon, 1985)1. Theory assumes that complaints are main-tained by client belief that their response to the original difficulty was the only right thing to do (de Shazer, 1985). 2. Therapist reframes the beliefs and puts them in a different perspective that allows symp-toms to be transformed into part of a mutually developed solution. 3. Focus is on the present and future rather than the past.a. Only information about past success is sought. b. Emphasizes strengths of client; \"Tell me how you dealt with a similar situation in the past\" (Cline & Davidson, 1997). 4. Emphasis is on outcomes with expectations of rapid change:a. \"When you are not feeling depressed what will you be feeling instead?\" (Cline & Davidson, 1997) b. \"How will you know when the problem is solved?\" 5. Therapist helps clients reformulate goals to a reachable level, i.e. \"having a more calm ap-proach\" instead of \"stop yelling\" (de Shazer, 1985). 6. Therapist compliments clients on what they are doing right. 7. Therapist uses exceptions: \"What do you do when you overcome the urge to yell?\" (de Shazer, 1985). 8. Solution is formulated around reframed belief and way clients describe life after \"problem\" no longer occurs:a. Have client leave with beginning step to-ward solution. b. Goals or tasks may be assigned: \"Between now and the next time we meet I would like you to notice what happens in your re-lationship that you would like to continue to have happen.\" (de Shazer, 1997). 9. Evaluation occurs at next session.a. If \"problem\" is better, therapist warns of relapse: \"These things rarely resolve with-out some recurrences. You will probably have a big fight in the next few weeks.\" b. If problem is the same: \"You must be do-ing something right or it would be worse.\" c. If worse: \"May have to go from bad to worse before it gets better.\" \"Is this the bottom or do things need to go from worse to worst before getting better?\" (de Shazer, 1985).52 chaPtEr 3 Major Theoretical Frameworks for Psychiatric Nursing 1. Problem-Focused Coping a. Defining the problemb. Generating alternative solutions c. Weighing alternatives re cost and benefits d. Choosing alternatives e. Implementation 2. Emotion-Focused Copinga. Cognitive reappraisal to alter the meaning of situation without changing objective facts b. Behavioral strategies such as physical ex-ercise, meditation, or talking to friends 3. Defense mechanisms (See Chapter 2) can be viewed as unconscious coping methods. Role Theory (Hardy & Conway) Role Theory \"represents a collection of concepts and a variety of hypothetical formulations that predict how actors will perform in a given role, or under what circumstances certain types of behav-ior can be expected\" (Hardy & Conway, 1988, p. 63). Concepts include:1. Approach to studying roles:a. Structural approach\u2014roles are fixed posi-tions with certain expectations and de-mands, enforced by societal sanctions. b. Symbolic Interactionist approach\u2014be-havior is a response to the symbolic acts (primarily gestures and speech) of others. 2. Role making\u2014a process of modifying a role; phases of role making include:a. Initiator behavior b. Other response c. Interpretation d. Altered response e. Role validation 3. Role taking\u2014the process of imagining oneself in the place of another 4. Socialization\u2014the process of learning the so-cial roles, skills, and knowledge that prepare one for role performance 5. Role stress\u2014a condition in which role obliga-tions are unclear, conflicting or impossible to meet 6. Role strain\u2014a subjective state of frustration or distress in meeting role expectations 7. Stratification\u2014a hierarchical ranking of people according to wealth, status, power, or occupa-tion (Hardy & Conway, 1988) QuEstions \u0088 Select the best answer 1. The purpose of a theory is to: a. Describe, explain, predict or control a phenomenonc. Prescriptions\u2014standards of correctness 3. Integration across various dimensions by means of:a. Self-verification\u2014soliciting feedback to confirm the view of self b. Self-consistency\u2014internal harmony among opinions, attitudes, and values c. Self-complexity\u2014viewing self as complex and multi-faceted d. Self-enhancement\u2014viewing self's posi-tive qualities as more important than self's negative qualities 4. Subjecting self-concept to confirmation from self and others 5. That self-concept is implicit and culturally bound (Hattie, 1991). Theory of Self-Disclosure (Richard L. Archer) Summarizing the research on and definitions of self-disclosure, Archer (1987) focused on its orien-tations and functions as follows:1. Self-orientation\u2014disclosures are concerned with exploring the nature and contents of one-self, for oneself. 2. Self-to-other orientation\u2014disclosures are con-cerned with locating oneself in relation to oth-ers by getting feedback. 3. Other-to-self orientation\u2014disclosures are used as a means of social control or of obtain-ing benefits from others. 4. Other orientation\u2014disclosure is geared toward obtaining reciprocal disclosure. 5. Self-and-other orientation\u2014disclosure is con-cerned with interdependence of participants in a relationship (Archer, 1987). Stress Theory (Hans Selye) Selye developed a theory of the physical response to stress called the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). The stages of the GAS are as follows:1. Alarm stage\u2014a threat is perceived, and the endocrine system and the immune system re-spond, creating physical and mental alertness. 2. Resistance stage\u2014the threat continues, and attempts are made to adapt. 3. Exhaustion stage\u2014if the threat continues be-yond a certain point, the adaptive hormones are depleted and the body succumbs to illness (Selye, 1976; Wilson & Kneisl, 1992). Coping (Monat & Lazarus, 1991) According to Monat and Lazarus (1991) Coping \"refers to a person's efforts to master demands (conditions of harm, threat, or challenge) that are appraised (or perceived) as exceeding or taxing a person's resources.\"53 Questions a. A health deviation b. Illness c. A self-care deficit d. A diagnostic indication 9. Imogene King's theory of nursing is: a. A theory of personal systems b. A theory of goal attainment c. A theory of adaptation d. A behavioral systems theory 10. In King's theory, a set of behaviors expected of a person occupying a certain position is called a: a. Role b. Perception c. Transaction d. Developmental position 11. One of the basic assumptions in the theory of Martha Rogers is that: a. People come together to help and be helped to maintain health. b.

Males, rather than females, responding to the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported higher rates for current use of alcohol (56.6% vs 46.0%), tobacco (35.2% vs 22.4%), and illicit drugs (10.4% vs 5.8%). 2. Young adults aged 18 to 25 and youth aged 12 to 17 years were more likely than older persons to engage in binge drinking and illicit drug use, and to consume alcohol concurrently with an illicit drug (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2008, 2009). 3. Co-occurring substance-related and other psy-chiatric disorders (also known as dual diagno-sis) are common.a. Persons diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders are twice as likely to also abuse one or more substances. This is also true for individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. b. Higher rates of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse have been reported in persons with schizophrenia than in the general population. c. Cigarette smoking is higher among per-sons with comorbid schizophrenia (up to 90%), bipolar disorder (70%), and other psychiatric diagnoses than among those without a comorbid condition (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2008). Signs and symptoms 1. Dependence\u2014Criteria established by the Di-agnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Dis-orders (DSM-IV-TR) for substance dependence SubStance-Related diSoRdeRS \u0088 Definition\u2014a cluster of mental disorders associ- ated with exposure to or excessive use of psychoac-tive substances, medications, or toxins.In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, APA, 2000), substance-related disorders are divided into two groups: (1) substance use disorders (abuse and dependence) and (2) substance-induced disorders (intoxication, withdrawal, and specific substance-induced (S-I) conditions including S-I delirium, S-I mood disor-der, S-I psychotic disorder, etc.). Epidemiology Results from the 2006-2007 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (Hughes, Sathe & Spagnola, 2009) found that 8.1% of the population 12 years or older reported past month illicit drug use. About 23.2% of the population 12 years and older engaged in past month binge drinking (5 or more drinks on one occasion), and 3.4% of the popu-lation were estimated to be alcohol dependent. Following alcohol, tobacco is the second most commonly used substance in the United States with 24.6% of the population 12 years and older smoking cigarettes in the past month. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug with 10.2% of persons age 12 and older reporting use in the past year. Illicit drug use other than marijuana (cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and the nonmedical use pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives) was 3.8% for persons 12 years and older.4 Substance-Related Mental Disorders 64 chapteR 4 Substance-Related Mental Disorders 2. Evidence that symptoms are better accounted for by a disorder that is not substance induced include:a. Symptoms precede onset of the substance abuse/dependence. b. Symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after the cessation of acute with-drawal or severe intoxication. c. Symptoms are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the character, duration, or amount of the substance used. d. Other evidence is presented suggesting the existence of an independent nonsub-stance induced disorder (history of recur-rent nonsubstance-related episodes). Diagnostic studies/tests (APA, 2006) 1. Common laboratory values associated with Substance Use Disorders (SUD):a. Liver function tests (LFTs)\u2014liver enzymes increased in (GGT), aspartate ami-notransferase (AST), and alanine amino-transferase (ALT). Other increased values include mean corpuscular volume (MCV), high density lipoprotein cholesterol and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). b. Urine drug screening (UDS) detects pres-ence of drug in the urine\u2014diagnostic limi-tations include:(1) Short \"window\" of detection of metabolites (2) Intermittent use patterns of abusers (3) Issues of civil liberties c. Blood alcohol level (BAL)\u2014greater than 150 mg/dl = evidence of intoxication; and greater than 300 mg/dl at any time sug-gests potential for alcohol dependence. d. Breathalyzer\u2014represents blood alcohol concentration (BAC)(1) Legal intoxication level in most states is 0.08%. (2) Levels above 0.1% without associated behavioral symptoms indicate pos-sible tolerance. 2. Screening instruments (partial list)a. CAGE questionnaireb.

(2) Carbamazepine (Tegretol)\u2014200 mg 4 times daily, then tapered off in reduced doses over 5 to 7 days; useful for mild/moderate with-drawal symptoms; less Adjunct medications\u2014clonidine (see under Opiates/Narcotics); haloperidol for agitation, or psychotic symptoms associated with DTs. (4) Supplements\u2014thiamine (Vitamin B 1) 100 mg daily to avoid Wernicke en-cephalopathy; folic acid (Vitamin B 9) 1 mg daily. b. Opiates/Narcotics(1) Methodone (Dolophine) in tapered doses to slowly withdraw from opioid agent\u2014must be part of FDA approved methodone program (Schedule II con-trolled substance). (2) Buprenorphine (Buprenex, Subu-tex)\u20144 to 8 mg per day (Schedule III controlled substance)\u2014opioid partial agonist antagonist\u2014reduces heroin craving; use of opiates and other illicit drugs such as cocaine thereby retain-ing clients in treatment longer; ad-verse effects include constipation and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. (3) Clonidine (Catapres)\u20140.4 to 0.6 mg per day in two divided doses (an alpha adrenergic agonist); may also be use-ful adjunct treatment for alcohol withdrawal\u2014Caution: may cause hypotension.(a) Clonidine to 0.3 mg day reduces noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus of the brain; has no effect on craving, insomnia, or muscle aches or pains; adverse effects include hypotension, seda-tion, dry mouth, and dizziness. (4) Propanolol (Inderal)\u201410 mg q 6 hours\u2014a beta-adrenergic antagonist with the same effects as clonidine; has also shown promise in reducing symptoms of cocaine withdrawal; Caution: may cause hypotension\u2014decreases blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and tremors. Dual diagnosis (comorbidity)\u2014concomitant exis- tence of a substance use and psychiatric disorder; many co-occurring psychiatric symptoms remit with 2 to 4 weeks of abstinence from substances; the most common co-occurring psychiatric disor-ders include antisocial personality, affective and anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia Nursing diagnosis\u2014several of the 2009-2011 NANDA International (2009) nursing diagnoses can be applied to substance-related disorders, including:1. Behavior, risk-prone health 2. Coping, defensive 3. Coping, ineffective 4. Denial, ineffective 5. Powerlessness 6. Self-Esteem, chronic low7. Self-Esteem, situational low8. Self-Esteem, risk for situational low9. Neglect, self 10. Violence, risk for self-directed 11. Family Processes, dysfunctional 12. Health Behavior, risk-prone 13. Health Management, ineffective self 14. Knowledge, deficient (specify) Genetic/biologic origins Strong evidence exists as to the genetics of alcohol abuse. Gene variants on chromosomes 5 and 8 have been identified as contributing to addictive behavior.1. Children of alcoholics are three to four times more likely to experience alcohol and/or drug problems; family history-positive individuals have less sensitivity to effects of alcohol (high tolerance). 2. Certain individuals, particularly those with Asian heritage, have a genetic inactivity of enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase, which re-sults in a build up of toxic alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, causing symptoms of flushing, headaches, tachycardia, and discomfort. 3. Chemical imbalance in neurotransmitter lev-els leads to self-medication with substances of abuse in an attempt to correct imbalance; pharmacotherapy interventions act on de-pleted neurotransmitter neurotransmitter systems sedative/hypnotics(1) lora- zepam (Ativan) every 2-6 hours, or oxazepam (Serax) 15 to 60 70 chapteR 4 Substance-Related Mental Disorders and glutamate; 666 mg PO three times daily is most effective when treatment goal is complete abstinence. b. Opioids/Narcotics(1) Methadone\u2014opioid agonist; 40-120 mg decreases high-risk behaviors as-sociated with heroin use (criminal activity, prostitution, IV drug use); adverse effects include sweating, con-stipation, nervousness, insomnia, de-creased sex drive, difficult ejaculation, and low grade opioid withdrawal\u2014must (2) nist; 4-8 mg per day blocks mg daily interferes with the metabolism of alcohol, producing unpleasant side effects when mixed with alcohol; symptoms include facial flushing, heart palpitations, increased heart rate, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased blood pressure; clients should be instructed to avoid over-the-counter cough medicines, after-shave lotions, vinegar, mouthwashes, nonalcoholic beer (contains small amount of alcohol) and food cooked with alcohol while taking this drug and for 14 days after drug has been discontinued. b. Opioids/Narcotics(1) Naltrexone\u201450 mg daily or three doses weekly of 100 mg on Monday and Wednesday and 150 mg on Friday will block the euphoric effects. 5. Agents to treat protracted abstinence\u2014contin- ued unpleasant state of low grade withdrawal, including sleep use is an adaptive attempt to cope with, or compensate for psychologi-cal deficits such as dysregulation of affect, 2. Agents to decrease craving\u2014used with psy - chosocial therapya. Alcohol(1) Naltrexone (ReVia)\u201450 mg per day (not only increases abstinence, but also reduces days of heavy drinking); opioid antagonist reduces the rein-forcement value of alcohol by decreas-ing the activity of the opioid system that is activated by alcohol; side ef-fects include increased liver enzymes, nausea, abdominal distress, joint and muscle pain, early insomnia, and anxiety (also available in once-weekly injectable\u2014Vivatrol). (2) SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, serta-line, citalopram) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing consumption, promoting abstinence, and preventing relapse through the medication's ef-fect on the (5-HT 3) serotonin b. Cocaine/Crack(1) Bromocriptine (Parlodel)\u20142.5-10.0 mg daily (a dopamine agonist); is more effective in acute phases of treatment, replenishing depleted neu-rotransmitters; side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, GI dis-tress, orthostatic hypotension, and sleepiness. (2) Amantidine (Symmetrel)\u2014200-400 mg daily. The same mechanism of ac-tion and side effects of bromocriptine (see previous paragraph). (3) Carbamazepine (Tegretol)\u2014200-1000 mg daily; blocks the dopamine re-ceptor sensitivity caused by chronic cocaine use; side effects include seda-tion, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, agranulocytosis, plate-let dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and tremors. (4) Despramine (Norpramine)\u2014tricyclic antidepressant, 2.5 mg per kg daily; used to reverse cocaine-induced neu-rochemical damage with anhedonia and depression; adverse effects in-clude arrhythmias, insomnia, anxiety, dry mouth, and additive cardiotoxicity when taken with cocaine; delayed on-set of action is a drawback. 3. Maintenance effects on GABA 71 Substance-Related Disorders emotional states, interpersonal conflict, and social pressure. Interventions include:(1) Identifying high risk people, places, situations (2) Identifying negative emotions\u2014bore- dom, loneliness, depression, anxiety, anger, guilt, shame, self-depreciation (3) Monitoring thinking associated with feelings (4) Planning in advance successful avoid-ance and coping strategies (5) Using slips, lapses, and relapses as corrective learning experiences not as treatment failures c. Evidence-Based Behavior Therapies for Drug & Alcohol Treatment (See Table 4-2 ) (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2009) Family dynamics/Family therapy\u2014identifies sub- stance abuse as the presenting symptom of an un-derlying family system dysfunction (Bowen, 1978).1. Families are undifferentiated. Members can-not act independently of the whole. 2. Family system is highly stressed and basic nur-turing needs are unmet. There is suppression and denial of emotional expression. Commu-nication is indirect, inconsistent, and con-flictual. Boundaries are weak and constantly changing. Families accommodate the addic-tion, thus \"enabling\" or making it easier for the addicted member to continue using. 3. Substance abuse is the central theme around which family life is organized. Family rituals and routines, interactional patterns, and prob-lem solving revolve around the addict (Stein-glass et al., 1987). 4. Codependency is a condition afflicting the significant other that is characterized by pre-occupation, dependency on and obsession with the addicted individual. Codependent individuals are often adult children of alcohol-ics (ACOA) and/or share the following similar characteristics:a. Low self-esteem and loss of identity b. Seeking external sources of fulfillment c. Need for approval from others d. Fear of abandonment e. Inability to express anger f. Possible behavior that is controlling, rigid, perfectionistic, and overresponsible g. Meeting others' needs at the expense of their own needs 5. Strategies in family therapya. Assessing the family system\u2014level of de- nial, level of education and insight\u2014use genogram b. Looking for strengths to reinforcepoor object relations, internal conflicts and impaired judgment and self-care. b. Substance abuse is a response to an un-derlying internal conflict. This conflict is between an internal need and an external limitation. c. Substances are used to avoid feelings of anxiety, anger, shame, depression, low self-esteem. d. Use of immature, rigid defense mecha-nisms such as denial, dependency, re-gression, displacement, and depression accompany substance addiction. e. Psychological dysfunctions are often the consequence of substance use rather than the cause. 2. Social Learning Theory views addiction as the result of maladaptive coping skills.a. Personal experience and past learning b. Situational antecedents c. Biologic make-up d. Cognitive processes e. Reinforcement contingencies 3. Psychotherapeutic interventionsa. Interventions linked to Psychodynamic Theory include:(1) Promoting identification as a \"recov-ering\" person (2) Fostering expression of honest feel-ings and reinforcing efforts to cope in more appropriate ways (3) Helping client explore, accept, and own both positive and negative as-pects of self (4) Helping client identify aspects of self that he/she would like to change (5) Helping client regain a feeling of empowerment by pointing out the choices he/she has available (6) Helping client recognize and focus on strengths and accomplishments (7) Confronting and exploring defense mechanisms such as denial, minimi-zation dependency, regression, pro-jection and displacement (8) Establishing parameters such as struc- ture and clear boundaries b. Interventions linked to Social Learning Theory consist of cognitive-behavioral/relapse prevention and behavioral thera-pies; goals of treatment are to facilitate changes in personal habits and lifestyle so that clients may anticipate and cope with problems and high-risk situations; most common high-risk situations associ-ated with 75% of relapses include negative 72 chapteR 4 Substance-Related Mental Disorders Table 4-2 \u0084 Evidence-BasedBehaviorTherapiesforDrug&AlcoholTreatment Therapy Name Brief Description Strategies UsedEfficacy with Substance CognitiveBehavioral Therapy(CBT)Basedonthetheorythat learning processes play a critical role in the developmentofmaladaptivebehavioralpatterns.Usingvariousstrategiestoenhanceself-control,individualslearn to identify and correct problematicbehaviorsbyapplying a range of different skills that can be used to stop drug abuse and to address a range of other problems that often co-occur.Exploringpositiveandnegativeconsequencesof continued use, self-monitoringtorecognizedrugcravingsandtoidentifyhigh-risk situations for use, anddevelopingstrategiesfor coping with high-risk situations and the desire to use.

Psychiatric and mental health advanced prac-tice nurse interventions include:(1) Grounded in the conception that sub-stance abuse is a medical and spiri-tual disease. The belief is that there is an internal causation for chemical dependency beyond the individual's control. (2) Groups offer support and mutual sharing. The group is open to all who share the common goal of recovery from a variety of substances and conditions. (3) The following 12 steps provide the roadmap one must follow to reach recovery:(a) Admit powerlessness and unman-ageability of life (b) Look to Greater Power to restore sanity (c) Turn life and will over to God (d) Take a moral inventory (e) Admitting nature of wrongs (f) Be ready to have God remove character defects (g) Ask God to remove shortcomings (h) Make a list of people harmed and willingness to make amends (i) Make amends (j) Continue personal inventory (k) Improve conscious contact with God (l) Carry message of spiritual awak-ening to other alcoholics (4) Critics of the twelve steps believe this approach is not appropriate for everyone and complain about the reference to God. Proponents endorse a broader, more spiritual versus re-ligious definition of God or Higher Power. Milieu interventions\u2014based on staff providing a safe, corrective environment that enhances the development of more adaptive coping skills and interpersonal behaviors.1. Management of withdrawal\u2014detoxification occurs in the early phase of recovery and involves safely tapering off of substance of abuse, thereby minimizing the physical dis-comfort associated with withdrawal. Guide-lines for withdrawal management include:a. Monitor vital signs and severity of with-drawal (see symptoms associated with specific drugs) and medicate as ordered. Use Clinical Instrument for Withdrawal from Alcohol (CIWA) to measure both objective and subjective symptoms of withdrawal. This enables the nurse to 75 Substance-Related Disorders 3. Role strain and work stress (long working hours, physical and emotional exhaustion) 4. Treatment approaches include:a. Intervention\u2014structured method of pen- etrating the delusional system of chemi-cally dependent persons for the purpose of facilitating insight into the addictive problem and entry into treatment(1) Use team approach, nonpunitive at-titude; 2-10 professional associates of impaired colleague who share a nonjudgmental attitude (to include one recovering peer and one with ex-perience in chemical dependency if possible). (2) Present documented evidence, always prefacing testimony with positive remarks. (3) Give impaired nurse a chance to respond. (4) State available options and allow an opportunity for voluntary entry into treatment.(a) Diversion programs\u2014facilitate reentry into practice without li-censure sanctions. (b) Regulatory legal action\u2014nurse reported to the state board for suspected chemical dependency is dealt with under the State Nurse Practice Act and the Administra-tive Procedure Act. (c) Criminal legal action\u2014nurse who diverts a control substance from a facility or obtains a controlled substance by fraud is in violation of the Controlled Substance Act. (5) Make arrangements to monitor progress. c. Specialized inpatient program, AA and/or NA meetings for healthcare professionals d. Employee assistance programse. Peer assistance support from state and district associations f. Reentry back into the workplace(1) Restrictions on handling medications for a certain period of time (2) Urine drug screening (3) Regular documented attendance for outpatient treatment and AA/NA meetings (4) Stable work shifts (minimize variable shift work) (5) Clear job performance expecta-tions with supervision and regular evaluationsa. Theory-based psychotherapy\u2014individual, group, family b. Evaluation, treatment recommendation and appropriate referral c. Consultant as an expert in the field of chemical dependency d. Staff support and management functions e. Interventions for the patient presenting with complex problems f. Staff education and supervision g. Preventative functions\u2014community awareness and education h. Research functions\u2014participation in and/or initiation of protocols that may improve future interventions and care of the substance abusing population i. Professional development\u2014committee memberships, publications, presenta-tions, learning opportunities j. Medication evaluation and monitoring if psychiatric and mental health advanced practice nurse granted prescriptive authority Community resources 1. Self-help support group meetingsa. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) b. Narcotics Anonymous (NA) c. Cocaine Anonymous (CA) d. Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS); geared more toward individuals with ag-nostic view of spirituality e. AL-ANON, NAR-ANON and AL-ATEEN\u2014 family/significant others and teenagers living with or involved with a substance abuser f. Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA) 2. Prevention groups\u2014special-interest groups developed for community awareness and education, public policy making, introducing and changing legislation related to alcohol and substance usea. Drug Abuse Readiness Education (DARE)b. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) Impaired nurses\u2014a resolution passed at the American Nurses' Association (ANA) Congress in 2002 advocates for the use of an \"alternatives to discipline\" model (also known as peer-assistance programs) in addressing a nurse's needs when substance-related or psychiatric disorders interfere with the practice of nursing. According to Cahill (1992) nurses are at higher risk due to:1. Accessibility to drugs and addictive substances 2.

General fears\u2014saying foolish things c. Usually mild impairment 3. Agoraphobia\u2014fear of being in a place or situ-ation from which there might be difficult or embarrassing escape, or in which, should symptoms become very embarrassing or inca-pacitating, there might be no help available\u2014such as:Anxiety DisorDers \u0088 Overview Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders in the general population, affect-ing about 40 million (18.1%) adults (aged 18 and older) in the United States (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005). This cluster of disorders is charac- terized by the type, degree, and duration of anxiety or worry experienced in response to one or more perceived stressors. The most common anxiety dis - orders are specific (simple) phobias (8.7%), social anxiety (phobia) (6.8%), posttraumatic stress dis-order (3.5%), generalized anxiety disorder (3.1%), and panic disorder (2.7%); other anxiety disorders occur in less than 2% of the population (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005). Levels of anxiety (Videbeck, 2006) I. Mild\u2014slight physical arousal, sharp percep- tions, ability to learn well II. Moderate\u2014physical symptoms apparent, nar - rowing of perceptual field, selective attention III. Severe\u2014physical symptoms problematic, dif- ficulty concentrating, very apprehensive, may develop ritualistic behavior IV. Panic\u2014terror, little ability to concentrate, dif- ficulty breathing, palpitations, fear of dying, may be suicidal Types of coping (Keltner, Schwecke, & Bostrom, 2007)1. Adaptive\u2014active problem solving is attempted with limited experience of anxiety.5 Anxiety and Stress- Related Disorders 84 ChApter 5 Anxiety and Stress-Related Disorders 2. Possible genetic component with higher con- cordance in first-degree relatives 3. Serotonergic abnormality4. Possible limbic system in gener-ating anticipatory anxiety (Stahl 2008, 2009; Sa- dock & Sadock, 2007)1. Antianxiety agents in combination with behav-ioral approaches 2. Antianxiety agents if behavioral approaches ineffective (See Table 5-1) a. Antidepressants, particularly b. Short-acting benzodiazepines (alprazo- lam) may be useful for specific phobias. c. Beta-adrenergic antagonists that block the sympathetic response (e.g., propranolol) are helpful in situational anxiety such as stage fright. d. Other antidepressants may be useful if first-line agents do not effectively reduce anxiety symptoms:(1) MAOIs in particular for social phobias(2) TCAs such as imipramine for panic disorders with agoraphobia Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Origins a. Psychodynamic\u2014phobia as an outward manifestation of inner, unresolved child-hood conflicts(1) Anxiety is displaced (when repression fails) upon an object or situation that symbolizes the conflict. (2) Conflicts are often sexual (oedipal) or related to separation anxiety. (3) Disorder includes disturbance of in- terpersonal attachment & coping.a. Fears of heart attack, depersonalization, loss of bladder control, etc. b. Limits on travel, crowds, or being out- side the home alone to avoid symptom development c. Mild (some avoidance or tolerance of anxiety) to severe (housebound or un-able to leave the house unaccompanied) impairment Differential diagnosis 1. Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia 2. Avoidant Personality Disorder 3. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder4. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder5. Schizophrenia (with delusions) Mental status variations 1. Appearance and behavior\u2014normal unless faced with feared stimulus, then exhibits symptoms of severe anxiety 2. Mood\u2014commonly depressed, often related to degree of impairment 3. Thought\u2014persistent, irrational fear of object or situation Nursing diagnoses (NANDA, 2009) 1. Anxiety (specify level)2. Insomnia 3. Coping, ineffective4. Fear 5. Powerlessness, risk for6. Relationships, readiness for enhanced7. Hopelessness8. Resilience, risk for compromised9. Self-Esteem, situational low10. Resilience, impaired individual11. Resilience, readiness for enhanced12.

(c) Induce/maintain relaxed state, while client imagines each anxiety-provoking stimulus. (d) When desensitized to one stimu- lus, move up the scale, until relaxation can be maintained throughout entire list of stimuli. (e) Apply technique in vivo. (2) Flooding\u2014use intensive exposure to stimulus in vivo or through imagery until fear can no longer be felt. (3) Neurolinguistic Programming c. Hypnosis\u2014used to support acceptance that the phobic object/situation is not dangerous, or to assist in relaxation when confronted with the feared object/situationb. Behavioral (1) Classical conditioning response\u2014 phobia develops when anxiety occurs as one is confronted with a naturally frightening stimulus and becomes paired with a neutral stimulus. (2) Operant theories\u2014person learns to avoid a stimulus for anxiety, and the reduction in anxiety reinforces the behavior. 2. Psychotherapeutic interventionsa. Psychodynamic\u2014insight-oriented therapy to resolve childhood conflicts, understand secondary gain, and to find healthy ways to deal with anxiety b. Behavior (most effective treatment) (1) Systematic desensitization (a) Design, with client, list of anxiety- provoking stimuli related to the object/situation from the least to most frightening.Table 5-2 \u0084 First-line Medications 2020 to 80 100 to 300 20 to 50 50 to 200SSRIs are first-line agents for (BuSpar) 20 to 30 May take up to 4 weeks for therapeutic effect Benzodiazepine to 0.25 0.75 to 6 2 to 6 30 to 60 15 to 30 0.5 to 2 15 to 100 4 to 40Generally, benzodiazepines are used short term (about one month) Legend for benzodiazepines: SA = short acting; IMA = intermediate acting; LA = long acting (Sadock & Sadock, 2007; Stahl, 2008, 2009)86 ChApter 5 Anxiety Family dynamics/Family therapy\u2014used in the fol- lowing situations: 1. Role performance (work, family, social con- tacts) is impaired, family dynamics are al-tered, and other members assume additional responsibilities. 2. Children sense fears of outside world or objects. 3 There is need for role restructuring, support of therapy and change, and reduction of second-ary gain of all members. Group approaches 1. Therapy a. Psychodynamic insight-oriented group therapy b. Psychoeducational group\u2014focus on un-derstanding phobic disorders and learning relaxation techniques c. Social skills training\u2014modeling, rehears- ing, coaching to improve communication d. Supportive therapy to provide reality test- ing and feedback within a group of others seeking to make similar changes\u2014may provide \"here and now\" experience in fac-ing phobic social situations 2. Self-help groups (affiliated with Phobia Society of America, Rockville, MD) may be present in some communities. Milieu interventions (unlikely to be hospitalized unless severely impaired)1. Provide safe, supportive environment, free of ridicule for phobia. 2. Institute goal-oriented contract for treatment. 3. Employ anxiety-reducing techniques (PMR, breathing, etc.) to decrease general arousal. 4. Conduct systematic desensitization (imagined or in vivo). 5. Engage in activities that increase feelings of power and self-esteem. 6. Reinforce what is learned in individual, group, and family sessions. 7. Provide referrals to outpatient support groups. Community resources 1. Outpatient therapy2. Support groups Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Definition\u2014a response resulting from exposure to a severe emotionally or physically traumatic event characterized by: (1) intrusive reexperiencing of the trauma; (2) avoidance behaviors and emotional numbing; and (3) increased arousal (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000) Signs and symptoms 1. Stressors may include war experiences, as- sault, rape, serious accidents, abuse, and natu-ral catastrophes (van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Weisaeth, 1996). 2. Common trauma experience symptoms in-clude overwhelming fear, loss of control, help-lessness, and fear of being annihilated.a. Person witnesses or experiences events that involve actual or threatened death or severe physical harm. b. Person reacts with fear, helplessness, or horror (APA, 2000). 3. Recurrent intrusive thoughts of trauma oc- cur in dreams, thoughts, flashbacks, or events similar to stressor. 4. Numbing or constriction (avoidance) re- sponses include:a. Avoidance of thoughts/feelings/ recollections about trauma b. Avoidance of persons/situations that pro- voke memory of original trauma c. Psychogenic amnesia, dissociationd. Marked diminished interest in significant activities, persons, or the future 5. Increased arousal responses include sleep dis- turbances, temper outbursts, hypervigilance and difficulty concentrating, and exaggerated startle response (APA, 2000). 6. Response may be delayed by weeks to many years. 7. Standard definition of PTSD (DSM) tends bet- ter to fit survivors of circumscribed events and fails to address symptoms and personality manifestation resulting from prolonged, re-peated trauma (Herman, 1992). 8. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, dissociation, so- matization, and affect dysregulation are highly interrelated (van der Kolk, Peclovitz, Roth, Mandel, McFarlane, & Herman, 1997). Differential diagnosis 1. Factitious Disorder 2. Borderline Personality Disorder3. Schizophrenia4. Depression 5. Panic Disorder6. Generalized Anxiety Disorder7. Acute Stress Disorder (APA, 2000) a. Similar origin and presentation as PTSD, but occurs within 4 weeks of traumatic event. b. Symptoms last from 2 days to 4 weeks. 8. Frequently misdiagnosed due to symptoms\u2014 hallucinations, depression, addiction, and so-matic complaints (Symes, 1995) 9. High rates of comorbidity (Friedman, 1996)87 Anxiety reactivates previous, unresolved childhood conflicts.(1) Regression, repression, denial and un- doing defense mechanisms (2) Secondary gain when dependency needs met b. Cognitive\u2014brain attempts to process through alternate blocking and acknowl-edging the event until a new mental scheme that incorporates the trauma is devised (Herman, 1992). c. Personal resilience\u2014persons who con-struct meaning out of the event, make connections with others, who actively at-tempt to cope, and who have strong inter - nal locus of control withstand trauma with fewer symptoms (Herman, 1992). d. There is some evidence that those who dissociate at time of trauma have higher risk for PTSD. e. Epidemiological studies\u201427% of women and 16% of men experienced sexual abuse as children; 33% of survivors who had physical contact without penetration, and 64% of those with penetration developed PTSD (Rodriguez, Ryan, Vande Kemp, & Foy, 1997). 2. Psychotherapeutic interventions: (Sadock & Sadock, 2007)a. Interventions for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) involve crisis intervention strategies with support, education, enhancement of coping mechanisms, and acceptance of the event (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). b. The two most common and effective ther - apies used for PTSD are:(1) Exposure therapy\u2014employs strategies (imagery, in vivo exposure) that pro-mote reexperiencing of the traumatic event (e.g., exposure-based cognitive Mental status variations 1.

Increased baseline sympathetic arousal may predispose; after trauma, baseline elevated. 2. Trauma response includes the following: a. Immediate, excessive arousal, espe- cially cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems b. Arousal of sympathetic system that leads to difficulty in distinguishing perceptual cues c. Original hyperarousal easily evoked after trauma by variety of cues. d. Autonomic arousal becomes neurologi-cally entrained (van der 3. of endogenous opioids altered a. When stressor subsides, opioids may decrease. b. Opioid withdrawal symptoms similar to PTSD. c. Individual may be \"addicted\" to trauma. Biochemical interventions (Stahl, 2008) 1. Antidepressantsa.

Group as surrogate family (1) Victims often blamed by family for disclosing or over-reacting. (2) Group serves as training ground for new behaviors.(a) Analyze effect of family's mes- sages and beliefs on view of self and world. (b) Learn and practice assertive behaviors. (c) Do not reinforce helplessness or powerlessness. (3) Support and validate strengths/worth.(4) Handle successfully the displaced hostility, regression, dissociation, extreme, anxiety or depression, self destructive behaviors. (5) Use 12-step group programs.(6) Teach short-term stress management.(7) Trauma\u2014use focused groups. 2. Combat trauma groupsb. Goals(1) Share experiences.(2) Work through problems in social adaptation. (3) Manage aggression toward others.(4) Make sense of trauma in life. Milieu interventions 1. Create a safe environment, including a trusting relationship with staff and no-harm contract. 2. Educate client about recovery process.3. Assist client to employ stress management techniques (relaxation techniques, exercise, cognitive strategies).a. Reduce general arousal.b. Employ techniques when anxiety in- creases or with intrusive memories. 4. Support client's ability to gain control over memories, to:a. Retrieve during therapy.b. Set aside . 5. Teach client to manage physiological symp- toms of PTSD, including sleep disorders. 6. Listen to client's story, respecting ability to dis- close and to stop remembering. 7. Engage in activities that promote self-esteem.8. Assist in making plans to use leisure time. 9. Encourage social interaction.10. Address spiritual issues. 11. Develop system of social support in community. 12. Assist to devise realistic plans for future, in- cluding therapy, occupation, and relationships (solution-focused plan).behavioral therapy, implosive therapy, and systematic desensitization). (2) Stress management\u2014used to teach relaxation techniques and cognitive restructuring such that one's ability to cope with stress is improved. c. Other psychotherapeutic interventions used in treating PTSD include:(1) Psychoeducation regarding the re- covery process (tailored to particular traumas) (2) Expressive therapies (art, dance, mu- sic) to translate visual and sensorimo-tor memories, especially those not encoded in cognitive systems, into meaningful symbols and verbal repre-sentations to be integrated (3) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) to decrease symptoms of trauma\u2014continues to be researched (Benedek, F riedman, Zatzick, & Ursano, 2009) Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Family roles can be altered as PTSD symptoms are experienced. 2. Some children develop affective symptoms, become rescuers or disengage from a parent who has PTSD. 3. Family may expect more rapid recovery than is possible. 4. Family can help clarify events, listen, and cor - rect distortions. 5. Abusive families-of-origin may deny, punish, and attempt to enforce conspiracy of silence. 6. Family therapy guidelines a. Support victim in recovery.b. Meet needs of all family members. c. Maintain awareness of how trauma affects views of self, family, and world. d. Develop shared frame of reference for trauma. e. Bring out central issues of blame, respon- sibility, and trust. Group approaches (group experiences with survi- vors of similar traumas can be helpful, variable in length)1. Adult survivors of childhood sexual abusea. Long-term group therapy, usually outpatient b. Goals(1) Reduce isolation, shame, guilt, and sense of deviance. (2) Restructure family-induced behaviors.(3) Develop new, more realistic patterns of interaction.89 Anxiety Disorders Community resources 1. Twelve-step programs (useful with co- occurring substance use disorder) 2. Community outreach program 3. Battered Women's Shelter for Domestic (Spouse) Abuse a. Abuse includes physical battery, verbal threats, intimidating gestures, forced sexual activity, isolation, and economic deprivation (Campbell, Harris, & Lee, 1995). b. Women are more commonly hurt than men; 16% of pregnant women are abused (McFarlane, Parker, & Soeken, 1995). c. Models of explanation(1) Perpetrator psychopathology, includ- ing substance abuse (2) Family violence with generational transmission, and violence within en-tire system (abused wives use severe violence in conflicts with children) (3) Violence instead of appropriate coping by perpetrator in stressful situation (4) Gender relations in which men choose violence when control over women is threatened d.

Solution-focused therapy Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Children of parents with GAD are likely to see the world as dangerous and themselves as vul-nerable. Children may be:a. Excessively protected.b. Excessively dependent. 2. Family member with GAD may exhibit altered role performance and require other family members to assume greater or inappropriate responsibility (Barloon, 1993). 3. Family member with GAD may become fam-ily's \"weak one,\" or the scapegoat. 4. Family treatment emphasizes the following:a. Knowledge of GAD and treatmentb. Cognitive restructuring for all family members to challenge and correct collec-tive assumptions about danger and coping c. Promotion of differentiation, especially in children2. Persons with GAD hav e increased sympathetic tone, greater response, and slower adaptation to stress. 3. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a principle inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter, may have diminished activity. 4. Decreased activity occurs in basal ganglia and limbic system, and frontal cortex; increased activity in cerebellum and some cortical structures. 5. Possible genetic link exists between alcohol- ism and anxiety disorders, particularly in males. 6. Worry is negatively reinforced by decrease in aversive somatic activation (autonomic hyper-activity) (Freeston, sants, and buspirone (BuSpar) are considered first-line agents in treating GAD. 2. After failure of trials with the above agents, sedating antidepressants such as mirtazap-ine, trazodone, or tricyclic sedating antihistamines such hy - droxyzine may be useful. 3. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) may be used as a first-line treatment or as an augmenting agent for GAD.a. Reluctance in using benzodiazepine exists due to the potential for abuse and depen-dence, and the long-term nature of GAD. However, these agents have been useful in reducing anxiety while achieving thera-peutic responses from first-line agents; augmenting the therapeutic response of other GAD medications; and in providing relief when intermittent surges of anxiety are experienced. Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Origins a. Psychodynamic\u2014anxiety results from unconscious conflict or emergence of un-acceptable drives (often related to depen-dent, sexual, or aggressive content).(1) Anxiety serves as a signal that repres- sion of drive or conflict is not working. (2) If repression doesn't contain drives, then other defense mechanisms em-ployed (conversion, displacement, regression). b. Behavioral\u2014anxiety is a conditioned re- sponse to a specific stimulus, or a learned, internal response (perhaps from imitating 91 Anxiety Disorders 3.

Panic Disorder Definition\u2014recurrent, unexpected, intense peri- ods of extreme apprehension and terror without clear precipitant Signs and symptoms 1. Attack begins with rapidly increasing symp-toms of fear and doom, palpitations, tachycar - dia, dyspnea, sweating, hyperventilation. 2. Attack lasts 30 to 60 minutes; may include symptoms of depersonalization, derealization, paresthesia, fainting, dizziness, choking, nau-sea, chest pain, flushes or chills.a. First attacks are often in phobogenic situation. b. Subsequent attacks are spontaneous (un- cued, unexpected). 3. Clients usually try to seek help, focusing on cardiac or respiratory symptoms. Clients often:a. Believe they are dying.b. Are seen in emergency room. c. Fear going \"crazy.\" 4. Panic response may be accompanied by ago-raphobia, fearing panic attacks will occur in setting without help. 5. Between episodes client exhibits anticipatory anxiety, vigilant for onset of another attack. 6. Attacks range from mild (one attack per month or limited number of symptoms), to severe (eight panic attacks per month). 7. Attacks ar e often accompanied by depression. Differential diagnosis 1. Note whether Panic Disorder is or is not ac- companied by agoraphobia. 2. Physical disorders such as mitral valve pro-lapse, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, or pheochromocytoma 3. Withdrawal from psychoactive substances 4. Caffeine or stimulant abuse 5. Alcohol abuse6. GAD, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)7. Somatization Disorder Mental status variations 1.

Therapy\u2014group therapy offers opportunities for feedback, realistic self-appraisal, and sup-port when changing behavior patterns.a. Insight-oriented approach to resolve un-conscious conflicts b. Psychoeducational approaches to increase understanding of nature of GAD and to learn coping strategies c. Cognitive group therapy to challenge and correct dysfunctional cognitions d. Assertiveness training Milieu interventions 1. Create a safe, supportive environment.2. Use goal-oriented contract to focus treatment. 3. Use diary/logs to record manifestation of anxiety (thoughts, emotions, physiological responses), the situation, course of events, ef-ficacy of intervention. 4. Teach role of dysfunctional cognitions (danger and inability to cope) in creating/maintaining anxiety. 5. Teach analysis of negative self-statements and replace with rational, positive statements and receive feedback from other clients. 6. Teach relaxation techniques, monitor practice of relaxation techniques, and assist to imple-ment when experiencing anxiety.a. Breathing techniquesb. Progressive muscle relaxation c. Autogenic training 7. Assist to develop alternative means of coping such as exercising, taking warm baths, or talk-ing to staff and other clients. 8. Promote activities that increase self- confidence through progressively more difficult challenges. 9. Plan leisure activities to deal with \"free time.\" 10. Encourage resumption of family, work, and social roles. 11. Refer to partial hospitalization program or outpatient services. Community resources 1. GAD often treated by primary care providers such as family doctors and nurse practitioners.a. Advanced practice PMH nurse may pro- vide consultation, individual, group, and family therapy. b. Work collaboratively. 2. Provide support groups or parenting classes for persons with anxiety disorders.92 ChApter 5 Anxiety and Stress-Related Disorders psychotherapeutic methods may be of great- est benefit for those diagnosed with a Panic Disorder. origins/Psychotherapeutic interven- Psychodynamic\u2014panic occurs when defenses against anxiety (repression, dis-placement, and avoidance) are ineffective.(1) Symbolic nature is often related to abandonment and separation anxiety. (2) Traumatic separations in childhood may increase vulnerability by produc-ing autonomic nervous system stimu-lation (Shear, 1996). (3) Interpersonal problems in assertive- ness and sociability may contribute (Battaglia, 1995). b. Behavioral (1) Parental behavior modeling or classi- cal conditioning (2) Demonstration of cognitions of exag- gerated vulnerability, inability to cope, and general negative views of self; catastrophic interpretations of anxiety symptoms that provide more arousal and symptoms (3) Stressful life events\u2014persons with Panic Disorder report greater fre-quency of life events that pose danger and threat. c.

First-degree relatives of clients with Panic Disorder are 4-to-8 times more likely to experi-ence a panic attack and with early onset (be-fore age 20) the rate increases to 17. 2. A genetic link has been implicated with a higher concordance rate among monozygotic twins; although no specific chromosomal loca-tion has been identified. 3. Abnormal regulation of the noradrenergic sys-tems in the brain is involved with panic attacks and Panic Disorder. 4. Neurotransmitters involved in Panic Disor - der include: serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA. 5. Brain imaging studies have implicated patho- logical involvement in several regions of the brain (temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala), and cerebral vasoconstriction\u2014possible relationship of CNS lesions with abnormal signal activity or asymmetric right temporal lobe atrophy, abnormal activity in hippocampus and right frontal cortex. 6.

Obsession\u2014unwanted, repeated, and uncon- trollable thoughts, images, or impulsesa. Inability to break thought cycle through distraction in conversation or other tasks b. Common themes of losing things, blas- phemy, fears of disease, contamination, sexual behavior, or aggression c. Increased anxiety if resisted 2. Compulsions\u2014repeated, unwanted pat- terns of behavior that are often responses to obsessionsa. Excessive cleaning, washing, checking, counting, or repeating b.

Cognitiv e and cognitive behavior thera- pies have been successful in treating panic symptoms.(1) Cognitive therapy\u2014focus on false beliefs and information about one's panic attacks (2) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\u2014 seeks to identify and refute mistaken beliefs and about physical symptoms and their consequences.(a) Panic-focused CBT\u2014frequently incorporates the following treat-ment components: psychoeduca-tion, self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, exposure strategies (to reduce fear cues), behavior modification (targeting anxiety reduction), and relapse preven-tion (APA, 2009). Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Clients with agoraphobia may always require family members to stay close by, resulting in:a. Marital discord b. Dependence upon children 2. Altered role performance (work, family, social situations) increases responsibility of other family members. Therapeutic approaches include: a. Family education about origin, nature, and treatment of disorder b. Family therapy to restructure communica-tion and roles to support change 3. Family is work essential due to chronic nature of Panic Disorder (Pollak & Smoller, 1995; Shear, 1995). Group approaches 1. Therapy to improve coping and/or social supporta. Insight-oriented therapy b. Cognitive therapy c. Support groups where stable, intimate re- lationships can buffer anxiety 2. Self-help\u2014community self-help groups en- courage acceptance and improved life func-tioning when residual symptoms persist. Milieu interventions 1. Provide safe, supportive environment.2. Establish goal-oriented tr eatment contract. 3. Assist client to employ relaxation and cogni-tive techniques when panic attack first begins. 4. Label experience as a \"panic attack\" and anxiety. 5.

Serotonin is implicated by observations that OCD symptoms decrease with selective sero-tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and increase with serotonin antagonists. 2. Some evidence suggests increased prevalence of OCD in first-degree relatives with the dis-order; and a genetic linkage on chromosome 9p24. Biochemical interventions (APA, 2007; Stahl, 2008) 1. SSRIs are the first-line treatment agent for OCD. 2. TCAs , specifically clomipramine & SNRIs may be considered with multiple failed SSRI response. Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Origins a. Psy chodynamic\u2014unacceptable thoughts and impulses are isolated, but threaten to break through into consciousness so that compulsive acts are performed to undo the possible consequences, should the un-acceptable become conscious.(1) Symptoms may arise during anal stage since much OCD involves cleanliness or aggressive preoccupation. (2) Note both ambivalence and magical thinking. b. Behavioral (1) Obsessions act as conditioned stimu- lus to anxiety. (2) Compulsions arise when a behavior reduces the anxiety associated with the obsessions. 2. Psychotherapeutic interventions (APA, 2007)a. Insight-oriented, psychodynamic therapy has little evidence to support its use in OCD treatment. b. Behavioral and cognitive behavioral thera- pies have greatest effectiveness.(1) Combine exposure with response de- lay (ERD) with pharmacotherapy. (2) Employ gradual extinction of ritu- als by exposure to anxiety-producing situations until habituation occurs with strict abstinence from perform-ing rituals (Abramowitz, 1997). (3) Reduce obsessive thoughts by thought-stopping (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist when obses-sive thought appears). (4) Reduce obsessive thoughts through semantic satiation (write a few words of the obsession and then rewrite or say aloud many times until fear is no longer evoked). Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Family members may constantly reassure the client, which reinforces the obsession. 2. Family may assist patient to avoid situations that trigger OCD, which worsens the fear cycle. 3. Therapeutic approaches include: a. Emphasize remaining neutral (not rein- forcement through reassurance). b. Avoid reasoning with client (increases anxiety). c. Avoid ridicule. d. Assist with response delay . e. Design with family, ways to use time freed up by successful treatment of symptoms (Shear, 1995). Group approaches 1. Supportive group therapy2. Self-help groups in community are often affili- ates of Obsessive Compulsive Foundation Inc. Milieu interventions (Keltner et al., 2007) 1. Incorporate relaxation exercises, recreational or social skills development, and successful problem-solving opportunities. 2. Promote stress management (provide educa-tion and practice exercises). 3. Conduct CBT, communication, or assertive- ness training groups. 4. Always focus care upon the needs of the patient/client. 5. Promote activities that reduce anxiety such as physical activity, and vary sufficiently in order not to reinforce or promote developing a new ritual.95 Sadock, 1. Origins a. Conversion of anxiety into physical symptom(1) Conflict is usually sexual or aggressive.(2) Symptom allows both disguising im- pulse and partially expressing it. (3) Symptoms have symbolic relationship to conflict. (4) Symptoms communicate special needs. b. Symptoms reinforced by family or society, plus secondary gain. c. Symptoms replace verbal language. 2. Psychotherapeutic interventionsa. Psychodynamic insight-oriented psycho-therapy is used to explore conflicts. b. Focus therapy on stress and coping. c. Employ brief, solution-focused psychotherapy. d. Hypnosis, anxiolytics, and relaxation exer - cises may be useful. e. Telling patient that their symptoms are imaginary can make them worse. Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Family rules negate direct expression of conflict. 2. Illness may be family-accepted means to avoid taking action. 3. Family may encourage secondary gain. 4. Employ therapy to improve verbal communi- cation, conflict resolution, and restructuring of family interactional patterns. Group approaches 1. Emphasis on coping with stress2. Assertiveness training Milieu interventions 1. Minimize sick role behavior. 2. Encourage verbal expression of needs and conflicts. 3. Assist staff and patients to reinforce verbaliza-tion and functional behavior, and ignore im-pairments to reduce secondary gain. 4. Help client understand relationships between conflict, symptoms, and gain. 5. Teach new coping skills to decr ease anxiety.

Do not occur during the course of delirium or dementia.3. Functioning is not markedly impaired except for the impact of the delusions. 4. In the elderly, mood may be manifested by anger, paranoia, and anxiety; behaviors may include suspiciousness, aggression, and isolation. Types of delusions (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007; Videbeck, 2006) 1. Persecutory/paranoid\u2014belief that others are attacking, harassing, cheating, or conspiring against them (or a person close to them); e.g., belief that one is being followed by the CIA or that others are poisoning their food 2. Jealousy\u2014belief that one's sexual partner is unfaithful 3. Erotomanic\u2014belief that someone, usually in a position of higher status or authority, is in love with them 4. Grandiose\u2014belief that they have special knowledge, worth, or powers; may believe they are or have a special relationship with a deity or famous person 5. Somatic\u2014vague or unrealistic belief that one's appearance, health, or physical functioning is deficient or unique 6.

Health Management, ineffective self19. Knowledge, deficient (specify) Genetic/Biologic theories (Sadock & Sadock, 2007) 1. Genetica. The lifetime risk of developing schizo-phrenia when one has a parent, identical twin or sibling with schizophrenia is much higher than in the population at large. b. Torrey et al. (1994) studied 66 pairs of identical twins and noted that 27 pairs were discordant for schizophrenia and 13 pairs were concordant for schizophrenia. c. An exact genetic linkage has not been es- tablished. However, multiple common ge-netic polymorphisms have been suggested with several genes implicated in schizo-phrenia vulner ability. Multiple genes on several chromosomes have been identified including: chromosomes 6, 2, 11, 13, 12, 22 (Tandon, Keshavan, & Nasrallah, 2008b; Wong, Arcos-Burgos, & Licinio, 2008). 2.

Neurotransmitter models\u2014theories/ hypotheses about schizophrenia include specific and interconnected roles of various neurotransmitters:119 Inforrmation Common to Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders create source of development changes that present risk factor for schizophrenia (Cannon & Marco, 1994) b. Risk factors associated with schizophrenia (1) Studies of childhood encephalitis, head trauma younger than age 10, hemorrhage into the ventricles, isch-emic damage to cortex associated with schizophrenia. (2) Twin studies established indicators of liability, but do not predict the disease (Torrey, Bowler, Taylor & Gottesman, 1994). 6. Theory of two types of schizophreniaa. Type I\u2014characterized by positive symp-toms of schizophrenia, e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking; responds well to typical antipsychotic medications b. Type II\u2014characterized by negative symp-toms, including withdrawal, flattening of affect, decreased motivation; respond bet-ter to newer antipsychotics (clozapine and risperidone); negative symptoms may be more related to structural defect and not dopamine function (Keltner & Folks, 1997) Biochemical interventions 1. Typical antipsychotics (Sadock & Sadock, 2007; Stahl, 2008, 2009)a. Used to decrease psychotic symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia b. Used short term in Schizophreniform Disorder c. Mode of action\u2014block dopamine recep- tors in post-synaptic neuron(1) Potency related to D2 receptor affinity in primarily four major pathways in the brain. (2) Blockade of dopamine receptors in the cortex potentially makes negative symptoms worse. (3) D2 receptor blockade responsible for many side effects of typical antipsy-chotics (Sherr, 1996). d. Medications (See Table 6-1 ) (1) Fluphenazine (Prolixin), 12.5 to 50 mg every 6 hours, and haloperidol (Hal-dol), 6 to 20 mg daily are available in intramuscular, injectable forms that are long-acting and released over two-to-three weeks.(a) Reduces need to take daily oral medications (b) Helps reduce ambivalence (2) Dosages vary widely among patients.a. Serotonin (5HT2) deficiency may be responsible for some forms of schizophrenia. b. Glutamate\u2014specifically, deficiency me-diated excitatory neurotransmission by N-methyl D-apartate (NMDA) receptors may be involved. This hypothesis is sup-ported by psychosis triggered by NMDA antagonists (phencyclidine and ketamine) (Keshavan, Tandon, Boutros, & Nasrallah, c. GABA\u2014Reduced levels of GABA in prefron- tal cortex may account for alterations in neuronal synchrony leading to memory im-pairment in schizophrenia (Keshavan et al.). d. Norepinephrine (NE) may be insufficient in clients with schizophrenia that display prominent negative symptoms. e. Dopamine (DA) is likely to be excessive at certain receptor sites, or persons with schizophrenia may have more dopamine receptors. D 2 receptors are present in lim- bic and motor neuron center; overactivity of D 2 receptors may be related to positive symptoms of schizophrenia (Harris & McMahon, 1997). Although direct evi-dence in support of the dopamine hypoth-esis of schizophrenia is sparse (Keshavan, Tandon, Boutros, & Nasrallah, 2008). f. Also implicated in schizophrenia are ace- tylcholine muscarinic and nicotinic re-ceptors, which play a role in regulation of neurotransmitters involved in cognition. g. The interaction of various neurotrans-mitters has also been studied relative to schizophrenia. h. Recent studies have examined effect of interactions between hormones and neu-rotransmitters in schizophrenia; patterns of dopamine-thyroid interactions and dopamine pituitary hormone secretions were found to be related to symptoms of schizophrenia. 4. Neurophysiological modelsa. Decreased cerebral blood flow (as mea-sured by Single Photon Emission Com-puted Tomography (SPECT)) (Keltner & Folks, 1997) and decreased glucose me- tabolism in the frontal lobes (as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) b. Hypofrontality may be related to changes in abstract thinking and social judgment. 5. Immunologic/Risk factor models a. Exposure to viruses, especially influenza prenatally\u2014theorized that such exposure may create maternal antibodies that be-come auto-antibodies in the fetus and 120 Chapter 6 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders v. Severe spasms of tongue and larynx can result in dys-phagia (difficulty swallowing) and compromised airway. vi. Treatment\u2014anticholinergic drugs; severe painful symp-toms benefit from IM dose cogentin 2 mg or benedryl 50 mg that may be repeated in 30 minutes if no resolution of symptoms. (b) Neuroleptic-induced pseudopar-kinsonism\u2014dopamine blockade in nigrostriatal pathways results in clinical symptoms such as:i. Tremors ii. Bradykinesia/akinesia (slow-ness, absence of movement) iii. Cogwheel rigidity (slow, regu-lar, muscular movements) iv. Postural instability, shuffling gait, loss of mobility in the facial muscles (mask-like faces), hypersalivation and droolinge. Potential side effects of typical antipsychotics(1) Anticholinergic effects occur due to interference of nerve impulses by ace-tylcholine and epinephrine; include constipation, dry mouth, blurred vi-sion, urinary retention and hesitancy; bethanecol is sometimes given for urinary retention. (2) Extrapyramidal symptoms can occur due to medication's effects on the ex-trapyramidal tracts of central nervous system.(a) Acute dystonia\u2014muscle spasms may occur early in treatment, sometimes after first dose; occur in up to 10% of clients:i. Blepharospasm (eye closing) ii. Torticollis (neck muscle con-traction, pulling head to side) iii. Oculogyric crisis (severe upward deviation of the eyeballs) iv.

(c) May occur any time during treat- ment but is more frequent shortly after initiation of antipsychotics or dose increases; rapid adminis-tration of a high potency antipsy-chotic and an increased number of IM injections may increase risk. (d) Treatment of NMS requires dis- continuation of antipsychotic drugs and maintenance of nutri-tion, cooling, and hydration. (e) Ventilation may be required for respiratory failure; renal dialysis for renal failure. (f) Muscle relaxant IV can be admin- istered to reduce rigidity.

Medications used for Schizoaffective Dis- order\u2014include atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and Depakote), as well de-pending on interventions1. Interactional schizophrenia delin-eates that biologic vulnerability along with en-vironmental factors, social skills, and support of individual are factors in development of the illness. 2. Psychotherapeutic intervention\u2014acutea. Nursing interventions during inpatient hospitalization(1) Nurse should set a tone of quiet con-fidence in treatment process that conveys a sense of caring rather than judgment. (2) Delivery of simple and short instruc-tions about the facility, daily schedule and treatment process are important to building a relationship that conveys respect and concern for individual as well as their illness. (3) Expected outcome of patient care for persons experiencing schizophrenia is patient will live, learn, and work at a maximum possible level of success as defined by individual (Moller & Murphy, 1995). (4) Initial treatment efforts are directed at correcting instability related to major symptoms experienced and resulting disruption in activities of daily living. (5) Medication management is joint effort, and must include careful (a) Recommended initial dose is 5 to 10 mg with a target dose of 10 mg within a few days. (b) Because of the relatively short time to steady state, recom-mended that patient remain on a dose for 5 to 7 days before increasing. (c) Mean 30-hour half-life of olan- zapine allows for once-a-day dos-ing, usually at bedtime. (d) Effective in treating positive and negative symptoms d. Ziprasidone (Geodon)(1) Mode of action (a) Antagonizes D2 receptors and 5HT2 receptors (2) Side effects(a) Hypotension (b) Dizziness (c) Sedation (d) Extrapyramidal symptoms (e) Nausea (f) Dry mouth (3) Dosage and efficacy(a) Recommended initial oral dose is 20 mg 2 times per day (b) Available in IM formulation\u2014rec- ommended adult dose: 10 mg ev-ery 2 hours or 20 mg every 4 hours as needed for agitation associated with schizophrenia (c) Effective in treating positive and negative symptoms e.

Aripiprazole (Abilify)126 Chapter 6 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders attention to observed behaviors, cli- ent description, and client response to medication therapies. (6) Careful recordkeeping of descriptive information and use of Brief Symp-tom Rating Inventory (BSRI) assists in initial assessment phase of treatment and determines client outcome profile related to treatment and medication. (7) Treatment milieu is organized to reduce sensory stimulation, while providing opportunities for simple and brief social and professional interactions. (8) Schedule should provide time for rest, structured activity, and set times to speak with providers. (9) Use of soft lighting, uncluttered space, and sound control can create an envi-ronment for recovery. b. Nursing intervention during the early acute stage of unstable neurobiologic responses requires constant observation and monitoring. Nursing interventions should focus on restoration of adaptive neurobiologic responses while providing for safety and well being (Moller & Murphy, 1995).(1) Assess and monitor health status and medications. (2) Identify symptoms of relapse and/or factors that increase symptoms. (3) Assist in management of delusions and hallucinations. (4) Allow for sufficient rest for brain re- sponses to stabilize. (5) Provide a safe, protective, quiet environment. (6) Reduce pressure to perform.(7) Allow client to verbalize fears, concerns. (8) Use clear, concise, concrete communication. (9) Facilitate communication with signifi- cant others. (10) Assist with activities of daily living as needed. (11) Assist with anger, anxiety manage- ment, and problem solving. (12) Simplify decision making. (13) Assess client's risk to self and others. c. Communication\u2014patient may communi-cate in symbols; listen actively for theme. d. Hallucinations(1) Observe patient attending to internal stimuli.(2) Note if patient talks or smiles to himself/herself. (3) Encourage involvement in real conversations and/or structured activities. (4) Administer medication as ordered and observe response. (5) Assess for content of hallucination; if patient is having command hallucina-tions to harm self or others, provide for safety. (6) Utilize judgment when providing for increased levels of observation as pa-tient with command hallucinations may not be able to contract for safety. e. Delusions\u2014delusional individual may have delusions of grandeur, paranoia, or poverty; may think he is a public figure or may believe he is being follo wed by CIA. (1) Do not argue with client or deny be-lief; does not eliminate delusion nor is trust gained by this approach. (2) Focus on reality and talk about reality-oriented issues in order to redirect the client from delusional topics. (3) Accept client's need for belief without actually reinforcing the belief. (4) For paranoid client, it is helpful to as-sign same staff member consistently to build trust. (5) Note stressors or any escalation in anxiety that may precipitate delu-sional thinking; assist individual in anxiety reduction. (6) If client feels food is poisoned, serve food in sealed containers. (7) Paranoid thinking may cause elderly to need assistance with nutrition and hydration. f. Withdrawn behavior(1) Assist with food and fluid intake as well as hygiene. (2) An accepting attitude and uncondi- tional positive regard may decrease sense of isolation. (3) Gradually introduce patient into activities. (4) Give positive reinforcement for participating. (5) Allow time for being alone as well as structure. g. Potential for harm to self(1) Inquire about suicidal thoughts. (2) Create safe environment by removing sharp and other harmful objects. (3) Encourage patient to contract for safety; if command hallucinations 127 Inforrmation Common to Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders as a last resort; may not be used as punishment. (h) If seclusion or restraint is neces-sary: the need for continuing the restrictive intervention must be evaluated within 1 hour through face-to-face contact by the at-tending physician/licensed inde-pendent practitioner (LIP), or a trained and approved registered nurse or physician assistant and the physician/LIP treating that patient must be consulted as soon as possible. (Also see discussion on seclusion and restraint in Chapter 11, page 259.) (i) Protocol for restraints include:i. Position client to prevent aspiration. ii. Glasses, jewelry, shoes, or belts are removed to prevent injury. iii. Constant observation is rec-ommended due to possibil-ity of laryngeal spasms from neuroleptic medications. iv. Range-of-motion to extremi- ties should be performed every two hours and pulses, color, and temperature as-sessed and documented; at risk for thromboembolic events. v. Nursing care includes hydra-tion, nutrition, and attention to elimination. vi. Need for seclusion and/or re-straint must be documented. vii. Assessment is ongoing, and patient may gradu-ally be moved from 5-point restraints to 3-point and 2-point restraints; patient should never be left in only one restraint. viii. Client is released from seclu-sion when behavior is under control and he/she is not in danger of hurting self or others. 3. Psychotherapeutic interventions\u2014maintenancea. In combination with pharmacologic man-agement, a number of psychosocial thera-peutic methods have been successful in promoting independent living, including (Sadock & Sadock, 2007):are present, contracting may not be feasible. h. Social isolation(1) Spend time with patient. (2) Make brief, frequent contacts.(3) Gradually encourage participation in activities. (4) Encourage structure in the day. i. Alteration in nutrition (1) Encourage balanced diet with high fiber. (2) Monitor intake, output, and caloric count when needed. (3) Limit caffeine intake. (4) Provide small, frequent meals. j. Potential for injury (1) Decrease stimulation in environment. (2) Encourage quiet time in room. (3) Promote safe environment. k. Management of violent behavior (1) Violence against self may be in the form of suicide or self-mutilation, particularly if there are command hal-lucinations present. (2) Violence towards others is also possibility. (3) Assess characteristics such as in- creased pacing, clenched fists, tense expression, irritability, agitation, threatening verbalizations. (4) Early intervention is important, keep-ing in mind use of least restrictive measures.(a) Decrease stimulation in the environment. (b) Administer medications per protocol/instruction and observe response. (c) Provide for safe environment by removing dangerous objects. (d) Encourage patient to spend quiet time in room or in quiet room. (e) When approaching patient, do so from the side and not in a direct manner. (f) When efforts to calm and diffuse are not successful, for safety of the patient and others, a show of force may be necessary and is sometimes sufficient in redirect-ing the client and de-escalating a situation. (g) If redirection and medication as well as decrease in stimulation are not effective, and client is at risk of harming self or others, seclu-sion and restraint may be needed 128 Chapter 6 Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders (1) Social skills training (behavioral skills training) used to enhance empathy and rapport with others, improve verbal/nonverbal communication and conversational skills, increase com-fort in recreational and occupational activities (2) Individual therapy (generally some insight into their illness is important to the success of therapy) such as CBT to address cognitive distortions, re-duce distractibility, and correct errors in judgment Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. No evidence that schizophrenia or other psy-chotic disorders are caused by family interac-tion patterns; therefore, family therapy is not used; important that family is involved in care of individual; family is an integral part of treat-ment plan and has best knowledge of indi-vidual's illness and ability to function. 2. Illness affects entire family system including careers, finances, schedules, and social life; problems that recur most frequently are:a. Failure to care for personal needs/hygiene b. Difficulty handling finances c. Withdrawal d. Odd personal habits e. Suicide threats f. Concern for safety of client and family 4. Eliminating blame is important if family mem-bers blame each other; acceptance of illness is first step toward management of illness; ex-pectations of patient should be realistic. 5. Anger may have to be addressed.6. Other questions to consider include:a. Devotion of time to other family members b. Respite for caregiverc. Home care versus boarding home or half-way house 7. Family members require education and in-struction; discharged client may require rein-tegration within family and role shifting may occur; nurse should assess family attitudes to-ward client, overall atmosphere in family, and available emotional/social supports. 8. Some aspects of family life have been linked to relapse in schizophrenia; concept of expressed emotion is implicated; three main compo-nents of expressed emotion are: criticism, hostility, and over-involvement; for individuals with schizophrenia with high expressed emo-tion, there is a higher probability of relapse (Haber, 1997). 9. Family needs to be educated on the role of stress in the exacerbation of symptoms.10. Environment for medication compliance is also important; 70% relapse rate if medications are not taken regularly and 30% relapse rate if medication regimen is followed. 11. Family members can be taught to recognize symptoms that may require medication ad-justment or hospitalization. 12. Family can provide responsibilities for client, such as simple chores, to introduce a sense of routine and accomplishment. 13. Family should encourage participation in vo-cational rehabilitation and other therapeutic activities. 14. Role of the Psychiatric/Mental Health Ad- vanced Practice Nurse (PMH-CNS & PMHNP)a. Various roles exist in advanced PMH nurs- ing practice related to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management, and com-bined pharmacologic management and psychotherapy (as allowed by state law/nurse practice act). b. Psychotherapeutic actions of the ad-vanced practice nurse may include:(1) Help client and family learn more about illness, treatment options, and ways to live with disease in a produc-tive fashion. (2) Plan psychoeducational approaches that maximize times when client symptoms are relatively stable. (3) Simplify instruction, reduce distract-ing stimuli, provide both visual and verbal information, and provide instruction in small segments with frequent reinforcement (Moller & Murphy, 1995). (4) Initiate family education that accen-tuates the family's belief in their own expertise, and focuses on symptom management and self-care skills for client. (5) Discuss with client and family, ra-tionale for selection of medication regimen, options available, expected benefits, side effects and time lag in response. (6) Establish a partnership with client, family members, and other health care professionals to develop treat-ment and rehabilitative goals. (7) Provide case management that may include any/all of the following:(a) Identifying and coordinating services (b) Understanding appropriate use of day treatment programs, club-house programs, and companion 129 Questions 8. Transportation services are key resources to promote access. 9. Psychiatric home care: a. Allows for careful identification and moni- toring of target symptoms and relapse prevention. b. Promotes involvement of client in self-assessment. c. Focuses on attainment of specific goals related to rehabilitation and maximization of functional ability. d. Nurse in psychiatric home care is essen-tially a \"guest\" in client's home, which is an empowering position for the client and family and supports process of continuing outpatient care for persistent but treatable mental illness. e. Nurse in psychiatric home care uses a rehabilitative model that supports client self-care and develops appropriate goals for successful, feasible outcomes that are compatible with the limitations of illness and abilities of client.

Mood disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders diagnosed in the general population (17% lifetime prevalence rate); 50% of suicides are associated with depression. 2. Major depressive episode prevalance is 12% lifetime, 6.7% one year. 3. Bipolar illness prevalence is , 1% lifetime, 2.6% one year. 4. Dysthymia prevalence is 5% lifetime, 1.5% one year. Sex distribution males 2:12. Bipolar Disorder\u2014equal male-female distribu- tion; women have higher rate of depressive episodes and rapid cycling (4 or more manic episodes in 12-month period)Mood disorders\u2014overview \u0088 Sadock, 2007)\u2014Mood dis-orders are characterized by mood disturbances on a continuum from depression to mania (See Table 7-1). Mood is an internally experienced feeling tone, distinguished from affect, which is an exter - nal expression of the internal feeling tone.1. Generally involves single or recurring de-pressive (unipolar) and/or manic (bipolar) episodes 2. Also occurs as part of other nonmood condi- tions (anxiety, cognitiv e, eating, psychotic, or substance-related disorders) 3. Occurs as a consequence of nonpsychiatric medical conditions (cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes, cancer, acquired immunode-ficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic fatigue syn-drome (CFS), fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis (MS)) or as a consequence of some medica-tions or their combined use. 4. Levels of severity include: a. Mild\u2014limited symptomatology beyond those needed for diagnosis b. Moderate\u2014intermediate severity between mild and severe c. Severe without psychotic features\u2014most of the diagnostic criteria have been met, and these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning d.

With seasonal pattern (Seasonal Affective Disorder)\u2014regular temporal relationship between the onset of an episode of Major De-pression or Bipolar Disorder, recurrent during a particular period of the year; in the absence of obvious seasonal stressor such as regular winter unemployment; full remissions or a change from depression to hypomania or ma-nia also occur at a characteristic time of the year 3. With atypical features\u2014characterized by the following features:a. Mood brightening during positive events (mood reactivity) b. Increased appetite (and possible weight gain) c. Increased sleep (hypersomnia) d. Feeling weighed down (leaden paralysis)e. Persistent pattern of interpersonal rejec- tion sensitivity 4. With postpartum onset\u2014depressive episode, ranging from moderate to severe, following Age distribution 1. Onset of Bipolar Disorder is earlier (childhood to age 50) than for major depressive episode. 2. Mean age of onset is 30 years for Bipolar Disorder. 3. Mean age of onset is 40 years for Depressive Disorder (evidence suggests a younger onset age among those involved in substance use). Other etiologic factors 1. Both Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder occur less frequently among those involved in close interpersonal relationships. 2. Higher incidence of Bipolar Disorder exists among noncollege graduates of higher socio-economic status (no relationship for Depres-sive Disorder). 3. Depressive Disorder is more common in rural vs urban areas. depressive disorders \u0088 Major Depression (unipolar, endogenous/depression in absence of external stress) Definition\u2014Depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities (anhedonia) and associated symptoms for a period of at least 2 weeks, persisting and representing a change from previous functioning; can be mild, moderate or severe, with or without psychotic features; occurs in the absence of manic features.

Recent genetics studies have focused on iden- tifying specific susceptibility genes for mood disorders. Linkage studies suggest the involve-ment of several specific genes (from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=Gene)a. Depression\u2014chromosomes 2, 5, 11, and 17 have been implicated.(1) (also known as: 5HTT, 5-HTTLPR, SERT) on that transports The encoded protein termi- nates the action of serotonin and recy-cles it. A repeat length polymorphism in the promoter of this gene has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin uptake and may play a role in depres-sive symptoms. (2) BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) on chromosome 11\u2014may play a role in the regulation of stress response and in the biology of mood disorders. b. Mania\u2014chromosomes 5, 10, 11, and 13 have been implicated.(1) DAOA (D-amino acid oxidase acti- vator) on chromosome 13\u2014poly-morphisms in this gene have been implicated in susceptibility to Schizo-phrenia and Bipolar Affective Disor - der, possibly due to decreased levels of D-serine and decreased NMDA receptor functioning. (2) BDNF (see depression, 2.c above) 3. Neurotransmitter hypothesesa. Imbalances in cells (e.g., serotonin (5 HT), dopamine other modulating neurohormones, acetyl-choline and gamma acetyl buteric acid (GABA); the feedback between messen-ger hormones and target organs suggest many types of defective neuroendocrine secretion b. Overactivity of the limbic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (LHPA) leading to hypercortisolism 4. Circadian rhythm hypothesis a. A disturbance in regulation of biologic rhythms that synchronize body functions is congruent with rhythmical cyclical na-ture of mood disorders. b. Depressed individuals may be in a chronic state of sleep satiety (arousal) leading to REM sleep abnormalities. Involves: 1. Behavior changes 2. Anxiety3. Insomnia4. Anorexia5. Expression of anger, helplessness, or hopelessness 6. Giving away personal possessions, closing bank accounts 7. Sudden calmness or improvement in a de- pressed client 8. Questions about guns, poisons, or other lethal instruments 9. Social withdrawal/isolation (physical or social)10. Stress (e.g., loss of health, significant other, job) 11. Feelings of worthlessness (e.g., everyone would be better off without me) Lethality of suicide threat\u2014direct relationship with the risk of death from suicide gesture1. Low lethality\u2014low death risk (holding breath, superficial cutting of wrists) 2. Moderate lethality\u2014moderate death risk (overdose of drug or toxic agent) 3. High lethality\u2014death is likely (hanging, gun-shot, driving into a train) Risk factors related to suicide: 1. Caucasian/White race2. Male gender 3. Advanced Age (3:1 risk for $75 years)4. Current depression5. Living alone/Isolation6. Lethality of suicide plan 7. Previous suicidal behavior8. Presence of psychotic symptoms9. Physical illness10. Hopelessness 11.

Data consistently demonstrate high concor - dance rates among first-degree relatives of people with unipolar depression and Bipolar Disorder and among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins\u2014the more family members affected with a mood disorder, the more likely other first-degree family members will be affected.143 Screening Instruments Acetylcholine may be involved in short- ened REM latency in depression (phase advance of circadian rhythms) leading to advances in cortisol secretion (which normally surges in early morning to pre-pare for wakefulness). c. Depressed individuals may dispense ear - lier with central nervous system (CNS) programs that promote vegetative func-tions or overcome the restraints of arousal systems sooner than nondepressed individuals. d. The phase delay hypothesis posits that for individuals with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), circadian rhythms occur at a later time relative to sleep onset and temperature, and predicts an antidepres-sant response to morning photo-therapy. This shifts the onset of melatonin produc-tion and secretion to an earlier time in the evening, which results in a correction of the disrupted relationship between sleep, temperature, and circadian rhythms. e. Bipolar patients in the manic phase may have phase shifting, loss of patterning, and disorders of amplitude. diaGnostiC studies/tests \u0088 General recommendation\u2014General medical evaluation with standard laboratory tests to rule out medical cause(s) of mood symptoms, as well as thyroid function tests (some thyroid illness is present in 8% of patients with depres-sive disorders), and toxicology screening (when substance-related effects are known/suspected); there are no definitive tests for mood disorders. While the clinical utility of the following tests is unknown, they have received attention in the literature:1. The dexamethasone suppression test (DMST) has been suggested as a useful test for depression; limited support for clinical use of this test has been reported. Underly - ing premise: dexamethasone is an exog-enous steroid that suppresses blood levels of cortisol. Based on the premise that many depressed patients exhibit hypersecretion of cortisol, a single (11 p.m.) dose of cortisol does not depress late afternoon cortisol lev-els. If t he postdexamethasone cortisol level is 5 mg/mL, then it has escaped suppression, and support is added for a diagnosis of bio-logic depression. 2. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are thought to be useful in differentiating unipolar from bipolar disorders and mania from Schizophrenia. 3. Urinary MHPG\u2014A major crosses the blood-brain barrier, its CNS activity can be estimated by measur - ing MHPG elimination in urine (peripheral MHPG is also secreted in urine); proposed that patients with low MHPG have less norepinephrine to metabolize and would respond to antidepressants that block norepi-nephrine reuptake; patients with normal or high NE levels may have a serotonin deficient depression and may respond to drugs that block serotonin reuptake. 4. Sleep EEG (REM latency measurement)\u2014sleep EEGs indicate that depressed patients spend less time in the more refreshing slow-wave phases of sleep and have a shorter pre-REM phase (decreased REM latency) of 2-30 min-utes versus 90 minutes. sCreeninG instruMents \u0088 Patient self-report questionnaires 1.

Table 7-10 \u0084 Lithium Side Effects & Nursing Interventions Side Effect Symptom Nursing Intervention Polyuria, with possible progression to Type II diabetes Urine output is large in volume and so dilute that it may be colorless.Reassure client that increased urination is common and benign. Client may complain of urinating so frequently that it interferes with activities of daily living, including sleep.Urine volume may diminish if the physician reduces the lithium dose or changes to a slow-release form or a single daily dosage. When severe, the physician usually orders 24-hour urine volume. If volume is greater than 3 L, a further renal workup is usually requested. When severe, polyuria is often treated by the physician with a thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretic (taking care to reduce the lithium dose). Lithium is contraindicated for clients with renal dysfunction. Increased thirst Recommend that clients quench their thirst and maintain a fairly stable intake of liquids from day to day. The best thirst quencher is water or a low-calorie beverage that will not cause weight gain when taken in large amounts. Gum or hard candies may help moisten the mouth. (continues)151 Interventions Table 7-10 \u0084 Lithium Side Effects & Nursing Interventions (continued) Side Effect Symptom Nursing Intervention Tremor\u2014a fine tremor that worsens with intentional movements. It can make writing, drinking hot beverages, and many other motor tasks difficult.Reassure that this is benign and may be temporary. In some clients it is persistent. The physician may order a reduction in dose, more frequent doses, or a change to a slow-release form. When the tremor is severe or incapacitating, the physician may treat it with a beta blocker, usually propranolol (Inderal). Recommend that the client reduce or eliminate caffeine-containing beverages. Nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, or soft stoolsReassure that this is benign and usually temporary. Recommend that the client take lithium with meals, a glass of milk, or a snack. If symptoms persists, the physician may change to another lithium preparation. Muscle weakness or fatigue Reassure that this is benign and usually temporary. Since this is not a very common side effect of lithium, ascertain whether it is being caused by another medication being taken by the client. Encourage the client to remain active and get regular physical exercise. If symptom persists, the physician may reduce the dose, order more frequent divided doses, change to slow-release, or reduce the dose and more gradually increase to the present dose level. Edema of the feet or other body parts Reassure that this is benign and may be temporary. A moderate salt restriction may reduce the edema. If moderate salt restriction is undertaken, the serum lithium level usually rises somewhat. It then becomes necessary to monitor for signs of toxicity and keep the physician informed in case it becomes necessary to reduce the lithium dose. Hypothyroidism (5%) Explain that this is reversible and treatable. The physician usually orders thyroid hormone replacement, such as levothyroxine (Synthroid) or desiccated thyroid. Weight gain (60%) Explain that this is fairly common and benign. Moderate calorie restriction and increased exercise usually help. Advise against fluid restriction or sodium restriction unless undertaken with knowledge of the physician and nurse, since either intervention can cause the serum lithium level to rise. Hair thinning or loss Explain that this may be temporary. Since hair loss can be a symptom of hypothyroidism, inform the physician so that thyroid function can be checked. If hair does not return, lithium is usually stopped so that hair can regrow. During periods of hair loss, encourage the client to consider wearing a wig. Benign, reversible granulocytosis Explain that this is benign. This side effect is the basis for its use as a treatment in some granulocytopenic conditions. Decreased libido Suggest timing sexual activity to not coincide with peak action time of medication.Explore strategies for continuing relationship intimacy. Moller, M. (1998). Mood disorders. In C.

Client education guildelines (1) Assess patient and family anxiety level and ability to understand.Syndrome (SS)\u2014a potentially fatal phe-nomenon usually resulting from drug-drug interactions (severe risk when SSRIs are combined with MAOIs, lithium, trypto- phan, Sadock & Sadock, 2007)(1) Most frequent signs and symptoms of SS are:(a) Mental status changes such as confusion or hypomania (b) Agitation or restlessness(c) Myoclonis (d) Hyperthermia (e) Diaphoresis(f) Abdominal Headache (i) Tremor(j) Ataxia or incoordination(k) Hyperreflexia (2) Treatment interventions for SS consist of removing the offending agent(s) and prompt treatment of all associ-ated symptoms, which may include nitroglycerine, cyproheptadine, ben-zodiazepines, anticonvulsants, cool-ing blankets, mechanical ventilation, and paralyzing agents (Sadock & Sa-dock, 2007). (3) Note also that abr upt discontinuation of SSRIs can lead to SSRI withdrawal, also called Discontinuation Syndrome (DS)\u2014rare with fluoxetine.(a) Signs and symptoms of DS in- clude dizziness, weakness, flu-like symptoms, headache, anxiety, cognitive dulling, and recurrence of depressive symptoms (rebound depression) (b) To avoid DS slowly taper most SSRIs when discontinuing Electroconvulsive therapy (Sadock & Sadock, 2007) 1. Mechanism of action\u2014Much of the research has focused on changes in neurotransmitter receptors and second-messenger systems\u2014every neurotransmitter system is affected, but like antidepressants, a of ECTs leads to downregulation of post-synaptic beta- adrenergic receptors. 2. Indications a. Most common indication for ECT is Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). b. Emergency therapy for suicidal or hyper-active clients who are in physical danger is indicated.153 Interventions priate and are unacceptable to the superego. (3) The person may develop a pattern of containing angry/aggressive feelings and directing them inward against the self leading to self-hatred. (4) Suicide is viewed as a strike against the hated and loved object as well as the self; manic episode is viewed as a defense against depression. Interpersonal interventions 1. Objectivesa. Insuring safety with reduced potential for self-harm b. Increasing appropriate expression of thoughts and feelings c. Increasing self-esteem and social interaction 2.

Increase self-esteem. (1) Schedule regular sessions with client.(2) Accept negativism without judgment.(3) Minimize time focused on real or per-ceived failures. (4) Focus on identifying strengths and accomplishments. (5) Collaborate with client in identifying factors maintaining low self-esteem. Cognitive interventions 1. Theoretical foundations a. Depression is a cognitive problem origi- nating from disturbed thinking in which the depression-prone person explains an adverse event as a personal shortcoming. b. Developmental experiences sensitize cer - tain people and make them vulnerable to depression. The constellation of negative thoughts that characterizes depression remains dormant until a person becomes depressed. When depression occurs after a life stressor, the dormant cognitive set (2) Individualize amount of information shared (i.e., treatment, post-ECT con-fusion, memory loss, etc.). (3) Provide time to discuss concerns and answer questions. (4) Instruct accompanying adult in dealing with the following post-ECT effects:(a) Orienting to time, place, and person (b) Headache (c) Nausea Other brain stimulation interventions (Sadock & Sadock, 2007)1. Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation\u2014 a noninvasive that cells of the cerebral cortex 2. Vagal nerve stimulation\u2014stimulation of the left vagus nerve through a multiprogrammable bipolar pulse generator implanted in the left chest wall 3. Deep brain stimulation\u2014involves creating a small hole in the skull into which small wire is passed into the selected brain regions; the wire is attached to a pacemaker device implanted in the chest wall and the pace maker is used to stimulate the selected brain region. 4. Psychosurgery\u2014involved surgery to modify areas of the brain; goal is to reduce symptoms of severely ill patients who have not responded to less invasive treatment interventions. Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Psychoanalytic theory a. Object loss hypothesis\u2014Infants experi- encing loss of the maternal love object in infancy experience separation anxiety and grief related to loss of the primary love ob-ject; early loss is thought to predispose the adult to respond abnormally to losses that occur later in life, becoming depressed significantly more often than those not experiencing such early losses. b. Aggression-turned-inward hypothesis\u2014 depression is proposed to be a turning inward of the aggressive instinct that is not directed at the appropriate object, with accompanying feelings of guilt.(1) This process is initiated by loss of an object toward whom a person feels love and hate (ambivalence). (2) The person is unable to express the angry feelings because they are thought to be irrational or inappro-154 Chapter 7 Mood Disorders (2) Considers attention span, distractibil- ity and motivation.

Involve clients in the following activities: (1) Assertiveness training(2) Role playing(3) Social skills training(4) Stress Relaxation exercises(6) Meditation (7) Physical fitness/exercise d. Increase client's present versus past or fu- ture orientation. Hopelessness theory of depression (learned helplessness)1. Based on attribution theory\u2014a chain of per-ceived negative life events are hypothesized to be the \"occasion setter\" for people to become hopeless and depressed. 2. Depression consists of four classes of defi- cits: motivational, cognitive, self-esteem, and affective. 3. Three types of influences determine whether a person will become hopeless, and, in turn depressed, when negative life events are experienced:a. When highly desired outcomes are be- lieved improbable or when highly aversive outcomes are perceived probable, and the person anticipates that no response in his or her repertoire will positively affect the outcome (helplessness), depression occurs. b. When negative life events are attributed to stable versus unstable and global versus specific causes, and are viewed as impor-tant, helplessness, low self-esteem, and depression ensue. c. Inferred negative consequences are most likely to lead to depression. The consequence is viewed as important, not remediable, likely to change, and af-fecting many areas of life. When inferred characteristics about the self (self-worth, abilities, desirability, etc.) are negative and will interfere with attainment of important outcomes, hopelessness and depression may ensue. 4. Improvement of depression is contingent upon one's perceived control and mastery of their environment.appears; negative cognitive processes re-place objective thinking. c. Cognitive elements of depression (1) Cognitive triad\u2014the person's negative view of self, the world and the future, which is a distortion of reality (2) Silent assumptions\u2014irrational beliefs or rules that significantly affect the de-pressed person's cognitive, affective, and behavior patterns (3) Logical errors\u2014faulty information processing and errors in thinking that maintain the person's belief in the validity of his/her negative concept despite contradictory evidence 2. Objectivesa. Increasing client's sense of control over his/her goals/behavior b. Increasing self-esteemc. Assisting client in modifying negative expectations 3. Guidelinesa. Assist in exploring feelings to elicit pa- tient's view of problem(s). b. Assist client in identifying negative thoughts. c. Accept client perceptions, not conclusions. d. Teach thought interruption or substitution. e. Encourage client to increase realistic thinking by appraising personal as-sets, strengths, accomplishments, and opportunities. f. Encourage formulation of realistic versus unrealistic goals. Behavioral interventions 1. Objectives (1) Activating clients in a realistic goal- directed way (2) Developing alternative problem- solving and coping strategies (3) Increasing self-esteem(4) Instilling hope(5) Increasing client responsibility for change (6) Gradual redirection of self- preoccupation to interests in outside world 2. Guidelinesa. Assess client strengths and weaknesses and personal and environmental factors that maintain depression. b. Work with client to develop a structured daily program of activities that:(1) Considers probability of succeeding.155 Interventions Group approaches 1. Devise a structured plan of therapeutic activi- ties that considers client's level of depression or mania. 2. Encourage attendance at group sessions and activities. 3.

Developmental experiences within the family system (abuse, conflict, divorce, death) can be antecedents of depression.a. Nodal events (significant exits and entries of people, places, objects, activities, and roles in a family system), especially those perceived as undesirable, can precipitate depression, especially when an event gen-erates stress or anxiety not openly dealt with in the family system. b. Multiple nodal events occurring within a brief period may escalate the likelihood of stress (cluster stress) and depression. c. Anniversary reactions (affective responses around anniversary of nodal event), which reactivate feelings associated with original nodal event, can take form of depression, suicidal thoughts, gestures, attempts, and other stress-related symptoms. d. Family precursors of mood disorders include early developmental family ex-periences related to strong nurturing in early childhood followed by cutting off of nurturing supplies in early childhood, coupled with unrealistic expectations, unquestioning acceptance of parental val-ues, and frustrated efforts to obtain family approval and love. Underlying resentment toward parents may erupt briefly, fol-lowed by quiet and fear of rejection. Manic episode masks guilt, loss, and rejection. Depressive episode represents internal-ization of disappointment, loss, and per-ceived failure. 2. Objectivesa. Increasing functional family interaction patterns b. Increasing family effectiveness in coping with grief, loss, stress 3. Family education, including: c. Community resources (medical, social, vocational, support groups) d.

Carl W., 60 years old, has been hospitalized on a medical unit for various aches and pains he has been experiencing for several weeks. He feels depressed, tense, and unable to sleep at night. In talking to the nurse, he reveals that his wife died 8 months ago, and he has not adjusted to the loss. To maximize the opportunity to deter-mine the extent of Mr. W.'s bereavement versus depression, the nurse should: a.

The nurse would probably give her which of the following diagnoses? a. Dysthymia b. Double depression c. Depression, recurrent type d. Depression, melancholic type 13. Karen K. called the office of the advanced practice PMH nurse in private practice saying she had to have an appointment now or she was going to fall apart. During the assessment interview, Karen described herself as becoming increasingly depressed following the birth of her first child 9 months ago in April. At first she felt blue, then increasingly despondent, sleeping a lot, hardly able to get out of a chair, crying all the time. She is now fearful that she might hurt the baby if she doesn't get some help. The advanced practice nurse would prob-ably give her which diagnosis? a. Major Depression b.

Blanche, 26 years old, is admitted to the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, manic episode. She is brought in by her husband, who states that she was fine until 3 days before admission. At that time she decided to plan a huge high school reunion and began calling all her classmates. Her speech became louder, more rapid, and insulting when the idea was not greeted with enthusiasm. Yesterday she went on a shopping spree and charged clothing worth $7000. This morning she went into her husband's office and began reorganizing his files. She became quite agitated, and her husband brought her to the emergency room. In assessing Blanche, the nurse is aware that the manic episode is in reality an: a. Attempt to block unconscious feelings of depression b. Incorrect interpretation of environmental stimuli c. Exaggerated response to an elating situation d. Uncontrolled acting out of uncensored id drives 26. Laurie M., age 32, is married and is a very suc-cessful attorney. She and her husband have a Victorian house they have restored. They ski, play tennis, and have an active social life. Yet Laurie reports feeling depressed all the time. She perceives herself as \"never measuring up.\" Despite having friends, she thinks they are only nice to her because they like her husband. She never enjoys the sports she does, because she never performs as well as she thinks she should. According to cognitive theory, Laurie's symptoms are most likely related to:Mrs. King heard a shot from the basement and found Mr. King bleeding from a superficial chest wound. To assess Mr. King's current potential for suicide, the nurse should: a. Ask Mr. King why he feels like killing himself b. Observe Mr. King for scars on his wrists or other signs of previous attempts c. Ask Mrs. King about any previous suicide attempts or threats by Mr. King d. Determine if there is a family history of suicide 18. To further assess Mr. King's suicide potential, the advanced practice PMH nurse should be particu-larly alert to his expression of: a.

Developmental trauma 28. Ted H., age 26, dropped out of college once, failed out twice, and currently works nights as a janitor in a factory. Both Ted and his family regard him as the family disappointment. Ted calls the mental health clinic because he feels depressed and very worried that he is going to lose his job. He states that his company is laying people off, and despite good evaluations, he knows that he will, as usual, be one of the unlucky who get fired. According to the Hopelessness Theory of Depression, the psychiatric and mental health advanced practice nurse understands that Ted's symptoms are most likely to occur when negative life events are perceived to be: a. Stable, global, important b. Unstable, global, important c. Stable, specific, important d. Unstable, global, important 29. Ted's ability to affect the outcome of potentially negative life events, like losing his job, is per-ceived by him to be: a. Nonexistent b. Low c. Moderate d. High 30. Fran S., age 57, is brought to the hospital Emergency Department by her daughter. She sits crying in a chair saying, \"How much can a person take? I cannot take anymore.\" Her daughter reports that Mrs. S.'s husband was killed in a car accident 3 years ago, and her 80-year-old mother was diagnosed with Alzheimers last year. Six months ago, her son revealed that he is homosexual and last week told the family that he has been HIV positive for 3 years and was just diagnosed as having Kaposi's sarcoma. Since that time, Fran has been mute other than when she is crying and mut-tering. She refuses to eat, bathe, or change her clothes. She has not slept more than 3 hours a night and says she just wants to crawl under a cover and not come out. The psychiatric and mental health advanced practice nurse understands that Fran's depression may be precipitated by: a. Cluster stress events b. Anniversary reaction c. Stress reaction d. Lack of social support 31. If Fran S. began to feel depressed around the time of year when her husband was killed, this would be called a(n): a. Nodal event b. Stress reaction c.

There are no medications yielding efficacious results in treating Anorexia Nervosa. There is limited evidence of success with cyprohep-tadine (Periactin) and amitriptyline (Elavil). There is additional evidence for effectiveness of medications used to address associated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and agita-tion. In Anorexia Nervosa, patients can be concerned about the side effect of weight gain associated with any medication; this topic must be addressed sensitively. 2. Antidepressants have been effective in ad-dressing symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa. SSRIs (specifically fluoxetine) have the highest em-pirical support and lowest side effect profile for these patients.168 ChaptEr 8 Behavioral Syndromes and Disorders of Adult Personality c.

Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Origins a. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Dis- order\u2014develops from excessive parental disapproval and control, which may cause the child to stifle emotional expression (especially anger), and focus on the details of childhood tasks, attempting to be per-fect as a way to win the approval of critical, over-controlling, and perhaps obsessional parents. b. Dependent Personality Disorder\u2014devel- ops from under-indulgence and ongoing reinforcement patterns during the oral stage; family environments inhibit expres-sion of feelings and exhibit high control; excessive dependence may represent a reaction formation against the expression of hostility or assertiveness; cultural and social factors contribute to excessive de-pendence in women and minorities c. Avoidant Personality Disorder\u2014children who are rejected, belittled, and censured by their parents may develop feelings of self-depreciation and social alienation. 2. Psychotherapeutic interventionsa. Psychotherapy\u2014treatment of choice: focus on the client's feelings rather than intellectualized thoughts b. Cognitive therapy\u2014to address faulty thinking c.

Complete neurological workup (including electroencephalogram DisorDers \u0088 Overview (Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014Cognition in- volves memory, orientation, judgment, language, the ability to engage in interpersonal relationships and problem solving, and performing actions and abstractions (proverb interpretation). Cognitive disorders are associated with or caused by distur-bance in the physiological functioning of brain tissue\u2014structural, hormonal, biochemical, electri-cal, etc.\u2014which causes cognitive deficits; ranges along continuum from acute (Delirium) to chronic (Dementia of the Alzheimer's type). Delirium Definition\u2014A transient (short-term), reversible, state of confusion, resulting from a gross disrup-tion in brain physiology and developing from a wide variety of factors (Lipowski, 1992); although symptoms are similar in their disturbance of con-sciousness and cognition, the delirium disorders are differentiated on etiology (Delirium Due to a General Medical Condition, Substance-Induced Delirium, Delirium Due to Multiple Etiologies, and Delirium Not Otherwise Specified) (American Psy-chiatric Association [APA], 2000); can progress to permanent dementia if identifying causes are not diagnosed and treated. Signs and symptoms (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock 2007)1. Disturbance of consciousness 2. Change in cognition (memory deficit)9 Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing 188 Chapter 9 Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing Nursing diagnoses\u2014several of the 2009-2011 NANDA International (2009) nursing diagnoses can be applied to delirium, including:1. Insomnia 2. Behavior, risk-prone health 3. Coping, ineffective 4. Self-Care Deficit, bathing 5. Self-Care Deficit, dressing 6. Confusion, acute 7. Memory, impaired 8. Sensory Perception, disturbed (specify) 9. Social Interaction, impaired Biologic origins\u2014delirium can be attributed to a wide range of physical disorders ranging from met-abolic disturbances to withdrawal from substances such as alcohol or sedative-hypnotic agents (APA, 2000).1. Risk factors associated with delirium (Sadock & Sadock, 2007)a. Severity of illness\u2014the more severe the illness, the more likely delirium will occur. b. Age and gender\u2014more common in males; the older the patient, the more likely de-lirium will occur; persons older than age 70 are most vulnerable. c. Cognitive impairment or preexisting brain damage/disease (tumors, traumatic brain injury, dementia)\u2014approximately 25% to 50% of patients diagnosed with Dementia have been found to have Delirium super-imposed upon the Dementia. d. Diabetes e. Hearing or visual impairment f. Malnutrition g. Systemic infection h. Substance-use disorder (alcohol, nicotine, or narcotics) 2. The following are common causes of (Keltner, Schwecke, & Bostrom, associated with Delirium b. Substance-related intoxication, with-drawal, or toxicity\u2014alcohol, medications (particularly those with anticholinergic properties, such as benztropine), or other substances have been implicated in Delirium. c. Certain drugs have been implicated in the development of Delirium, particularly in older persons. Drugs that can cause de-lirium include anticholinergics, antihista-mines, antidepressants (tertiary TCAs), and low potency antipsychotics (Videbeck, 2006).3. Complete battery of limited to: blood chemistries, CBC, serologic tests for syphilis, HIV antibody test, urinalysis, blood and urine drug screen, and thyroid profile 4. Additional testing, when indicated, includes: B12 levels, CT scan, and MRI (Sadock & Sadock, 2007) 5. Use of screening instruments such as:a. Delirium Rating Scale (Trzepacz, Baker, & Greenhouse, 1988) b. Intensive Care Delirium Screening Check-list (Bergeron, Dubois, Dumont, Dial, & Skrobik, impair-ment with lucid intervals 2. Inability to maintain attention or engage in goal-directed behavior; difficulty following questions upon examination; client may per-severate in response to earlier questions 3. Disorganization of thought\u2014difficulty main-taining coherent stream of thought, easily distracted; speech rambling, inconsequential, or illogical; faulty reasoning and lack of goal-directed behavior 4. Perceptual disturbances\u2014illusions, hallucina-tions, delusions may be present, but generally poorly organized; can suffer acute paranoid delusions accompanied by fear, anxiety, at-tempts to escape or destructive rage episodes 5. Impairment in the level of consciousness\u2014 client falls asleep during the interview 6. Disturbed sleep-wake cycle\u2014hypervigilantt during the night and sleeps during the day 7. Abnormally increased or decreased psycho-motor activity; may pick at the bed linen or be sluggish, resembling catatonia-like movements; three clinical patterns possible (Lipowski,1992):a. Hypoalert\u2014hypoactive client who is le-thargic and drowsy b. Hyperalert\u2014hyperactive client who is restless and agitated c. Mixed variant\u2014shifting between lethargy and agitation 8. Disorientation (place, time, and/or person)\u2014disorientation to place and time is very com-mon; however, disorientation to person is rare 9. Memory impairment\u2014usually short-term memory impairment and both anterograde (memory for events just prior to onset of de-lirium) and retrograde (memory for events just after the episode) amnesia present 10. Appears bewildered, and may be anxious and frightened189 Cognitive Disorders dose of 2 to 6 mg of haloperidol, repeated in hourly intervals if patient remains agi-tated. Switch to oral dose when calm (a daily divided dose of 5 to 40 mg PO may be needed in patients with delirium). b. Droperidol (has a more rapid onset of se-dation than haloperidol)\u2014monitoring of the electrocardiogram is advised with this alternative. c. Atypical antipsychotic agents may be use-ful (avoid ziprasidone (Geodon) due to activating effects). 3. Treat insomnia when present.a. Short- or intermediate-acting benzodiaz-epines (e.g., lorazepam, 1 to 2 mg PO at bedtime) are considered to be first-line agents in treating insomnia in delirious patients. 4. Avoid barbiturates and long-acting benzodiaz-epines unless they are being used to treat the underlying cause of delirium, such as alcohol withdrawal or seizures. Psychosocial approaches 1. Attend to the client's concerns and fears, which may be expressed in the hallucinations and/or delusions (Lipowski, 1992). 2. Reorient the client to reality, especially when illusions are present. 3. Reduce fear and anxiety by providing a calm reassuring manner, assuring the client that you will be sure he is safe. 4. Explain all procedures to minimize anxiety. 5. If client is extremely agitated, the use of physi-cal restraints is not recommended since they may increase fear and agitation along with increasing the risk of problems associated with immobility. The use of \"sitters\" or enlisting the family's help is more efficacious. Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Involve the family in assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation of the nursing care plan. 2. Family can provide useful information as to the client's premorbid cognitive status, the possible causative factor of the delirium, his-tory of the client and other critical data. 3. Family can assist in planning psychoso-cial interventions that are likely to be most successful. 4. Family can assist in interventions by helping to orient and reassure the client. 5. Family needs to be provided with information and reassurance along with referral informa-tion for use postdelirium.d. Systemic illness (such as infection, trauma, heart failure, malnourishment)\u2014urinary infection is a common culprit in the development of delirium in older or catheterized patients. e. Hepatic functioning that decreases with normal aging; drugs have been shown to have a longer half-life and decreased plasma clearance. Drugs that require a high rate of hepatic extraction should be used judiciously (e.g., major tranquilizers, tricyclic and antiarrhyth-mic of any interven- tion are to treat the underlying cause, and to pro-vide physical, sensory, and environmental support.1. Treatment of the underlying cause(s) (Sadock & Sadock, 2007):a. Restore adequate fluid and electrolyte bal-ance, nutrition, and vitamin supply (Lip-owski, 1992; St. Pierre, 1996). b. Eliminate medication(s) suspected of af-fecting mental status. c. Treat toxicity as indicated\u2014if toxicity from anticholinergics is suspected, the use of physostigmine reverses the delirium for 15 to 30 minutes following a 1 to 2 mg intravenous dose (repeated doses may be needed). d. Treat withdrawal from substances.(1) Alcohol withdrawal delirium develops after recent cessation or reduction of alcohol consumption. (2) Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment choice for delirium associ-ated with initially 0.25 mg PO/IM/IV , every 6 to 8 hours\u2014caution when liver damage is present) (Meagher & Leonard, 2008). (2) May need to replace thiamine and other vitamins to prevent permanent organic disorder due to deficiency. 2. Treat psychosis when present.a. Haloperidol\u2014most commonly used sedative because of low anticholinergic side effects, quick sedation, and low inci-dence of orthostatic (Tune & Ross, Lipowski, 1992); potential for extrapyramidal symptoms such as \"cog-wheel\" rigidity in joints (can be seen in flexing and extending the elbow) and ex-cessive salivation, and dystonic reactions such as torticollis (extreme turning of head to one side with the inability to cor-rect posture). Administer an intramuscular 190 Chapter 9 Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing 6. Family members may exhibit grief reactions such as anger, hostility, bargaining, depres-sion, guilt, avoidance, denial, and ambivalence (Barry, 1996). Group approaches\u2014for delirious clients, group intervention is contraindicated. Milieu interventions 1. Aimed at providing safety, support, and structure 2. Environmental interventions help reestablish orientation by placing clock, calendar, and fa-miliar belongings in the client's room. 3. Encourage family visits to assist patient with orientation. 4. Correct any sensory deficit that the patient may have by having eyeglasses or hearing aid made available and within close reach. 5. Place the client in a room with windows to help orient to day and night. 6. Keep outside, distracting noises to a minimum and keep a low light on at night. 7. Reduce, but don't eliminate stimulation, as sensory deprivation also contributes to delirium. Community resources\u2014not indicated during the acute episode, but may be useful as a referral re-source based on the following factors:1. Etiology of the delirium (i.e., Alcoholics Anon-ymous; Narcotics Anonymous; social support such as senior center, case management, or home health services) 2. Need for the client and/or family to resolve the emotional trauma associated with the acute episode of delirium through participa-tion in individual, group, or family counseling/therapy Dementia Definition\u2014Development of multiple cognitive deficits affecting at least three of the following mental activities: memory, language, visuospatial skills, personality, or emotional state, and execu-tive function; the decline in cognitive functioning causes significant impairment in social or occu-pational functioning, representing a significant decline from a previous level of functioning; does not routinely occur during the course of a delirium (except Vascular Dementia), and are judged to be related to a causative factor. In most cases demen-tias are irreversible (APA, factorsb. Cerebrovascular disease\u2014in particular, stroke and cerebral blood flow problems c. Cerebral oxygenation problems d.

Criteria for the diagnosis of a dementia based on clinical examinationa. Presence of cognitive deficit (APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007)(1) Memory impairment (required for DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of dementia)(a) Impairment in ability to learn new information (b) Forgetting previously learned informationi. Often both forms are present. ii. In later stages, extreme mem-ory impairment is evidenced in inability to recall most or all information (e.g., family member's identity, own birth-day, and sometimes their own name). (2) In addition to memory deficits, the following may be present (at least one is necessary for DS-IV-TR diagnosis of Dementia):(a) Deterioration of language func-tion (aphasia), evidenced by difficulty in recalling names of persons or objects may be present. In advanced stages, in-dividual may be mute, or demon-strate echolalia (repeating what is heard) or palilalia (repeating a sound or word over and over again). (b) Difficulty in carrying out motor function, despite intact motor abilities (apraxia) may be pres-ent. May contribute to difficulties in drawing, cooking, activities of daily living. (c) The inability to recognize or iden-tify objects by name\u2014although sensory abilities are intact (agnosia)\u2014may be present (e.g., 191 Cognitive Disorders tests for syphilis, HIV antibody test, urinalysis, blood and urine drug screen, B12 and folate level, and thyroid function tests 2.

Blessed Dementia Scale (BLS-D) Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type Definition\u2014This type of dementia is characterized by a gradual and insidious onset and a generally progressive deteriorating course for which all other specific causes have been excluded by the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests (APA, 2000). It is the most prevalent of the dementias and can occur with the following variations:1. Senile or presenile onset, depending on whether after or before age 65 2. Within senile and presenile variants, disease can be with delirium, with delusions, with de-pression, or uncomplicated. Signs and symptoms\u2014characterized by multifac- eted loss of intellectual abilities, such as memory, judgment, abstract thought, and other higher cortical functions; changes in personality and be-havior, and significant decline and impairment in social and occupational functioning (APA, 2000) Differential diagnosis\u2014exclusion of all alternative specific causes of Dementia by complete history, physical examination, and laboratory tests1. Benign forgetfulness\u2014a common phenom-enon among older adults 2. Subdural hematoma 3. Normal pressure hydrocephalus 4. Brain tumors 5. Parkinson's disease 6. Vitamin B12 deficiency 7. Hypothyroidism 8. Delirium 9. Acute psychotic episode 10. Major depressive episode 11. Multi-infarct dementia (See next secton on Vascular Dementia) 12. Medication interactions 13. AIDS dementia complex (ADC)cannot recognize by touch alone, a wristwatch, keys, or pencil when placed in hands). (d) A disturbance in executive func-tioning may be present\u2014as evidenced by impaired abstract thinking, difficulty in shifting from one mental activity to an-other, and problems in perform-ing serial motor skills. b. Information from patient's family, friends, and employers c. Report of change in personality of a per-son older than age 40 suggests consider-ation of Dementia. d. Other information suggesting Dementia includes change in intellectual ability, forgetfulness, efforts to conceal cognitive deficits. 2. Criteria for severity of Dementiaa. Mild\u2014work or social activities are signifi-cantly impaired, however the capacity for independent living, adequate personal hygiene, and reasonable judgment remain intact. b. Moderate\u2014independent living is hazard-ous, and some degree of supervision is necessary. c. Severe\u2014activities of daily living are so impaired that continual supervision is re-quired, (e.g., unable to maintain minimal personal hygiene; largely incoherent or mute).

Clinical or laboratory evidence in support of the diagnosis of vascular dementia includes:a. Since the cause is cerebrovascular disease, focal neurologic signs and symptoms (e.g., exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes are an important diagnostic determinant) b. History of stroke or other cerebrovascu-lar insult; presence of carotid bruits is common 4. A stepwise deteriorating course with \"patchy\" distribution of deficits (affecting some func-tions, but not others) is present early in the course (APA, 2000). 5. Individual can present with delirium, delu-sions, or depression, gait abnormalities, weak-ness of an extremity. Different from other dementias, a diagnosis with the following specifiers is used for vascular dementia (APA, 2000, 2007):a. With delirium b. With delusions c. With depressed mood Differential diagnosis (APA, 2000, 2007) 1. General differential diagnosis of Dementia due to Other General Medical Conditions and De-mentia of the Alzheimer's Type (See previous sections) 2. Impairment due to single stroke Mental status variations\u2014is differentiated from other primary dementias only by the fact that the cognitive manifestations may wax and wane, showing patchy or stepwise deterioration. Biologic origins\u2014cerebrovascular diseases Other Dementias Dementia Due to General Medical Condition (APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)1. Dementia Due to HIV Disease\u2014The presence of dementia in a client with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS. Encephalopathy in HIV is associated with the type of dementia known as AIDS de-mentia complex (ADC) or HIV dementia and occurs in 14% of patients with HIV . 2. Dementia Due to Pick's Disease\u2014character-ized by atrophy in the fronto-temporal regions of the brain (rather than parietal-temporal re-gions associated with Alzheimer's disease). 3. Dementia Due to Traumatic Brain Injury\u2014characterized by emotional lability, speech deficits/dysarthria (slurred, slow, and difficult to understand), and impulsivity\u2014associated Mental status variations\u2014manifestations include: 1. Recent and remote memory deficits 2. Short attention span and inability to concentrate 3. Impairment in abstract thinking and judgment 4. Other disturbances of higher cortical function-ing, such as agnosia, apraxia, aphasia, and constructional Affective lability 6. Perceptual disturbances such as hallucination 7. Depressed mood Genetic/Biologic origins (APA, 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)1. Precise Alzheimer's disease still unknown 2. Hereditary factorsa. Familial patterns exist. b. Genetic markers on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21 have been identified in early-onset (younger than age 60) Alzheimer's disease (AD) c. An increased risk of late-onset AD has been associated with a variant of apoli-poprotein E (APOE) found on chromo-some 19; the risk is specifically associated with the allele APOE-e4 (APOE contains instructions for making the protein that carries cholesterol in the bloodstream) (Alzheimer's Disease Education & Referral (ADEAR) Center, 2008). d. A number of biomarkers are currently un-der investigation. Of specific interest are tau and beta-amyloid proteins\u2014two bio-markers in cerebrospinal fluid (APA, 2007). A recent National Institute on Aging (NIA) study found that participants with APOE-e4 genes, high levels of tau and low levels of beta-amyloid proteins were most likely to have mild AD, and testing for these biomarkers is currently underway (NIA, 2009). Vascular Dementia (also known as multi-infarct dementia) Definition\u2014direct consequence of cerebrovascular disease, characterized by the often abrupt onset of a stepwise deterioration in intellectual functioning that, early in the course, leaves some intellectual functions relatively intact (patchy deterioration) (APA, 2000) Signs and symptoms 1. Symptoms of vascular dementia are largely the same as those found in AD. 2. Multiple cognitive deficits manifested by memory impairment and disturbance in 193 Cognitive Disorders with boxer's \"punch-drunk syndrome\" and combat veterans who have experienced con-cussion and other serious head injuries 4. Dementia Due to Lewy Body Disease\u2014char-acterized by hallucinations, parkinsonian features (resting tremor, bradykinesia, cog-wheeling), and extrapyramidal symptoms; caused by Lewy inclusion bodies in cerebral cortex; attention rather than memory deficits evident early in illness; markedly adverse ef-fects with antipsychotics. 5. Dementia Due to B 12 Deficiency (reversible)\u2014 Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B 12 deficiency. Dementias caused by this deficiency are rare\u2014characterized by parethe-sias of lower, then upper extremities resulting from neuronal demyelinization. Other clinical manifestation of this dementia can include: mood and behavior changes, psychosis, and reflex changes (hypo- and hyper-reflexive). Biological intervention is Vitamin B 12 replace- ment therapy. 6. Dementia Due to Normal Pressure Hydroceph-alus (NPH) (reversible with early treatment)\u2014NPH results when the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal column is impaired. Clinical symptoms of NPH include urinary incontinence, gait apraxia, and de-mentia. The dementia associated with NPH effects one's ability to manage activities of daily living, and may result in personality dull-ing, lack of motivation, and limited judgment/insight. Memory loss occurs in later stages of the process and is followed by a progressive decline in cognitive functioning. Treatment involves surgical placement of a ventricular shunt in the brain and is most successful in reversing dementia in the early stages (Keltner et al., 2007). Information Common to all Dementias (unless stated otherwise) Nursing diagnoses\u2014several of the 2009-2011 NANDA International (2009) nursing diagnoses can be applied to dementia, including:1. Behavior, risk-prone health 2. Coping, ineffective 3. Self-Care Deficit, bathing 4. Self-Care Deficit, dressing 5. Self-Care Deficit, toileting 6. Confusion, acute 7. Confusion, risk for acute 8. Confusion, chronic 9. Memory, impaired 10. Social Interaction, impaired 11. Caregiver Role Strain, risk for 12. Insomnia13. Role Performance, ineffective 14. Neglect, self 15. Wandering [specify sporadic or continual] 16. Health Management, ineffective self 17. Coping, compromised family Biochemical interventions (APA, 2007; Flood & Buckwalter, 2009; Keltner et al., 2007; Stahl, 2008, 2009)1. After verifying a diagnosis of Dementia, blood pressure management at the higher end of the normal range is recommended for improving cognitive function in Vascular Dementia (ACE inhibitors and diuretics do not amplify cogni-tive impairment). 2. Initial interventions depend on the etiologic factor causing the dementia and to treat the underlying cause of the disturbance (e.g., treat diabetes with insulin, hypothyroidism with thyroid replacement, thiamine deficiency with replacement, and iatrogenic disorders by eliminating the causative drug). 3. In patients with Dementia, benzodiazepines may be used for anxiety; antidepressants for depressive symptoms, and antipsychotics for psychosis. Exercise caution when treating older patients. Avoid the use of pharmacologic agents with high anticholinergic actions.a. \"Sundowner syndrome\" occurs when older patients are overly sedated\u2014and in Dementia patients experiencing an adverse reaction to a psychoactive drug or with deprivation of external cues such as light and orienting cues (e.g., interper-sonal contact, clock). This syndrome is characterized by drowsiness, confusion, ataxia, and accidental falls (Sadock & Sadock, 2007) b. If biochemical intervention is indicated for control of agitation or hallucination associated with Dementia, drug treatment should be used cautiously (particularly in older patients), beginning with the low-est possible dose and tapering upward as needed. Haloperidol is the drug of choice for controlling agitation in dementias due to lower anticholinergic effects. Low dosage of 0.25 mg should be initiated. Side effects include dystonias (rigidity in joints and torticollis) and excessive saliva-tion. Orthostatic blood pressures should be monitored and the client and his/her caregiver(s) should be taught the side effects. c. In treating depression associated with, SSRIs are preferred over TCAs (due to the high anticholinergic and antiadrenergic 194 Chapter 9 Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing agents showing some promise are lithium, and beta amyloid antagonists. Psychosocial approaches 1. Base on careful nursing assessment of the patient. 2. Goal of nursing care regardless of the setting is to help the client maintain the highest possible level of independence. Skill training can assist the client to reach his/her potential (Tappen, 1994). 3. Use warm, caring, respectful approach. 4. Use clear, simple, and direct communication. 5. Keep tasks within the client's abilities, using sequencing and cuing (i.e., laying out the cli-ent's clothing in the order in which he/she needs to put it on) 6. Avoid over- or under-stimulation. 7. Provide for adequate rest and nutrition.properties of TCAs), and MAOIs (due to potential for serious interactions). d. Atypical antipsychotics have been used successfully in treating associated hal-lucinations and delusions, but recent evidence suggests a connection with in-creased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in this population, as well as in-creased risk in the development of meta-bolic syndrome, thus very cautious use is advised. 4. Thus far, the FDA has approved five medica-tions (cholinesterase inhibitors) for treating Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (other de-mentias are not listed).(See Table 9-1 ) 5. Other selegiline, statins, ginko bi-loba, folate preparations, and Vitamin E, which have limited support for their efficacy thus far; Table 9-1 \u0084 Cholinesterase Inhibitors Used in Treating Dementia* Generic (Trade Name)Approved Dementia Level Usual Dose Dosing Information Comments Donepezil (Aricept)Mild, Moderate & Severe5 to 10 mg PO in eveningStart at 5 mg; may increase to 10 mg in 4 to 6 weeksFirst-line option; also available in disintegrating tablet form Galantamine (Razadyne)Mild to Moderate 16 to 24 mg PO daily Immediate release: Initially 8 mg twice daily; may increase to 16 mg twice daily after 4 weeks; maximum 24-hr dose 32 mgSecond-line option; available in once-daily extended release form Rivastigmine (Exelon)Mild to Moderate 6 to 12 mg PO in two divided dosesInitially 1.5 mg PO twice daily; increase by 3 mg every 2 weeks; maximum 24-hr dose 12 mgSecond-line option; also available in transdermal form\u2014dose: initially 4.6 mg/day; in 4 weeks increase to maximum dose of 9.5 mg/day Tacrine (Cognex) Mild to Moderate 20 to 40 mg PO four times dailyInitially 10 mg PO 4 times daily (qid) for 4 weeks; may increase by 10 mg qid increments every 4 weeks as needed; maximum 24-hr dose 160 mg1st drug approved by FDA for treating Alzheimer's dementia; rarely used due to risk of reversible hepatic toxicity Memantine (Namenda)Moderate to Severe10 mg PO twice daily Initially 5 mg PO daily; may increase by 5 mg each week; maximum 24-hr dose 20 mgSecond-line option; recommended to divide doses over 5 mg, usually twice daily *FDA Approval for Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (APA, 2007; Stahl, 2008, 2009)195 Cognitive Disorders depression or who have one of the previously mentioned disorders. 3. Educational groups seek to inform and em-phasize learning and discussion instead of therapy (Neese & Abraham, 1992). For elders who have mild cognitive impairment and their families, educational groups addressing the various types of dementias are an excel-lent method to help alleviate the isolation that clients and families feel when faced with a chronic disorder. 4. Validation groups developed by Feil (1989) are designed to benefit even severely im-paired clients. The goals of validation are to stimulate communication in order to prevent withdrawal inward, to restore well-being, to facilitate the resolution of unresolved issues to prepare for death, and to reduce caregiver burnout by teaching empathy skills (Bleathe-man & Morton, 1996; Fine & Rouse-Bane, 1995). 5. Activity, movement, and sensory stimulation groups also enhance functioning in cognitively impaired older adults (Arno & Frank, 1994). Milieu interventions\u2014are a critical factor in the treatment of both acute and chronic dementias, whether the client is at home or in an institution.1. Provide safety, structure, and support. 2. Provide consistency of routine. 3. Provide orientation and environmental cues. 4. Explain procedures in clear, direct language to enhance understanding and allay anxiety. 5. Provide for adequate rest, nutrition, and elimination. 6. Disruptive behavior in demented clients of-ten occurs in response to an environmental trigger. Therefore, it is important to assess and modify the environment (Whall, 1995). Disruptive behavior often occurs in response to perceived pain, need for control, need to feel safe, need for stimulation, and need to de-crease stress. Community resources 1. Potential resources for clients and caregivers can be extensive depending on the etiology, duration, and level of cognitive and functional impairment associated with the dementia. 2. Organizations related to organic factors caus-ing the disorder would include Alcoholics Anonymous, The American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, American Lung Association, and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Foundation. 3. A wide array of community services are available to maintain the client and family, 8. If the dementia is vascular, provide informa-tion to the client regarding managing risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease (diet, exercise, decreasing stress, medication, signs of impending stroke, etc.). Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Family needs to be included in the assessment as well as the intervention phase of treatment with cognitively impaired clients since they can provide much useful information regard-ing how to best care for their loved one. 2. Family members are often the hidden victims of the illness, especially when the dementia is chronic rather than reversible. 3. Family interventions always include provid-ing support and education, and in some cases, such as when the dementia is due to sub-stance abuse, counseling or therapy may be indicated. 4. Family interventions also include assisting the family for anticipatory grief, which usu-ally is a deep sadness that occurs before the anticipated future loss. Symptoms of anticipa-tory grief are depression, an increased preoc-cupation with the affected family member, an analysis of all the possible problems that may occur during the course of the disease, and an-ticipation how each family member will need to readjust to care for the affected family mem-ber (Barry, 1996). In addition to anticipatory grief, family members also may experience the bereavement stages proposed by Kubler-Ross (1969): denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Group approaches\u2014In selecting elder group par - ticipants, as with young adults, extreme paranoia and severe cognitive impairment is usually con-traindicated for effective group work. Therefore, elders who are experiencing the latter stages of Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, tend not to benefit significantly from most of the following groups while those with mild cognitive impair-ment can and do benefit from group therapy:1. Reminiscence groups aim to increase self- esteem through positive affiliations and in-teractions with others (Ashton, 1993). These groups may be helpful for elders and indi-viduals with mild cognitive disorders and depression. 2. Cognitive-behavioral groups assist clients in correcting negative thoughts and attitudes, as well as maladaptive ways in which clients process information (Hitch, 1994). This type of group can be helpful to elders who suffer from mild cognitive impairment with superimposed 196 Chapter 9 Cognitive Mental Disorders and Geropsychiatric Nursing abilities/capacity for independent living (nutrition, dressing, grooming, toileting, etc.) b. Increased suicide risk is related to loneli-ness, helplessness, hopelessness\u2014spe-cifically ask if the client is experiencing thoughts of suicide. c. Assess disturbances in cognition\u2014incor-porate use of MMSE, Mini-cog or other assessment tools (See discussion earlier in this chapter) Mental disorders & associated findings in old age (Keltner, Schwecke, (See earlier sections of this chapter)\u2014antipsychotic use contraindicated\u2014related to increased risk of mortality due to cardiovascular or infectious events. 2. Substance-related disordersa. Long-term alcohol abuse can lead to in-firmities such as cirrhosis, Wernicke's en-cephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome, malnutrition, effects of exposure (gan-grene) and falls. b. Sudden onset of delirium in older persons hospitalized for medical conditions is the most frequently recorded cause of alcohol withdrawal. 3. Anxiety disorders\u2014some anxiety disorders can occur for the first time after age 60. 4. Schizophrenia\u2014rarely diagnosed after age 65. 5. Depressive disordersa. Depressive disorders occur in about 15% of community-dwelling elders (home and nursing home residents). b. Useful assessment instruments include the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). c. Cognitive impairment with depression is referred to as pseudodementia (dementia syndrome of depression)\u2014occurs in about 15% of depressed older patients. d. Antidepressant use by adults older than 65 years increases risk of suicide. As with all patients, monitor closely for changes that indicate increased suicidality. e. Increased suicide risk exists for persons older than 65 years\u2014loneliness is the lead-ing cause for suicide ideation. 6. Other mental disordersa. Sleep disorders\u2014advanced age is a primary factor contributing to sleep disorders. b. Pain disorders(1) Comorbidity of medical and psychi-atric conditions make pain a special condition among older adults.including home health agencies, social ser-vices, outreach programs, homebound meals, church support, day care, respite care, hospice, nursing homes, and others. geropsyChiatriC nursing Piven, 2006; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014Old age is a natural phase of the life cycle, not a disease. A continuum of health in aging exists; ranging from those described as well-old to those described as sick-old. Well older individuals are maintaining daily functions and enjoying a time of integrity rather than despair (Eric Erikson\u2014See Chapter 3). Conversely, the sick-old experience a variety of physical and men-tal disorders or combinations thereof. Within the next 20 years, the demands and opportunities for geropsychiatric nursing, in caring for well and sick older persons, will expand and grow exponentially. Issues regarding health maintenance, healthy lifestyle promotion, comorbid disorders (psycho-logical and physical), long-term consequences of substance abuse and/or military conflict, cultural considerations and the effects of globalization/migration each contribute to future health care needs. Psychiatric examination of the older patient (Keltner, Schwecke, encountering older adults in any set-ting need to consider their physical, emo-tional, and social needs. 2. In assessing older persons in a psychiatric set-ting, follow the same format as that used for younger adults. 3. If evidence of cognitive impairment is pre-sented, additional collateral information from family/caretaker is needed. 4. In an approach with older clients, keep in mind the continuum of aging\u2014taking into account whether the person is a well 75-year-old who volunteers at a local agency, or a frail 75-year-old residing in a nursing home. 5. Psychiatric history should include:a. Childhood/adolescent history and milestones b. Family history c. Marital/Civil union history d. Sexual history\u2014many well elders are sexu-ally active well into advanced age e. Abuse history and vulnerability for elder abuse 6. Mental status variationsa. Patients older than 65 should be assessed for functional limitations that affect 197 Questions a. Reminiscence\u2014characterized by review of meaningful and/or conflictual memories of past experiences b. Life review therapy capitalizes on remi-niscence behaviors through a conscious, deliberate process.(1) Therapist may guide process by en-couraging written/tape-recorded biographies/histories review of special events/milestones.

Among children ages 10-14, homicide and suicide were the third and fourth leading causes of death. d. About 4.5 million children 3-17 years of age (7%) had Attention Deficit Hyperactiv-ity Disorder (ADHD), with a 2:1 ratio for boys vs girls. e. Attention-Deficit Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (30%), and depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems (21%) were among the most frequently reported health conditions in children with special healthcare needs (younger than 17 years). f. Alcohol is the most common psychoactive substance used during adolescence.(1) 8% of both male and female 8th-grade students reported heavy drinking. (2) 17% of 10th-grade males and 15% of females reported heavy drinking. (3) 20% of 12th-grade males reported heavy drinking, compared with 21% of 12th-grade females. g. Illicit drug use (marijuana, cocaine, etc.) within the past 30 days was reported by:(1) 8% of 8th-grade students. (2) 16% of 10th-grade students. (3) 22% of 12th-grade students. Cultural and ethnic considerations 1. Cultural weaknessesChild and adoles Cent \u0088 PsyChiatri C Mental health nursing Professional standards\u2014Specialists in this area hold a master's or doctoral degree addressing specific issues in child and adolescent psychiatric nursing and are certified as clinical nursing spe-cialists in child and adolescent psychiatric nurs-ing or family psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioners (FPMHNP) by the American Nurses Credentialing Center. They are recognized by their peers as Advanced Practice Registered Nurses. Epidemiology 1. Prevalence rates of mental disorders among children and adolescents (Bloom, & Cohen, 2009; Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2009; Keltner, Schwecke, & Bostrom, 2007)\u201420% of school-age children suffer significant mental health problems (8-12 million children and adolescents); of these, only 20% are receiving mental health services. 2. Reports of child and adolescent health surveys from 2006 to 2008 (Bloom, & Cohen, 2009; Fed- eral Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2009) include the following facts: a. The incidence of adolescent depression is 8.2% (highest incidence was among girls and those aged 16-17 years). b. Youth who have had a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year are at greater risk for suicide and are more likely 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence 206 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence 3. Being abused physically or sexually 4. Being of minority ethnic status (associated with poverty) 5. Having teenage parents 6. Being in families with marital discord, parental conflict, divorce, instability in family environ-ment; being in foster care 7. Having a chronic illness or disability 8. Living with prolonged parent-child separation, multiple separations, frequent changes in pri-mary caretaker 9. Homelessness (families with children are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population) 10. Being a Native-American child from certain tribes whose suicide rates are 2-3 times that of the rest of the US population for the same age Genetic/Biologic origins 1. Low birth weight 2. Developmental delay 3. Brain damage 4. Epilepsy5. Addiction as a result of maternal substance abuse 6. Early difficulties in adjustment between infant and primary caretaker temperament styles 7. Mental retardation8. Genetic loading\u2014there is an increased risk for developing a mental disorder for children with a first-degree relative afflicted with the disorder (specifically genetic links have been found among: mood and anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, tic disorders, and ADHD) (Keltner et al., 2007) 9. Physical illness and impairments a. Illness often interferes with the acquisition of skills and negotiation of developmental milestones. b. Children have fears and anxieties re- lated to their developmental age, and the younger the child, the fewer the coping strategies. c. Regression occurs in the face of illness or disability. d. Chronic illness may pose greater risk for psychological disturbance. e. Children with AIDS are at particularly high risk due to(1) Family dysfunction\u2014extreme poverty, drug abuse, social isolation, and/or homelessness (2) Parental ill health or social stigmatization 10. Circumstances that may decrease risk include:a. Lack of acculturation means children of immigrants (and their parents) are at greater risk for depression and suicide (Hovey & King, 1996, Sadock & Sadock, 2007). b. Some folk medicine practices and child rear ing practices may be perceived as abusive by Western cultural standards. The nurse needs to observe and educate parents about certain practices (Zimmer-man, 1997), but needs to be aware of other cultural beliefs before imposing Western practices. 2. Cultural strengths a. Strong loyalty to family, family cohesive- ness, and family ownership of children's problems is prevalent in Native-American, African-American, and Asian families. b. Strong supportive extended family link- ages and sharing in child-care tasks by family, friends, and neighbors is prevalent in families of color. c. Cultural emphasis on discipline, obedi- ence to rules, and respect for elders who are sources of advice for child rearing is prevalent in Asian families. d. Having bicultural competence preserves cultural identity while the child negotiates the dominant culture. e. Humor as a means of coping with adver-sity is a strength. f. Independence for children is prevalent in Native-American families; interdepen-dence of siblings in Hispanic families. g. Strong religious values, customs, rituals, and institutions that provide spiritual sup-port and reinforce strong, ethical values for life decisions, and give meaning to life are prevalent; churches provide group socialization activities and supplementary child care. h. Value placed on education of children, who are seen as hope for the future by African-American and Asian families. i. Strong ethnic community representatives and organizations exist that help people of color to bargain, negotiate, and obtain resources from larger societal systems (Gaudin,1993). Risk factors for mental and emotional disorders are increased in the following situations:1. Living in poverty and in crowded, inner city environments (poverty increases intensity of all other risk factors) 2. Having mentally ill and substance abusing parents207 Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing a. Parental discord prior to a separation and divorce b. Continuous discord regarding custody, visitation, child support, and each parent's activities and friends c. Children exposed to parental separation before school entry may show increased risk of later conduct or oppositional and mood disorders. d. Children exposed to parental separation after 10 years of age show increased risk of substance abuse. e. Children and adolescents in therapy may focus on parent's separation as a major event in their lives. 4. Blended familiesa. Children must adjust to stepparents, step- siblings and step-grandparents. b. Visitation schedules often disrupt family routines; children often feel resentment, anger, and a sense of abandonment. c. Loyalty conflicts and attachment prob-lems are common and relate to child's de-velopmental stages. 5. Alternative lifestylesa. Children sense they are different or are teased. b. Adolescent peer pressure and develop-mental needs propel the youngster to fit in with the peer culture. 6. Foster families\u2014Number of children in foster care has recently decreased from record highs reported early this decade: 783,000 children served by the system in 2007, of which over 496,000 lived in foster care; 75% placed due to maltreatment or inadequate care (Trends in Foster Care report from the Administra-tion for Children & Families: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/trends.htm). Access to health care 1. Services for children are inadequate, inappro- priate, or unavailable. 2. Over 12 million US children lack health insurance. 3. Cutbacks in funding of mental health services have affected psychiatric care of children and adolescents. 4. Inadequate residential care is available. 5. In order to obtain services for their children, many parents must give custody to the state. 6. Inadequate numbers of mental health pro-fessionals are trained to provide the needed mental health services for children and adolescents.a.

National Information Center for Handicapped Children and Youth Learning Disorders Definition\u2014Learning disorders, also called learn- ing disabilities, occur in 4 to 6% of school-age children. There is controversy over the inclusion of these as mental disorders. Often there is no sign of psychopathology. Detection and treatment gener-ally occurs within the school system. Reading Disorder (APA, 2000; Keltner et al, 2007) Definition\u2014Also called dyslexia, Reading Disorder involves lower achievement in reading skills than would be suggested by aptitude or intellectual abilities. Treatment involves remediation strategies to improve reading skills. Mathematics Disorder (APA, 2000; Keltner et al, 2007) Definition\u2014Mathematics Disorder involves lower achievement in math skills than would be suggested by aptitude or intellectual abilities. Treatment involves problem-solving strategies to improve math skills. Disorder of Written Expression (APA, 2000; Keltner et al, 2007) Definition\u2014Involves lower achievement in writing skills than would be suggested by aptitude or intel- lectual abilities. Treatment involves direct practice to improve writing skills.a. Maternal alcohol consumption causing prenatal damage due to to xins b. Pregnancy and perinatal problems (10%)c. Fetal malnutrition, prematurity, or hypoxia d. Maternal trauma\u2014pregnant women more at higher risk for injury due to family vio-lence than nonpregnant women 6. Physical disorders acquired in childhood Biochemical interventions\u2014are diagnostic and symptom specific; include symptomatic features/behaviors Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Origins include: psychosocial deprivation, lack of stimulation, and complications of other mental disorders. 2. Behavior modification specific for acting-out can be effective. 3. Supportive treatment that raises self-esteem may be helpful for the higher functioning patient. 4. Treatment interventions are based on the social, educational, psychiatric, and environ-mental needs of the patient. Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Dysfunctional family processes, such as abu-sive and chemically dependent families may contribute. 2. Families who undernurture and understimu-late may contribute. 3. Therapy is geared to correcting dysfunctional processes without pathologizing family; pro-mote rewarding, praising. 4. Deficits of mentally retarded child create se-vere stress for family; pattern of overprotection and overcompensation may develop. 5. Families need both respite care and help in focusing on the child's strengths as well as re-alistic expectations. 6. Psychoeducational approaches can be used to engender family cooperation with programs. Group approaches 1. Traditional, insight-oriented group is not indicated. 2. Behavior modification, educational group may be helpful. 3. Multiple family group therapy decreases fam- ily's sense of isolation and stress, and provides a forum for sharing effective management strategies. 4. Socialization groups can be useful.5. Skills building can be useful.210 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence Family dynamics/Family therapy\u2014families may need assistance in parent management strategies and psychoeducational approaches may be in order. Group approaches\u2014may be helpful in self- esteem issues and to help overcome feelings of differentness. Community resources\u2014educational intervention depends upon degree of impairment.1. National Learning Disabilities Association2. Federation for Children with Special Needs Communication Disorders Definition\u2014Communication disorders involve deficits in speaking or language (the formulation and comprehension of verbal exchange between people), and affect about 5% of preschool and 3% of school-age children. A diagnosis is informed by standardized testing (APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Expressive Language Disorder (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Definition & signs and symptoms\u2014Children with this disorder tend to function below their intel- lectual abilities in terms of correct tense usage, complex sentence structure, vocabulary, and word recall. Therapeutic interventions may involve practice and possibly a speech specialist; other therapeutic options include psychotherapy to address self-esteem. Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Signs and symptoms (APA, 1994, p. 60-61)\u2014in- clude those for Expressive Language Disorder as well as difficulty understanding words, sentences, or specific types of words, such as spatial terms. Phonological Disorder (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Signs and symptoms\u2014failure to use developmen- tally expected speech sounds that are appropriate for age and dialect (e.g., errors in sound produc-tion, use, representation, or organization such as, but not limited to, substitutions of one sound for another [use of /t/ for target /k/ sound] or omis-sions final consonants) (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Signs and symptoms\u2014disturbance in the nor - mal fluency and time patterning of speech Motor Skills Disorder/Developmental Coordination Disorder (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Definition & signs and symptoms\u2014Deficits occur in coordination and ability to perform gross and/or fine motor skills associated with activities of daily living. Children with this disorder frequently struggle to perform activities including jump-ing, hopping, running, and may perform poorly academically due to clumsiness and poor writing skills. About 5% of all school-age children meet the criteria for Developmental Coordination Disorder. A diagnosis is informed by standardized testing. Differential diagnosis 1. Mental retardation2.

Motor movements frequently accompany stut- tering, such as eye blinks, tics, tremors of the face and head, fist clenching. 4. Severity of symptoms may increase under pressure to communicate, such as during interview. Nursing diagnoses (NANDA, 2009) 1. Communication, impaired verbal2. Anxiety Genetic/Biologic origins 1. Familial pattern is noted. 2. Stuttering\u2014research supports genetic evi- dence for origin of stuttering.a. Male-to-female ratio is 3 to 1.b. 50% of first degree biologic r elatives affected.3. May have generalized neurological soft signs.4. No factors have been shown to be clearly asso- ciated with recovery. 5. Approximately 80% recover before 16 years of age. 6. Females more commonly recover than males. Psychotherapeutic and behavioral interventions 1. Therapy should focus on overcoming associ- ated anxiety and frustration. 2. Relaxation training, positive self-talk and stress management may help provide a sense of mastery and self-control. 3. Teach self-control strategies. Family therapy 1. Family may help raise child's self-esteem. 2. Assist parents to understand and be empa-thetic with patient. 3. Contributory family dysfunctional patterns need to be addressed; confront interactions that maintain dysfunction. 4. Challenge denial surrounding deficit in order to support actual interventions. 5. Promote realistic expectations, e.g., filling in pauses (Jongsma et al., 1996). Group approaches\u2014overcome low self-esteem and impairment of social functioning. Community resources 1. Speech and hearing therapy services\u2014usually not covered by third-party payers. 2. School systems may have special education services. Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) Autistic Disorder (APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) Definition & signs and symptoms\u2014Autism is a PDD characterized by symptoms involving impair - ment in social interaction, communication, and restrictive repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior/interests. Autism disorder can be dif-ferentiated from other PDD due to early age of onset for autism (younger than 30 months); severe deficits in social relating, communication, and development (e.g., Rett syndrome involves a rapid decline in previously acquired skills); occurs in about 0.08% of children. Associated features (the younger the child and the more severe the impairment, the higher the num-ber of associated features)212 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence with Asperger's disorder often have normal intel- ligence (compared to the high incidence of men-tal retardation among those with autism); verbal abilities/intellect are frequently higher than per-formance abilities/intellect; have a tendency to interpret language cues concretely; and possess social skills deficits that are evidenced by difficul-ties in reading social cues. Additional character-istics include clumsiness, difficulty managing transitions, and a preoccupation with areas of their own interest. The disorder is more common among boys. Therapeutic interventions for Pervasive Develop- mental Disorders1. Behavioral therapy to target behaviors that will improve abilities to assimilate into school and social relationships; and increase the likeli-hood of future independent living 2. Symptomatic treatment of associated psychi- atric conditions Attention-Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Definition\u2014Behaviors that are disturbing to oth- ers and often socially disruptive. The behaviors are referred to as \"externalizing\" symptoms. They interfere with the child's social functioning and learning. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Definition & signs and symptoms (American Acad- emy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2007a; APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014ADHD is among the most common of childhood psychiatric conditions; characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity that occur in at least two different settings (i.e., home and school) with significant impairment in func-tioning (socially, academically, occupationally). ADHD is divided into the following three subtypes that specify the dominant associated behaviors:1. Hyperactive-impulsive type 2. Inattentive type 3. Combined (hyperactive-impulsive and inat- tentive) type Associated features 1. Child may become alienated from peers due to inability to cooperate with others or follow game rules; excessive talking is common. 2. Child may engage in dangerous activities with- out considering consequences. 3. Symptoms may not be evidenced when child is in a highly structured, novel, or one-to-one situation, or when watching TV or playing video games.1. Abnormal development of cognitive skills 2. Abnormal posture and motor behavior 3. Odd response to sensory input such as obliv-ion to pain or cold, but hypersensitivity to be-nign sounds, such as birds chirping; may have a fascination for some sensations of touch, such as velvet pillow 4. Abnormalities in eating, drinking, or sleeping 5. Abnor malities of mood 6. Mental retardation7. Temporal complications9. Self-injurious behavior, such as head-banging, finger-biting, gouging skin Differential diagnosis 1. Mental retardation\u2014even seriously impaired, can socialize and communicate in some way 2.

Role Performance, ineffective Genetic/Biologic origins/Biochemical interventions1. Genetic link\u2014evidence of higher concordance rates has been shown among monozygotic twins. 2. Increased incidence of ADHD among first-degree relatives (although subtypes may differ) could be a factor. 3. May be sex-linked\u2014more males than females are diagnoses with ADHD. 4. Fathers may be alcoholic or have Antisocial Personality Disorder. 5. Children with ADHD have higher risk of devel- oping Conduct Disorder, SUD, and Antisocial Personality Disorder than general population. 6. Conduct Disorder and specific developmental disorders are more frequent in relatives. 7. Predisposing factors a. CNS abnormalitiesb. Disorganized, chaotic environmentsc. Noradrenergic, sero- d. Family history of ADHD 8. Diagnostic studies\u2014hyper/hypothyroid may be contributing factor; although no specific laboratory tests aid in the diagnosis of ADHD. 9. Psychopharmacology (AACAP, and 80% of children with ADHD respond medication. b. First-line agents are slow-dose second-line include antidepressants with noradrenergic properties, such as bu-propion (See Table 10-1 ) (1) In 2006, the FDA required labeling changes for all stimulants to warn about the effects of sudden death associated with stimulants used at unusual doses in children and adoles-cents with heart problems including structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac condition.4. Age of onset is generally before 7 years of age (almost half before 4 years of age). 5. Disorder is often diagnosed at entry into school. 6. Low self-esteem, labile mood, and temper tan-trums are often present. Differential diagnosis 1. Considerations: a. It is sometimes impossible to differenti-ate this diagnosis from response to a chaotic environment, including parenting problems. b. Teacher reports are somewhat more valid than those from family since the family may either normalize or be unaware of what degree of compliance to expect from children at various ages. 2. Rule out: a. Specific learning disabilities b. Acute situational reactions c. Adjustment disorders d. Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defi- ant Disorder e. Mental Retardationf.

Originsa. Retarded ego developmentb. Low self-esteem 2. Psychotherapeutic interventions a. Provide careful environmental control\u2014 tasks and chores broken down into short, manageable components; homework done in short periods with opportunities for breaks. b. Convey unconditional positive regard since these children often have low self-esteem and respond to positive reinforcement. c. Provide social skills training.d. Provide problem-solving strategies/CBT.(2) In addition, there is an increased risk of abuse and dependency for stimu-lant class medications. (3) For adults with ADHD, first-line agents include nonstimulants (atom-oxetine, sustained-release stimulants. Pemoline and dextroamphetamine sulfate are also used. d. Bupropion\u2014contraindicated in children/ adolescents with seizure disorders.

Par - tially digested food is brought up into the mouth without nausea, retching, disgust. The food is ejected, or chewed and reswallowed. The condition is potentially fatal. With an onset after 3 months of age, children with this disorder usually have inad-equate emotional interaction; rumination disorder may lead to failure to thrive. Differential diagnosis 1.

Same as adults, but modified for developmen- tal level 2. Must provide safe environment for other patients Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents Definition\u2014Powerlessness, increased dependency, impaired self-esteem, and poor social skills are common manifestations of anxiety disorders in children. Child and adolescent anxiety disorders are on a continuum with, and may become adult anxiety disorders. Retrospective studies of adults with anxiety disorders indicated that 65% had two or more anxiety disorders as children. Insecurely or ambivalently attached infants develop more anxiety diagnoses in childhood and adolescence. Behavioral inhibition is a risk factor in the develop-ment of anxiety disorders in young children. Anxi-ety disorders in children do not appear in isolation. They are part of an array of other symptoms and traits. Separation Anxiety Disorder Definition & signs and symptoms (AACAP, 2007e; APA, 2000; Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014Separation anxiety disorder (commonly termed stranger anxiety) is one of two anxiety dis-orders found in the child and adolescent section of the DSM-IV-TR. This disorder is characterized by persistent fear, shyness, and social withdrawal when confronting unfamiliar people and settings; the disorder is diagnosed when upon separating from a major attachment figure, the child exhibits intense, excessive, and developmentally inappro-priate fear/anxiety. The anxiety must be present for at least 1 month and produce significant im-pairment in functioning at home, school, or with friends. The fear/anxiety is manifested by reluc- tance or refusal to separate from the attachment figure and nightmares about separation; occurs in about 15% of all children and 4% of school-age children. Differential diagnosis 1. Somatic complaints2. Developmentally appropriate separation anxietyachieve therapeutic blood levels (Antai-Otong, 1995). b. Complete physical examinations and baseline laboratory studies must be done prior to initiating drug therapy. c. Children and adolescents often tolerate lithium better than adults. d. Dosage ranges from 600 mg daily for a weight of 15 to 25 kg given in divided doses to 1500 mg per day for a weight range of 50 to 60 kg given in divided doses. 3. Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotic agents approved for adult treat-ment of manic symptoms have also been used in treating children and adolescents.a. Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (1) Carbamazepine (Tegretol) is given in doses of 15 to 30 mg/kg/day (2) Valproic acid (Depakene) given in nonresponse to lithium or Tegretol\u2014 dose is 25 to 60 mg/kg/day, with a blood level of 50 to 120 a possible adjunct for acute mania and SSRIs for management of as-sociated depression. 5. Neuroleptics6. Antimania agents 7. ECT Intrapersonal origins/Psychotherapeutic interventions1. Mania is common among families\u2014it is thought that bipolar parents may exercise in-adequate parenting techniques. 2. Cohort effect indicates increased incidence of bipolar illness in individuals born after 1940. 3. Hospitalization is frequently indicated.4. Age-specific psychotherapy/play therapy\u2014 CBT and/or interpersonal therapy may be use-ful to address skill building, and monitoring of symptoms/progress. Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Psychoeducational approaches essential for patient and family. 2. Psychotherapeutic interventions include: a. Support and empathyb. Academic and occupational functioning c. Social and family functioningd. Relapse prevention 3. Biologic origins of this disorder must be taken into account (therapist may be dealing with several bipolar persons in family).225 Mental Disorders Diagnosed in Children & Adolescents 2.

Church and sports activities Selective Mutism (Elective Mutism) Definition & signs and symptoms (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014Although fully capable of speaking competently, children with selective mutism remain completely silent or whisper nearly inaudible one-syllable words when experiencing a socially anxiety-producing situation, most typically at school. Selective mutism is one of two anxiety disorders found in the child and adolescent section of the DSM-IV-TR. The disorder has been associ- ated with Social Phobia, and may be a subtype of social anxiety/social phobia. Familial factors con-tributing to selective mutism (and other anxiety conditions) include maternal anxiety, depression, and heightened dependency needs. Differential diagnosis 1. Severe or Profound Mental Retardation, Perva- sive Developmental Disorder, Developmental Expressive Language Disorder 2.

Attempts to engage the patient in conversation are futile, although the presence of adequate receptive language is apparent.3. Over anxious disorder 4. Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia5. PDD or Schizophrenia Mental status examination 1. May refuse to separate from parent.2. May cling or cry and fuss if parent tries to leave; if separated, checks frequently in spite of reassurances and knowledge that parent is close by. Nursing diagnoses (NANDA, 2009) 1.

Moderate to catastrophic stressor as defined on Axis IV may contribute. 2. More research needed on genetic vs environ- mental transmission. 3. Brief, symptom-focused therapy approaches include:a. Psychodramab. Art work c. Play therapy utilizing role play, doll house, sand box, puppets to explore anxieties, fears, and worries d. Therapeutic games, storytelling to expand awareness e. Emphasis on symptom reduction, empow- erment, mastery and control f. Goal to decrease symptoms quickly to enhance functioning, avoid permanent dysfunction g.

Case histories report symptoms developed fol- lowing reprimand for verbalization. 3. Challenging to treat since these patients don't talk to therapist and often passively refuse nonverbal communication. 4. Psychoanalysis reportedly is beneficial.5. Behavior therapy may be beneficial. 6. Resolve core conflict contributing to mutism so patient speaks consistently in all social situations. Family dynamics/Family ther apy 1.

RAD is characterized by a lack of a clearly identified attachment figure, nonresponsiveness, excessive inhibition, hypervigilance, indiscrimi-nant socialization, or disorganized attachment behaviors. RAD is divided into two subtypes:2. Child abuse3. Early traumatic childhood losses4. Chronic medical problems5. Impaired social skills If continued into adulthood, becomes Avoidant Personality Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder (includes Overanxious Disorder of childhood) (See also Anxiety and Stress Related Disorders chapter) Children with this disorder are extremely sensitive. Overanxious behavior is exaggerated during times of stress. Overly concerned about social performance and competency. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (See also Anxiety and Stress Related Disorders chapter) Thought to be rare in children until recently. Symptoms in children include obsessive thoughts, rituals, such as washing, checking, and repeatedly rewriting letters or numbers until perfect. Adults realize the behaviors are unreasonable; chil- dren may not. Panic Disorder\u2014uncommon before the prepubertal period; peak age of onset is 15-19 years of age Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (See Anxiety and Stress Related Disorders chapter) Treatment Measures\u2014should be a multimodal approach incorporating behavioral/CBT, psychodynamic, family well 2007e; Sadock & S adock, 2007; Stahl, 2008, 2009) 1.

First, engage principle caregiver (then other relevant family members) in treatment.(1) Therapist can act as coach for care- giver to promote child's healthy at-tachment behaviors. (2) Alternatively, therapist can model attachment-promoting behaviors in dyadic work with caregiver in joint therapy with child. b. Identify family stresses. c. Assess family resources. d. Assess and intervene in dysfunctional conflicts affecting child's well-being. e. Supervise care.f. Recommend out-of-home placement if necessary. Milieu interventions 1. Does not meet criteria for psychiatric hospitalization. 2. Patient may be placed in infant home or pe- diatric unit to treat other conditions while awaiting placement; cuddling and stimulation essential; staff may model appropriate behav-ior for parents.

Differential diagnosis 1. Normal rocking and thumb-sucking are com- mon in infants and young children. 2. Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Tic Disor - der, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Mental status examination\u2014behavior appears compulsive and involuntary.1. Inhibited type\u2014emotionally withdrawn\u2014fail- ing to initiate or respond, in a developmentally appropriate manner, to most social interac-tions; experiencing hyper-arousal, difficulty in regulation of emotion (irritability, anger/aggression in response to efforts to comfort) 2. Disinhibited type\u2014indiscriminant sociabil- ity\u2014little, if any, fear of strangers; seeking and accepting comfort from unfamiliar adults; sometimes considered to be emotionally shal-low, attention seeking, and interpersonally superficial Differential diagnosis 1. Physical examination to determine/treat fac- tors contributing to disturbance in rates of growth and development 2. Mental R etardation or Pervasive Developmen- tal Disorder, such as Autistic Disorder 3. Children with severe neurological abnormali- ties, including deafness, blindness, profound multisensory defects, major central nervous system disease, or severe chronic physical illness Mental status examination 1. Lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness 2. Apathy and lack of interest in environment 3. Child may stare, have weak cry and poor mus- cle tone, as well as low motility. 4. Home visit often required to investigate ne-glect or abuse since caregiver reports not reliable. Nursing diagnoses (NANDA, 2009) 1. Parenting, risk for impaired2. Role Performance, ineffective3.

Overwhelming psychosocial stresses in par-ents with emotional deficits 6. Family therapy229 Other Disorders of Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence 2. Associated with mood, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders. 3. Adolescent drug and alcohol abuse is major health problem and precedes later drug and alcohol dependency. 4. Disrupts adolescent's ability to meet develop-mental tasks. 5. Associated with:a. Accidents, suicides, and psychiatric illness b. Dual diagnosis, especially depression, ADHD, and Conduct Disorder c. Teenage pregnancy, infant morbidity and mortality, high-risk sexual behavior and STDs(1) Children of cocaine-addicted mothers may experience difficulty in bonding; at risk for multiple problems, includ-ing low birth weight. (2) Cocaine interferes with parental bonding and empathy. (3) Infants born to alcohol-dependent/alcohol-addicted mothers are at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome; infants are difficult to soothe, are at high risk for later developmental abnormalities, disruptive behavior disorders, and mental retardation. d. Parental substance usee. Emotional distance between parent and adolescent and lack of involvement in adolescent's life f. Lack of supervision and discipline g. Low self-esteem, high population density, high crime (JAACAP, 1997g) 6. Developmental issues are often delayed, dis-rupted, or arrested when adolescents become substance abusers. 7. Strong evidence exists to support a genetic or constitutional risk for SUD. 8. Diagnostic/Screening instruments include the Teen Addiction Severity Index (T-ASI) and Adolescent Drug and Alcohol Diagnostic As-sessment (ADAD). 9. Treatment programs use interventions similar to adult programs (12-step programs, family involvement, reliance on group confrontation)a. Treatment is designed to prevent substance-use behaviors and provide education for patient and family. b. Address coexisting behavioral and psy-chiatric problems; family functioning, academic functioning, and peer relations (JAACAP, 1997g). c. Substance abuse is often a way of dealing with chronic stress and family dysfunc-tion, so entire family must be targeted for intervention. Nursing diagnoses (NANDA, 2009) 1. Injury, risk for 2. Behavior, risk-prone health Biologic origins 1. Common in Mental Retardation2. Associated with congenital deafness and blindness 3. Associated with degenerative and CNS disorders 4. Temporal-lobe epilepsy and severe Schizophrenia 5. May be induced by cer tain psychoactive sub- stances such as amphetamine, in which case the diagnosis of Psychoactive Substance- Induced Organic Mental Disorder should also be made Treatment measures 1. Promote safety and reduced episodes of self- injury. 2. Behavioral techniques (habit reversal differen-tial reinforcement of alternative behavior) and pharmacological interventions have yielded successful results. 3. Dopamine agonists, specifically phenothi-azines, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine (Thorazine) have been the most frequently used medications for treating stereotypic movement/injurious behaviors 4. Haloperidol\u2014Children older than 3 years\u2014 initial dose: 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with gradual increase to 0.5 mg/kg in 5 to 7 days to bring symptoms under control; maximum dose of 100 mg/day. Side effects include sedation, laryngeal edema, brochospasm, 5. The efficacy of opiate antagonists in reducing self-injury is presently under study. Family dynamics/Family therapy\u2014provide fam- ily support and information re: management and pharmacology. Substance-Use Disorders (SUD) in Childhood & Adolescence (Sadock & Sadock, 2007)\u2014See also Substance-Related Disorders chapter 1. Prevalence rate among adolescents is 32%; higher among those at high risk for social impairment.230 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence Nursing diagnoses\u2014same as adults Biologic origins: 1. Neurodevelopmental models suppose a fixed lesion in interaction with a combination of ge- netic or nongenetic factors such as early viral CNS infection, autoimmune mechanisms, or pregnancy/birth complication. 2. Association of Asperger's with psychotic phe-nomena in children has been found. 3. Children with EOS may come from families with greater prevalence of disorder. 4. Chromosomal abnormalities/prenatal insult is possible. 5. Eye-tracking abnormalities reported in adoles- cents at risk for Schizophrenia; smooth pursuit abnormalities, or the inability to track a mov-ing object with the eyes, specific for vulner-ability to Schizophrenia. 6. Information processing deficits could underlie illogical thinking and loose associations. 7. Position Emission Tomography (PET) evalu- ation shows striking right posterior parietal hypometabolism. Mental status examination 1. Prodromal illness, exaggeration of that seen in adults 2. Motor clumsiness3. Speech and language problems4. Delay in language acquisition 5. Early diagnosis of disruptive or avoidant behaviors 6. Positive and negative symptoms7. Auditory hallucinations most frequent, so-matic and visual, less frequent 8. Higher baseline levels of thought disturbance 9. Loose associations and illogical thinking not typically seen in normal children after 7 years of age Biochemical interventions 1. Similar medications used with both adults and children. 2. Atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and clozapine useful due to limited extrapyra-midal side (EPS) effects; side effects of clozap-ine include agranulocytosis, and need close monitoring. 3. Comorbid depression may guide choice of agents in polypharmacy. 4. Since onset of therapeutic effect not apparent until some time after treatment started, rapid switching of agents is not helpful. 5. Stimulant use contraindicated due to capac- ity to induce psychotic symptoms (Volkmar, 1996).10. Level of treatment service decisions can be determined using the Child and Adolescent Levels of Care Utilization Services (CALOCUS) instrument (levels range from 0 to 6; 0 = basic preventative services, whereas 6 = secure/locked inpatient setting with intensive 24-hour care). Early-Onset Schizophrenia (EOS)/ Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia (COS) Definition & signs and symptoms: (APA, 2000; Sadock & Sadock, 2007) 1. Onset of psychotic symptoms before 12 years of age (prepuberty) for COS; after for EOS; on-set before 6 years of age very rare. 2. Similarity of cognitive, neurologic, and lin- guistic deficits suggests the same disorder as adults, with greater severity and chronicity. 3. Same criteria used as for adults, but difficulties in applying criteria to children. Differential diagnosis 1. Autism and other pervasive developmental disorders 2. Neurological disorders3. Multidimensionally impaired (MDI) a. Mood lability and social ineptness present but not social withdrawal b. Most meet criteria for ADHDc. Fleeting hallucinations d. Odd thinking, often in conjunction with language disorder 4. Affective disorder\u2014psychosis associated with Bipolar Disorder often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia 5. Medical conditions and pharmacological agents (stimulants) 6. Substance abuse7. Dissociative states 8. Trauma-related - der (Volkmar, 1996; (JAACAP), 1997f) 10. Easier to diagnose in adolescents (EOS) than children (COS)a. Inability of preschool children to use rules of logic or notions of reality makes it dif-ficult to establish delusions or thought disorder. b. Focus on disorganized speech makes it difficult to evaluate a child with a language disorder. c. Hallucinations difficult to distinguish from sleep-related and other developmental phenomena. d. Need accurate information about premor - bid functioning.231 Treatment Modalities for Mental Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence Nursing research agenda 1. Outcome studies of treatment models that best facilitate patient functioning 2. Impact of illness on siblings Personality Disorders Although personality disorders are not generally included in the disorders of infancy, childhood, and adolescence, the presentation, defenses and symptomatology of these disorders are presaged by the childhood disruptive behavior disorders. According to DSM IV-TR (APA, 2000), one may see the following personality disorders or the initial signs in older children or adolescents:1. Antisocial 2. Avoidant 3. Borderline Signs and symptoms\u2014See Behavioral Syndromes and Disorders of Adult Personality chapter Biologic/Intrapersonal origins 1. Faulty ego functioning may be related to de-velopmental arrests in childhood as well as genetic predisposition and trauma (See Be-havioral Syndromes and Disorders of Adult Personality chapter) 2. Primitive defenses of personality disorders may be triggered by experiences of poor par-enting, family dysfunction, and inadequate caretaking. 3. Children reared in unstable environments have low self-esteem, lack trust, and have poor social skills. 4. Early trauma, including physical abuse and sexual abuse. Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Parents lack empathy and affection; often re- jecting and chaos ridden. 2. Family substance abuse, mental illness, abuse, and violence may be present. 3. Review family and environmental dynamics for Conduct Disorder. treat Ment Modalities \u0088 for Mental disorders in Childhood and adolesCenCe Individual psychotherapy\u2014current treatment of child and adolescent mental disorders involves a multimodal approach (Keltner et al., 2007; Sadock & Sadock, therapy\u2014historically, the commonly used modality with children; play therapy is Psychotherapeutic interventions 1. Individual therapy based on the following factors:a. Developmental stage b. Degree of active thought disorder c. Ability to tolerate intimacy, and assess-ment of the degree of importance of the relationship to the child d. Encouragement of focus on reality of out- side world e. Refocusing disordered thinkingf. Setting limits on inappropriate behavior (Jongsma, Peterson & McInnis, 1996) 2. Supportive therapy based on whether expres- sion or suppression of affect is desired 3. Expressive therapy4. Social skills training5. Special educational interventions Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Parents often report children appeared normal at birth. 2. Families experience profound sadness, guilt, and self-blame; older theories of \"schizophre- nogenic mothers\" and cold, rejecting par - ents may still be held by some mental health professionals. 3. Parents may view themselves as victims of child's disorder. 4. Lack of respite care and services places addi-tional burdens on family. 5. Family therapy with psychoeducational ap-proaches fosters clear communication. Group approaches\u2014enhance socialization skills Milieu interventions 1. Facilitate child's highest level of functioning. 2. Facilitate age appropriate skills. 3. Consistency and predictability essential. 4. Use isolation sparingly to facilitate child's inte-gration into unit (Johnson, 1995). 5. Staff needs education and help with child's un- even developmental presentation and variety in functioning. 6. Expectations must be realistic. Community resources 1. Support groups for parents2. National Association for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) 3. Case management services to coordinate di- verse services 4. Federation of F amilies for Children's Mental Health 5. Parents of Schizophrenics232 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence Family dynamics/Family therapy 1. Helps family achieve healthy coping and inter- rupts behaviors that maintain child or adoles-cents symptoms 2. Usually a mandatory component of a child's therapeutic environment; parental involve-ment is strong predictor of positive outcomes for child 3. Problems treated: a. Communication and expression of feel- ings among family members b. Limit-setting skills c. Rules, consequences, and rewardsd. Dealing with separation dynamics Milieu interventions 1. Physical setting a. Age-appropriate furniture that is mobile for arranging small conversation area b. Games, puzzles, books and toys geared to developmental level of residents c. Provision for safetyd. Sociopetal structure with all client rooms entering a central family room to foster interaction and support safety e. Warm, home-like ambience with pictures, plants, padded furniture f. Provision for privacy in sleeping, dress- ing, and bathing while allowing necessary monitoring and supervision g. Respect for children's and adolescents' need for own \"space\" for possessions, school work, writing, etc. h. Provision of active orientation to treatment(1) Bulletin boards with calendars, sched-ules, staff names (2) Patient names, assignments, primary therapist and staff member, privilege level and point system 2. Structured treatment programs a. Philosophy\u2014child and adolescent pro- grams often based on a family systems model with developmental perspective(1) Inpatient unit becomes a family that provides for expression of feelings, effective communication between members, development of cop-ing skills, and positive recreational experiences. (2) Family life simulated with meal preparation and other routine activi-ties; birthdays and celebrations are planned and implemented. b. Rules, limit setting, and consequences (1) Unit rule booksan intervention defined as the purposeful use of toys and other equipment to assist the child in communicating his or her perception of the world and to help him or her master en-vironment (Zimmerman, 1997); play therapy has not received the empirical support that other therapies (CBT, interpersonal therapy) have experienced. Behavioral play (practice/rehearsal exercises) can help child learn and experience new ways of behaving. 3. Behavioral modification\u2014behavior therapists actively direct treatment.a. Most useful when implemented in home, classroom, and with individual child. b. Parents taught behavioral management strategies. c. Children and adolescents learn self- control and relaxation techniques. d. Treatment goals are mutually set with child, therapist, and parents. e. Compatible with solution focused, short term approaches. (Zimmerman, 1997). 4. Cognitive therapy is beneficial for children aged 9 to 10 and older; cognitive therapy en-ables child and adolescent to utilize coping self-statements and to overcome dysfunctional cognitive distortions. 5. Skills training has as its goal helping children achieve competence in mastering develop-mental tasks and to make use of environmen-tal and personal resources to achieve a good outcome (Bloomquist, 1996) Group approaches 1. Childhood a. Social skills groupsb. Emotional expressionc. Behavioral expression d. Protection from unsafe environmente. Coping with divorce, separation, and blended families f. Recovery groups for children of substance abusing parents g. Art therapy groups for identification and expression of feeling 2. Adolescencea. Peer relationshipsb. Substance abuse recovery/12-step groupc. Communication with parentsd. Coping with divorce, separation, and blended families e. Critical incident debriefingf. Decreasing impulsive and high-risk behavior233 Treatment Modalities for Mental Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence 4. Final dose may be higher than in adults be- cause of metabolic and organ differences. 5. Clinical observations of effects are essential because of absence of carefully controlled studies of pharmacotherapy in children. 6. Variation in dosing between adults and chil-dren considers difference in size, metabolism, and desired action. 7. Combined pharmacotherapy is being used safely in children; same considerations in introducing multiple medicines apply to chil-dren as to adults. 8. Antihistamines lower seizure threshold and cause delirium and worsening of tic disorders. 9. Lithium is cleared rapidly by children, so they may require higher doses to stabilize a mood disorder. 10. Valproate (Depakote) may be hepatotoxic in children younger than age 10. 11. MAOIs are contraindicated in pediatric popu- lation due to dietary and other risks. 12. Children both metabolize neuroleptics more rapidly and are more sensitive to their main effects. 13. Stimulants are first line of treatment for atten- tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and this practice is generally continued through adolescence into adulthood. 14. SSRIs are generally considered safe and ef- fective for treatment of depression and some anxiety disorders in children; however, an increased risk for suicide among children, ado-lescents, and young adults exists for this class. 15. Buspirone (BuSpar) may be helpful in manag- ing aggression and agitation in children with Mental Retardation or a Pervasive Develop-ment Disorder (PDD) (Zimmerman, 1997) Medication management for adolescents 1. Establishment of trust is essential because of developmental issues regarding control by authority. 2. Adolescents are more susceptible to extrapyra-midal side effects. 3. Teens have poor fluid intake, which makes them susceptible to constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention. 4. Vital signs need monitoring for potential hypotension. 5. Drowsiness may interfere with school. 6. Abuse of medications, including selling medi-cations at school, especially anti-anxiety or sympathomimetic agents is a risk factor. 7. Adolescent, family, and school professionals should understand indications, responses, in-teractions and compliance issues to facilitate proper adjustment of medication dosage.(2) Consistency in application of rules and consequences (3) Peer or buddy system for older chil- dren and adolescents (4) Positive reinforcement rather than punishment (5) Point system for privileges with higher points indicating a higher level with more privileges (6) Recognition in community meeting(7) Limit setting on a continuum with positive social interaction at one end and time out on the other(a) Positive social interaction such as smiles, nods, and encouragement (b) Extinction is used for mildly in- appropriate behaviors by with-holding positive reinforcements or ignoring behavior; inappropri-ate behavior usually escalates after period of ignoring prior to extinguishing (c) Providing direction(d) Verbal reprimand or specific statements that point out conse-quences if inappropriate behavior continues (e) Privilege removal that is natural consequence to the behavior (f) Time out to child to reflect and re- gain control and equating to one minute per year of development (Johnson,1995; Antai-Otong, 1995) c. Treatment level system\u2014organized, con- crete way to show child's progress through treatment(1) Expectations and privileges increase with advance to next treatment level or phase. (2) Child or adolescent may earn a set number of points each day; increased privileges are attached to higher levels. d. School program must be provided as part of inpatient, partial, or residential pro-grams for children and adolescents. Medication management considerations for children1. Children differ in response to medication's main and side effects. 2. Children may metabolize and eliminate medi- cations more rapidly. 3. When medicating children, start slow, titrate carefully, use lowest effective dose.234 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence overnight; or is 14 years old or younger and voluntarily chooses not to come home when expected; or child older than 15 years stays away for more than two nights. 2. 500,000 to 2 million youngsters (mainly ado-lescents) run away from home each year and another 900,000 have no home (Mohr, 1998)\u201468% of all runaways are older adolescents (aged 15-17)a. Situational runaways\u2014largest subgroup; circumstances include:(1) Eldest daughters seeking relief from major household responsibilities (del-egating family dynamics) (2) Adolescents used as pawns in parental conflicts (3) Parents trying to obstruct normal ado- lescent separation process (binding family dynamics) (4) Reunion fantasy causing adolescents to run away as a ploy to pull parents together b. Departure runaways\u2014depressed and an- gry about treatment at home and hungry for affection and a sense of belonging; es-cape is a genuine survival tactic c. Throwaways\u2014youth who are asked to leave home (expelling family dynamics); usually endure lifestyles similar to depar-ture runaways; approximately 200,000 to 600,000 have been thrown out, agree to leave, or are removed by authorities (Ham-mer, Finkelhor, & Sedlak, 2002; Mohr, 1998). 3. Circumstances departure run- aways and throwaways include the following:a. Parental criminal activity, violence, alco- holism, and addiction b. Overall chaotic home environment c. Physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and neglect d. Conflicts over same-sex orientation 4. Population of children and adolescents with no social service supporta. Become homeless street people and often turn to prostitution, drug dealing, stealing and panhandling to survive; most can-not return home due to high degree of dysfunction. b. Are vulnerable to exploitation; group at highest possible risk for rape, assault, homicide, depression, suicide, drug over-dosing, pregnancies, poor nutrition, poor hygiene, sleep deprivation, and STDs including HIV/AIDS and 1998).8. Adolescent, family, school, and other psychiat-ric professionals must have reasonable expec-tations of medications. 9. Monitor for potential overdose when patient is experiencing suicidal thoughts (Botz & Bidwell-Cerone, 1997). Adolescent Behavioral Issues Violence (Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2009) 1. Adolescent acting-out behaviors continue, but the juvenile crime rate has declined from an all-time high rate in 1993 (26% of all violent crimes); juvenile crime rate decreased in 2007 to 17% (all such victimizations reportedly in-volved a juvenile offender); 56% of all violent crimes committed by a juvenile involved mul-tiple perpetrators. 2. Rate of victimization of teens (ages 12-17) is twice that of the general population. 3. Girls 14 to 15 years of age have highest risk of any age group of being raped (Johnson, 1997). 4. Violence by juveniles usually acted out on other juveniles; nearly one million juveniles between 12 and 19 years of age are raped, robbed, or assaulted, twice that of the general population. 5. Lethality of teenage violence is increasing; teenage violent death rate rose 13% between 1985 and 1991. 6. 12% to 31% of the general adolescent popula-tion have elevated depressive symptomatology placing them at risk for Major Depression and suicide. 7. Positive correlation between juvenile violent behavior and adult violent behavior. Youth gangs and violence 1. Results from a National Youth Gang Center (NYGC) survey in 2007 (Egley & O'Donnell, 2009) indicate that gang activity among youth has begun to rise (2007 prevalence rate of 35%), following a low in 2001(24%). 2. Antisocial behavior in adolescence is positively associated with depression. 3. Conduct disorder is associated with involve- ment with a delinquent peer group. 4. Victims of teen violence are being killed rather than injured (Johnson, 1997); increasingly, firearms are involved in adolescent homicide and suicide; teenage homicide rate has dou-bled since 1985. Runaways (Hammer, Finkelhor, & Sedlak, 2002) 1. Definition\u2014A runaway child is one who leaves home without permission and stays away 235 Treatment Modalities for Mental Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence d.

Involvement of parent with child Medical neglect 1. Caregivers' failure to provide prescribed medi- cal treatment for their children, e.g., immuni-zations, prescribed medication, recommended surgery 2. May involve clash between parents' religious beliefs and recommendations of medical community Mental health neglect\u2014caregivers' refusal to com- ply with recommended corrective or therapeutic procedures Educational neglect\u2014failure to comply with state regulations for school attendance (Erickson & Egelund, 1996) Physical Abuse (measures of incidence and prevalence rates can vary based on restrictiveness of definition) Child characteristics related to abuse 1. Early health problems increase risk, including: a. Medical b. Intellectual c. Developmental aberrations 2. Temperament/behavior a. Difficult temperament (impulsivity, crying) b. Conduct problemsc.

Of the fatalities, 75.7% were younger than 4 years of age. In-fants (age birth to 1 year) had the highest rate of victimization (2.2%); more than half were female (51.5%) and nearly half were white (46.1%), although boys were more likely to die as a result of the abuse/neglect. 2. The most common for m of maltreatment is neglect (56.0%); followed by physical abuse (10.8%); sexual abuse (7.6%); and psychologi-cal maltreatment (4.2%). 3. Perpetrators of the child maltreatment were parents (79.9%) or relatives of the victim (6.6%); female (56.5%), and under the age of 40 years (74.8%). Of the perpetrators who were child daycare providers, nearly 24 percent (23.9%) committed sexual abuse. Neglect\u2014may be impossible to estimate actual scope because neglect is easily overlooked. Physical neglect\u2014most widely recognized and commonly identified form of neglect; includes fail- ure to protect from harm or danger and provide for child's basic physical needs (shelter, food, clothing) Emotional neglect\u2014more difficult to document or substantiate, often beginning when children are too young to communicate or know they are not receiving appropriate care1. Extreme form of neglect leads to nonorganic failure to thrive. 2. American Humane Association describes emo-tional neglect as passive or passive/aggressive inattention to child's emotional needs, nurtur-ing, or emotional well-being & Egelund, 1996). 3. \"Psychologically unavailable\" parents overlook infants' cues and signals, especially cries and pleas for warmth and comfort. 4. Has serious long term consequences for child; emotionally neglected children expect their needs will not be met, and do not even try to solicit care and warmth; they expect failure, therefore lack motivation. 5. Neglectful parents: a. Lack an understanding of children's be-havior and parent-child relationship. b. Experience a great deal of stress.c. Are socially isolated or unsupported.236 ChaPter 10 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence 4. Sexual exploitation 5. Child pornography6.

Structured and semistructured interview pro- tocols (e.g., Cognitive Interview, Step-Wise Interview) have been established to increase accuracy of information obtained, and to minimize mistaken or false information from children who become confused, frightened, overwhelmed, or intimidated with the inter-view process (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). 3. Recommended that role of evaluator and ther - apist be kept separate (American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children [APSAC], 1997). 4. Sexual acts are considered abusive when the following are present:a. Power differentialb. Knowledge differentialc. Gratification differential 5. History is most difficult phase of evaluation and most important. 6.

Higher incidence of PTSD 2. Higher incidence of dissociative disorder 3. Greater symptom severity4. Vicarious traumatization of the therapist be- cause of greater impact on victim Confidentiality Applies regardless of patient's age. Information cannot be disclosed to outsiders with- out parental consent. Decision to reveal information to parents is relative to child or adolescent's developmental age. 1. May be developmentally inappropriate to seek child's \"consent\" for disclosure to parents of information revealed during therapy. 2. May be developmentally and therapeutically appropriate to safeguard an adolescent's dis-closures, even from parents. 3. Nurse should set ground rules for confidential- ity during assessment/evaluation. If parent has abused or neglected a child, disclo- sure of confidential information to maltreating parent may be contraindicated regardless of the child's age. Nurse should be familiar with legal concept of privilege. Written records, notes, videotapes, drawings, and photographs may be subpoenaed.1. Attorney issuing subpoena cannot require/force professional to produce records. 2. Subpoena does not override confidentiality requirement. 3. Patient should be consulted when subpoena for records is received.

Deinstitutionalization, which began in the 1970s, has reduced the census of the pub-lic mental hospitals established by state governments. b. Over the last 40 years, public mental hos-pital census has declined, while the num-ber of admissions has risen. c. Public mental hospitals have seen an in-crease in admission rates of younger, vio-lent patients. d. The goals of deinstitutionalization are:(1) To save clients from debilitating ef-fects of lengthy, restrictive periods of hospitalization. (2) To return the client to home and community as soon as possible after hospitalization. (3) To maintain the client in the commu-nity for as long as possible. e. In general, the public mental hospital pa-tient population decreased by returning the patients to their families, transferring them to nursing homes, and by shifting them into the community, where unfor-tunately some became homeless street people because community support did not work. 3. Ambulatory settingsa. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC)(1) The CMHC Act passed by Congress in 1963 supported mental health centers and deinstitutionalization in all 50 states.Mental Healt HCare \u0088 Delivery SySteM The number and variety of psychiatric-mental health delivery care settings have both greatly in-creased since the 1970s. In the United States, the major focus has been in treatment of mental disorders, not the prevention of mental disorders. Types of settings 1. Acute care inpatient settings, either psychiat-ric units in general hospitals or in psychiatric hospitalsa. Often psychiatric units specialize in adults, children, adolescents, alcohol, sub-stance abuse or geriatrics. b. In recent years, changing reimbursement of inpatient stays has resulted in shorter psychiatric lengths of stays. c. From this decline in hospitalization days, many psychiatric units offer an array of services including partial hospitalization, outpatient, and home care. d. Today, most patients that are admitted to the hospital are in crisis with the treat-ment goal of stabilization. e. Inpatient treatment is focused on pre-venting harm to oneself or others and the need for multidisciplinary assessment and stabilization. 2. Public mental hospital settings11 The Larger Mental Health Environment 254 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment face-to-face evaluations of patients 24 hours a day.(a) Most of these programs are com-munity-based with some operat-ing in conjunction with a general hospital emergency department. (b) Emergency services were origi-nally targeted for suicide preven-tion and outpatient treatment of acute psychosis. (c) Crisis programs provide care for the acutely decompensated chronically mentally ill patient living in the community (11) Psychiatric emergency services have continued to evolve in the community over the last 20 years as most urban settings have centralized emergency services in one or a few sites.(a) Many rural areas are coordinating networks of emergency services at a limited number of sites, usually in a general hospital. (b) Many emergency services have expanded roles so that patients can stay for several days. (c) Some programs offer community outreach programs whereby staff go into the community to work with patients. (d) Many emergency services start long-term medication regimes such as antidepressants. (12) The current state of mobile crisis ser-vices by a 50-state survey:(a) By 1995, 73% of the states had mobile emergency services and provided services in private homes, hospital emergency rooms, residential programs, shel-ters, correctional facilities, bus and train stations, and general hospital medical units. (b) Mobile crisis units were reported to provide for patients and families: earlier interventions, improved access to care, support for families, minimizing patient's trauma (Geller et al, 1995). (c) A 2009 Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) report described reduced in-patient hospitalization, shorter stays if hospitalized, and a sig-nificant reduction in healthcare costs for children in crisis who were managed by a mobile (2) This legislation represented a shift from the focus of the mentally ill in public mental hospitals to flexible, community care. (3) A principle in the development of CMHC was that people with mental illness have a right to treatment in the least restrictive environment. (4) In 1965, the five essential services for a federally funded CMHC were in-patient services, outpatient services, partial hospitalization, and consulta-tion and education. (5) The legislation provided federal fund-ing to local communities for construc-tion and staffing of CMHC, with the understanding that funding would eventually shift to state and local resources. (6) In 1975, seven other essential ser-vices were added including children's services, geriatric services, aftercare, state hospital prescreening, drug abuse treatment, alcohol abuse treat-ment, and transitional housing. (7) After deinstitutionalization, the pa-tients were discharged from public mental health hospitals to a CMHC system so that the CMHC staff could provide adequate follow-up. (8) CMHC experienced the following problems working with discharged public mental health hospital patients:(a) Many discharged patients found it difficult to adjust to independent community living because pa-tients needed a slow, gradual in-troduction to independent living. (b) Patients had difficulty keeping ap-pointments and complying with medication schedules. (c) Many patients became involved in a revolving door syndrome or had many, short hospital admissions. (d) Some discharged patients did not receive the anticipated ser-vices due to homelessness or incarceration. (9) CMHC are successful in working with chronic patients by using crisis intervention, extensive community outreach programs, supportive living arrangements, and work programs. (10) Psychiatric emergency crisis/walk-in programs are centralized community mental health programs that offer 255 Mental Healthcare Delivery System groups over the continuum of care, from an inpatient setting to community-based care such as an outpatient clinic or home. c. Case management, a standard of PMH nursing care (ANA, APNA, ISPN, 2007), is a clinical system that focuses on the ac-countability of an identified individual or group by:(1) Coordinating patient or group patient care across an illness episode or con-tinuum of care (for example, clinic to hospital to home) (2) Ensuring and facilitating achievement of quality and clinical cost outcomes (3) Negotiating, obtaining, and coordi-nating services and resources needed by patients/families (4) Intervening at key points for individ-ual patients (for example, using criti-cal pathways) (5) Addressing and resolving patient pat-terns that cause poor quality-cost out-comes within collaborative teams (6) Creating opportunities and systems of health care to enhance patient outcomes (Easterling, Avie, Wesley & Chimner, 1995) d. Community mental health nurses assist patients with a range of psychological problems and are concerned with the pa-tient's stress, coping and adaptation. e. Community mental health nurses assist individuals and families to anticipate the course of events in the mental healthcare system. f. Psychiatric mental health nursing in home health(1) In recent years, there has been an in-creased need for psychiatric nurses in the home. (2) A criterion for providing home health is usually that the patients are home-bound or their illnesses result in them not being able to leave their home. (3) Three groups of common homebound patients include:(a) People living alone especially the elderly (b) People with medical illnesses, es-pecially chronic illnesses (c) Chronically mentally ill people (4) The psychiatric nurse may provide:(a) Direct caregiving, such as as-sisting a depressed patient to perform his/her activities of daily livingmultidisciplinary crisis team in Milwaukee, WI\u2014report available at: http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=1719 4. Day treatment programs and partial hospi-talization programs (PHP) are ambulatory treatment programs that include the major, diagnostic, medical, psychiatric, and prevo-cational treatment modalities designed for patients with serious mental disorders who require coordinated, intensive, and multidis-ciplinary treatment not provided in the usual outpatient setting. The length of these pro-grams varies from 4-to-8 hours per day and from 1-to-5 days a week, and programming can occur at nearly any time of the day (day-time, evening, or night) (Keltner, Schwecke, & Bostrom, 2007; Rosie, Azim, Piper, & Joyce, 1995).a. The four functions of partial hospitaliza-tion include:(1) Treatment of acutely ill patients who would be inpatients (2) Rehabilitation of patients who are in transition from acute inpatient to out-patient care (3) Intensive treatment of patients who do not require inpatient care but who may benefit from more intensive care than it is possible to provide on an outpatient basis (4) Long-term maintenance of chronic psychiatric patients b. For maximum treatment effectiveness, partial hospitals should match the func-tional level of patients with treatment intensity. (a) An intensive group-oriented psychotherapy program may lead to deterioration of acutely ill patients. (b) If low functioning patients are treated with patients needing intensive group-oriented psycho-therapy, the intensity of the pro-gram may be diluted. 5. Other community settingsa. There are many psychiatric nurse roles, including case managers, psychiatric home health nurses, psychiatric commu-nity outreach nurses, psychiatric nurses who practice in vocational and rehabilita-tion centers, and psychiatric nurses who work in a variety of collaborative practice settings. b. A psychiatric nurse who is a case man-ager can work with patients, families, and 256 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment (b) Counseling, such as assisting a depressed patient to modify nega-tive thinking (c) Education, such as teaching a depressed patient about his/her antidepressant medication side effects (d) Referral, such as scheduling an appointment when the patient needs medication adjustment (e) Health promotion for patients and family, such as guiding the families in preparing balanced nutritional meals (5) A community mental health nurse who provides psychotherapy for in-dividuals, families, or groups should possess a graduate degree and be na-tionally certified. 6. Outpatient & private practicea. Since the 1960s, psychiatric nurses have engaged in private practice, especially clinical specialists who hold national certification, e.g., American Nurses Cre-dentialing Center (ANCC) Certification in Advanced Practice (Peplau, 1990).(1) ANCC certification exams for psy-chiatric nursing include specialty certification in psychiatric and mental health (PMH) nursing for RNs, and several advanced practice certifications:(a) Adult PMH clinical nurse specialist (b) Child/Adolescent PMH clinical nurse specialist (c) Adult PMH nurse practitioner (d) Family PMH nurse practitioner (2) Building concerns about the potential fragmentation of advanced practice PMH nursing suggested by multiple certification titles prompted an analy-sis of the job skills associated with the various areas of advanced practice PMH nursing. b. Findings from a collaborative study in-volving the ANCC and American Psychi-atric Nurses Association (APNA) found artificial divisions and considerable over-lap among the advanced practice roles (of the 335 PMH advanced practice tasks, 332 were deemed essential for both CNS & NP practitioners) (Rice, Moller, DePascale, & Skinner, 2007). The findings prompted recommendation for development of one exam for advance practice nurses certify-ing as PMH CNS or NP.c. Nurses can practice alone or with other healthcare professionals. d. Nurses' private practice can include a vari-ety of functions, including individual and family assessment; individual, group, and family psychotherapy; and prescriptive authority for psychotropic medication, de-pending applicable restrictions of practice as defined by the state nursing practice act, as well as rules for reimbursement. e. In general, barriers to Certified Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialists include difficulty in obtaining third-party reimbursement, limited autonomy in organized practice settings, and low salaries (Merwin, Fox & Bell, 1996; Puskar & Bernardo, 2002). f. The following are important consider-ations in working in private practice. The private practitioner:(1) Has the client as the primary obligation. (2) Determines who the client will be. (3) Determines the techniques to be used in service to this client. (4) Determines practice professionally, not bureaucratically. (5) Receives a payment directly from or on behalf of the client. (6) Is educated in a graduate program. (7) Is sufficiently experienced as an ad-vanced practice nurse. (8) Adheres to advanced practice nursing values, standards, and ethics and is professionally responsible. (9) Is licensed and certified where appli-cable to engage in private practice. g. Disadvantages of private practice include:(1) Economic uncertainties and possible financial difficulties (2) Professional isolation, loneliness, and lack of advancement (3) Malpractice suits (4) Total responsibility for professional accountability and professional competence h. Guidelines for establishing a viable private practice(1) Evaluate whether solo or group prac-tice is desirable. (2) Create a financial management system. (3) Obtain malpractice and office liability insurance. (4) Establish criteria for hiring employees and using consultants. (5) Ensure that private practice is geo-graphically accessible.257 Types of Healthcare Insurance Plans Organizational changes needed in managed care include: 1. Promotion of team-based care or creating a seamless organization 2. Aggressive promotion of self-care 3. Case management for high-cost, high-use members 4. Continuous improvement emphasis Impact of managed care on hospital nurses (Buer - haus, 1994)1.

ManageD Care\u2014an internal \u0088 forCe of C Hange Wit Hin tHe Mental Healt H Delivery SySteM Managed care is a healthcare strategy designed to achieve the positive outcomes that can result from adopting price competition while controlling for unfavorable effects. For competitive lo w prices, there must be a variety of healthcare providers such as hospitals, physi-cians, and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). For competitive low prices, healthcare providers must keep their costs low by, for example, using cost containment strategies. Along with low prices, healthcare providers must provide a quality service. Healthcare changes as the result of managed care in the following ways:1. Change of provider incentives, change from fee-for-service reimbursement to capitation (See changes resulting with Mental Health & Addiction Equity Act of 2008\u2014capitation is prohibited with this law)a. Fee-for-service reimbursement is the tra-ditional method of paying healthcare pro-viders, where providers determine what healthcare services the patient needs, and the insurer passively pays for each service received by the patient according to the reasonable charge in a given geographical area. b. Capitation is a preset amount of money allocated to provide set services for a population over a stated period of time, regardless of service used. Typically, an employer or third-party payor will con-tract with a behavioral managed care company or a provider organization to provide comprehensive mental health care for a lump sum payment. The man-aged care company and/or the provider organization then decides what care the patient needs. In capitation, the managed care company and/or the provider organi-zation incurs more risk if healthcare costs for a group of people exceed the capitated payment.258 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment (c) Nursing roles with other health- care disciplines 2.

(5) Increase visibility and use the politi-cians' priorities to speak your needs. (6) Empower others by sharing knowl-edge and increasing team building. Political issues 1. Current healthcare legislative issues include concerns about:a. Healthcare coverage for the uninsured and other vulnerable populations such as chil-dren, women, and the chronically ill b. Developing and implementing a national healthcare plan to assure adequate health care, including mental health care, for all citizens 2. The care of people with mental health disor-ders is challenged by their vulnerability and lack of voice in the political process. 3. Key past mental health legislationa. In 1935, the Social Security Act influenced mental health care because of the shift from state to the federal government in the care of ill people. b. In 1955, the Mental Health Study Act cre- ated the Joint Commission on Mental Ill-ness and Health that recommended shift of patient populations from state hospital in exchange for a promise to provide all health care required during a defined period of time. Consum-ers have restricted choice of healthcare providers, no cost for services beyond insurance payment, restricted choice to hospitals, reduced cost to em-ployers who buy the insurance (Cleverley, 1997). Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) are pro- grams that contract with healthcare providers to provide healthcare services to consumers, usu-ally at a discounted rate. Consumers have some restricted choice by using contracted healthcare providers, copay for services, access to contracted hospitals, some reduced cost to employers who buy the insurance (Cleverley, 1997). Traditional fee-for-service insurance plan\u2014 Consumers have freedom of choice of healthcare providers, usually pay a deductible and 20% of outpatient charges, unlimited access to choice of hospitals. Employers usually pay a higher cost but employees have freedom of choice. Combinations and variations of HMOs, PPOs and traditional fee-for-service types can be available. external forCeS interaCting \u0088 WitH tHe Mental HealtH SySteM Social issues 1. Role behaviora. Stereotyping behavior is useful in examin- ing roles such as men and women, nurse and physician, and female patient and male therapist, male patient and female therapist. b. In general, there are distinct beliefs about the characteristics of men and women, including:(1) Male characteristics reflect competen-cies such as competitiveness, inde-pendence, and objectivity. (2) Females are perceived as being oppo-site of these characteristics and there-fore dependent, noncompetitive, and subjective. (3) Men are perceived as being blunt and unable to express feelings. (4) Women are seen as having tact, awareness of other's feelings, and an ability to express their feelings. (5) These sex role stereotypes can impact many areas of a person's life including:(a) A person's self-esteem and pre-scribed role in society (b) The nurse-client therapeutic relationship259 External Forces Interacting with the Mental Health System systems to community mental health systems. c. In 1963, the Community Mental Health Centers Act created community mental health centers and led to deinstitutional-ization. Federal funds were to match state funds in creating CMHC. d. In 1975, the Developmental Disabilities Act focused on the rights and treatment of people with developmental disabilities and provided a foundation for individuals with mental disorders. e. In 1977, the President's Commission on Mental Health supported community mental health centers, protection of hu-man rights, and insurance for mentally ill people. f. In 1986, the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act provided advo-cacy programs for mentally ill people. g. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act promoted employment opportuni-ties and prohibited discrimination for all people with disabilities including mental disorders. h. In 1998, the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 prohibited lifetime or annual limita-tions on mental health coverage for cer-tain insured employees. g. In 2008, the Paul Wellstone & Pete Do-menici Mental Health Parity & Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (P .L. 110-343) amended the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act (to take effect January 2010). The law does not require health insurance plans to provide mental health and substance abuse ben-efits, but prohibits employer healthcare plans from imposing caps or limitations on mental health treatment or substance-use disorder benefits that aren't applied to nonpsychiatric benefits (Retrieved from: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/healthins reformforconsume/04_thementalhealth parityact.asp) 4. Use of seclusion/restraints\u2014within the Patient Rights Document, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published strict rules for the use of seclusion and restraints.a. Seclusion and restraint are defined as follows:(1) Restraint\u2014the physical control of a patient to prevent injury to patient, staff, and others (2) Seclusion\u2014the involuntary con- finement of a patient to a specially designed room for their own safety (O'Brien, Kennedy & Ballard, 2008)b. The use of seclusion and restraints should occur only after all other therapeutic inter-ventions have been exhausted. All patients have the right to be free from any form of restraint (physical or chemical) (2009 up-date of the CMS document retrieved from: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/ Downloads/som107ap_a_hospitals.pdf). 5. National healthcare agenda, under the Public Health Service, Healthy People 2010 (US De-partment and Health and Human Services, 2000) creates a national focus on promoting health and preventing disease. The following are areas related to mental health and mental disorders:a. Reduce suicide, especially among children and adolescents and in jails. b. Reduce mental disorders among children, adults, and elderly. c. Among those with serious mental ill-ness, reduce homelessness, increase employment. d. Reduce relapse among those with eating disorders. e. Increase the numbers receiving screening for mental disorders when receiving care in primary healthcare setting. f. Increase treatment for people with depres-sive disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, sub-stance abuse and co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders. g. Increase access to care for people with personal and emotional problems. h. Increase cultural competence of providers. i. Among recipients, increase satisfaction with mental healthcare services 6. Strategies for psychiatric-mental health nurses to serve as change agents for addressing men-tal health issues include:a. Write and verbalize concerns and solu-tions to legislative bodies and the media. b. Seek membership on community commit- tees that recommend or formulate policy. c. Be familiar with the legislative process, ob-taining copies of bills and making presen-tations at local, state, and federal hearings. Financial issues 1. The United States finances health care by both public and private monies. 2. With the passage of Medicare and Medicaid legislation in 1965, the federal government embarked upon a significant subsidy to health care, greatly increasing access to care (McCloskey & Grace, 1994). 3. Expenditures for mental health treatment grew from $33 billion in 1986 to $100 billion in 2003 (Mark et al., 2007).260 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment insurer provider panels, requests for the following information are usually included in the credential-ing application:i. Advance practice PMH nurse's identifying informa-tion (name, address, birth date, social security number, military service, etc.) ii. Licensure information (RN, state advance practice autho-rization, specialty area) iii. National provider identifier (NPI) number iv. DEA license number (if pre-scriptive authority includes controlled substances) v. Professional liability coverage vi. National certification in area of specialty vii. Any professional sanctions viii. Practice type and location e. Billing for private practice (Billings, 1993)(1) Not all clients have or want to work with insurance; some will pay for ser-vices themselves. (2) Give new clients a handout so the fi-nancial arrangement will be clear. (3) Before the first visit, have the client check with their insurance to see what services are covered or whether visit needs to be preauthorized. (4) On the first visit, use an initial data form to obtain all necessary infor-mation, such as date of birth, social security number, and insurance information. (5) If the client is filing for his/her own reimbursement, provide the necessary information. (6) If the client requests your assistance, approach the insurer with the as-sumption that you will be reimbursed. (7) If need be, apply to become an autho-rized provider. (8) One way to increase referrals is to de-velop a relationship with the referral source. f. Questions that assist in determining pri-vate practice charges include:(1) How much do other advanced prac-tice nurses providing a similar service in the area charge? (2) How much do other similar helping professionals in the area charge? (3) What is your level of experience and education?4. Since 1986, more mental health care is being provided in the outpatient setting with an in-creased use of psychotropics. 5. Reimbursement for advanced practice nursinga. With the Budget Reconciliation Act in 1997 (the legislation included the Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act), Con-gress authorized direct Medicare reim-bursement for all advance practice nurses (at 85% of physician fee rate), regardless of geographic practice area (Buppert, 2008; Frakes & Evans, 2006). b. Types of reimbursements (McCloskey & Grace, 1994)(1) Fee-for-service reimbursement\u2014current trends throughout the country indicate that probably less than 20% of mental health care will be delivered through the traditional fee-for-service model. (2) Medicare reimburses health care for the elderly and some disabilities by this federal program. Hospitals are now reimbursed a flat amount based (Diagnostic Related Group) upon the patient's medical diagnosis, age, surgical procedure, and comorbidity (existence of other medical condi-tions). Home care, including psychi-atric home care, is reimbursed under Medicare. (3) Medicaid is a federally assisted and state-administered program for the indigent. c. Contract payment and services(1) Nurses can develop contracts to pro-vide specific services independently for patient subgroups being served by HMOs or other healthcare providers. (2) Many times, these providers are in-terested in the cost of the service and who can legally and safely provide that service. (3) Service contracting is a matter of de- fining a required service for a group of clients that is difficult to provide with existing staff. (4) Reasons for promoting contractual li-aisons (Marshall, 1994) include: defin-ing a particular population, increasing profitability for selected healthcare professionals, and lowering the cost for third-party payers and facilities. d.

Planninga. Using epidemiology for planning priorities (1) Epidemiology is the study of disease in human populations. (2) Epidemiologists are concerned with patterns of disease such as commu-nicable, congenital, and chronic ill-nesses within a population. (3) Epidemiology focuses on character-izing health outcomes in terms of what, who, where, when, and why. For example, what is the disease? Who is affected by the disease? When do dis-ease related events occur? Why did the disease related events occur? (4) Epidemiological research has shown a positive relationship between physi-cal and psychiatric disorders, and that the strength of this relationship varies among different populations. (5) Epidemiological findings assist re-searchers and funding agencies to establish priorities to guide future research. (6) Epidemiology has been useful in examining mental illness caused by poisoning, chemicals, drug usage, nutritional deficiencies, biological agents, and electrolyte imbalances (Stuart & Sundeen, 1996). (7) The following epidemiological triangle is useful to explain the presence or absence of illness:(a) Host or population characteristics in the occurrence, nonoccur-rence, or prognosis of an illness\u2014includes factors such as age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, (4) What do third-party payers say are \"reasonable and customary charges\" for professionals in your area? (5) What is the most attractive rate for the clientele that you hope to attract? g. Private practice in managed care (God-schalx, 1996)\u2014In fee-for-service reim-bursement, the nurse must evaluate the client to obtain a diagnosis and to match the client to available services. Reimburse-ment is based upon the diagnosis. leaDerSHip anD ManageMent \u0088 Leadership theory and roles 1. Leadership is the process of influencing others toward goal setting. 2. Gardner identifies the tasks of leaders as: en-visioning goals, affirming values, motivating, managing, achieving workable unity, explain-ing, serving as a symbol, representing the group, and renewing their energy (Swansburg, 1996). 3. Early leadership studies focused on identifying leadership traits in individuals, such as intel-ligence, personality, and abilities. 4. Studies of leadership styles in the 1930s by Lewin and colleagues examined the decision-making styles of leaders:a. Autocratic\u2014leaders make decisions alone. b. Democratic\u2014leaders involve followers in the decision making process. c. Laissez-faire\u2014leaders are permissive and allow followers to have complete autonomy. 5. Hersey and Blanchard's Life-Cycle of Situ- ational Leadership (Swansburg, 1996)a. Assumes that the type of leadership de-pends on the situation. b. The three main factors to consider in the leadership process are: the leader, the situ-ation, and level of maturity (readiness) of the followers. c. As a follower becomes more mature, the follower needs less structure (task struc-ture) and more focus on building relation-ships in the group (relationship behavior). d. Leadership strategies vary depending on the follower and include:(1) Telling\u2014for followers who are im-mature and need high task structure and low relationship behavior; lead-ers provide specific instructions and closely supervise performance (2) Selling\u2014for followers who are a little less immature and need high task structure and high relationship 262 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment (5) The systems model focuses on devel- oping a comprehensive system of care and coordinating mental health ser-vices. Interventions include creating community support services, service coordination, and case management (Worley, 1996). c. Planning community interventions(1) Primary prevention is an intervention to reduce the incidence of disease by promoting and preventing disease processes. (2) Secondary prevention is an interven- tion such as depression screening that detects disease in early stages. (3) Tertiary prevention is an intervention that attempts to reduce the severity of a clinically apparent disease. d. Planning children's health issues(1) Children compose one third of our population. (2) Major health problems include inju- ries and acute illness. (3) Behavioral problems include eat-ing disorders, attentional problems, substance abuse, conduct disorders and delinquency, sleep disorders, and school maladaptation. (4) A child's coping mechanisms are influenced by the individual develop-ment level, temperament, previous stress experiences, role models, and support of parents and peers. (5) Healthy People 2010 supports pro-grams for decreasing smoking, re-ducing gun violence, and promoting playground safety. e. Planning women's health(1) Programs need to focus on women's psychosocial and physiological well-being. (2) Women are more likely to suffer from major depression and phobias (Jones & Trabeaux, 1996).(a) Women have twice the rate of depression than men have, even when income level, education, and occupation are controlled. (b) Women 18-44 years old have the highest rates of depression. (c) Factors that contribute to depres-sion in women include: unhappy intimate relationships, history of sexual and physical abuse, reproductive events, multiple roles, ethnic minority status, race, religion, national origin, ge-netics, life-style behaviors (b) Agent or cause\u2014includes infec-tious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites), physical agents (radiation, heat, cold, machinery), or chemical agents (heavy metals, toxic chemicals, pesticides) (c) Environment or surround-ings\u2014includes factors such as population density, education, occupation, income, housing, social support, rainfall, habitat, levels of stress, satisfaction, noise, resources, access to care, and temperature. (8) The identification of risk factors is im-portant for planning for populations most likely to suffer illness or injury.(a) Psychosocial risk factors include developmental or situational events that occur at a certain time that can create a vulnerable point for an individual. An example is suicide. Adolescents have a high suicide rate. (b) Workers who lose their jobs are especially vulnerable to depres-sion, illness, and family conflicts. b. Incorporating community assessment into planning(1) Community needs assessment in-cludes assessing social indicators or examining community characteristics such as income, race, population den-sity, and crime. (2) More information on community needs can be obtained from key in-formants in the community or people who work in the community such as clergy, social service, and healthcare providers. (3) Community forums can provide com-munity members an opportunity to express their needs. Important in community assessment is viewing the community as a partner so that inter-ventions can be community-focused. (4) One community assessment wheel (Anderson & McFarlane, 1995) as-sesses the areas of physical envi-ronment, education, safety and transportation, health and social services, communication, econom-ics, politics and government, and recreation.263 Leadership and Management (3) Operational planning is everyday work management, develops shorter term goals from both long-range and short-range plans. i. Steps in preparing a planning project pro- posal, for example, starting an adolescent therapy group for an outpatient practice setting include:(1) Describe the current business or the current outpatient practice. (2) Analyze the strengths and weakness within the outpatient setting of start-ing the proposed adolescent group. (3) Analyze the opportunities and threats outside of the setting of starting the proposed adolescent group; for exam-ple, are other outpatient settings also conducting the same group? (4) Describe the product or group ther-apy, including all staff, facility, and financial resources. (5) Describe how the program will be marketed. (6) Describe how the program fits into the organizational chart. (7) Show a projected time line or the steps and dates when the project or group therapy will begin. (8) Describe how much the program will cost, and how much revenue the pro-gram will produce. 2. Directinga. Definition\u2014coordinating or activating work b. The manager directs work activities such as issuing assignments, orders, and instructions that permit the worker to understand what is expected as well as contribute to the attainment of organiza-tional goals. c. The manager needs to establish work guidelines, manage time efficiently, re-solve conflict, facilitate collaboration, and negotiate for needed resources. d. The manager needs to create a motivat-ing climate for staff by using motivation theories.(1) Reinforcement Theory\u2014B. F. Skinner's Behavior Modification. To motivate staff, managers need to:(a) Create a consistent, visible reward system. (b) Reward positive staff behav-iors or the behaviors will be extinguished.low self-esteem, poverty and unemployment. (3) Three major causes of mortality in women are heart disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular disease. f. Planning men's health(1) Men are physiologically more vulner-able, evidenced by more male infant deaths and shorter predicted lifespan. Many reasons account for this differ-ence including genetics, risk-taking behaviors, and ignoring warning signals. (2) Males have more significant death rates in AIDS, suicides, homicides, and accidents. (3) Male suicide rate is four times higher than females and the eighth leading cause of death overall.(a) Men are more likely to make a serious attempt to kill themselves rather than use it as a cry for help. (b) Suicide risk factors for men in- clude: over 65 years of age, un-married, unemployed, previous attempt, positive family history, and suffering from terminal ill-ness or other medical condition. (4) Alcohol disorders remain high for men\u2014chronic liver disease and cir-rhosis are health diseases affecting men. (5) Men have a higher incidence of anti-social behavior. g. Planning for the homeless(1) Homelessness and criminalization are concerns for many people with chronic mental illness. (2) It is believed between 25-33% of the homeless population is chronically mentally ill. (3) The new \"revolving door\" is not within the state hospital but has been now described as inside the county jail, with the criminal justice system be-ing described as the newest mental hospital. h. Three types of planning(1) Strategic planning is a continuous, systematic process of making risk- taking decisions today with the great-est possible knowledge of their impact on the future, usually done for the next 5-year period. (2) Functional planning is a specialty ser-vice planning, such as planning for a staff development department.264 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment (2) Herzberg's Two Factor Motivation Theory (Swansburg, 1996). Assump-tions are:(a) People want to work and do that work well. (b) Workers can be motivated by work itself. (c) It is possible to separate personal motivators from job dissatifiers. (d) Job motivators (satisfiers) pres-ent in work itself and encourage workers to do the work well\u2014include achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, ad-vancement, possibility for growth, status, company policy. (e) Maintenance factors (hygiene factors) keep workers from being dissatisfied but do not motivate\u2014include salary, supervision, job security, positive working condi-tions, personal life, interpersonal relations/peers. e. The role of the manager in creating a mo-tivating climate (Marquis & Huston, 1994)(1) Communicate clear expectations to staff. (2) Develop the idea of working as a team. (3) Request staff input for decisions that affect staff. (4) Give positive reinforcement. (5) Be fair and consistent with all employees. (6) Allow employees to make as many au-tonomous decisions as possible. (7) Integrate the uniqueness of each in-dividual into meeting organizational goals. (8) Explain your own and organizational decisions to staff. f. Resolving conflicts(1) Conflicts are inevitable outcomes of social interactions. (2) Levels of conflict include: intra- personal, intragroup, intraterrito-rial, interpersonal, intergroup, and interterritorial. (3) Questions for diagnosing the conflict (Swansburg, 1996)(a) What is the issue in question? (b) What is the magnitude of the stakes? (c) How interdependent are the parties? (d) Are the parties in a continuing relationship?(e) What is the power and work struc-ture of the parties? (f) How involved are third parties? (g) How do the parties perceive the progress of the conflict? (4) Conflict resolution strategies(a) Avoidance or keeping the conflict quieti. Ignoring the conflict\u2014when issue is trivial or symptom-atic of a more basic issue ii. Imposing a solution\u2014when a quick decision is needed or when an unpopular deci-sion is going to be made and the group can not reach a decision (b) Defusion or cooling the emotions of the parties involvedi. Smoothing\u2014playing down its importance and magnitude, giving people time to cool down and gain perspective; used when conflict is with issues not related to work ii. Appealing to superordinate goals\u2014when there are im-portant goals that both par-ties cannot meet without the other's help (c) Containment allows some conflict to come out into the open, but in tightly controlled manner.i. Bargaining\u2014when two par-ties have relatively equal power ii. Structuring the interaction\u2014 when a third party is needed so that the conflict does not escalate (d) Confrontation is openly discuss-ing all areas of conflict with the end result of finding a solution to conflict.i. Integrated problem solving\u2014when there is limited trust among parties and unlimited time to problem solve ii. Redesigning the organi-zation\u2014when sources of conflict come from work processes and the work can be divided into more self-contained work groups 3. Organizinga. Open systems theory265 Leadership and Management have use over a year's time, such as hospital beds or desks. (2) Stages of the budget include: (a) Planning the budget, usually 6 months to a year (b) Reviewing and justifying the final budget (c) Implementing the budget (d) Monitoring and reviewing the budget d. Organizing nurse and client empowerment(1) Empowerment is a process that changes the distribution of power and enables others to recognize and use their talents and contributions so that they experience their own personal power. (2) Nursing empowerment is creating an empowering climate for nurses and staff (Gunden & Crissman, 1994). Em-powerment is created by:(a) Fostering trust\u2014manager needs to demonstrate constancy, con-gruity, reliability, and integrity. (b) Feedback\u2014manager needs to re-ceive and give realistic feedback including fostering opportunities for staff to make decisions, and by providing inspiration. (c) Communication\u2014manager needs to encourage openness in organi-zational communication. (d) Goal setting\u2014manager needs to work with staff to set goals for their work and for their profes-sional development. (e) Positivity\u2014manager needs to cre-ate a positive climate so that the staff can accomplish their goals. (3) Client empowerment creates an em-powering climate for patients.(a) Nurses should assist all vulner-able groups to achieve a greater sense of empowerment. (b) Clients who are empowered have a greater sense of hope and are more able to make autonomous decisions about health care that may increase their level of health. (c) Nursing interventions for assist-ing clients to feel more empow-ered include: active listening, letting clients know their rights, initially acting as an advocate for them if needed, reassuring them that fears are normal, mutually (1) An organization is greater than the sum of its parts. (2) Permeable boundaries exist between the organization and its environment. (3) The input, throughput, and output processes are goal-oriented, focused on accomplishing organizational work. (4) The components of the throughput (work) process are the workers, the work itself, the formal support pro-cesses, and the informal support processes. (5) The organization is dependent on the environment for resources to do the work and to accept its work. (6) The organization is constantly adapting. (7) Over time, the organization will be-come larger and will become increas-ingly complex and specialized. b. Organizing patient care delivery(1) Many nursing units organize patient care based on the existing delivery system or by the latest trend. (2) Patient care delivery systems include case management, primary nursing, team nursing, functional nursing, and any variation of these. (3) Factors to be considered in the deci-sion of selecting the optimal patient care delivery system include (Marquis & Huston, 1994):(a) Quality of care and cost-effectiveness (b) Patient and family satisfaction (c) Nursing and other discipline satisfaction (d) Consistency with organizational philosophy and goals (e) The nature of work that needs to be accomplished c. Organizing the budget(1) Managers are concerned with follow-ing types of budgets:(a) Personnel budgets reflecting the amount of money spent on staff-ing, including full-time personnel, part-time personnel, and person-nel hired as needed. (b) Operating budgets reflect ex-penses that fluctuate up or down when services are provided, such as electricity, supplies, rent, and repairs. (c) Capital expenditure budgets re-flect large purchase items that 266 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment setting reasonable goals, helping them identify their strengths, be-ing culturally sensitive, and teach-ing health promotion and disease prevention. (d) The empowerment model of recovery is a health promotion model in which individuals de-fine their own needs and are ac-tive collaborators with a variety of people in their own healing (Fisher, 1994). (e) The empowerment model of re-covery is based on experiences of consumers in recovery and on the independent living movement, which is a grass-roots movement for social justice and civil rights led by people with disabilities. (f) Nurses can apply the principles of the empowerment model of recovery by using the following methods (Fisher, 1994):i. Facilitating recovery through education and instilling hope ii. Developing alternatives to hospitalization iii. Providing state funding for involuntary admissions un-der the public safety budget rather than the healthcare budget iv. Maximizing consumer in-volvement in all aspects of treatment; establishing self-help and consumer-run services v. Ensuring that consumers are genuinely and effectively in-volved in activities to protect human rights and improve the quality of services vi. Favoring the role of personal care attendants rather than case managers (who are too controlling) vii. Viewing the life experience of recovery from a serious psy-chiatric disability as an asset in hiring, not a liability viii. Promoting consumer control and choice in housing and financial, educational, voca-tional, and social services ix. Providing staff training based on the needs of consumersx. Basing quality improvement of mental health services on outcome measures designed by survivors and consumers 4. Evaluatinga. Evaluation is the systematic attempt to as-sess worth and value for decision-making purposes. b. Program management and evaluation(1) For program improvement, use formative evaluation or receive in-termittent feedback throughout the program's performance. (2) For program judgment at the end of program, use summative evaluation. c. Types of measurement in evaluation(1) Resources for program\u2014structure of people, equipment, and setting (2) Judgments of process performance (3) Concerns and issues of all stakehold-ers or those having an interest in the program (4) Goals and objectives of program and whether goals and objectives were met (5) Intended and unintended program outcomes d. Methods of measurement.(1) Empirical research designs with statis-tical analysis (2) Questionnaires and surveys of stake-holders for attitudes, satisfaction, and goal attainment (3) Comparison to other similar programs (4) Review of documents, policies, and procedure manuals (5) Cost analysis for effectiveness, ben-efits, feasibility (6) Interviews of individuals or focus groups (7) On-site observation of process and structure e. Quality in health care(1) Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is a philosophy for evaluating and managing the quality of health-care services. (2) To successfully integrate a philosophy of quality into a mental health setting, staff must understand the philosophy and processes of improving quality in a collaborative, multidisciplinary setting. (3) Total Quality Management is a man-agement philosophy that incorporates the concept of continuous quality improvement by involving all levels 267 Leadership and Management g. Self-evaluation (1) Nurses should be continually involved in self-evaluation or identifying their own strengths and weaknesses in a professional role. Nurses are account-able to the public and profession. (2) Self-evaluation has been found to be threatening if an employee must discuss findings in a group of other employees. (3) Advanced practice nurse self- evaluates practice based on client outcomes (ANA, 1996). h. Evaluation of care and legal issues (Fon-taine & Fletcher, 1995; Stuart & Sundeen, 1996)(1) Nurses' ability to provide safe care is enhanced by knowledge of the law, particularly legislative decisions af-fecting the state's nurse practice act, ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, and Standards of Psychiatric Practice. (2) An important concept in psychiatric nursing is understanding the legal framework for the delivery of mental health care in the state in which the nurse practices. (3) State law may also vary regarding ad- missions, discharges, patient rights, and informed consent. (4) Types of admissions to psychiatric units(a) Voluntary admission\u2014signed standard admission form indicat-ing patient voluntarily seeks help. (b) Involuntary admission or com-mitment\u2014patient did not request hospitalization and admission was initiated by hospital or court. (c) Emergency involuntary admissioni. State laws differ as to pro- cedures for petitioning for admission, psychiatric evalu-ation of the client, treatment available, and length of de-tainment (usually 2-3 days). ii. Clients are restricted from leaving and may be forced to take psychotropic medication. iii. Clients' right to consult with attorney to prepare for hear-ing must be enforced. (d) Indefinite involuntary admissioni. Civil hearing is convened to determine need for continu-ing involuntary treatment.of personnel within an organization to actively participate in decision making. (4) The definition of \"quality\" has broad-ened from a property of the product to being defined by the customer, which focuses mental health care on the customer. (5) Deming (1986) wrote that to increase quality, management should:(a) Create an organizational culture that embraces opportunities to improve services. (b) Eliminate quotas, slogans, and awarding contracts based on price alone. (c) Promote self-improvement of workers and management. (6) To be effective over time, quality im-provement involves:(a) Staff working together to improve the work process. Employees can only be as productive as their work process is organized. (b) All staff using a continuous, ratio-nal approach for problem solv-ing over time. It involves every employee on every level working together. (c) Feedback mechanisms built into work processes so that work can be monitored and improved. When quality is improved, mis-takes occur less often, resulting in less cost. (d) A plan systematically attacking problems identified by staff and patients. f. Peer evaluation(1) Peer evaluation has been shown to be a valuable part of a total performance evaluation plan and can include mul-tiple ratings of different peers. (2) Peer evaluation identifies strengths and weaknesses of an employee, identifies competency, increases self-awareness, improves and evaluates the enactment of professional roles. (3) The three phases of peer review(a) Employees become familiar with peer review. (b) Objectives are defined; employees try different peer review tech-niques; objectives are further refined. (c) Peer evaluation becomes fully operational.268 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment ability to carry out the threat immedi- ately (words alone are not enough). (9) Negligence is an act or an omission to act that breaches the duty of due care and results in or is responsible for a person's injuries. (10) For psychiatric mental health nurses, the most common causes of negli-gence are implementation of suicide precautions and assisting in electro-convulsive therapy. (12) Informed consent is the client's right to receive enough information to make a decision about treatment and to communicate the decision to others.(a) In an absence of consent, a healthcare provider can be held liable in a civil lawsuit for bat-tery, assault, and professional negligence. (b) In the case of an emergency situa-tion, consent may not be obtained because a delay would endanger the client's health and/or safety, and the client may be treated without legal liability. (c) To give informed consent, the patient should be told the diagno-sis, differential diagnosis, nature of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to be performed, the prospect of success from the treatment, prognosis or expecta-tions, and alternative courses of treatment if available. (13) Clients must be informed of the po-tential risks of medications and have the right to refuse medications. If the physician or nurse believes the pa-tient needs the refused medication, the physician can take the decision to the courts to rule whether client is incompetent. (14) Competency is a legal determination that a client can make reasonable decisions about treatment and other areas of his/her personal life. (15) Communication, both written and oral, is a legal responsibility. Specific charting, e.g. on suicide precautions, documents the nurse's actions. (16) There are federal rules regarding chemical dependence confidential-ity so that staff members cannot disclose any admission or discharge information.ii. \"Clear and convincing evi-dence\" of \"mentally ill and dangerous to self and others\" must be demonstrated. (5) Clients do not lose their legal rights because they are admitted to a psychi-atric facility. (6) Malpractice is the failure of profes-sionals to provide the proper and competent care resulting in harm to the patients, judged by national stan-dards of care by other members of their profession.(a) Nurses should be familiar with the following resources that help define standards of care:i. Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements ii. Scope and Standards of Psy - chiatric Nursing Practice iii. Nurse practice statutes of the state iv. Evidence-based practice/treatment guidelines v. Documents published by the Joint Commission on Ac-creditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) vi. Federal Agency Guidelines (USPHS) (AHCPR) vii. Statements from the Ameri- can Hospital Association viii. Policies and Procedures of the employing agency (b) If standards are not clear in a par-ticular instance, a lawyer should be consulted. (c) Malpractice suits usually come from angry patients who have had poor results from treatment. (d) Malpractice lawsuits involving nurses usually include adminis-tration of medications or treat-ment, communications, and supervision of patients. (e) Most malpractice suits are filed under the law of tort, which is a private civil wrong committed by one individual against another for which money damages are col-lected by the injured party from the wrongdoer. (7) Battery is a harmful or offensive touching of another's person. (8) Assault is a threat to use force without actual bodily contact, although the person must have the opportunity and 269 Leadership and Management centered consultation\u2014See next section) (ANA et al., 2007). 2. In the community mental health model, Ca-plan (1970) defines consultation as a specific professional process between two systems. The consultee system has a problem and re-quests assistance. The consultant system gives the assistance. 3. Role characteristics include collaborative pro-fessional relationships, not supervisory rela-tionships, where the users/consultees choose whether or not to accept professional advice. 4. The psychiatric liaison nursing role pro-vides and coordinates psychiatric care and maintains a therapeutic environment for clients admitted with a physical symptom or dysfunction. 5. Psychiatric liaison nurses, as members of the healthcare team, provide direct care, including psychotherapy, health teaching, anticipatory guidance, and somatic therapy to individuals, groups, and families. 6. Psychiatric consultation liaison nurses may provide indirect care such as consultation, education, maintenance of a therapeutic envi-ronment, systems evaluation, and program de-velopment for work unit and/or organizational issues. 7. The consultation liaison nurse provides sup-port and guidance in assisting the user/ consultee to solve the problem and gain more understanding of the issues. 8. Consultation liaison nurses may fill roles in a variety of settings\u2014independent private prac-titioners who are self-employed, nurses who are contracting out services to an organization based on a fee-for-service arrangement, and/or staff members of an organization. 9. In general, the nurse consultant will deal with the following three problem areas:a. A problem with a specific patient b. A specific service program problem c. An organizational problem 10. Phases of the interactive consultative liaison process (Lehmann, 1996)a. Orientation phase(1) Identifying the overt and covert expec-tations of the consultee (2) Clearly defining the problem so that the staff have realistic expectations for the consultation (3) Communicating confidentiality (4) Writing a written contract(a) Represents an exchange between the consultee and consultant. (b) Clearly writes services expected and method of payment signed (17) All 50 states have enacted child abuse reporting statutes that generally in-clude a definition of child abuse, a list of persons required or encouraged to report, and the governmental agency designated to receive and investigate the reports. (18) Some states have enacted adult abuse laws. (19) Duty to warn or disclose (Tarasoff v. The Regents of University of Califor - nia, 1976) ruled that a psychotherapist had the duty to warn his or her client's potential victim of potential harm. In 1983, the court stated that the duty to warn was composed of two elements: (1) the duty to diagnose and predict the client's danger of violence, (2) the duty to take appropriate action to pro-tect the identified victim. The duty to warn supercedes the client's right to confidentiality. (20) Some general areas of healthcare litigation in multidisciplinary psychi-atric/mental health private practice\u2014informed consent, faulty diagnosing resulting in wrong treatment, physical restraint and bodily harm, confiden-tiality and defamation, failure to warn those threatened by clients, limita-tion of ability to perform a needed service and failure to refer to another professional, misuse of therapy, and inappropriate termination and aban-donment of client. The consultative liaison role 1. This advanced practice nursing role evolved from consultative roles and requires the ability to integrate expert psychiatric-mental health knowledge into all healthcare settings (ANA, APNA, & ISPN, 2007).a. PMH consultant-liaison activities occur in nonpsychiatric care settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics, rehabilitation settings, and extended care facilities in which the advanced practice PMH nurse provides specialized consultation or direct care. b. A variety of services can be provided by the PMH consultant-liaison nurse includ-ing client-centered consultation (to treat or advise treatments for identified men-tal health needs) and providing nurses and other care providers information, support, and training about identified mental health issues/concerns (consultee-270 CHapter 11 The Larger Mental Health Environment c.

(c) Contains a brief description of problem, expected outcomes or goals, estimated time to be de-voted to project, amount of com-pensation for consultant's time, key department and personnel related to consultant, and name of contact person from consultee agency. b. Working phase(1) After contract is formalized, further assessing the problem. (2) Selecting interventions for the problem. At this point, the nurse consultant may have completed the consultation depending upon the terms of the contract. c. Termination phase(1) Writing a formal summary written report (2) Including in the written report\u2014purpose, dates, time, and activities of consultation; statement of identified problem; assessment and diagnoses of problem; proposed interventions for problem resolution; alternative problem-solving approach; and evalu-ation criteria and findings, if available QueStionS \u0088 Select the best answer 1.
