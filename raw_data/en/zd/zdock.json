Special guest Island Breeze will join the festival before the film for a blessing, traditional protocol, and gift exchange with local Indigenous leaders. Following the film, Island Breeze will provide additional performances for audiences.

ABOUT THE FILM: 1893. The Hawaiian Kingdom has been overthrown by a Western power just as an outbreak of leprosy engulfs the tropical paradise. As leprosy infections spread throughout the Native Hawaiian population, the newly imposed colonial government orders all Native Hawaiians suspected of being infected to be banished permanently to a remote colony on Moloka'i, known as 'the island of the living grave.' But when a local cowboy named Ko'olau (Jason Scott Lee) and his young son Kaleimanu (Kahiau Perreira) contract the dreaded disease, they refuse to surrender to authorities, sparking an armed clash with brutal white island authorities in which a sheriff is killed. Now a hunted man, Ko'olau flees with his family to a hidden valley, where they join forces with another small band of refugees. Pursued by a group of mercenaries led by a ruthless former Civil War commander, the fugitives are cornered for a final skirmish that will make Ko'olau and his wife, Pi'ilani (Lindsay Marie Anuhea Watson), heroes for the ages in a story based on one of the most epic events in Hawaii's history. Based on real-life historical events as told through the memoirs of Pi'ilani herself.
