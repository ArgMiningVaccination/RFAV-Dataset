To register email: [Stefan Nekvapil](mailto:theccmelbourne@gmail.com). Thursday September 4th 7pm: The Foundations of Health and Well being. When understanding and supporting the child's body and soul development in today's world filled with great changes and advancements, it is important to recognise what effects this has on their developmental processes. Our medical model is based on determining when an individual is sick rather than what makes them well. We do not need to wait years for studies to prove what may be detrimental to our children's health, we can perceive what promotes health and wellbeing through the insights given out of Steiner education and Anthroposophical medicine. This talk will speak about some of the main issues confronting child health and wellbeing in our times and how we can counter the unbalancing effects. It is open to all parents and teachers and will be held at Morning Star Kindergarten, Bellingen. Please pre-arrange care for your children. Tickets $10 at the door. More information can be obtained from [Chrysalis Steiner School.](http://chrysalis.nsw.edu.au/contact/contact-details/) Tuesday November 18th: The Inner Work path, Meditation and Crossing the Threshold. The inner work leads to crossing the threshold. Certain stages and preparations are an essential for a healthy relationship with the spiritual world. This is essential if we wish to clearly see the path of evolution and connect with the spirits of progression that support humanity. Presented by the Anthroposophical Society Sydney Branch.

The pre-requisite for this workshop is the completion of the foundation workshop.

Through this balanced course of understanding why and how the exercises work, experiencing artistic/ therapeutic support, and daily practice we will be immersed in the inner work of anthroposophy. This will enable us to further and hold our daily practices.
