I am living in India, married and have two daughters of age 10 and 5. I was a non-vegetarian before and I also used to take lot of milk and milk products like milk, curd, butter, ghee, buttermilk, cheese etc. I was having wheezing problem, pain in the body, continuous sneezing in the morning, sweating in the body etc. I use to give 3 glasses of milk everyday to my elder daughter when she was 5 years old thinking that milk is very nutritious with calcium and protein. She used to suffer from cold and cough very often. I was under the impression that I was providing the most nutritious combination of food - egg and milk. Yet something was wrong with her immunity that she fell sick often. Visit to the physician became a regular affair, atleast once in a month. When my second daughter was born I consumed lots of egg in my diet thinking that it will help in lactation. I became so fat and I weighed 75 kgs (My height is only 150 cms) and it also resulted in lots of complications to the body. My husband suffered from migraine, kidney stone and rheumatism. My search of health books for the correct diet ended with the book IYARKAI UNAVE NOI THEERKUM MARUNTHU written by Shri. M.A.Appan in Tamil. The topic of the book means that NATURAL FOOD IS THE MEDICINE FOR ALL DISEASES. Reading the book I was totally amazed to know that the author himself who was a leprosy patient in his younger days got rid of leprosy and is leading a healthy life. Though he tried all types of treatments, he did not get cured. On the advice of his brother Shri. Ramakrishnan he stopped all medicines and ate natural food only and got rid of leprosy. He is now living in kulasekarapattinam of Tamilnadu. He is 70 now and takes care of 3 acre land all by himself. Many persons had told their experiences regarding natural food in that book. I was more and more amazed to read that many coma, epilepsy, asthma, cancer patients who were left hopeless by the allopathy doctors have got cured by natural food. So I stopped non-veg and reduced milk and milk products in my diet. Before that I used to buy 2 litres of milk every day for my family. Now at present I have completely stopped milk and milk products after 4 years. At the same time I started to include natural food (raw and uncooked food) in my diet. Gradually I got rid of all my diseases without any medicines. My daughters and my husband are also healthy now. My weight came to 51 Kgs without any exercise. I feel very active and enthusiastic now. It has brought positive changes in my character too. Now I am tolerant, smiling, cheerful and relaxed with sound mind. I am a working mom. I am able to balance both home and office at ease. I don't get stressed up or get exhausted at the end of the day. I work on computers and still have healthy eyes/vision. I don't have eye irritation, watering of eyes etc even if I work for long hours (12 hrs) in the system. I wish the readers to follow this diet and be healthy. WHAT IS NATURAL FOOD? Natural food means food produced by mother nature.(Cooked by the heat of the sun) . We have to eat it raw as given by nature without making any changes in the form of cooking, boiling, frying etc. When a food is kept on fire it loses all its nutrition it has. We eat only the dead food. That is why man suffers from so many diseases. No other living being in the world cook food and eat. WHY MAN IS VEGETARIAN? (1) Man and herbivorous animals absorbs water whereas Carnivorous animals licks water for drinking. (2) Man and herbivorous animals have lengthy small intestine whereas Carnivorous animals have short small intestine. (3) Carnivorous animals have canine teeth for tearing flesh whereas our teeth is designed by nature to chew food. (4) Vegetarian people have long life span than the non-veg eating people. WHY MAN IS FRUITARIAN? The root eating animals like pig, rat, rabbit have their mouth shape in such a way to pierce the earth. The teeth of grazing animals are in such way to chew the grasses. Birds have beaks to pick up the grains. Monkeys and squirrels are in such a way that they can jump from one tree to another to eat fruits. Man can stand erect and his hands are in such a way to pluck the fruits from the trees. His body is also capable of climbing up tall trees like coconut and palm. Hence we can know that according to his physiology man is a fruitarian. Hence man should gradually change from Non-vegetarian->Lacto vegetarians->Vegetarian->Raweaters->fruit eaters ( eating fruits and nuts alone) MILK AND EGG VEG OR NON VEG MILK Mother's milk is enough. After that milk digesting enzymes are not produces in the human body. It is not ourfood. It is produced by the cow for its calf. We are stealing its food for its selfishness. Atleast mothers should realize what a great sin it is. Moreover milk is said to have calcium and protein by the allopathy doctors. But cow obtains it from eating raw grass and vegetables. We can also eat in the same manner to obtain the said nutrition. Cold, cough,easnophilia , Wheezing and asthma gets reduced by stopping milk and milk products. EGG The same explanation stands for egg also. Egg is produced by the hen for its reproduction and not for us. Eating egg is aborting life in its foetus stage itself. It is equivalent to abortion. I leave it to the readers to decide whether milk and egg are veg or non-veg. FACTS ABOUT ANIMAL PROTEIN There are lot of differences between plant and animal protein. Animal protein spoils a man. Any animal protein be it - egg or flesh or bones or milk or milk products is not suitable for man. Man's digestive system and its secretions is not formed suitably to digest these animal proteins. They entirely vary from carnivorous and omnivorous. Man is frugivorous. ie fruits and nuts is the diet of the man. Animal protein not only create disease by easy fermentation in the alimentary system but also affects the mind very much. This is the reason why the flesh eating people are quick to anger. This tendency destructs the super powers of the brain and reduce its alertness. If a man avoid all flesh and dairy products he will be relieved from 50% of his diseases. Even carnivorous animals eat raw flesh only. Man is the only one who eats roasted DEAD BODIES. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NATURAL FOOD IS TAKEN When we take natural food or come into contact with natural forces like rain, sun, pure water etc. Elimination of toxins which is accumulated in our body due to taking cooked food, bad habits etc begins to take place. That is why we have cold and cough while taking fruits headache while going in the sun fever while going in the rain etc. VARIOUS FORMS OF ELIMINATION Elimination takes place through various forms while initiating natural food for which we should not panic. They are (1) Head ache (2) Body pain (3) Tiredness (4) Sleepy (5) Fever (6) Skin eruptions/acne (7) Diarrhoea (8) Cold and cough (9) Through nails (10) Body odour (11) Mouth odour (12) Vomiting We should only be happy at these signs of elimination and not get panicked. The patients' will power, courage and cooperation plays a vital role here. The more one understands about the treatment and what is happening in his body the sooner he will get cured. WHAT TO DO WHEN ELIMINATION TAKES PLACE The person should take as much rest as possible according to his health position. HEADACHE: Take enema. Put wet cloth pack or wet mud pack on the head till pain subsides. Banana leaf bath, sun bath is also advised. Steam bath can be taken during rainy season and in cold countries. BODY PAIN, TIREDNESS, SLEEPY, COLD AND COUGH: Take lots of fruit juices (juicy fruits like pomegranate, orange,grapes,gooseberry, sweet lemon etc) till the uneasiness subsides. While taking lemon juice only 5 drops /for 200ml of water should be added. Dried gooseberries soaked in honey helps to overcome anemia. Honey mixed with water will also help. Dates can be eaten. FEVER: Enema, wet cloth pack, wet mud pack at head and stomach will help.Juicy fruits diet advised. In cases of high fever hip bath will help. BODY ODOUR AND MOUTH ODOUR: Continue natural food and take sand bath, banana leaf bath. VOMITING: Vomit occurs because of the heat in the liver. Juices of citric fruits like orange juice, lemon, sweet lemon and tender coconut can be given to reduce the heat. He can fast too if he is at complete rest just by taking water. SKIN BOILS: Fruit and vegetable juices and pure mud can be applied to the skin. LOOSE MOTION: Take lots of tender coconut and pomegranate juice. (Those could not afford to buy lots of fruits can go in for green leaves juices (Mint, coriander, curry leaf, palak etc,) and vegetable juices. In that case goose berries and a small piece of ginger can be added too. POINTS TO REMEMBER WHILE TAKING TREATMENT (1) When the patient is very sick full rest is necessary. (2) Allow him to sleep as much as possible. (3) No necessary for yoga, breathing exercises etc. (4) Enema at least once a day. (5) The patient should be kept in juice diet for fast recovery. (6) Put wet cloth pack or wet mud pack wherever there is pain, wound or swelling in the body. Care should be taken that the mud is without pesticides or fertilizers. Otherwise multanimitti (fuller earth) clay available in fancy stores, cosmetic shop for facial will serve the purpose. (7) While giving treatment, coconut and other nuts can be avoided. But after cure they should be certainly added to the diet. Being on fruit diet alone without nuts is not advised. After the patient feels hunger nuts can be added little by little and gradually increased. (8) Acupressure treatment can be given. (9) For those not getting sleep at night 1 spoon honey mixed with 200 ml of water can be given. Pressure can be given on the base of the middle toe of the leg. (10) For the patient on full natural diet enema is not necessary. If the patient cooperates enema can be taken. (11) When the patient feels chillness wet mud pack or wet mud pack is not necessary. Hot or warm water can be used instead. Hands, legs, head and ear should be closed without heat escaping from the body. Gloves, socks, scarf, sweater, blanket can be used for the purpose. Slippers can be used for walking on chill mosaic floor, tiles etc. (12) For loss of appetite, enema and lemon juice as instructed twice a day. GENERAL POINTS TO REMEMBER (1) Energy giving food- Red banana, Dates, cashew nut and juicy fruits. (2) Raw coconut is not cholesterol. When it is cooked it becomes cholesterol. Raw coconut can be eaten as much as we can. There is no harm in it and it won't cause weight gain. The same applies to other raw nuts and cooked nuts. (3) Natural sugar in fruits is easily digestible and it does not create diabetes. (4) For over weight : correct weight proportionate to height will come automatically. (5) For under weight: Sprouted pulses will help in increasing the weight and keeps away constipation. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VEG, NON VEG AND NATURAL FOOD One Should understand the difference between veg and natural food. Natural food is raw food eaten without cooking where as veg food is natural food cooked. VEG /NON VEG NATURAL FOOD (1) Killing strength (lion,tiger,cheetah) Pulling strength (Elephant) (2) Stamina will not be there Stamina to work longer. (3) Results in indigestion and constipation No indigestion and constipation. (4) No guarantee for disease Guarantee for disease free life (5) Hate Compassion (6) Lust Love (7) Adamant Determined (8) Restlessness Peace (9) Anger Tolerance (10) Luxury Simplicity (11) Worldly wishes Divinity (12) Cowardice Courage, braveness (13) Selfish Selfless (14) Laziness Enthusiastic (15) Tiredness Brisky VEG /NON VEG NATURAL FOOD (1) Killing strength (lion,tiger,cheetah) Pulling strength (Elephant) (2) Stamina will not be there Stamina to work longer. (3) Results in indigestion and constipation No indigestion and constipation. (4) No guarantee for disease Guarantee for disease free life (5) Hate Compassion (6) Lust Love (7) Adamant Determined (8) Restlessness Peace (9) Anger Tolerance (10) Luxury Simplicity (11) Worldly wishes Divinity (12) Cowardice Courage, braveness (13) Selfish Selfless (14) Laziness Enthusiastic (15) Tiredness Brisky Natural food creates lots of changes in our mentality too. Gradually we can see positive changes in our character. EFFECT OF NATURAL FOOD ON BREATH The more deeper the breath the longer will be the life span. The animals with short breaths live short (eg. Dog) whereas tortoise with long deep breaths live for 300 years. In humans we can determine our life span with our diet. We can notice that persons with short breaths will fall ill often whereas persons with deep breaths will enjoy good health. While taking natural food our body gets purified. The more purified our body becomes our breath will also start to get deeper and deeper. The more deeper our breath the more we will be free from diseases and mental worries. We will start to feel peace and happiness internally. HOW TO START TAKING NATURAL FOOD Changing from cooked to natural food at one stretch requires lot of will power and self control. Hence the proverb Slow and steady wins the race will help here. We can start with 1 meal of natural food/day. (eg breakfast or dinner with only fruits and nuts). No limitation in quantity. Continue for a certain period of time according to your convenience and then gradually extend it to the second meal. Then one day we will be able to completely change to natural food. This is applicable for minor diseases. Meanwhile they can also try to stop taking nonveg- and milk products. But this does not apply to one who is seriously ill and fighting for life. They should completely change to natural food to overcome their illness. There will be a craving for cooked food and always a hunger like feeling while starting a diet on natural food because man started eating cooked food from time unknown and this habit has been imprinted in every cell of human beings. It is quiet difficult to overcome a habit formed by our ancestors. Hence we should try to come out of it step by step. The uneasiness we feel at first should not be misunderstood with weakness and it is the same feeling a drunkard feels when he doesn't find his drink at his usual time of drinking. Will anybody argue foolishly that drinking is safe and healthy. The same is applicable to the starting problem of natural food. Gradually our body will get used to it and the feeling of uneasiness will vanish. Meditation will help to control the craving for cooked food. It is wise to start taking natural food when we are healthy itself because prevention is better than cure and it also won't affect our day to day activities. Eat the fruits which you like most. Nuts should be taken compulsorily. Eating fruits alone is not advisable. The quantity of food taken will gradually reduce after long term intake of natural food. (Since less amount of food is enough for a healthy body). METHOD OF EATING Mono diet is the best method. (ie eating one type of food at a time without mixing different types of fruits, making fruit salads and vegetable salads.) If more than one food is taken at a time 1st nuts should be taken and then fruits should be taken. No calorie count required. Ideal weight for our height will come automatically. No requirement for BMI. No limitation in the quantity of raw food taken. We can eat as much as we can whenever we feel hungry and drink water whenever we feel thirsty. It is better not to mix cooked and raw food at the same time as their method of digestion differs. Chewing the food well helps to overcome indigestion and drinking water and juices sip by sip will help the saliva to mix with the juice for easy digestion. MANY QUESTIONS-ONE ANSWER (1) Why it sweats only to humans? (2) Why birds are able to travel from one continent to another continent non-stop without getting tiredness whereas we feel tired even for traveling small distances? (3) Why man gets many diseases such as BP, sugar, cancer, epilepsy, leprosy etc and meets his death before his life span? (4) Why man is not happy even when he is rich? (5) Why men fight among themselves? (6) Why man goes on searching FOR MONEY, FAME ETC FOOLISHLY while can't even take a single dust after his death? (7) Why he goes on filling his wardrobe while he can wear only one dress at a time? For whom and for what purpose? (8) If education and money can bring happiness, is every educated and rich man happy? ANSWER: Man is the only living being on earth who eats cooked food. YOGA, GYMNASTICS, EXERCISES-ARE THEY NECESSARY? After starting to take the natural food our flexibility of body increases. We can notice that Monkey's, Squirrels which live on trees don't get any fractures even they fall from tree. While we humans suffer from fractures even from a small fall. They don't go for gym & yoga classes. If we change to Natural food we can notice our body will be able to do most of the yoga postures naturally (without doing it on regular basis). Hence the time on daily yoga, exercises, and gym activities can be saved and utilized for doing meditation. Gym activities can only increase outward muscle development & inner organs won't be strong. Also there is no guarantee for disease free body. We can see body-builders afraid of facing small day to day problems in their daily life. Only natural food & meditation makes us mentally as well as physically strong. Gym activities & other exercises may help us to keep ideal weight but there is no guarantee for disease free life & inward happiness. DETAILS OF USEFUL BOOKS FOR INTERESTED READERS 1.

Wet cloth pack 10. Wet mud pack 11. Sun bath SUN BATH Persons can stand, sit or lie down in the sun with minimum dress. Sunlight gives us lots of energy. It gives vitamin D to us. It eliminates the toxins in our body in the form of sweat & headache and gives us warmth. The power of sunlight can be understood from the fact 1. Victims of skin cancer are very less in tropical countries. 2. Sun tanned skin gets skin diseases very rarely. 3. Dark skin is more healthier than white skin. 4. Sun bath can be taken before 9 o clock in the morning & after 4' o clock in the tropical countries. Should not be more than 20 minutes in the tropical countries. STEAM BATH Steam bath is of use during rainy season and in cold countries. In these places removal of toxins through sweat is very less. Steam bath serves this purpose here. It can be taken at home too. Vicks, leaves of neem, Tulsi, Nochi, can be used. Pressure cooker can be used. A gas tube can be taken and checked whether there is any dust in it by passing water through it. Water should be kept in the pressure cooker and heated. A gas tube can be attached to the nozzle where the weight of the pressure cooker is kept for cooking. The person should be made to sit on a chair or stool of convenient height and he should be covered fully with 3 or 4 blankets. Then steam from the pressure cooker can be sent through the blankets. Care should be taken that the steam does not touch the body of the person. Also care should be taken that the pressure cooker should not tumble over. The patient can be made to sit inside until he can tolerate the steam. The patient should sweat well. It is very useful for persons suffering from cold, asthma, obesity etc. WET MUD PACK Pure mud, putru mun, red sand, clay (Without pesticides and fertilizers) can be mixed with water and made into a paste. Take a rectangle shaped cotton cloth, put the paste into it and fold the cloth in such a way that the mud does not fall outside. It can be kept for more than 1/2 an hour. It helps in case of heat during long travel, fever, headache, and constipation. After the treatment is over taking enema will increase the results double fold. The same can be done simply by wetting a cotton cloth. EYE WASHER It is a small equipment made of plastic. It can be got from all naturopathy centres. Otherwise a small bowl with water filled fully will serve the purpose. This is useful for those work long hours during night, those who work in computers, those who watch TV, those who work in dust, drive etc. It cools the eyes. Keep the eyes (one at a time) on the water and rotate in clockwise and anticlockwise direction for 5 minutes. At the beginning there will be little uneasiness. This is a simple treatment to protect the eyes. NOSE CLEANER Put a little salt in slightly warm water. Fill it in the container made for it. Bent forward turn your head slightly upwards towards your right and breathe through the mouth and pour the water little by little into the right nostril. The water will come out through the left nostril. Similarly repeat for the left nostril. This treatment helps in case of respiratory problems like cold, sinus, asthma, TB etc. SPINAL CORD BATH The equipment for spinal cord bath is available in nature cure centers. Lie down on this such that spinal cord touches the water for 1/2 an hour. Then take bath in cold water. This helps in case of spinal cord problems, back pain and high BP patients. HIP BATH A equipment for taking hipbath is available at nature cure centers. If not a round shaped vessel such that a person can sit inside with his legs outside can be used. The vessel should be broad and short. Fill half of the vessel with water and sit in it like sitting on easy chair. Put the legs on the opposite. Place a wood piece and keep the legs on it such that legs does not touch the floor. This is to avoid leakage of the body's magnetic field to the earth. Take a piece of cloth and massage the stomach when in water. The patient can be made to sit for 40 minutes and then after 15 minutes he can take bath. The water once used should not be reused. This reduces the stomach problems. It cools the stomach and hence the bowel movements become easy. This reduces headache and high fever. It cures constipation the basic cause for all diseases. OIL PULLING Although it doesn't come under naturopathy it helps in removal of toxins from the body by a simple method. This is harmless and can be done before food 3 times a day when the illness is serious. As the person turns healthy once in a day morning is enough. METHOD: A spoonful of any edible oil can be used for the purpose. It should be kept in the mouth and goggled continuously for 15 to 25 minutes. After that it should be spitted out and not swallowed. Even if swallowed no harm in it. But swallowing should be avoided. Then mouth can be washed. Toxins in the body comes to the mouth through osmosis process. ENEMA This is a simple plastic equipment available at cheap cost at Nature cure treatment centers. Germs are created in constipated body. Hence toxins are created in the blood. Gradually the body falls ill. The intestine gets heated up during constipation. It gives rise to files, fistula etc. Enema cup is used to wash the intestine just as we wash our mouth by goggling. It should be taken daily in case of constipation. To avoid constipation high fibrous food (ie natural food) should be taken. If natural food is taken and the tongue is clear without white patches enema once in a week is enough. The stools should not be sticky. It indicates constipation. Even children can take this. It can be used in case of headaches, fever and cold. It is useful for those on cooked food. HOW TO USE? Fill the enema cup with water and hang it at a height over your head. Then with the help of the nozzle pass the water through the anus into the intestine. (A little oil can be applied to the nozzle) .After all the water has passed keep it for 20 minutes. Lying down will give better results. After that stools can be passed out. This wash out all the impurities stagnant in the intestine. Water which is used for drinking purpose should be used. BANANA LEAF BATH (1) 10 to 15 full lengthy banana leaves are required for this per person. (2) It is best to do this before 12'o clock in the morning. Good sun light is required for this since removal of toxins in this method is through sweat. Heart patients will a feel a little restlessness during this treatment. There is no need to panic. (3) Since it will sweat a lot during this treatment the patient should drink as much water as possible before taking the treatment. (4) Minimum dress is advised. A small wet towel should be put on the head. (5) Spread a mat and a wet blanket on a place with good sunlight. (Blanket on the mat) (6) On the blanket spread 5 to 6 small ropes at fixed intervals to tie the patient with banana leaves. Then spread the banana leaves such that the inner part of the leaves touches the patient's body. Then allow the patient to lie down on it and then cover him with banana leaves and tie with the rope underneath so that no air enters inside. The full body should be covered except for the nose to breath. (7) The patient can be inside for 20 to 40 minutes. If the patient feels very uneasy he can be relieved. (8) Toxins in the form of sweat from 1/2 to 1 litre would have come out. (9) Then the patient should be allowed to rest in a airy shady place for 1/2 and hour and then take bath with cold water. (10) This is a wonderful treatment in case of obesity. (11) Since the leaves turns poisonous by treatment it should not be given to grazing animals like cow and goat. It should not also be put as fertilizers to the plants. Care should be taken to dispose the used leaves properly. (12) A slight tiredness or headache may be there after taking this bath which is quiet normal. (13) Healthy persons can take this bath once in a month. Persons suffering from diseases can take it once in two weeks. It purifies the blood. SAND BATH (1) Red soil, clay or sand with sticky property can be used for the purpose. Make it into a paste by mixing it with water the day before the bath is to be taken. This cools the heat in the sand and encourages bacterial growth which is good for the skin. (2) Sand bath should be taken before 12'o clock. (3) Sand bath should be taken wearing minimum dress. (4) The mud can be applied to all parts of the body including head. It can also be applied over wounds. (5) The sunlight should be allowed to fall on the body. (6) After 1/2 an hour or after the mud has completely dried up take rest for 1/2 an hour in shade. (7) Take bath in cold water. No necessary for soap, shampoo or any shikakai etc. Rub the mud well with water and massage it slowly and take bath. (8) Toxins in the body comes out through this treatment. Sweat pores will get cleansed and a feeling of freshness will be there. (9) This treatment is good for skin diseases like psoriasis and nerve problems, paralytic, leprosy, leucoderma problems. (10) Those who live in apartments and cities , where pure mud without fertilizers and pesticides not possible, Multani mitti, a clay which can be obtained in fancy stores can be used. The above treatments can be done at home. If doubt arises expert guidance can be sought. Even healthy people can take these treatments and remove toxins from their body and can prevent them from diseases. SPACE LAW Space law says that whichever natural food is available in a particular area sufficient for the people in that area. No need to import food from other countries and eat. No other animals import food and eat. They eat whatever available in that area, don't look for which food has protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals etc. They also don't count the calories for eating. Inspite of all this they stay healthy. Hence no need to import costly foreign foods and eat. In India Coconut, banana, dates which is easily available throughout the year contains all the nutrition required for human body. Other seasonal fruits available in the area can also be taken. Those who couldn't afford costly fruits can take coconut milk, vegetable juices, juices of green leaves etc . No need for tinned food, protein food,nutritious drink etc. If we have any doubt regarding the food to be taken we can think of the animals like elephants which live only on greens and the enormous strength they have. THINGS TO BE AVOIDED/REDUCED IN COOKED FOOD AND THEIR ALTERNATIVES AVOIDED/REDUCED IN COOKED FOOD ALTERNATIVES (1) Sugar Jaggery/PalmJaggery (2) Powdered Salt Crystal salt (3) Saturated oil Unsaturated oil (4) Chilly Pepper (5) Tamarind Lemon (6) Mustard Cumin (7) Coffee,Tea Black coffee, Lemon tea (8) Polished rice Flattened rice ( beaten rice or Poha) or unpolished red rice (Used in Kerala) The alternatives (except pepper, lemon, cumin) are for those who could not stop taking these foods. They don't come under the category of natural food. They are less harmful. JUICE FASTING Juice fasting helps when the patient cannot be kept on complete fasting. (On water). It has both advantages and disadvantages. ADVANTAGES: (1) Since the energy spent on digestion is very less (Since the intake is in liquid form) the body diverts its energy for purification of the system. (2) Energy absorption is easier for the body. (3) Juices of juicy fruits (Grapes, Orange, Sweet lemon, Pomegranate with high glucose content) will help in case of seriously ill patients to recover fast. (4) Very sick patients will find it easy to digest. DISADVANTAGES: (1) Since the intake is in liquid form there is no fibre content in the intake. (2) Not advisable for patients with severe piles and constipation problems. They are recommended to take natural food as it is. If the patient is kept on juice fasting taking enema once a day is advised. (If bowel movements are not regular and constipation arises) BLOOD AND NATURAL FOOD Blood is alkaline. Raw food is also alkaline. Raw food maintains the alkaline nature of the blood easily. When food is cooked it becomes acidic. Cooked food taken turns the blood to acidic nature. Hence the body fights to turn the blood into alkaline to maintain the health. When it fails to do so we become a prey to diseases. ACUPRESSURE This is a method of applying pressure (not acupuncture and there is no necessity for needles.) to the hands and legs. One important thing to remember here is Acupressure alone will not cure diseases. Naturopathy is the basic foundation to come out of the disease. Acupressure when done along with natural food gives faster relief from diseases. It is based on the principle that nerve endings are present for all the organs of the body in our hands and legs. If pressure is applied on the particular point on hands or legs for the affected organ a small electric impulse is sent to the corresponding organ and the affected organ begins to get cured. PRESS WHERE IT PAINS is the basic principle of acupressure. The nerve ending of the affected organ can be identified by the pain in the particular point. This pain will be different from the pressure applied. Pain indicates that there is some problem in that organ. The endocrine glands in our body Pituitary, Pineal, Adrenal, Pancreas, Solar plexus, thyroid and sexual glands determines a person's character according to their functioning and non-functioning. Proper functioning gives rise to positive characters like loving, cheerful, braveness, courage, determination, tolerance etc. Non- functioning results in characters like anger, adamancy, stealing tendency, cruelty, lust, fearfulness, suicidal tendency etc. Hence persons with psychological problems can be given treatment in endocrine glands in addition to naturopathy for astonishing results. Even prisoners' characters can be changed by giving treatment in these glands. Acupressure rollers can be purchased at shops for giving pressure to all points other than endocrine glands. They can be used to give pressure even when we watch TV or work on computers. For endocrine glands pressure has to be given by thumb in vertical position. For more details book HEALTH IN YOUR HANDS VOLI AND VOLII Written by shri Devendra vora can be referred. This book was recommended by India's former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who lived more than 90 years. This book is also available in languages like Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, etc. Points to be pressed for various diseases( including cancer, brain tumor, AIDS, sugar, blood pressure)is given at the back of the book. By referring to this list points to be pressed can be found at by the patient himself. Points to be pressed to overcome bad habits like smoking, drinking, drugs is also given. FASTING SPAIN PROVERB: It is better to lose a meal than call 100 doctors SCOTLAND PROVERB: One who eats till he falls ill should fast until he recovers. Fasting is the best medicine. It gives rest to the digestive system. Deaths due to over eating are more than deaths due to starving. All the animals undergo fasting when they fall ill till they recovers. Example. Goat, Cow, Dog. Only man continues to eat even when he is sick. HOW TO FAST? Only water should be taken when thirsty. Those who can't can take juices. After the sickness has reduced juicy fruits and fleshy fruits can be included little by little for a few days. Then after recovery nuts can be included. During fasting taking rest is a must. If airy places are available rest can be taken there. Energy losing activities such as watching TV, talking more, listening to music, walking long distances should be avoided. The body should be helped to divert all its energy to cure the body. Due to fasting the toxin level in the body gets reduced. Since the toxin level is reduced the diseases also gets reduced. TO INCREASE DIGESTIVE POWER 2 spoons of ginger juice daily will help those with weak digestion. The white colour sediment which settles after the juice is taken should not be eaten. Juice taken should be kept for 15 minutes for the sediment to settle and then taken with a spoonful of honey. Not advisable for ulcer patients. They can chew cumin instead. Drink warm water made by boiling cumin and pepper in it. CAN KIDNEY FAILURE PATIENTS DRINK WATER Kidney failure patients can drink water when they are thirsty provided they are on complete natural diet (mainly on juicy fruits). If more juicy fruits are included in the diet the less thirsty he will be. Acupressure can also be given to the kidney point in hands and legs. Salt and sugar should be avoided completely. Kidney stone patients should drink lots and lots of water to dissolve the stone formed. They are formed because of the lack of body's capacity to absorb the calcium. Hence they tend to crystallize in the form of stone. This arises due to the non-functioning of thyroid gland and it can be cured easily by giving acupressure on kidney and thyroid gland point. (More details in the book Health in your hands Vol I By Devendra Vora ). Following juice diet will give faster results. (Banana stem juice will be helpful). HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK? There is no minimum and maximum limitation for drinking water in natural food. One can drink water whenever he feels thirsty. The concept of drinking 3-5 litres of water daily to purify the body applies only to those on cooked food.

This will help to a certain extent to keep them fresh. Water should be sprinkled over the sand whenever necessary to keep it wet.

TO THE PARENTS AND TEACHERS Habits once formed are very difficult to overcome. Some parents may argue that during young age let them eat whatever they want. After their middle age they can control their diet. But they are making the grave mistake of making their children a slave for taste. Don't over feed. Over feeding decreases the brain power. They are harming more than helping by over feeding their children. Let what they eat be nutritious even if it is in small quantity. There is no need to show our affection through over feeding. If they refuse food let them fast. There is no harm if a child misses a meal. He will automatically take food after he feels hungry. A lean playful child is healthier than a fat lazy child. Pregnant women and newly married couples can take lot of natural food in their diet and meditate to have both physically and mentally strong children. Parents and teachers play a vital role in spreading this message to the younger generations. Children spend more time with the teachers than with their parents. Hence they can tell their students about natural food and their benefits in their classes through books, stories, puppet shows, slides, games etc. A healthy disease less world will bloom in future. TO THE READERS The above points may seem absurd to some readers. But only if every individual change the world will change. We can't change the world without change in the individuals. SMALL DROPS MAKE THE MIGHTY OCEAN. To create this change NATURAL FOOD, ACUPRESSURE AND MEDITATION will help. Cooking is the root cause of all the evils in the world. To curb a evil we have to kill the root cause. Mother Terasa says that Peace should begin at home. Other measures are useless. Only eating fruits will be FRUITFULL. Viewers can send their queries regarding natural food to e-mail : lram12062000@gmail.com MAN IS THE BEST CLOWN OF THE UNIVERSE Man's basic NEEDS are food, clothing and shelter. (1) Food - Fruits and nuts (2) Clothing - 2 sets of dress enough for man. We can get that from the cotton plant and the hand made spinning wheel (used by Mahatma Gandhi). No need for textile industry and their dyes which pollute the rivers. (3) Shelter - we can get from the mud houses and huts. (earthquakes are caused by the big building and dams which we build. It is not the earthquakes which kills, it is the buildings which get destroyed during earthquakes which kills. For the above three we need not disturb the eco cycle. The eco cycle will remain balanced. No need for Industries and factories which spit enormous chemicals into the environment. The other things which we do are for our GREED. Our greed is killing us through weapons, famine, flood, tsunami, earthquakes, violent wind etc. Man is the most intelligent (He can create himself by cloning) and he is also the most foolish (He can kill himself through weapons created by him) of all the creatures. He is a 2-in-1. Hence we can crown ourselves with the title BEST CLOWN OF THE UNIVERSE. Will man realise before the last tree is cut down in the world he can't eat and breathe money?
