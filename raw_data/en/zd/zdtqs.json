Per pseudoci\u00e8ncia formulada Steiner is a spiritualist movement founded in the early 20th century by the esotericist Rudolf Steiner that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world, accessible to human experience. Followers of anthroposophy aim to engage in spiritual discovery through a mode of thought independent of sensory experience. While much of anthroposophy is pseudoscientific, proponents claim to present their ideas in a manner that is verifiable by rational discourse and say that they seek precision and clarity comparable to that obtained by scientists investigating the physical world. Anthroposophy has its roots in German idealism, mystical philosophies, and pseudoscience including racist pseudoscience. Steiner chose the term anthroposophy (from sophia, 'wisdom') to emphasize his philosophy's humanistic orientation. He defined it as \"a scientific exploration of the spiritual world\", Others have variously called it a \"philosophy and cultural movement\", a \"spiritual \"a system of thought\". Anthroposophical ideas have been employed in alternative movements in many areas including education (both in Waldorf schools and in the Camphill movement), agriculture, medicine, banking, organizational development, and the arts. The main organization for advocacy of Steiner's ideas, the Anthroposophical Society, is headquartered at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. Anthroposophy's supporters include writers Saul Kandinsky and Frommer, music therapist Maria Sch\u00fcppel, Romuva religious founder Vydnas, and former president of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Several prominent members of the Nazi Party were supporters of anthroposophy and its movements, including (an agriculturalist), SS colonel Hermann Schneider, and Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller. Rudolf Hess, the adjunct F\u00fchrer, was a patron of Waldorf schools. The Deputy F\u00fchrer was also a staunch defender of Steiner's biodynamic agriculture. The historian of religion Olav Hammer has termed anthroposophy \"the most important esoteric society in European history\". Many scientists, physicians, and philosophers, including Michael Shermer, Michael Ruse, Edzard Ernst, David Gorski, and Simon Singh have criticized anthroposophy's application in the areas of medicine, biology, agriculture, and education to be dangerous and pseudoscientific. Some of Steiner's ideas that are unsupported or disproven by modern science, including: racial evolution, clairvoyance (Steiner claimed he was clairvoyant), and the Atlantis myth.
