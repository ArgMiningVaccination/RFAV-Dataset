Define the terms dietetics, clinical nutrition & therapeutic diet, 2.Enumerate the scope of dietetics and the role of dietitian in health care, Welcome to the study of clinical and therapeutic nutrition. Clinical nutrition, as a study focuses on the nutritional management of individuals or group of i ndividuals with established disease condition. Clinical nutrition deals with issues such as altered nutritional requirements associated with the disease, disease severity and malnutrition and many such issues. Nutrition is an integral part of the medical t herapy as adequate nutrition support can go a long way in improving quality of care and improving patient's medical outcome. The importance of nutrition in the prevention of illness and disease has been long recognized. So let us get to know more about cli nical and therapeutic nutrition. DIETETICS AND ROLE OF DIETITIAN IN HEALTH CARE As a student of nutrition it must be evident to you by now that the diet and the food we eat have a direct and significant impact on our health. Eating a healthy balanced d iet improves the quality of our life, whereas a poor diet may lead to morbidity and disease. The branch of medicine concerned with how food and nutrition affects human health comprising the rules to be followed for preventing, relieving or curing disease b y diet is called Dietetics. Dietetics deals with feeding individuals based on the principles of nutrition. In fact, dietetics is the science and art of human nutritional care. Clinical Dietetics is the application of dietetics in a hospital or health care institutional setting. Clinical dietetics focuses on individual nutrition support and symptom management. You may come across the terms diet therapy, therapeutic diets while studying about clinical dietetics. Let us get to understand these terminologies u sed in the context of dietetics. Diet therapy is a branch of dietetics concerned with the use of food for therapeutic purpose. Diet therapy is a broad term used for the practical application of nutrition as a preventive or corrective treatment of a diseas e. It concerns with recovery from illness by giving good diet and prevention of disease. It may involve the modification of the existing dietary lifestyle to promote optimum health. The principles of diet therapy are to: maintain good nutritional status, correct deficiencies or disease, if any, provide rest to the body, help metabolize the nutrients, and make changes in body weight, when necessary. Diet therapy may include prescribing specialized dietary regimes or meal plans. These specialized die t regimens or meal plans are called therapeutic diets. Therapeutic diet refers to a meal plan that controls the intake of certain foods or nutrients. They are adaptation of the normal, regular diet. Some common examples of therapeutic diets include clear l iquid diet, diabetic diet, renal diet, gluten free diet, low fat diet, high fibre diet etc. Therapeutic diets are usually prescribed by dietitians, nutritionists or physicians. Role of Dietitian in Nutrition Care Dietitian you know is an expert in dietet ics, dealing with human nutritional care. A dietitian applies the science and principals of human nutrition to help people understand the relationship between food and health and make appropriate dietary choices to attain and maintain health and to prevent and treat illness and disease. Dietitians work in a wide variety of roles in, for example, a clinical, public health or community, food service, administrative, freelance/consultancy, research or teaching capacity. However, you will find that majority of dietitians are clinical dietitians working in hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities or specialized institutes/units to provide nutritional care to patients with a variety of health conditions, and provide dietary consultations to pat ients and their families. The activities most likely to be undertaken by the clinical dietitians would include: Collecting, organizing and assessing data relating to health and nutritional status of individuals, groups and communities, Review and analyze patients' nutritional needs and goals to make appropriate dietary recommendations, Develop and implement nutrition care plans and monitor, follow up and evaluate these plans and take corrective measures where ver required, Calculate nutritional value of food/meals planned, Prescribe therapeutic diets and special nutrition support and feeding regimens , Oversee the preparation of special diets, special nutrition formulas for p atients who are critically or terminally and require special feeding through oral, enteral or parenteral routes, Plan and prepare basic menus and assist in supervising food service personnel in preparing menus and serving of meals, Schedule work a ssignments in the dietary unit to facilitate the effective operation of the CHAPTER 2 : THERAPEUTIC DIETS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Enumerate the scope of dietetics and the role of dietitian in he alth care, 2. Explain the diets of altered consistencies , 3. Discuss the adaptation of normal diet to therapeutic diets, and Therapeutic diet is a qualitative/quantitative modified version of a normal regular diet which has been tailored to suit the changing nutritional needs of patient/individual and are used to improve specific health/disease condition. It is a planned diet used to supplement the medical or surgical treatment. Balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such q uantities and proportions that the need for energy, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health and well being Refer to Figure 1.1 which illustrates routine hospital diets. Figure 1 .1: Routine hospital diets Normal or general diet in a hospital setting is a balanced diet which meets the nutritional needs of an individual/patient. It is given when the individual's medical condition does not warrant any specific modification. Most hos pitals follow simple dietary recommendations (given by ICMR (Indian council for Medical Research ) for Indian population) while planning the general diet. It is planned keeping the basic food groups in mind so that optimum amount of all nutrients is provided . Further, since the patient is hospitalized or on bed rest, reduction of 10% in energy intake should be made. The diet provides approximately 1600 to 2200Kcal, and contain around 180 to 300g carbohydrates, 60 to 80g of fat and 40 to 70 g of protein. Figure 1.1 also illustrates the soft diet and the liquid diets which are examples of therapeutic diet. In addition to these there may be other modified diets which individuals may require as part of their therapeutic needs. The reasons for modifying the diets may include: For essential or lifesaving treatment: For example in celiac disease, providing gluten free diet, To replete patients who are malnourished because of disease such as cancer and intestinal diseases by providing a greater amount of a nutrient such as protein, To correct deficiencies and maintain or restore optimum nutritional status, To provide rest or relieve an affected organ such as in gastritis, To adjust to the body's ability to digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete: For example, a low fat diet provided in fat malabsorption, To adjust to tolerance of food intake. For example, in case of patients with cancer of esophagus tube feeding is recommended when patients cannot tolerate food by mouth, To exclude foods due to food allergies or food intolerance, To adjust to mechanical difficulties, for example for elderly patients with denture problems, changing the texture/consistency of food recommended due to problems with chewing and/or swallowing, To increase or decrease body weight/bo dy composition when required, for example as in the case of obesity or underweight, As helpful treatment, alternative or complementary to drugs, as in diabetes or in hypertension Types of Dietary Adaptations for Therapeutic Needs A diet may need to be altered and adjusted in many ways before it meets the therapeutic needs of an individual patient. These adaptations may include: Change in consistency of foods, such as liquid diet, soft diet, low fibre diet, high fibre diet. Increase or decrease in ene rgy value of the diet such as low calorie diet for weight reduction, high calorie diet for burns. Increase or decrease in specific nutrients or type of food consumed, such as sodium restricted diet, lactose restricted diet, high fibre diet, high potassium diet. Elimination of spices and condiments, such as bland diets. Omission of specific foods such as allergy diets, gluten free diet. Adjustment in the ratio and balance of proteins, fats and carbohydrate such as diabetic diet, renal diet and cholestero l-lowering diets. Test diets: These are single meals or diets lasting one or few days that are given to patients in connection with certain tests e.g. the fat absorption test used to determine if steatorrhea is present. Change in frequency of meals, feed ing intervals, re -arrangement of the number and frequency of the meals such as diabetic diet, diet for peptic ulcer disease.Remember, normal nutrition is the foundation upon which the therapeutic modifications are made. The various dietary adaptations for therapeutic needs are briefly highlighted here. A. Diets of Altered Consistency Therapeutic diets are modified for consistency, texture to fit the nutritional needs. Some individuals may require a clear liquid diet, while others a fully liquid diet or soft diet based on their medical condition. Figure 1.2 illustrates the modified diets based on consistency. Figure 1.2: Modifications in consistency a) Liquid Diet consists of foods that can be served in liquid or strained form in room temperature. They are usually prescribed in febrile states, postoperatively i.e. after surgery when the patient is unable to tolerate solid foods. It is also used for individuals with acute infections or digestive problems, to replace fluids lost by vomiting , diarrhoea. The two major types of liquid diets include - Clear liquid diet and full liquid/fluid diet. i) Clear liquid diet provides foods and fluids that are clear and liquid at room temperature. The purpose of the clear liquid diet is to provide fluids a nd electrolytes to prevent dehydration. It provides some amount of energy but very little amount of other nutrients. It is also deficient in fibre. Hence it is nutritionally inadequate and should be used only for short periods i.e. 1 -2 days. Examples of c lear liquid diet: Water, strained fruit juices, coconut water, lime juice (nimbu pani), whey water, barley/arrowroot water, rice kanji, clear dal soup, strained vegetable or meat soup, tea or coffee without milk or cream, carbonated beverages, ice pops, pl ain gelatin are some examples of clear liquid diet. ii) Full liquid diet provides food and fluids that are liquid or semi liquid at room temperature. It is used as a step between a clear liquid diet and a regular diet. The purpose of the full liquid diet is t o provide an oral (by mouth) source of fluid for individuals who are incapable of chewing, swallowing or digesting solid food. It provides more calories than the clear liquid diet and gives adequate nourishment, except that it is deficient in fibre. It is indicated for post -operative patients and for gastrointestinal illness. The nutritive content of the full liquid diet can be increased by using protein, vitamin and fibre supplements. Examples of full liquid diet: Foods allowed or included in a full liqui d diet include beverages, cream soups, vegetable soups, daal soups, strained food juices, lassi/butter milk, yogurt, hot cocoa, coffee/tea with milk, carbonated beverages, cereal porridges (refined cereals) custard, sherbet, gelatin, puddings, ice c ream, eggnog, margarine, butter, cream (added to foods), poached, half boiled egg etc. b) Soft diet as the name suggests provides soft whole food that is lightly seasoned and are similar to the regular diet. The term 'soft' refers to the fact that foods inc luded in this type of diet are soft in consistency, easy to chew and made of simple, easily digestible foods. It does not contain harsh fibre or strong flavors. It is given during acute infections, certain gastrointestinal disorders and at the post -operati ve stage to individuals who are in the early phase of recovery following a surgery. The soft diet provides a transition between a liquid and a normal diet i.e. during the period when a patient has to give up a full liquid diet but is yet not able to tolera te a normal diet. Soft diet can be nutritionally adequate (providing approximately 1800 -2000 calories, 55 -65g protein) provided the patient is able to consume adequate amount of food. Examples of soft diet: A soft diet freely permits the use of cooked veg etables, soft raw fruits without seeds, broths and all soups, washed pulses in the form of soups and in combination of cereals and vegetables (like khichri, dalia), breads and ready -to-eat cereals (most preferable refined such as poha, upma, pasta, noodles etc.), milk and milk beverages, yogurt, light desserts (including kheer, halwa, custard, jelly, ice cream), Egg and tender and minced, ground, stewed meat and meat products, fat like butter, cream, vegetable oil and salt and sugar in moderation. Foods to be best avoided in the soft diet include coarse cereals, spicy highly seasoned and fried foods, dry fruits and nuts, rich desserts. c) Bland Diet: A bland diet is made of foods that are soft, not very spicy and low in fiber. It consists of foods which are me chanically, chemically and thermally non -irritating i.e. are least likely to irritate the gastrointestinal tract. Individuals suffering from gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastritis or ulcerative colitis are prescribed this diet. Foods Included: Milk and mil k products low in fat or fat free; Bread, pasta made from refined cereals, rice; cooked fruits and vegetables without peel and seeds; Eggs and lean tender meat such as fish, poultry that are steamed, baked or grilled; Cream, butter; Puddings and custards, clear soups. Foods Avoided: Fried, fatty foods; Strong flavored foods; Strong tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, condiments and spices; High fiber foods; hot soups and beverages; whole grains rich in fiber; strong cheeses. B. Modification in Quantity Depending on the clinical condition some individuals may require a restriction diet such as sodium restricted diet (as in high blood pressure), purine restricted diet (as in gout) or low residue diet (prescribed and/or before abdominal surgery) designed to reduce the frequency and volume of fecal output. Sometimes a complete elimination diet may be recommended when there is food intolerances or complete insensitivity to a particular food such as a gluten free diet or a dairy free diet or nut free diet etc. O ccasionally an increase in the amount of a specific dietary constituent may be prescribed such as a high potassium diet or a high fibre diet (as in constipation) or an iron -rich diet (as in anemia) when the clinical condition demands. C. Modificat ion in Nutrient (Proteins, Fat, Carbohydrate) Content The nutrient content of the diet is modified to treat deficiencies, change body weight or control diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. You may have come across patients with high blood sugar level s, being prescribed a diabetic diet which requires changes in the quantity and type of carbohydrates included in each meal. Refined carbohydrates (such as sugar, honey, refined flour, semolina etc.) are best avoided and use of complex carbohydrates (whole wheat flour, coarse cereals etc.) recommended. Patients with heart diseases require a fat controlled low cholesterol diet while patients with renal (kidney) failure and advanced liver diseases a low protein diet, patients with HIV disease, cancer or malnou rished a high protein, high calorie diet. Others as in the case of overweight, obesity a weight reduction diet, low in fat and calories. D. Changes in Meal Frequency Individuals suffering with gastro -esophageal reflux disease (GERD) stand to benefit by consuming small but frequent meals. 5 to 6 small meals instead of three regular meals are recommended. E. Changes in Method of Cooking Leaching is indicated for cooking vegetables for people with chronic kidney diseases because the kidney's no longer ma intains the ideal level of potassium necessary for optimum health. Leaching (soaking in water) drains out excessive potassium and phosphorous from the vegetables. In elderly people food may be modified by mechanical processing such as mashing, blend ing or chopping. For patients on bland diet foods steamed, baked or grilled are recommended. A review on the methods of cooking is presented for your understanding at the end of the book. F. Modification in the Method of Feeding To provide adequate nutrition, normally oral feeding (by mouth) is recommended. Sometimes oral feeding is not possible, under such circumstances special feeding methods such as enteral feeding (provision of liquid formula diet delivered via nasogastric feeding tube) and parenteral feedi ng (fluids containing water, glucose, amino acids, minerals, vitamins given through the peripheral and central veins) is recommended. _____________________________________________________________________ Chapter 3: NUTRITION AND INFECTION Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Discuss the interaction between nutrition and infection, 2. Describe the effect of infection on nutritional status, 3. Discuss how malnutrition can lead to infection, The role of n utrition in disease prevention and health management is well established. Also you are aware that poor nutrition can lead to ill health, disease and infections. Infections are caused by microorganisms which in turn can lead to malnutrition. Is there a link between these two conditions? In this section we shall discuss the interaction of infection and nutrition. Infection and malnutrition have always been intricately linked. Evidence suggests that common childhood infections exert their influence in preci pitating malnutrition. The relationship between malnutrition, impaired immunity and infection can be described as a vicious cycle. We will learn about this vicious cycle in this chapter. THE CYCLE OF MALNUTRITION AND INFECTION Malnutrition, as you alread y know, is an impairment of health resulting from a deficiency or lack of food/nutrients or imbalance of nutrients in the diet. Almost any nutrient deficiency, if sufficiently severe, will impair resistance to infection. Let us understand this interaction between malnutrition and infection with the help of a case study. Raju, a 4 -year-old boy, is suffering from infectious diarrhoea, caused by the invasion of the body by harmful microorganisms. The infection caused loose motion, fever, dehydration and impai red absorption. On further investigation he was also found to be suffering from protein energy malnutrition reflecting as loss of weight. Now, when these two diseases exist in the same person (here Raju) concurrently, the interaction between the two diseas es usually alters the nature, behavior of the diseases. The overall clinical status of the child worsens often resulting in increased complications or increased duration of the disease and in some cases results in death. In case of Raju, infection is a com mon precipitating factor for malnutrition. Ironically, malnutrition is also a major factor in the occurrence of infection and the two interact, making each other worse. Figure 2.1 illustrates this interaction. Figure 3.1: Interaction between i nfection and malnutrition An inadequate dietary intake, in case of Raju, led to weight loss, lowered immunity, mucosal injury, invasion by pathogens, and impaired growth and development as highlighted in Figure 3.1. Raju's nutrition was further aggr avated by diarrhea, malabsorption, loss of appetite, diversion of nutrients for the immune response, and urinary nitrogen loss, all of which lead to nutrient losses and further damage to defense mechanisms making him more susceptible to infections. This in turn led to further reduced dietary intake causing a vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection as highlighted in Figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: The vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection So when infection aggravates malnutrition or maln utrition lowers resistance to infection, the relationship between the two can be described as Synergism i.e. the simultaneous presence of malnutrition and infection results in an interaction that is more serious for the individual than would be expected fr om the combined effect of the two working independently. The synergistic effect of malnutrition and infection often leads to a high rate of child deaths in poor households/communities in India. What generally happens is that in a poor rural/slum household a child is as such born with low birth weight (that is less than 2.5kg) because of inadequate dietary intake of the mother during pregnancy. Subsequently the child is solely breast fed for long periods (2 or more years). Complementary feeding (i.e. introd uction of additional foods other than breastmilk) is delayed beyond 6 months of age. This triggers growth faltering that is the child's growth and development slows down resulting in weight loss. In other terms malnutrition sets in. Moreover, in view of th e poor environment and lack of hygiene so common in rural/slum areas, the children are further exposed to infections like diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. There is reduction in food intake by the child due to loss of appetite due to these infect ions. As a result, there is further slowing down of growth. The cumulative effect of dietary deficit and infection produces retardation of physical growth leading to stunting (short stature or low height/length for age as compared to normal child) in child ren. It is important to highlight here that the effects of stunting are long lasting. Children who are stunted grow up to be adults with reduced capacity to do physical work and are less economically productive. Effect of Malnutrition on Infection With reference to Figure 3.1 and 3.2, it must be evident to you that inadequate nutrient intake lowers immunity. Also it leads to mucosal damage. Let us get to know more on this aspect. a) Lowered Immunity: Immunity, in simple terms can be described as the st ate of being unsusceptible or being protected against a particular disease or illness by the presence of particular substance in the blood. These particular disease fighting substances are called antibodies. A healthy well -nourished child/individual is at a lower risk of infection. They can fight the infection because of the ability of these well -nourished individuals to produce these disease fighting substances called antibodies. But in case of malnourished individuals there is reduction in antibody produc tion and therefore the disease fighting capacity is lowered making the individual more prone to infections. b) Effect on the integrity of skin and mucous membrane: Dietary inadequacy diminishes resistance to infection by reducing the integrity of various tis sues. In a healthy well fed individual the skin, mucosal membrane and other tissues are healthy and prevent the entry of infectious agents. They act as a barrier and prevent the infection from entering the body. In an individual suffering from malnutrition , the protective mechanism is absent. The mucous membrane becomes readily permeable and provides a favorable environment for the growth of the infectious agent. Consequently, the individual will catch infection easily. Infection and Nutritional Status Infection, no matter how mild, has adverse effects on nutritional status. Nutritional status, as you may recall, refers to the condition of health of an individual as influenced by the utilization of the nutrients. So how does infection influence the utili zation of the nutrients which in turn influences nutritional status? Let us understand. There can be multiple ways but the first and foremost effect of infection is on loss of appetite. a) Loss of Appetite: Do you recall the last time you were sick or down with some infection? What did you experience? Yes, you may not have been eager to consume food or were not able to tolerate food leading to loss of appetite. Further with use of medicines such as antibiotics to treat the infection your appetite may have be en further affected leading to reduced food intake. Now if this condition would have been prolonged it would have led to consistent decrease in food intake leading to nutrient deficiency. b) Unfavorable cultural practices: One of the common practices in our country is to restrict or withdraw food from individuals when suffering from infection, particularly diarrhoea or respiratory infections. It is believed that solid foods, milk etc. be best avoided instead bland, starchy gruels low in nutritive value be pr ovided to rest the digestive system. Such a practice is deleterious; particularly when the individual due to infection is already having low food intake and further reduction in the quality of diet contributes to nutrient deficiencies and thus leading to p oor nutritional status. c) Decreased intestinal absorption: The main function of intestine is to digest, absorb and propel food along its length. During infection all these functions are affected. Infections cause's changes to the epithelial membrane l eading to malabsorption. Any decrease in the absorption of nutrients can lead to deficiency. For example, in children suffering from infectious diarrhoea, protein absorption from intestine may reduce as much as 40%. Other evidence suggests that in children with acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections only 30 -70 per cent of ingested vitamin A is absorbed. Poor absorption thus leads to nutrient deficiency disorders influencing nutritional status. d) Worm/parasite infection: Also there are documented reports implicating intestinal worm/parasitic infections with poor nutritional status. Hookworm, round worm infection, amoebiasis, giardiasis is among the most common intestinal parasitic infections worldwide. These infections are associated with decreased child growth, loss of weight, chronic blood loss, iron deficiency anaemia, diarrhoea and stunted growth. e) Protein loss: In some infections and fevers, few nutrients, particularly proteins are excreted and lost from the body thus causing poor nutritional status. For example, diseases associated with diarrhoea, dysentery produce an average loss of 0.9g protein per kg body weight per day. Higher losses are observed with typhoid fever and other acute infections, reaching 1.2g protein/kg body weight/day. Such losses t herefore contribute to increased requirement of protein during infection and fevers. From the discussion above it must be evident to you that the overall effect of the infections on the nutritional status is substantial. In the context of developing cou ntry like India, where large number of children, are already on a deficient diet and malnourished, the coexistence of infection in the same child is producing the effect that is beyond the summed effect expected from the two conditions acting alone. ______________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 4: METHODS OF COOKING Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Describe different methods of cooking , 2. Explain and ensure the nutritive v alues in various methods of cooking. Many foods are consumed as such in the raw state while some are cooked to make them edible. Food is being cooked as it tastes better Even vegetable and fruits are cooked to add variety to the diet and make them easil y palatable, attractive and colorful. Cooking also kills many microorganism and makes the food safe to be consumed. Several raw foods have anti -nutritional factors which are destroyed by cooking. It also enhance the availability of some nutrients. Figur e 4.1 Different methods of cooking Principles of cooking food 1. Foods must be cooked in a way that it retains the original flavours. 2. Sometimes the flavor of the food is drawn out into the gravy or broth. 3. The preservation of the maximum nutritive value can be ensured by using the correct method of cooking. Cooking methods During cooking, heat may be transferred to the food by conduction, convection, radiation or by the energy of microwave -electronic heat transfer. Table 4.1: Classification of Cooking Methods Moist Method Dry heat Combination Method Boiling Roasting Braising Simmering Griling/ Broiling Poaching Toasting Stewing Baking Blenching Suffering Steaming Frying Pressure Cooking i) Moist Methods: These are the methods in which we us e the heat generated by water in some form or the other. Some of the important ones are explained as follows: a) Boiling Foods are cooked by placing them in boiling water at 1000 C and maintain this temperature till the desired stage of cooking has been reached. Rice, pulses, potatoes are cooked this way. Advantages 1. Simplest Method of cookery 2. Boiling of food brings about uniform cooking of food 3. At high temperatures protein content of food get denatured and embedded in food 4. Starch gets gelatinized and colla gen gets hydrolyzed. 5. Boiling of foods aids in proper digestion Disadvantages 1. The process of boiling takes time. 2. When excess of water is used the water soluble nutrients are lost. 3. Loss of minerals is also a big disadvantage with boiling. 4. Boiling o f food brings about its decoloration b) Pressure Cooking In this method the food is cooked under pressure and with increase in pressure the temperature also correspondingly increases. Thus the food is cooked very fast. Actually it is a type of steaming only , in which water is boiled under high pressure, thus raising the temperature and reducing the cooking time. Advantages 1. Reduces cooking time. 2. Fuel efficiency increased. 3. Nutrient loss is less. 4. Food is cooked properly and is made tender. 5. The flavor and arom a of the food is trapped inside the cooker and is not lost. Disadvantages 1. Long hours of pressure cooking make food soggy and too soft. 2. Flavors of foods may make and individuality be lost. c) Steaming This method uses steam as the medium of cooking. The f ood is surrounded by steam and is cooked by the heat supplied from steam. Types of steaming are: Dry steaming: The steam generated from double boiler is used for cooking food. Sauces and custards are made by this method. Wet Steaming: Steam comes in dire ct contact with the food and cooks it. Dhokla and idli are made by this method. Advantages 1. Constant stirring is not required. 2. Nutritive value of food remains intact. 3. Cooking time is less. 4. No external is added which makes the food easily digestible. 5. The f lavor of the steamed food is good. Disadvantages 1. Dhokla cooker and Idli makers are required. 2. Special vessels are essential for steaming food. 3. Limitation of the type of foods that can be cooked by this method. d) Poaching This method is generally use d for eggs. This involves cooking in the minimum amount of liquid at a temperature of 80 -85. Fish and fruits are also poached. Advantages 1. Cooks food quickly. 2. There is no addition of fat. 3. The foods that are poached are better digestible. Disadvantages 1. Water soluble nutrients leach into the water. 2. The foods are generally bland in taste. e) Toasting Generally applied for bread slices which are browned from both sides by keeping them between two grilles. Advantages 1. Improves color, flavor and texture of food. 2. Roasted seeds are easy to grind. 3. Roasting reduces the amount of moisture of foods Disadvantages 1. A continuous vigil is required to prevent burning. 2. Amino acids are lost while toasting. f) Baking The medium of cooking is hot air. A dry method of cooking, it combines steam which is generated while food is cooked. Cakes, custard, baked vegetables, bread, biscuit, pizzas are all baked food. Advantages 1. Texture and flavor of foods are improved. 2. Baking give rise to a variety of combination of dishes. 3. Foods are cooked uniformly in an oven. Disadvantages 1. An oven is required for baking. 2. Over cooking results in the burning and scorching of food. g) Blanching Blanching is a cooking process wherein a food, usually a vegetable or fruit, is scalded in boiling water or oil, removed after a brief, timed interval, and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (shocking or refreshing ) to halt the cooking process. Advantages 1. Blanched dishes are healthy as there is minimal loss of nutrients because of the short cooking time. 2. Blanching also enhances the color of green vegetables, and the time taken is also lesser than other moist heat cooking methods. Disadvantages 1. Blanching cannot be used for every type of food item. 2. Blanching often needs to be cou pled with another cooking process so as to provide more flavor to the final dish. ___________________________________________________________________________ UNIT 2: DIET IN HEALTH AND DISEASE (CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, CLINICAL SYMPTOM S AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) CHAPTER 5: FEVER (ACUTE & CHRONIC) CHAPTER 6: DIARRHOEA CHAPTER 7: EATING DISORDERS (ANOREXIA NERVOSA, 8: OVERWEIGHT/OBESSITY CHAPTER -5: FEVERS (ACUTE&CH RONIC) (TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Define the term fever and present the classification of fevers 2. Differentiate between acute and chr onic fevers 3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during infection and fevers, and 4. Describe diet therapy during fevers. In the previous Unit we looked at the interrelationship between nutrition and infections. You would rea lize that infection and fevers are coexistent. Fever is an outcome of infection. In this section we will also look at the basic concepts and inter -relationship between fever, infection and nutrition. A detail review on dietary management of fevers will be presented. FEVER: DEFINITION, CAUSES & SYMPTOMS Fever is classically defined as the abnormal condition of the body, characterized by undue rise in temperature, quickening of the pulse, and disturbance of various body functions. Surely, you must be aware of the normal body temperature. Yes, the normal human body temperature may range from 36oC to 37oC (98.6F). So, technically any body temperature above the normal temperature may be considered fever. What do you think? Well, in practice an individual is usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 (38 \u00b0 C). It is important to understand that fever is not an illness but it is a symptom or an adaptive response of our body to a variety of conditions, such as infection, inflammation or unknown causes. Fever may be caused by a bacterial infection or by a virus or certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation of the lining of the joints) or a malignant tumor etc. As a child you may recall suff ering from cold/cough and/or chest infection or diarrhoea, and very often these infections were accompanied by fever. The clinical and behavioral manifestations of fever besides elevated temperature you might have experienced included headache, muscle ache , chills and shivering, sweating, loss of appetite, irritability, general weakness, dehydration etc. Fever is, therefore, a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in the body. Fever, in fact, is part of the body's own disease -fighting m echanism. A rise in body temperature is one of the ways our immune system attempts to combat an infection Fever helps defend against microbial (bacterial/viral) invasions and apparently is capable of killing or inhibiting the growth of some bacteria/viruse s that can tolerate only a narrow temperature range. From our review so far we may then conclude that usually a rise in temperature helps the individual resolve an infection. So a mild fever i.e. above the normal body temperature but below 100.4F (38 \u00b0 C) is probably helping to neutralize the bacteria or virus that is causing the infection. There is no need to worry. But sometimes fever may rise too high and can be severe and serious and lead to complications. Therefore it is important to learn about the cl assification, type and pattern of fever for appropriate management. FEVER: CLASSIFICATION AND TYPES Fevers are primarily classified into three categories: Acute, Sub -acute and Chronic fevers based on duration as highlighted in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1 Classification of fevers Acute fevers are those which are for less than 7 days in duration and are characteristics of infectious diseases such as malaria and viral -related upper respiratory tract infections. Sub-acute fevers are usua lly not more than 2 weeks in duration as can be seen in cases of typhoid fever. Chronic fever on the other hand are persistent, usually more than 2 week in duration 2 Basal Metabolic Rate is defined as the rate at which our body uses energy wh en we are resting in order to keep the vital body functions (such as breathing, heart beating etc.) going and are typical of chronic bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, viral infections like HIV, cancers etc. Further, based on the height of the bod y temperature, fevers can also be classified as low grade, moderate grade or high grade fever. You would notice that a low grade fever does not exceed 37.80C and is present daily especially in the evening. Tuberculosis causes low grade fever. Similarly you may come across fever types described as continuous or sustained fever, intermittent fever and remittent fever. Continuous/sustained fever is defined as a fever that does not fluctuate more than about 1oC (1.5F) during 24h, but at no time touched normal. Continuous fevers are seen in pneumonia, typhoid, and urinary tract infection among others. Such fevers are characterized by slow step -wise temperature rise. Intermittent fever is defined as fever present only for several hours during the day. This pattern you may notice in malaria, tuberculosis or pyrogenic infections. Remittent fever, on the other hand, is defined as fever with daily fluctuations exceeding 2oC but at no time touched normal. This kind of fever is always associated with infectious diseases such as infective endocarditis, rickettsiae Infection. Having looked at the different types and classification of fever, we shall focus next on management of fevers, with special reference to dietary management. Diet, you would notice plays an important role in the management of fevers. With the rise in body temperature, (above normal), several metabolic changes occur in the body that increases the nutritional needs. A brief review on these changes is presented next. METABOLIC CHANGES DURING FEVER Feve r is usually characterized by certain metabolic changes. Higher the temperature, longer the duration of the fever, more is the ill effect. The common effects include: Increase in the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Note, there is a 13% increase in BMR with every 1 \u00b0C rise in body temperature.(or 7% increase with every 1 \u00b0C increase in temperature). Decreased glycogen stores and decreased stores of adipose (fat) tissue. Increased catabolism (breakdown) of proteins, especially in case of typhoid, malaria, tuber culosis fevers. This results in production of excess amount of nitrogenous wastes, which places an additional burden on the kidneys. Increased excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride etc. thought sweat, urine, vomiting leading to electrolyte imbalance. Accelerated loss of body fluid in the form of excessive sweat and urine formation. Loss of appetite which limits the food intake thus leading to weight loss. Decrease in the absorption of nutrients like proteins, vitamins, minerals. The above chan ges accompanied by headache, muscle ache, chills and shivering, sweating, loss of appetite, irritability, general weakness, dehydration experienced during fever may have a significant effect on the nutritional status of the individual. Thus management of f ever becomes critical. In the next section we shall look at the diet therapy for management of Fevers. We shall first consider the dietary management in sub -acute fever, followed by dietary therapy for chronic fever. DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF SUB -ACUTE FEVE R Typhoid is a serious health threat in the developing world such as India, especially for children. We have already learnt that typhoid is a sub -acute continuous fever which can last for about two week's duration. What is the cause of typhoid? Typhoid is caused by the Salmonella t yphi bacteria, and is also called enteric fever because the bacteria or infection is found in the intestines. Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or occasionally through direct contact with someone who is i nfected. The mode of spread of this infection is, through fecal -oral route . Let us understand the concept of fecal -oral route here. Note, Salmonella typhi is passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. The source of infection can be the drinking water or milk or any other food contaminated by intestinal contents (through faeces, urine) of the patient or by flies which transmit the disease. We can also contact the infection if we eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who has n ot washed their hands carefully after using the toilet. A patient with typhoid will usually present with: high fever, headache, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting gastrointestinal problems like abdominal pain and either diarrhoea or constipation. increased BMR massive loss of lean body mass (muscle) due to tissue (protein) breakdown leading to excessive nitrogen loss. significant decrease in glycogen and adipose tissue stores because of increased energy expenditure. excessive diarrhoea, vomiting le ading to fluid and electrolyte losses. Dietary management in Sub -acute fever The main objective of dietary management during sub acute fever is to: i) provide a nutritious diet to prevent malnutrition. ii) restore positive nitrogen balance and reduce the burde n on kidneys iii) provide relief to symptoms as and when present. iv) correct and maintain water and electrolyte balance, and v) avoid irritation of intestinal tract as may occur in typhoid. Thus the dietary management will focus on providing a diet that contai ns high calories, proteins, carbohydrates and moderate fat. But very often the fever is accompanied by anorexia, vomiting, nausea. You would notice the patient has poor appetite moreover is unable to tolerate food. So, the diet has to be modified as per th e patients' tolerance. The texture of foods given would depend on the patient's tolerance. Initially a liquid or full fluid diet may be provided for few days. As the person's appetite improves a bland diet, low fibre soft diet may be given which is soothin g and easy to digest. Slowly the person may be put on a normal diet. The idea is to encourage the patient to eat so as to meet the increased nutrient requirements. Feedings several times a day need to be encouraged. The nutrient needs during typhoid and ho w to meet them is the focus of discussion next. The information is summarized in Table 5.1. Table 5.1: Dietary considerations and nutritional needs during sub -acute fever. 1600 Kcal Diet Chart Meal Menu Amount Early Morning Coconut water (Liquid and 1 glass (250ml) electrolytes) Glucose biscuit 2 No. Breakfast Potato sandwich with butter 1 portion (2 slices) (high calorie) Banana 1 No. (100 -150gms) Apple Juice 1 glass (250ml) 10.00am Buttermilk (salty) 1 glass (250ml) Suji upma 1 katori e cooked Mid Morning (12:00noon) Clear dal soup 1 big bowl (200ml) Lunch Khichri 1 big bowl Soft Vegetable (Lauki/ 1 katorie cooked Tinda/ Pumpkin/potato) Washed dal 1 katorie cooked Curd 1 katorie Cooking oil 1 - 1\u00bd tsp Evening tea Tea with sugar 1 cup with 2 tsp Glucose Biscuit 2 No. Evening Snack Lemon Water (sugar and 1 glass salt) 1 katorie cooked Stewed apple Dinner Boiled Rice 1 big bowl Soft Vegetable (Lauki/ 1 katorie cooked Tinda/ pumpkin/ potato) Washed dal 1 katorie cooked Curd 1 katorie Cooking Oil 1 1 \u00bd tsp Bed time Apple Juice 1 glass (250 ml) Following the dietary considerations highlighted in Table 5.1, we hope you should be in a position to plan a diet for a typhoid patient. .

Avoid close contact or sharing eating utensils, cups with people who are infected DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC FEVER Tuberculosis (TB), you may be aware, is an example of chronic fever caused by bacteria - Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The disease spreads from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air by cough or spit or sneeze from a person with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis mainly af fects the lungs but can get localized in other organs also, like lymph nodes, kidney, bone etc The most commonly observed form of tuberculosis in India is pulmonary tuberculosis. It is worthy to note that tuberculosis remains a major global health problem and is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. It is linked to poverty, under nutrition and poor immune function. When a person is infected with pulmonary tuberculosis, in a normal healthy individual, the immune system help fights the infection and the bacteria in the body are in an inactive state and the person shows no symptom. This is called latent tuberculosis. However, if the body's immune system is unable to fight the bacteria the disease becomes activ e and is contagious and can spread in the body and to other people. The association between TB and undernutrition has long been known. TB makes undernutrition worse and undernutrition weakens immunity, thereby increasing the likelihood that latent T B will develop into active disease. The common symptom with active TB in individuals is that they: are in a catabolic (breakdown of protein/body tissue) state leading to muscle wasting, experience weight loss, have fever, fatigue, exhaustion and persis tent coughing, show signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and have low body mass index (BMI) (lower than 18.5 kg/m2). Why do you think weight loss occurs among those with TB? Weight loss can be caused by several factors, including: reduced foo d intake due to loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain; loss of protein and other nutritional reserves due to fever , malabsorption due to diarrhoea, loss of fluids, electrolytes metabolic alterations caused by the disease, and an increase in the energy expenditure of the patient in an attempt to fight infection The progression of the disease may be slow gradual but can lead to serious consequences. The key to treatment, therefore, is early detection, followed by antibiotic therapy, adequate res t and diet management. Children with TB, in particular, need special attention since the child has increased requirements as a result of both growth and TB. Tuberculosis is completely curable through short -course chemotherapy. Treating TB cases who are spu tum-smear positive (and who can therefore spread the disease to others) at the source, it is the most effective means of eliminating TB from a population.DOTS or Directly Observed Treatment Short course is the internationally recommended strategy for TB co ntrol that has been recognized as a highly efficient and cost -effective strategy . Let us study the dietary management next. Dietary Management of tuberculosis As undernutrition is highly prevalent among people with TB, the dietary recommendations for TB patients are based on the nutrient and energy requirements for hyper catabolic and undernourished patients. The main objective of diet therapy is to prevent weight loss, strengthen the immune system and accelerate recovery. An adequate diet containi ng all essential nutrients namely carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins is necessary for the well being and health of the TB patient. Dietary considerations for tuberculosis Here are some recommendations on how to monitor weight gain in TB patients, particularly in children: Encourage the individual to eat healthy, nourishing balanced diet. TB often adversely affects nutritional intake due to poor appetite, making patients at risk for malnutrition. Encourage patients to consume six sma ller meals per day instead of three. Make the meals appetizing in appearance and taste and provide enough energy and protein. Commercially -available high energy and protein drinks (balanced in terms of micro - and macronutrients) may be used effectively t o meet the increased requirements. Household ingredients such as sugar, vegetable oil, peanut butter, eggs and non -fat dry milk powder can be used in porridge, soups, gravies, milk based -drinks to increase the protein and energy content without adding to the bulk of the meal. At least 500ml to 1litre milk (or milk product like yoghurt t, soft cheese) should be consumed daily to ensure adequate intakes of vitamin D and calcium. Ensure consumption of at least five to six portions of fruit and vegetab les per day. Pure fruit juice can be used to decrease the bulk of the diet. Provide adequate fluid intake (at least 10 to 12 glasses per day) to compensate for increased losses Provide a good multivitamin and mineral supplement. Ensure safe food handlin g and personal hygiene. Now, can you now summarize the dietary recommendation for a TB patient. Prepare a list of foods you may include liberally or restrict/avoid in the diet of a TB patient. Table 5.4: Foods to include and to be restricted/ avoided in the diet of tuberculosis patient Foods to include Foods to avoid 1. Cereals and millets (wheat, rice, ragi, 1. Red meat and organ meats jowar) 2. Limit refined foods 2. Pulses (rajma, black chana, soyabean) 3. Strongly flavored vegetables 3. High energy, protein drinks and 4. Excess fat beverages 5. Fried fatty food 4. Foods providing proteins of high 6. Sweets concentrated food biologic values ex. - eggs, soft cheese, 7. Acidic and spicy food such as pickles tender meat, fish etc. 8. Spices, condiments and seasoning 5. Cereals pulse combination with some animal protein ex. Khichri with curd etc. 6. Nuts and oil seeds like pea nuts 7. Seasonal fruits and vegetables 8. Green leafy vegetables like maithi, mint, spinach, cabbage etc. 9. Citrus frui ts 10. Milk and milk products 11. Vegetables oils and dairy fat like ghee 12. Jaggary and sugar We end the dietary management of TB patients with some Do \\s and Don'ts. Table 5.5: Do's and Don'ts Do's Don'ts 1. Always washed vegetables and fruits 1. Do not serve large meals to prevent with clean water before serving discomfort 2. Wash hands frequently particularly 2. Do not excessive fat in cooking before eating or preparing food 3. Consumption of tobacco and alcohol 3. Give plenty of fluids and electrolytes to should be avoided compensate for loses 4. Caffeine tea consumption should be 4. Provide 6 frequent meal per day avoided 5. Include 5 -6 portion of fruits and 5. Avoid close contact or sharing utensils, vegetable in the diet each day cups with people who are infected 6. Include meals which are easy to digest well tolerated 7. provide a good multivitamin and mineral supplements ______________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 6: DIARRHOEA (TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives: After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Define diarrhoea and review the different terminologies used in the context of diarrhoea, 2. Differentiate between d ifferent types of diarrhoea, 3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during diarrhoea and 4. Describe the diet therapy during diarrhoea. We have looked at the basic concepts and inter -relationship between fever, infection and nutri tion in our study so far. Diarrhoea, an infection, is an important public health problem among under -five children in developing countries. Recent evidence suggests that diarrhoea is the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, and is responsib le for 13% of all deaths/year in children under five years of age. This chapter will focus on the classification/terminologies, determinants, preventive and control strategies of diarrhoea and dietary principles for management of diarrhoea at home or in a community setting. DIARRHOEA: DEFINITION, CAUSES & SYMPTOMS As per the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than normal for the individual). Now con sider the following cases. Case 1 : Rani is a 2 -year-old girl. She has a history of frequent passing of stools but they are well formed. As a baby who was breast fed, even then, Rani use to pass loose \"pasty\" (semi formed) stools. Her mother is worried. Case 2 : Ramu is a 2 -year-old boy. He has a 2 -day history of watery diarrhoea. His mother informs that he has had several episodes of loose motions with 4 -5 loose liquid stools passed per day. In your opinion are the two children suffering from Diarrhoea? B efore you jump to any conclusion, please read the definition of diarrhoea once again more carefully. Then comment on each case. Diarrhoea is the passage of three or more liquid or watery stools in a day. Here the consistency and character of stools rather than the number of stools alone is critical. Figure 6.1: Types of diarrhoea Now, considering the two cases mentioned above, Ramu is more likely to be suffering from diarrhoea as his stools are liquid, watery and off course frequent. Rani, though was passing frequent stools but the stools were well formed. Hence, she is not likely to be suffering from diarrhoea. Remember, Diarrhoea is characterized by the frequent passage of liquid stools, which is accompanied by excessive lo ss of fluids and electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium. Diarrhoea, is a symptom and not a disease. This must be clear to you. SYMPTOMS OF DIARRHOEA Diarrhoea is associated with symptoms depending on the cause and who is affected. Common symptom , however, include: Watery, thin or loose stools Abdominal cramps Sense of urgency to have a bowel movement Nausea and vomiting In addition to the symptoms described above, the symptoms of severe persistent diarrhea include: Dehydration Blood, mucus, or undigested food in the stool Weight loss Fever Diarrhoea can be life -threatening! During diarrhoea, the stools have high water content - an indicator that water is being lost in higher than normal amounts. The stools also contain a high amount of electrolytes (sodium, potassium). This results in the deficiency of water and electrolytes in the body which is referred to as dehydration. By now, you must have understood the consequences of diarrhea/dehydration and can appreciate that it is the h ighest cause of illness and death especially in children. So an understanding on what causes diarrhoea needs urgent attention. Causes of diarrhea Diarrhoea, is usually a symptom of bowel infection. The infection may be caused by a wide range of pathogens , including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. These (E. coli), Salmonella and Shigella : they all may cause food poisoning Virus, such as a Norovirus or Rotavirus Parasites, such as the Giardia intestinalis , that causes Giardiasis Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking -water or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Poverty, ignorance, poor sanita tion is often the underlying risk factors Diarrhoea caused by contaminated food or water while travelling is often known as traveller's diarrhoea. Recognizing the ill -effects, management of diarrhoea, particularly in the context of management of dehydrati on and malnutrition is crucial which is discussed next. TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA Diarrhea/dehydration should not be neglected and must receive prompt medical care to minimize the frequency of morbidity and mortalities. In light of the compli cations discussed above let us now examine what should be the objectives in the management of diarrhoea and more specifically dehydration. The major objectives in the management of diarrhoea include: 1. Fluid and electrolyte replacement 2. Removal of cau se (especially if infection) 3. Nutrition concerns 4. Determining the status of dehydration 5. Fluid management(ORT -Oral rehydration therapy) 6. Nutritional management The first step in diarrhea management is to determine the status of dehydration. Let us consi der this Determining the status of Dehydration Table 6.1: Recognizing dehydration Dehydration status Sign/Symptoms Some dehydration Two of the following signs: Restless, irritable Sunken eyes Drinks eagerly, thirsty Skin pinch goes b ack Slowly Severe dehydration Two of the following signs: Lethargy or unconscious Sunken eyes Not able to drink or drinking poorly Skin pinch goes back very slowly Figure 6.2a: Sunken eyes - a sign of dehydr ation Figure 6.2b: Skin pinch - goes back slowly A review on the use of ORT and the fluid therapy in the management of dehydration is presented next. The key to diarrhoea management is the early replacement of fluid lost in the st ools through intravenous or oral route (by mouth). Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is at the core of management of diarrhoea. A review on the use of ORT and the fluid therapy in the management of dehydration is presented in this section. First let us under stand what is ORT? Oral rehydration therapy is a simple treatment for dehydration associated with diarrhoea. The term ORT includes: Complete oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution, Solutions made from sugar and salt, Food based solutions, and Home fluids without insisting on specified amounts of glucose and salt. . The term ORS refers to the complete oral rehydration salt mixture. ORS is potentially the most important medical advance of this century. It is safe, effective and cost saving. ORS can alone su ccessfully rehydrate 95 -97% individuals with diarrhoea. A single universal ORS solution containing: sodium - 75 mmol/l and glucose - 75 mmol/l, osmolarity 245 mosmol/l is recommended for all ages and all types of diarrhoea. How much of ORS to give for rep lacement of ongoing stool losses to maintain hydration. Refer to Table 6.2 for easy reference. Table 6.2: ORS guidelines for replacement of ongoing losses to maintain hydration Age After each liquid stool, offer < 6 months Quarter glass or cup * (50 ml) 7 months to less than 2 years Quarter to half glass or cup * (50 -100 ml) 2 up to 10 years Half to one glass or cup* (100 -200 ml) Older children and adults As much as desired * Large tea cup Besides ORS, other oral rehydration therapies can also be used and recommended, when ORS is not available. These other oral rehydration therapies are presented in Table 6.3. Table 6.3: Other oral rehydration therapies* Composition per litre Appropriate use Home made fluids Sugar (Sucrose) 40g Prevention of dehydration Sugar and salt solution Salt (NaCl) 4g Food based solutions -Rice approximately 50g Prevention of dehydration -Rice water* with salt (precise measurement not required -Dal or dal water with salt -Salt 4g -Butter milk (Lassi) with salt -Soups with CHAPTER 7 -EATING DISORDERS (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS,CLINICALSYMPTOMSAND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter , the students will be able to: 1. Define the term eating disorder, 2. Define and differentiate between different types of eating disorders, 3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of eating disorders, and 4. Discuss the management of eating disorders with special reference to nutritional management. Disordered eating behavior includes a wide range of eating related problems such as inadequate eating pattern, including binge eating, purging and restrictive diet to lose or control weight, unhealthy dieting practices, maladaptive behavior related to dissatisfaction with body shape or size. Adolescents, young adulthood is a period of increased awareness of one's body appearance and having a distorted body image or negative perception about one's body weight and shape during this phase of life can be a potent cause of several unhealthy body - related behaviors and disordered eating patterns. In this chapter we will focus on these issues. We will learn about eating disorders - the types, causes, consequences and what dietary measures to adopt to manage the disordered eating condition. WHAT ARE EATING DISORDERS? Eating disorders are illnesses in which the people expe rience severe disturbances in their eating pattern/behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. People with eating disorders typically become pre - occupied with food and their body weight. These disorders can affect a person's physical and mental health. Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal and life - threatening. Disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa. These conditions are defined herewith. Binge eating disorder Binge eatin g disorder is characterized by recurrent binge (excessive indulgence in eating) episode during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating. Three particular features are characteristic of binge eating. These include: i ) the amount of food eaten is larger than most persons would eat under similar circumstances, ii) the excessive eating occurs in a discreet period, usually less than 2 hours, and iii) the eating is accompanied by a subjective sense of loss of control. Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia nervosa is an disorder characterized by binge eating (eating large amount of food in a short time, along with the sense of loss of control) followed by a type of behavior that compensates for the binge, such as purging (includi ng self -induced vomiting), excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting and/or engaging in excessive exercise. People with bulimia can fall within normal range for their weight. But, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia refers to loss of appetite. Anorexia nervosa, therefore, is a disease characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health. Features characteristic of anorexia nervosa include: i) a relentless pursuit of thinness, ii) a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight, and iii) extremely disturbed eating behavi or. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, SIGN, SYMPTOMS OF EATING DISORDERS Having looked at the different types of eating disorders surely you may be able to distinguish between these specific conditions. To help you recall, you studied that: Unlike bulimia ner vosa, in binge eating disorder, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, fasting or excessive exercise. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese, Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal rang e for their weight. People with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished. Some common clinical characteristics and sign, symptoms associated with these disorders are highlighted in Table 7.1. Surely they will help you in diagnosis or further identification of an eating disorder. Table 7.1: Clinical features, signs and symptoms of eating disorders People with eating disorders may struggle with one or more of the following psychological problems: distress, anxiety, feeling of helplessness, low self esteem, inability to concentrate, unable to engage in conversation and withdrawn. The reality behind these conditions is that the brain is literally unable to function properly due to the lack of nutrition available to the body. Thus knowledge of these signs/symptoms is critical. Understanding the signs, symptoms will help in identifying target Anorexia Nervosa Bulimia Nervosa Binge Eating Disorder - Profound Weight loss leading to maintenance o f body weight 15 percent below normal, - Dieting, deny hunger, even when one is thin or emaciated, - An intense fear of weight gain or becoming fat despite the individual's underweight status; - Excessive or compulsive exercising, - Delayed puberty (if early onset ) and in females, amenorrhoea i.e. absence of atleast three consecutive menstrual cycles, - Strange eating habits such as avoiding meals, eating in secret, monitoring every bite of food - Sensitivity to cold - In severe cases, the bones protrude through the skin, as there is hardly any body fat. - The skin may be dry and scaly. - Body hair is increased (excessive growth of coarse hair in women), - Frequent fluctuations in weight. Individual is usually normal weight to overweight - Eating large amount of food in a short time, along with the sense of loss of control, - Purging (self -induces vomiting) after meals - Inability to voluntarily stop eating/feeling guilty or ashamed about eating, - Overeating in reaction to emotional stress. - Irregular periods in women - Swollen glands , tooth decay - Depressive moods - Persistent over concern with body shape and weight -Exercising or dieting excessively -Using laxatives, diuretics or other pills after eating when they are not needed - Dehydration, Electrolyte imbalance which can lead to kidne y and heart failure - Food seeking in the absence of hunger (such as after a full meal), - Excessive eating, amount of food eaten is large at one time, - A sense of lack of control over eating, - Absence of purging (self - induced vomiting), fasting or excessive exercise symptoms and behaviors that will be addressed in the treatment plan. We will learn about the management of eating disorders later in this chapter. Next let us look at the causative factors. WHAT CA USES EATING DISORDERS The exact cause of eating disorders is not known. But, it is thought to be multi -factorial in origin. The multidimensional causative factors may include: vulnerable personality; psychological conflicts - individual and family relatio nship; socio -cultural environmental factors - cult of thinness, hazardous dieting, social class and race and finally genetic and constitutional factors. The best -known environmental contributor to the development of eating disorders is the socio -cultural idealization of thinness. Young children start to express concern about their own weight or shape or about becoming too fat. Beauty and appearance anxiety are critical global issues and media and advertizing are key factor driving this concern. Pictures, t elevision, magazines influence children's/adolescents concept of the ideal body shape, influencing them to want to lose weight and promoting unrealistic standard of beauty. This concern endures through life. Bullying, weight stigma has been identified as yet another factor. Overweight girls and boys are teased about their weight by peers or family members. Individuals report coping with weight stigma by eating more food. Weight teasing or weight -based victimization among youth thus predicts weight gain, fr equent binge eating, are at increased risk for eating disorder symptoms, and are more likely to have a diagnosis of binge eating disorder. Weight stigma is also a significant risk factor for depression, low self esteem and body dissatisfaction among indivi duals. Occupation/profession may also play a role. Athletes are at -risk, especially those competing in sports that tend to emphasize diet, appearance, size and weight, such as weight -class sports (wrestling, rowing, horseracing etc.) and aesthetic sports (bodybuilding, gymnastics, swimming etc.). Though most athletes with eating disorders are females, but male athletes also are at -risk. Similarly dancers have a prevalence of anorexia 10 times that of general population MANAGEMENT OF EATING DISORDERS The management of eating disorders should be a multidisciplinary approach. A multidisciplinary team comprising of a physician, nutritionist and psycho -therapists is usually involved in their management. The treatment of eating disorders can be said to have three components. A) Medical and Biochemical Management B) Nutritional Management, and C) Psychological Management Our focus in this unit will be only on nutritional management as psychological and medical management are not within our preview. Nutritiona l Management of Eating Disorders Here in this section we will consider the components of the management of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa together, since the nutritional consequences and nutritional management for both these conditions are on simil ar lines. Malnutrition due to low or poor consumption of energy -giving macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins and/or micronutrients relative to individual needs is a concern with both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In both the cases, consideration needs to be given to symptoms of the starvation syndrome. Starvation syndrome here refers to starvation caused either by food restriction/dieting as in anorexia nervosa or problems related to food absorption as in purging or excessive exercis e may mean that insufficient energy is consumed for weight maintenance in bulimia nervosa. An illustrative 3000Kcal diet plan/menu is presented in Table 7. 2 for reference. Table 7. 2: Menu for a 3000 kcal diet for an eating disorder (anorexic) patien t Early Breakfast Mid- Lunch Mid Evening Dinner Morning Morning Afternoon Tea (Snack) (Snack) (Snack) Milk shake (1 Paushtik Veg.

Based on the likes, dislikes of the patient the meals may be altered provided they are balanced. Some do's and don'ts related to management of eating disorders are highlighted herewith. Remember eating disorders are long term illnesses and people recover slowly. Be patient and encourage the patient not to give up. Do's Don'ts - Educate yourself about t he eating disorder. - People with eating disorder are extremely This will equip you to help those around self-conscious about their eating habits. Do you suffering from the problem not nag them about eating or not eating. - Family support is extr emely important, This will reinforce the behavior. especially in helping the recovering patient - Do not blame or shame the person. with everyday tasks. Educate the family, - Do not hide food to keep the person from friends regarding th e disorder and binge eating. This will create resentment Encourage them to attend family - Do not force the person to eat.

Define the term overweight and obesity 2. Explain th e causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of obesity, 3. Discuss the general strategies for obesity prevention, and 4. Describe the dietary management of obesity. World Health Organization (WHO) defines Overweight and Obesity as a con dition of abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. So any individual with more than 120% of ideal body weight may be considered as overweight. The ideal body weight (IBW) can be calculated by the formula: IBW = (height in cm -100) \u00d7 0.9 A simple measure, however, commonly used to classify overweight and obesity across all ages is BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is defined as person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m2). [BMI = Weight (kg )/Height (m) 2] Overweight, Obesity among Adults BMI is considered to be the most useful population -level measure of obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and all ages of adults. The BMI based classification for adults (both International and for Asi an population) is given in Table 8.1. As you may have noticed that WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows: overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30. But, for Indian population, BMI between 18.5 and 23 is considered normal, since they tend to have higher percentage body fat even at lower BMI as compared to the European population. BMI greater than or equal to 23 is considered overweight/obese for Indian adult as indicated in Table .1. Table 8.1: BMI categories for adults (WHO) Body Mass Index (BMI) population > >25 kg/ m2 Obese Note, the BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is specific to adult population only. You can use this classification to categorize adults into different grades of malnutrition. First calculate the BMI (based on weight and height) and then check in which class the individual's BMI falls. To illustrate, an Indian female (30 years of age) who weighs 70kg and height is 1.6 meters, BMI calculated is: 70/1.6 \u00d71.6 = 27.34kg/m2. As per BMI classification (Asian population in T able 8.1), the individual is obese. BMI cut -off levels for categorizing overweight and obesity among children and adolescent are different. The BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is not applicable to children and adolescent. WHO has given the ideal ranges of weight for a given height for children 5 -19 years of age. These Tables are useful for categorizing children as normal, under -nourished and overweight or obese. Obesity is defined based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general accumulati on, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered more harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference is classified as central obesity. Waist circumference of 90cm for men and 80 cm for women classified as central obesity is associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases. Figure 8.1 Fat around abdomen Table 8.2: Indirect measures of body fatness (other than BMI) Measurements Descriptions Skinfold thickness Skin fold thickness is being used for estimating the body fat content. This (SFT) requires special instruments called 'calipers'. Skin folds at different parts of the body (triceps, biceps, sub -scapular, supra -iliac, front thigh and ca lf) have been used for estimating body fat. Specific equations are used to convert the skin fold thickness into the body fat content. Advantage: Relatively simpler, non invasive and apart from the total body fat content, it can also indicate about the body fat distribution. Waist circumference WC is highly sensitive and specific measure of central obesity. Cut off values (WC) for adults available as highlighted earlier. Advantage : Simple technique Disadvantage : For children no Indian data a vailable and not widely used. Waist hip ratio WHR= Waist circumference / Hip circumference. (WHR) WHR cut offs available for adult males and females but not for children. WHR of more than 0.9 among men and 0.85 in women are associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases. WHY SHOULD WE AVOID OBESITY? Maintaining an ideal body weight is crucial for good health. There is no clear definition of ideal body weight, but body weight for a given height of a person with good health and l ong lifespan is considered as ideal body weight. Excessive body weight increases the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, certain types of cancers, osteoarthritis etc. Excess body fat broadly affects every organ in the bo dy with multi -organ consequences. Major health consequences have been illustrated in Figure 8. 2. Figure 8.2: Major health consequences of overweight and obesity Obese children are not only at risk to become obese adults, and c onsequently suffer from ill health and premature death, but serious complications can also emerge during their childhood. Children with obesity have more risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol than their normal weight peers. Children with obesity are also at higher risk for having other chronic health conditions and diseases, such as asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly being reported among children who are overweight. Onset of d iabetes in children can lead to heart disease and kidney failure. Overweight and obese adolescents may also suffer from: - depression, low self -esteem, and behavioral problems, - stigmatization (teasing, harassment, and rejection) and bullying behavior by th eir peers, - psychological distress manifested by poor self -image, aggressive and negative behavior, depression, suicide, and - drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco addiction. In view of the rising obesity prevalence, many of the young children and adolescents have developed 'fear of fatness' and are adopting various dietary and behavioral practices to lose weight and remain thin, even if they have normal BMI. It is more seen in urban areas at this moment. These individuals are at higher risk of developing eati ng disorders. Apart from health consequences which we discussed above, body fatness has other implications also. These are economic and academic burden. It has been estimated that obesity accounts for 2% to 7% of total healthcare costs in developed countr ies. There are also other costs to consider such as reduced quality of life and productivity loss attributed to decreased work efficiency and medical issues. With regards to academic consequences, among obese adolescents, higher school absenteeism, dropout and lower academic achievement have been seen. But, drawing definite conclusion on this issue is difficult. Considering the ill effects of obesity it is important that we look at the causes of obesity. The next section focuses on etiology of obesity. WHAT CAUSES OBESITY? Figure 8.3: The causes and risk factors of obesity Overweight and obesity, are broadly the result of an imbalance between energy intake (food) and energy expenditure (physical activity and some other metab olic activity). The imbalance might be due to excess energy intake (overeating) or reduced energy expenditure (sedentary lifestyle). The excess of energy consumed is stored in the body in the form of adipose tissue. When food availability is less, it could be seen as a survival mechanism, but when food is abundant and the physical activity level decreases, this results in fat deposition. Table 8.3 lists the key factors that might promote weight gain and obesity. Table 8.3: Summary of factors that promote weight gain and obesity - High intake of energy -dense, micronutrient poor foods - Heavy marketing of energy -dense foods and fast food outlets - High intake of sugar -sweetened soft drinks and fruit juices - Sedentary lifestyle - Adverse socio -economic conditions - Large portion sizes - High proportion of food prepared and eaten outside the home - Rigid restraint/periodic disinhibition eating patterns - Alcohol Source : Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation. WHO Technical Report Series 916: Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases. World Health Organization; Geneva, Switzerland: 2003 As highlighted in Table 8.3, increased risk factors include a higher energy density diet with increased intake of fat and added sugars, salt in foods. Eating junk or unhealthy foods coupled with low physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) promotes weight gain. Saturated fat intake (mostly from animal sources), marked increases in animal food consumption, reduced intakes of complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber, and reduced fruit an d vegetable intake are other contributing factors. Over -feeding during infancy, childhood and adolescence predisposes to overweight/obesity in adulthood. Further, lack of access to healthy foods as determined by adverse socioeconomic conditions influences the diet and health of a population. Energy -dense and nutrient -poor foods provide daily calories at an affordable cost to the poor groups hence consumed in large portions. On the other hand, the commercial driven food market environment is other probable causes of obesity. The traditional micronutrient -rich foods consumed by children/families are replaced by heavily marketed, sugars -sweetened beverages (i.e. soft drinks) and energy dense fatty, salty and sugar foods (HFSS snacks), contributing to obesity. The dietary changes highlighted above are compounded by lifestyle changes that reflect reduced physical activity at work/school and during leisure time. Evidence suggests that insufficient physical activity is one of the important risk factors of obesity, and work -related activity has declined over recent decades, whereas, leisure time dominated by television viewing and other physically inactive pastimes has increased, particularly among children. Considering the multifaceted causes of obesity it is impo rtant that appropriate strategies based on improved dietary practices and physical activity for prevention of obesity are considered. The next section focuses on prevention strategies followed by dietary management of obesity. GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR OBESITY PREVENTION The prevention of obesity in infants, young children, adolescents and adults should be considered of high priority. There can be no single or simple solution to the increasing prevalence of obesity. It's a complex problem and there has to be a multifaceted approach. Policy makers, state and local governments/organizations, business and community leaders, school, childcare and healthcare professionals, parents and individuals must work together to create an environment that supports a healthy lifestyle. For infants and young children, the main preventive strategies should focus on: the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding; avoiding the use of added sugars and starches when feeding formula; instructing mothers to accept their child 's ability to regulate energy intake rather than feeding until the plate is empty; assuring the appropriate micronutrient intake for the child needed to promote optimal growth and development. For school children and adolescents, prevention of obesity i mplies the need to: promote an active lifestyle; limit television viewing; promote the intake of fruits and vegetables (at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily) restrict the intake of unhealthy, energy -dense, micronutrient -poor foods (e.g. pac kaged snacks ( rich in fat, sugar and salt), refined grains and sweets, potatoes etc); restrict the intake of sugars -sweetened soft drinks, sport drinks and fruit juice drinks. improving sleep, reducing stress The home environment too is another import ant setting in preventing overweight and obesity. Parents can play a crucial role. Potential areas to target in terms of television viewing, home food and physical activity environment include: Purchasing healthy foods, Practicing regular meal times, Enco uraging the children to eat only when hungry and to eat slowly. Allocating individual portions of food for children, Keep the refrigerator stocked with fat -free or low -fat milk and fresh fruit and vegetables instead of soft drinks and snacks high in sugar and fat. Creating opportunities for physical activities, Parents as role model. Parents who eat healthy foods and are physically active set an example that increases the likelihood their children will do the same, Messages to parents to not having tele vision in children's room and encouraging family rules restricting television viewing. Children should be encouraged to participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, preferably daily in the form of sports and physical a ctivity. Some examples of moderate intensity physical activity may include: brisk walking, skipping (rope jumping), playing soccer, swimming, dancing etc. In addition to encouraging physical activity, children should avoid too much sedentary time. Parents should limit the time children watch television, play video games, or surf the web to no more than 2 hours per day. Additionally, television viewing for children age 2 or younger may be best avoided. Instead, encourage children to find fun activities to d o with family members or on their own that simply involve with more activity. Preventive measures for adults: The preventive measures highlighted above may apply to preventing obesity among adults too. Some healthy eating practices and points to consid er that may protect against weight gain may include: eating five to six servings of vegetables and fruits daily, choosing whole grain foods and avoiding highly processed foods made with refined flour, sugar and saturated fat in the diet, avoiding foods which are high in 'energy density' or that have lots of calories in a small amount of food, decreasing sugar -sweetened beverages Preventive strategies for adults may also include promotion of small changes in physical activity. A total of 60min of phys ical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians. This should include at least 30min of moderate -intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking, jogging, hiking, bicycling, gardening etc), 15min of work -related activity e.g. carrying hea vy loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15min of muscle -strengthening exercises (at least 3 -4 times a week). Note inactive people should start slow and gradually increase physical activity. The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by: reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods; ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers; restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace. So prevention is always better than cure. Maintaining a desirable body weight by consuming just enough calories or adjust physical activity to maintain energy balance (i.e. intake = output) is critical to prevent and treat obesity. The next focus in this unit is how to maintain energy balance and reduce weight. DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY A combin ation of interventions/strategies may be adopted to manage obesity. These include: a. dietary modification, b. increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary lifestyle, and c. behavior modification Successful treatment, management of overweight, obesi ty requires adoption and maintenance of lifestyle behaviors contributing to both dietary intake and physical activity. Role of physical activity in reducing prevalence of obesity has already been highlighted in the section on prevention Here we shall focus on dietary management of obesity. The objective of diet planning for overweight/obese individual must focus on: promoting gradual weight reduction preventing muscle loss and other nutritional deficiencies helping to maintaining a desirable body weight, and bring positive behavioral changes (diet/ life style management) To meet these objectives the nutrient needs and dietary modifications for overweight, obesity are highlighted in Table 8.4. Table 8.4: Dietary considerations and nutritional needs for ov erweight and obesity Dietary requirements Recommendation Dietary Considerations Energy (Kcal) Weight reduction: Deficit of 500 Kcal/day will help For adults Moderate deficit diet produce a weight loss of 500g - 1200 - 1500 Kcal/day for per week women, and - 1500 -1800 Kcal/day for Deficit of 750 - 1000 Kcal/day men will help produce a weight loss Low-Calorie diet of 1 kg per week - 1000 -1200 Kcal/day for women, and - Restrict the intake of high fat, - 1200 - 1500 Kcal/day for sugar, salt (HFSS) foods. men - Avoid foods which are high in For older children and 'energy density' or that have lots adolescent Adult guidelines may be of calories in a small amount of adopted food.

Define the term hypertension, 2. Enumerate the risk factors in causation of hypertension, 3. Discuss the complications and consequences of hypertension, and 4. Describe the dietary management and prevention of hypertension with special emphasis on lifestyle modification. Hypertension is fast becoming a common health problem in India, likely because people are adopting increasingly sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits. It is important to note that men/women, young/old adults all are at risk of this problem and it is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, heart failure, renal disease and other complications. What is alarming is the fact that hypertension is known as a silent killer. It often occurs without any symptom or warning signs until more serious problem arises. Modifying lifestyle factors is important for managing hypertension. Hypertension is a health condition characterized by high blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) is the force of circulating blood against the inner walls of blood vessels. When blood travels through the blood ves sels with more force than is considered healthy it is called hypertension. An instrument/devise called sphygmomanometer is used to measure BP. An optimum blood pressure level is a reading under 120/80mm Hg. The numerator 120 represents the pressure when t he heart contracts and is referred to as \"Systolic pressure\". The systolic measurement is the peak pressure in the arteries. The denominator 80 represents the pressure when the heart relaxes (is at rest) between beats, called the \"Diastolic pressure\". Dias tolic pressure is the minimum pressure in the arteries. Recent guidelines have given the classification of blood pressure and the stages of hypertension (in adults) based on blood pressure values as highlighted in Table 9.1 Table 9.1: Classification of bl ood pressure and the stages of hypertension Blood Pressure Category Systolic blood pressure Diastolic blood pressure (SBP) (DBP) Normal <120 mm Hg <80 mm Hg Elevated 120-129 mm Hg <80 mm Hg Hypertension Stage 1 130-139 mm Hg 80-89 mm Hg Stage 2 140 mm Hg 90 mm Hg Hypertensive Crisis 180 mm Hg 120 mm Hg SYMPTOMS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS I. Consequences of hypertension: (a) Damage to arteries and blood vessels: Hypertension gradually increases the pressure flowing through the arteries leading to damaged or narrowed arteries. Once the arteries are damaged, the fat from the diet enters the blood stream and tends to get collect in the inner walls of arteries, over a period of time it leads to the narrowing of the lumen of the arte ries, as a Figure 9.1 Blood Vessel result artery walls becoming less elastic, limiting blood flow through the body. The diseases of the arteries resulting from the blockage of arteries are generally called coronary artery disease (CAD). (b) Damage to heart: The major function of the heart is to pump blood to the entire body. Uncontrolled blood pressure can damage the heart in several ways. It affects the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscles. When blood cannot flow freely to the he art, the individual can experience chest pain (angina), a heart attack or irregular heartbeat or irregular rhythm (arrhythmias). Over time, the strain on the heart caused by high BP can cause the heart muscle to weaken and work less efficiently. High blood pressure then forces the heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to rest of the body. This causes the ventricle to thicken and stiffen, limiting the ventricle ability to pump blood thus increasing the risk of heart attack, heart failure or sudden death. Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath or troubled breathing, swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or abdomen, fatigue. (c) Damage to Brain: Like the heart, the brain too requires constant supply of blood. Blood carries nourishing food to the brain so that it can work properly. Sometimes there can be a temporary disruption of blood supply to the brain caused by artery blockage or a blood clot both of which can arise from high blood pressure. Interruption of blood flow to the brain c an lead to mild cognitive impairment or to dementia , a brain disease resulting in problems with thinking, speaking, reasoning, memory, vision and movement. Uncontrolled high BP can damage and weaken brain's blood vessels causing them to narrow, rupture or leak leading to forming blood clots in the arteries (leading to the brain) blocking blood flow causing s troke . Stroke is a condition when part of the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, causing brain cells to die. (d) Damage to Kidneys: Major function of the kidneys is to filter extra fluids and waste from the blood - a process that depends on healthy blood vessels. Like the blood vessels in the brain and the heart, high BP can damage large arteries leading to kidney and the tiny blood vessels within t he kidney. As a result kidneys are unable to filter extra fluid, waste; thus dangerous levels of these accumulate leading to kidney failure. (e) Damage to Eyes: Like other blood vessels these too can be damaged due to high BP. Blood vessels supplying blood to the retina (membrane that lines the inner surface of the back of the eyeball) when damaged can lead to bleeding in the eyes, blurred vision and complete loss of vision. (f) Sleep Disorder: Some people experience loud snoring and breathing interruption s during a night's sleep. This condition is called sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea often don't feel rested when they wake up in the morning. Research has linked this condition to high blood pressure. II. Causes of Hypertension The factors that play a role in causing or increasing the risk of getting a disease are called risk factors. Table 9.2 highlights the risk factors for hypertension. Smoking, diabetes, elevated lipid levels (high cholesterol, triglyceride), excessive weight, low fitness, unhealt hy diet, psychosocial stress, sleep disturbances are some of the risk factors. In Table 9.2 you will notice that these factors are categorized as modifiable and non- modifiable . Table 9.2: Risk Factors Common in Patients with Hypertension Modifiable Risk Factors Relatively Fixed/Non -modifiable Risk Factors - Cigarette smoking, secondhand smoking - CAD - Diabetes mellitus - Family history - Dyslipidemia/hypercholesterolemia - Increased age - Overweight/obesity - Low socioeconomic/educational statu s - Physical inactivity/low fitness - Obstructive sleep apnea - Unhealthy diet - Psychosocial stress Dietary factors are an important determinant of development and progression of hypertension. It is one of the important modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Unhealthy diets consisting of high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) foods are the main culprit. Most commonly consumed HFSS foods include chips, fried foods, sugar sweetened carbonated and non - carbonated beverages, pizzas, burgers, ready -to-eat n oodles, potato fries, and confectionery items. There is a strong association between salt intake and blood pressure. Excessive salt intake has been associated with increased prevalence of hypertension and a rise in systolic pressure with age. Excessive sod ium intake can cause body to retain fluid and also cause arteries/blood vessels to constrict, which increases blood pressure. Also a diet high in calories, saturated fats like ghee, butter and food rich in animal fats (such as whole milk, red meat, organ m eats), trans fats (deep fried snacks/foods, bakery products etc.) and processed, packaged foods such as chips, cookies etc. Carries an additional risk of hypertension. Packaged and processed foods often have sodium added during manufacturing either as salt or as baking soda. Hypertension is often present in individuals who are overweight and obese In fact, hypertension is strongly associated with high body mass index (BMI). More the weight, more the blood flow required to supply oxygen and nutrients to th e tissues. As the volume of the blood increases so does the pressure inside the arteries. Hence people who are obese are likely to have higher blood pressure. Physical inactivity or low fitness also increases the risk of obesity along with hypertensi on. Regular exercise increases blood flow through arteries and release substances that relax blood vessels, which in turn lower blood pressure. Remember, sedentary lifestyle devoid of exercise increases the risk of blood pressure. Along with sedentary life style, smoking, tobacco intake is other modifiable risk factors. What must be emphasized here is that these factors also make elevated blood pressure difficult to control despite progressively increasing doses of medication. Hence lifestyle/dietary managem ent is important for such patients in order to avoid drug dependency. MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION & DIETETICS Dietary/nutritional management is the cornerstone of hypertension management. We will focus on this aspect in more details here. I. Nutritional M anagement of Hypertension The main objective of dietary management of hypertension is to: Achieve gradual weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and maintain weight slightly below the normal level, Reduce sodium intake and maintain fluid and el ectrolyte balance, Maintain adequate nutrition, and Slow down the onset of complications Table 9.3 (a): High and low sodium content foods High sodium content foods Low sodium content food - Pizza, instant soups, burgers, buns, rolls, - Unproc essed whole foods like cereal grains sandwiches, biscuits, cookies such as whole wheat, wheat flour, oats, - Processed foods like ham, sausages, cold cuts vermicelli, jowar, bajra, brown rice, rice flakes; of meat, all pulses, dried b eans and peas - Processed cheese - Fresh fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pears, - Savoury snacks (namkeen, samosa, pakora, berries etc. chips, French fries, salted popcorn etc.), - Fresh green leafy vegetables and other - Sauces, tomato ketchup, gravies, curry vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek leaves, powders, papad, pickles, chutneys, salad mustard leaves, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, dressings, sandwich spreads, pepper, capsicum etc. - Ready -to-eat cereals, cakes, pies, patties. - Roots and tubers such as colocasia (arbi), - Whole full fat milk, potato, sweet potato, radish etc. - Canned vegetables and canned meat/fish, - Unsalted Nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashew etc.) frozen packa ged meals/foods. and oilseeds - Organ meat (liver, kidney, brain), crabs, - Fresh fish, chicken, lean meat prawns. - Fat free or low -fat milk, yogurt, soymilk. - Proprietary drinks such as Bournvita, - Vegetable oils (soybean, corn, canola, Horlicks, chocolate drinks sunflower, olive oil. - Seasonings such as herbs, spices, garlic, ginger, onion, lemon and lime juice.

Define the term diabetes and present the classification of Diabetes, 2. Explain the causes, clinica l symptoms, complications of Diabetes, and 3. Describe the management of Diabetes, with a focus on diet therapy and dietary management. In your day to day life you may have heard family, friends, and acquaintances complaining of suffering from \"Sugar Proble m\" or \" Madhumeh \". Newspaper articles, TV commercials promising simple, home remedies for cure of sugar problem are on the rise. Today, the so -called sugar problem or \" Diabetes \" has become a major public health problem in our country In this chapter we will consider the risk factors, symptoms and complications of Diabetes with major focus on management of diabetes. Diet, exercise, drugs, communication and nutrition education/awareness as major components of dietary management will be highlighted. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a condition, when the blood glucose or so called \"blood sugar\" is too high. Diabetes is a disease that affects body's ability to produce or respond to insulin. Insulin, is a hormone that is released in response to food we eat. In a normal healthy person, the pancreas release insulin to help the body store and use the sugar from the food they eat. Foods, particularly carbohydrate -rich foods in our diet namely, rice, wheat, potatoes etc. are digested and broken down into a sugar called glucos e. Glucose is vital for our health because it is an important source of energy for our body. Insulin helps to utilize this glucose to produce energy by the body for our daily activities. Insulin also stimulates the cells to take up glucose, thus prevents a rise in blood glucose and maintains its level within certain normal limits. SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS In diabetic individuals, the pancreas (the organ that produces insulin) cannot produce enough insulin or whatever is produced is not efficien tly used by the body and sugar builds up in the blood (hyperglycemia ). This condition when insulin is not efficiently used by the body is called insulin resistance. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism resulting from defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. In Diabetes, there is excessive glucose in blood and urine due to inadequate production of insulin or insulin resistance. Generally, in normal persons, without d iabetes fasting glucose levels are maintained at less than 110mg/dl. After a meal (post prandial), the plasma glucose level increases but Figure 10.1 Pancreas insulin stimulates the cells to take up glucose and thus the plasma glucose levels return to bas al level within 2 hours. The criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes is given in Table 10.1. Table 10.1: Criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes Plasma Glucose Level (mg/dl) Fasting Post prandial (PP) 2 >200 Source: ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes, 2005 You would notice that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) more than or equal to 126mg/dl and plasma glucose level 2 -hour post meal (or post 75g glucose) more than or equal to 200mg/dl is diagnosed as diabetes Generally, glucose is excreted in urine when blood glucose levels are high, beyond 180mg/dl. This condition is described as renal glycosuria . It may be noted that diabetics lose varying amount of glucose in urine dependi ng on severity of diseases and dietary intake of carbohydrates in their diet. Another concept, important to diabetes status, which needs special mention here, is Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HBA1c). When the concentration of glucose in blood rises, more of it gets attached to hemoglobin (which is a pigment present in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells of the body) forming glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c). In a normal individual without diabetes, the HBA1c concentration varies from 5 -6%, while in d iabetics, it increases to over 6% of the total hemoglobin depending on the blood glucose level. So what is the significance of HBA1c? HBA1c shows the general trend of glucose levels in the blood during the previous 2 -3 months. HBA1c helps determine how wel l a person's diabetes is being controlled over time. I. Types of Diabetes There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce insulin. This fo rm was previously referred to as 'insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus' (IDDM) or 'juvenile diabetes', Type 1 diabetes may affect people at any age, but usually develops in children and adolescents, hence was referred to as juvenile diabetes earlier. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune refers to the fact that the body's immune system (which normally helps in fighting infections) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. As a result there is little or no production of insulin and hence, such individuals require daily dose of insulin injections to control the level of glucose in the blood. When insulin is not provided it can lead to life threatening consequences. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 diabetes is the common form of diabetes, with 90 -95% of people with diabetes having this condition. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance . This means no matter how much or how little insulin is made, the body cannot use it as well as it should, and sugar builds up in the blood. As the disease progresses eventually no insulin is produced. This form was previously referred to as 'non -insulin dependent diabetes' or 'adult onset diabetes', because it was diagnosed mainly in adults, who did not require insulin to mana ge their condition. It is associated with excessive body weight and/or fat (obesity) or sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through exercise and diet but overtime people with this type of diabetes may r equire oral anti -diabetic drugs or/and insulin depending on the condition. Besides the two types of diabetes highlighted above, you may come across cases where diabetes developed during pregnancy. This is referred to as gestational diabetes. Gestation al Diabetes When a pregnant woman develops diabetes, it is known as gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually disappears after pregnancy but is associated with complications to both mother and baby. The offspring are prone to develop childhood ob esity and type 2 diabetes later in life as an adult. Women with a history of gestational diabetes may also go on to develop type 2 diabetes immediately after delivery or few years after delivery. Considering the different types of Diabetes it is important that we look at the risk factors associated with diabetes. The next section focuses on the risk factors. Risk factors of Diabetes The causes of diabetes are multi -factorial and depending on the type of diabetes the risk factors contributing to the onset of the disease may vary. Actual cause is not clear, but factors that have been shown to increase the risk of diabetes are highlighted below. Figure 10.2 Risk factors of diabetes In case of type 1 diabetes, it is an auto -immune disease . What is known is that the immune system (which fights infections, harmful bacteria, viruses in our body) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. For example viral infections such as measles, mumps can trigger abnormal auto immun e response that destroy the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Thus little or no insulin is produced. Instead of being transported to the cells, sugar then builds up in the blood. Genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the onset of this condition. Type 2 diabetes, which you have learnt is the most common form of diabetes, is caused by many factors but the two important risk factors include lifestyle factors and genes . Among lifestyle factors, lack of physical activity, overweig ht, obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes in the later stage of a person's life. You would notice that about 90% of type 2 diabetic individuals are overweight or obese. Central obesity (accumulation of fat around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference) is known to increase insulin resistance. How does obesity increase the risk of diabetes? Well obesity reduces the sensitivity of tissues to insulin action in the utilization of glucose. Next, unhealthy eating habits and practices (such as eating too much of fat, simple sugars, and refined foods and not consuming enough fiber in the diet) have been shown to influence the development of diabetes. Further, type 2 diabetes seems to run in families, indicating genetic predisposition or hered itary as risk factor. Among other factors, ageing i.e. increased age enhances the risk of type 2 diabetes. Stress which is so common in modern life is now increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for disease onset and progression. Having gone throug h the risk factors, you may have realized that many of these factors can be controlled by the choices we make. For instance, physically inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diets, stress can be controlled and are therefore called modifiable risk factors. Others such as hereditary, age, history of gestational diabetes we cannot change or modify, hence are fixed. Remember the risk for diabetes increases if an individual is: Overweight and obese, particularly central obesity i.e. accumulation of fat around the a bdomen indicated by higher waist circumference, On an unhealthy diet, consuming too much fat, simple sugars, refined foods and low intake of dietary fiber (inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption), Age 40 or older. Risk increases as you grow old Has a parent or sibling with diabetes Physically inactive i.e. living a sedentary life, Has high blood pressure, high cholesterol or high triglyceride Have had gestational diabetes So more the risk factors you have the greater the chances of developing diabet es and other health issues. Complications of Diabetes The symptoms of diabetes are very typical, but sometimes they are so mild that we don't notice them. But in case of Type 1 diabetes, the symptoms usually happen quickly and are much more severe as co mpared to type 2 diabetes. However, you would notice that both types of diabetes have some warning symptoms which include: Frequent and increased/excessive urinary output ( Polyuria) Feeling of thirst ( Polydipsia) and dry mouth Hunger, increased appetite (Polyphagia ) even though the individual is eating Extreme fatigue, lack of energy, easy tiredness and irritability Unexplained Weight loss Blurry vision Frequent infections such as skin, vaginal infections Cuts, bruises, sores which are slow to heal , and Tingling sensation, pain or numbness in the hands and feet The symptoms may seem mild, but it is important to note that diabetes can increase the risk of many serious health problems, if not controlled. Diabetes can cause a host of complications - acute as well as long term - affecting nearly every organ in our body including heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, gums, teeth etc. But the good news is that controlling diabetes can help avoid these complications or prevent them from becoming worse. The acute complications of diabetes include: Diabetic ketoacidosis: Ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones . How are ketones formed? When there is not enough insulin, the body cannot utilize carbohydrates to provide energy. So, to meet the energy needs, the body begins to break down fat as a fuel. This results in increased formation of ketones. When the ketones produced are more than what the body can handle, they accumulate in the blood resulting in ketoacidosis. Note, ketoacidosis can be fatal, and the patient may go into coma. This condition usually results from irregular or inadequate management of diabetes, particularly during stress and acute infections. Among long-term complications , heart diseases and blood vessel diseases are common problem. Due to injury to large blood vessels, diabetics have increased predisposition to atherosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels due to deposition of fatty substances). Diabetics may have high levels of blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, which make them susceptible to heart diseases and stroke. Diabetes can also lead to eye problems such as glaucoma, which may cause blindness if not treated . So the bottom line for diabetics is to get tight control of the blood glucose levels and thus prevent the complications from getting worse. Besides the acute and the long -term complications highlighted above, one short -term complications of diabetes whic h requires mention here is hypoglycemia. Unlike increased glucose levels in the blood, the rapid and severe lowering of blood glucose below certain critical normal limit (below 40 - 50 mg/dl) in the body is known as hypoglycemia . The person with hypogl ycemia experiences weakness, sweating, restlessness, palpitation and giddiness. What may be the cause of hypoglycemia? It is possible for the blood glucose levels to drop when there is inadequate amount of carbohydrates in the diet, particularly under cond itions when an individual is on insulin or taking insulin on an empty stomach or while fasting. Hypoglycemia can also occur following a strenuous exercise. Cases of hypoglycemia can be treated by immediately providing orange juice or glucose, sugar or sw eet, which can rapidly raise the blood glucose level. It is always advisable for a diabetic to carry any one of these substances as a protective measure. Remember maintenance of blood glucose within normal limits helps to prevent and limit progression of diabetic complications. A patient who maintains the blood glucose levels within the normal range suffer from much less short and long term complications as compared to those who frequently experience fluctuations (some time high, sometime low) in the bloo d glucose levels. MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES & DIETETICS It is important to understand that diabetes cannot be completely cured or treated, but it can be managed carefully in order to prevent/delay the development of complications. Management of diabete s is quite individualized and focuses not only on the diabetic state but also on the overall health and well -being of the diabetic patient. There are four main aspects in the management of diabetes. These include: Dietary Management Lifestyle Management - Exercise Adherence to Drugs/Medication, Insulin schedule, and Education, communication and awareness We begin our study of dietary management of diabetes by first looking at the main objectives in the management of diabetes. Dietary Management of Diab etes Diet plays a crucial role in the management of diabetes. The main objectives of dietary management of diabetes are to: attain and maintain ideal/desirable body weight achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels and reduce the sugar in the urine provide adequate nutrition to maintain optimal nutritional status treat the symptoms, and prevent/avoid the acute complications achieve optimum blood lipid levels In general, the nutritional needs of a diabetic are not much different than the needs of a non - diabetic individual. For instance, in case of a normal healthy individual, the normal diet should provide 60 -65% calories from carbohydrates, 20 -25% calories from fats and rest (15 - 20%) from proteins. A diabetic diet too can follow this distributio n but is governed by the present body weight of the patient and the need to maintain the desirable or ideal body weight. Before you review these considerations, it is important for you to understand that carbohydrates and dietary fiber play a major role in the control of blood glucose. Glycemic index is a guide used to classify carbohydrate containing foods according to their potential to raise the blood sugar level. It is therefore useful in planning diets for diabetics. Read the concept of glycemic index presented in the next section first. Glycemic Index Glycemic index (GI) describes the rise of blood glucose occurring after a meal. In a given meal there can be different foods. It is, therefore, important to know about the extent of rise in blood glucos e with a given quantity of a particular food. Different carbohydrates raise blood glucose to variable extent. GI, therefore, gives a ranking of how quickly each carbohydrate -base food or drink makes the blood glucose rise after consuming them, in comparis on to the response to an equivalent amount of glucose. A rating of each food between Zero to 100 is provided. Glucose raises the blood sugar levels very quickly and has a GI of 100. In comparison multi -grain Roti has low GI of 27 and is beneficial for diab etics. GI, therefore, is a useful guide in planning diets for diabetics. Generally, there is no standard way to categories food based on GI, but for convenience three categories of food based on their GI value can be considered: the high -GI index foods (va lue>70), intermediate -GI foods (>55 to <70) and low-GI foods (<55). For your reference glycemic index of some common foods used in Indian diets are presented in Table 10. 2 Table 10.2: Glycemic index of some common foods Item Glycemic Index Item Glyc emic Index Cereal and Millet Products Fruits White wheat bread 75 \u00b1 2 Apple (raw) 36 \u00b1 2 Whole wheat bread 74 \u00b1 2 Orange 43 \u00b1 3 Wheat roti 62 \u00b1 3 Banana 51 \u00b1 3 Chapati 52 \u00b1 4 Pineapple 59 \u00b1 8 White boiled rice 73 \u00b1 4 Mango (raw) 51 \u00b1 5 Brown boiled rice 68 \u00b1 4 Watermelon (raw) 76 \u00b1 4 Barley 28 \u00b1 2 Potato (boiled) 79 \u00b1 4 Instant oat porridge 79 \u00b1 3 French fries (potato) 63 \u00b1 5 Rice porridge/congee 78 \u00b1 9 Carrots Boiled) 39 \u00b1 4 Millet porridge 67 \u00b1 5 Dairy Products Sweat corn 52 \u00b1 5 Milk (full fat) 39 \u00b1 3 Cornflakes 81 \u00b1 6 Milk (skim) 37 \u00b1 4 Ice cream 51 \u00b1 3 Miscellaneous Pulses Chocolate 40 \u00b1 3 Chickpeas 28 \u00b1 9 Popcorn 65 \u00b1 5 Soya Beans 16 \u00b1 1 Soft drinks/soda 59 \u00b1 3 Lentils 32 \u00b1 5 Honey 61 \u00b1 3 Glucose 103\u00b13 Table 10.3: Foods that can be used liberally, moderately and best avoided in the diet of diabetic individuals Foods that can be used Foods to be used in moderate Foods to be avoided liberally amounts - Green leafy - Whole grain cereals , millets - Refined cereals and their vegetables like and their products e.g. whole products (e.g. Maida, suji, spinach, drumstick, wheat flour, whole wheat white bread, white rice, fenugreek, mustard, bread, oats, bajra, jowar roti pasta etc .) amaranth, cabbage etc. - Plain gelatin -based etc. - Whole pulses, lentils with desserts, sugars, sweets, - Vegetables like husk, chick peas, pigean pea, honey, candy, jam and cauliflower, brinjal, beans, peas etc. jellies. lady finger Bhindi), - Raw fruits with hard skin or - Sweet concentrated foods bottle gourd (ghia), seeds such as apple, pear, using excessive whole Bitter gourd (karela) guava, apricots, berries, milk and dairy fat etc., pomegranate, etc. including hal was, ladoos - High -fiber foods (raw - Fruits like banana, mangoes, etc. fruits with hard skin dates, grapes, custard apple, - Cakes and pastries. or seeds, green leafy chikoo (sapota), oranges - Sweetened juices and soft vegetables, other shou ld be taken with caution . drinks vegetables etc.) - Nuts and Oilseeds - Processed foods with high - Condiments and - Milk and dairy products (low fructose corn syrup.

Diabetes Education: Cornerstone of Diabetes Management Unlike other disease conditions (such as high blood pre ssure or high cholesterol levels) where medication alone can often time successfully treat it; here there are lots of other components to diabetes. Diabetics require day-to-day knowledge of nutrition, exercise, medication, glucose monitoring, psychosocial adjustment etc. Diabetes education therefore becomes important. Diabetes education means empowering people with diabetes with knowledge and provide tools crucial for making them active partners in the diabetes management team. People with diabetes need to be educated regarding: The nature of disease, the possibility of development of short term and long term complications, if the condition is not managed appropriately. Self-monitoring skills Appropriate self -care skills Appropriate resources Positive atti tude In addition to the list provided in Table 10.3, some do's and don'ts and basic tips are presented in Table 10.4 Make a note of these.

Physical Activity Guidelines for Indian Population The health benefits of physical activity are well established. Lifestyle intervention studies have shown that Type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) can be prevented with appropriate physical activity and diet. What is appropriate physical activity for the Indian population? Th e guidelines for adults and children are highlighted herewith: 1. A total of 60min of physical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians in view of the high predisposition to develop T2DM and CHD. This should include at least 30 min of mod erate -intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, hiking, gardening, bicycling etc.), 15 min of work -related activity (e.g., carrying heavy loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15min of muscle -strengthening exercises (such as playing on playgro und equipment, climbing trees, playing tug -of- war, lifting weights etc.). 2. For children, moderate -intensity physical activity for 60 min daily should be in the form of sport and physical activity. Educate the diabetic patients to follow an appropriate p hysical activity schedule. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER 11: HEPATITIS/ JAUNDICE (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AN D DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives: After reading this chapter the students will be able to: 1. Understand the role of Liver in the smooth functioning of the body. 2. Enumerate the risk factors in causation of Jaundice and Hepatitis, 3. Discuss the comp lications and consequences of Jaundice and Hepatitis. 4. Describe the dietary management and prevention of Liver infected diseases. Liver is the largest organ of the body constituting 2.5 to 3% of the body weight. It is a multifunctional organ which plays a n important role in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Most of the end products of digestion of food are transported directly to the liver. Compounds which it synthesizes, or stores are sent to other parts of the body when needed. Toxic substances w hich may enter via food or are produced in other parts of the body are detoxified here. Thus, liver has an important bearing on the nutritional status and diseases of this organ markedly affect health. The function of the liver has been summarised in the table given below: - Protein Metabolism - Synthesis of plasma proteins, carrier proteins like transferrin and coagulation factors Carbohydrate Metabolism - Synthesis, storage and release of glycogen. Synthesis of hepari n, Gluconeogenesis from amino acids, conversion of glucose into fatty acids, interconversion of monosaccharides Lipid Metabolism - Synthesis of lipoproteins, phospholipids and cholesterol, conversion of fatty acids, carbohydrates and protein intermediates to fat, formation of file, conjugation of bile salts. Mineral and Vitamin Metabolism - Storage of iron, copper etc., large reservoir of vitamin A and Vitamin D, Conversio n of blood coagulation factors to prothrombin in the presence of vitamin K, conversion of - carotene to retinol and Vitamin D to its active metabolites. Immunological - Important part of lymphoreticular system Detoxification - Of bacterial decomposition products, mineral poisons, alcohol and certain drugs like morphine and dyes. HEPATITIS Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self -limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatiti s viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS I. Causes : There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birt h or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV -contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Safe and effective vacci nes are available to prevent HBV. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV -contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in devel oping parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available. Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are like the flu and include: Muscle and joint pain A high temperature (fever) of 38 \u00b0C (100.4F) or above Feeling unwell Headache Occasionally yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), Symptoms of chronic hepatitis can include: Feeling tired a ll the time, Depression, Jaundice, A general sense of feeling unwell. The period of time between exposure to hepatitis and the onset of the illness is called the incubation period. The incubation period varies depending on the specific hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of about 15 to 45 days; Hepatitis B virus from 45 to 160 days, and Hepatitis C virus from about 2 weeks to 6 months. Many patien ts infected with HAV, HBV, and HCV have few or no symptoms of illness. The most common symptoms of different types of hepatitis includes: Dark urine (hepatitis A, B, C) Stomach pain (hepatitis B, C) Yellow skin or eye whites, called jaundice (hepatitis A, B, C) Pale or clay -coloured stool (hepatitis A, C) Low-grade fever (hepatitis A, B, C) Loss of appetite (hepatitis A, B, C) Fatigue (hepatitis A, B, C) Feeling sick to your stomach (hepatitis A, B, C) Aching joints (hepatitis B) II. Preventions Prevention and control measures which can be adopted are listed below: - Control of reservoir: - It is very diffi cult to achieve this because of poor sanitary facilities of the community and no specific treatment available to kill the organism. Control of transmission: - Spread of the infection can be controlled by strict personal hygiene, e.g. thorough hand washing with soap before eating and after going to the toilet; sanitary disposal of sewage to prevent contamination of drinking water and eatable. Control of susceptible population: - Susceptible population groups may seek medical advice for suitable contr ol measures. Certain protective measures are available for specific susceptible groups and individuals at risk. Administration of vaccine: - The other control measure is the vaccine. Vaccines against infective hepatitis have been developed but are still i n clinical trials stage and it may take some more time before they are widely used in the prevention of infectious hepatitis. MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS & DIETETICS: Majority of the patients with Hepatitis do not required drastic interventions. It is advi sable to encourage patients to consume a normal diet. However, patients consuming alcohol are mostly malnourished and hence required serious nutritional interventions. Nutritional Management The objective of nutritional management of hepatitis are: i) to relieve symptoms ii) to aid in the regeneration of liver tissues iii) to prevent further liver damage A high protein, high carbohydrate moderate fat is recommended. Small attractive meals at regular intervals are better tolerated. Overfeeding should be avoided. 1. Proteins: -For the liver cells to regenerate an adequate supply of proteins is needed. With severe jaundice, 40 g while in mild jaundice 60 -80 g of protein is permitted. 2. Fats: - Fats make the food more palatable and increase calorie intake. In severe jaund ice 20 g and in moderate jaundice 20 -30 g of fats per day are recommended. In other cases of jaundice, fate needs to be restricted only if there is obstruction to fat digestion and produces fatty diarrhea. 3. Carbohydrates: -High carbohydrates content in the diet is essential to supply enough calories so that tissue proteins are not broken down for energy purpose. When fever, nausea and vomiting are present, intravenous glucose is suggested. As soon as the patient can take oral feeds; intravenous feeding shou ld be stopped and fruit juices, sugar, jaggery and honey are given not only to provide carbohydrate but also to supply adequate electrolytes. 4. Vitamins: -They are essential to regenerate liver cells. 500 mg of vitamin C, 10 mg of vitamin K and supplements of B complex are essential to meet the daily needs. If anorexia, nausea or vomiting is there, the vitamins may be given by injection. 5. Minerals: -If food is not taken orally then a careful watch should be kept on the sodium and potassium levels. Oral feeds of fruit juice, vegetable and meat soups with added salt, given orally or through a nasogastric tube help in maintaining the electrolyte balance. Normal level of sodium and potassium in the body fluids must be maintained through supplements. 6. Foods includ ed: - Cereal porridge, soft chapattis, breads rice, skimmed milk, tapioca, potato, yam, fruit, fruit juices, sugar, jaggery, honey, biscuits, soft custard without butter cream and non-stimulant beverages.

Jaundice is a common symptom for all liver diseases. It results due to increase lev els of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice is clinically detected when the bilirubin level is above 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dl . (Normal level 0.2 to 0.8 mg/dl ). CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: I. Causes: Damage to liver cell s leads to increase in bilirubin resulting in jaundice. After 120 days of life, RBC are broken and through a complex chemical reaction, bilirubin is produced. This is excreted in stools and urine along with bile. Problems like increased destruction of RBC, decreased functioning of the liver or obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver can result in jaundice. The figure below shows the production of jaundice. 120 days Release Bilirubin from Red Blood Cells Destroyed haeme Sent to Jaundice Increased destruction Liver damage Liver of RBC (hepatitis) Obstruction Processed and of bile eliminated through Passage stools and Urine Other causes of jaundice are pernicious anaemia and certain diseases affe cting the liver such as typhoid, malaria, yellow fever and tuberculosis. Figure 11.1 Discoloration of Eyes Figure 11.2 Yellow pigmentation of the skin II. Common symptoms of jaundice include : a yellow pigmentation of the skin and the whites of the eyes, normally starting at the head and spreading down the body pale stools the urine also appears dark yellow or brown in colour itchiness fatigue abdominal pain weight loss vomiting fever pale stools III.Types of Jaundice There are three types of jaundice namely: 1. Hemolytic jaundice It is also known as prehepatic jaundice. This relates to excessive destruction of RBC resulting in an increased bilirubin formation and anaemia. There is an increased unconjugated plasma bilirubin, which is excreted through the urine. This kind of jaundi ce is common in newborns, i.e. neonatal jaundice. 2. Hepatic jaundice In this, there is a normal bilirubin production. The liver cannot convert fat soluble bilirubin to the water soluble form. Hence, there is a decreased conjugation leading to hepatocyte da mage (jaundice). Failure of about 80% or more of hepatic function is observed. 3. Obstructive Jaundice It is referred to as post - hepatic jaundice. This results from the interference of normal flow of bile into the duodenum due to stones, tumors or in flammation of mucosa of the duct. This results in a backflow of bile in to the blood stream and is circulated in the body giving a yellow color. MANAGEMENT OF JAUNDICE & DIETETICS To remove excess bilirubin a generous intake of water is necessary. Hen ce Requirement is of more than 3 - 4 litre in a day. Thus, initially when jaundice is diagnosed preference should be given to a clear liquid diet every two hourly. This reduces the load on liver. Clear liquid includes fruit juices, dal or rice water, veget able stalk, vegetable soup or chicken broth. Once the patient tolerates this without any nausea or vomiting, start with a full liquid diet. This includes buttermilk, yogurt smoothie, liquid mixture of dal and rice or curd and rice or liquid porridge. Within a day or two, start with soft easy to digest food and very low in fat. Water intake must be over 3 litres throughout the course of jaundice. Soft khichadi, porridge, curd rice and upma should be good. Be generous with carbohydrates, as it is required t o build liver cells. Avoid any oil as it is processed in liver, which is already compromised due to jaundice. Coconut oil or ghee can be used sparingly (1 - 2 teaspoon/day). Table 11.2 Foods that can be used liberally and best avoided in the diel o f an individual suffering from Jaundice Foods that can be used liberally Foods to be avoided 1. Sugarcane : - Sugarcane has simple 1. Spicy and fried foods sugars that help rebuild liver cells. Chewing the sugarcane helps in removing the bile through the body. Or even sugarcane juice will help. Just ensure the juice is hygienic. Drink juice twice daily for better results. 2. Banana : - Banana is high in antioxidants 2. Junk foods. Liver needs to produce more and potassium. Both help in flushing out bile to digest these foods and that may toxins from the liver. Crush ripe banana, aggravate the condition. add some honey and take this at least twice a day for good results. 3. Buttermilk : - Buttermilk is light to 3. Alcohol, coffee and tea add more toxins digest. It has probiotics that are required for to the liver. normal gastrointestinal function. Having buttermilk at least thrice a day is advisable. 4. Tomato juice : - Tomatoes contain 4. Non -pasteurized milk which is high in vitamin C and potassium which helps in microbes. detoxifying the liver. 5. Lemon : - Lemon is high in antioxidants. 5. Pulses and legumes It protects liver cells from further damage as it unblocks the bile duct from accumulated bile fluid. 6. Gooseberry : - Gooseberry is rich in 6. Non Vegetarian food as it involves liver vitamin C that alleviates the symptoms of for it metabolism. jaundice. 7. Barley : - Barley has diuretic property. It helps to remove all toxins and bile from body through urine. 8. Wheat grass : - Wheat grass triggers the enzymes involved in rejuvenating the liver cells. While juice of Wheat grass is very effective in normal functioning of liver. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ CHAPTER: 12 CELIAC DISEASE, LACTOSE INTOLERANCE & PEPTIC ULCER (DEFINITION,CAUSES,CLINICALSYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance & Peptic ulcer. 2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, complications of the above mentioned diseases, and 3. Describe the treatment and prevention with a main focus on diet therapy and dietary management. Malabsor ption Syndrome Malabsorption syndrome is an alteration in the ability of the intestine to absorb nutrients adequately into the blood stream and it leads to severe malnutrition. Some common malabsorption syndromes are Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance. CELIAC DISEASE Celiac disease often called gluten -sensitive enteropathy is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed people where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide Figure 12.1 inflammation in small Intestine SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS I. Causes: Celiac disease is caused by an abnormal immune system reaction to the protein gluten, which is found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits . In the case of coeliac disease, immune system mistakes one of the substances that makes up gluten, called gliadin, as a threat to the body. The antibodies that are produced cause the surface of intestine to become inflamed (r ed and swollen). The surface of the intestine is usually covered with millions of tiny tube -shaped growths called villi. Villi increase the surface area of gut and help it to digest food more effectively. However, in celiac disease, the damage and inflam mation to the lining of the gut flattens the villi, reducing their ability to help with digestion. II. Symptoms The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and differ in children and adults. Digestive signs and symptoms for adults include: Diarrhoea Fatigue Weight loss Bloating and gas Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Constipation However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms unrelated to the digestive system, including: Anaemia, usually from iron deficiency Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia) Itchy, blistery skin rash Mouth ulcers Headaches and fatigue Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitiv e impairment Joint pain Reduced functioning of the spleen. III. Physiological conditions: Children presenting with celiac disease often will experience a decline in both height and weight growth velocity resulting in a decrease in the growth percentiles. Adults have diarrhea as a major symptom of celiac disease in approximately 50% of cases. They may also be diagnosed in the setting of anemia or osteoporosis. IV. Complications Chronic and sever form of celiac disease patients are at risk for several comp lications. These complications are following: Anaemia Dermatitis, herpetiformis Vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium absorption Vitamin K deficiency Infertility, increases risk of abortion, delayed puberty, delayed growth MANAGEMENT OF CELIAC DISEASE AND DIETETICS Treatment: At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten -free diet. No medication exists that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestine heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer an d in some cases sterility. The diet can be cumbersome; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse. Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. Gluten - free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten -containing foods. The term \"gluten -free\" is generally used to indicate a supposed har mless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain. Gluten -free diet improves healthcare -related quality of life, and str ict adherence to the diet gives more benefit than incomplete adherence. Nevertheless, gluten -free diet doesn't completely normalize the quality of life Dietary guidelines in celiac disease: Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, is critical in treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. Many heal thy, gluten -free foods and products are available in the market. Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings do not contain gluten and are part of a well -balanced diet. Gluten -free types of bread, pasta , and other foods that are now easier to find in stores and at special food companies. Potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour can be substituted in the diet of a celiac.

Bed time Apple juice 1 glas s (250 ml) Note: Avoid wheat and wheat products LACTOSE INTOLERANCE Lactose intolerance: The inability to digest lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products. The basis for lactose intolerance is the lack of an enzyme called lactase in the small intestine. The most common symptoms of lactose intolerance are diarrhea, bloating, and gas. SYMPTOM S & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS I. Causes There are two main types of lactose intolerance, which have different causes. Primary Lactose Intolerance: Primary lactose intolerance is the most common. It is caused by a decrease in lactase production with age, s o that lactose becomes poorly absorbed. Secondary lactose intolerance: This form of lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine decreases lactase production after an illness, injury or surgery involving your small intestine. Among the diseases a ssociated with secondary lactose intolerance are celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease. Another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase deficiency. This type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small intestine along with the lactase. An example of such a disease is celiac disease (sprue). Congenital or developmental lactose intolerance: It's possible, but rar e, for babies to be born with lactose intolerance caused by a complete absence of lactase activity. This disorder is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive, meaning that both the mother and the father mu st pass on the same gene variant for a child to be affected. Premature infants may also have lactose intolerance because of an insufficient lactase level. Lactase deficiency may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation in the gene that is responsible for producing lactase. This is a very rare cause of lactase deficiency, and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth. II. Symptoms - A person with lactose intolerance will experience s ymptoms after consuming milk or some dairy product that contains lactose. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to a severe reaction, depending on how much lactase the person produces, and how much dairy products they consume. Symptoms include: Flatulence Bloating Abdominal pains Nausea Diarrhoea The person may have a sudden urge to use the bathroom 1 to 2 hours af ter consuming lactose. In severe cases, dehydration may occur. The most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood, referred to as adult -type hypolactasia. This decrease in lactase is genetically programmed. MANAGEMENT OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE AND DIETETICS Treatment: There's currently no way to boost body's production of lactase, but one can usually avoid the discomfort of lactose intolerance by: Avoiding large servings of milk and other dairy products Including small servings of dairy products in your regular meals Eating and drinking lactose -reduced ice cream and milk Experimenting with an assort ment of dairy products . Not all dairy products have the same amount of lactose. For example, hard cheeses, such as Swiss or cheddar, have small amounts of lactose and generally cause no symptoms. Buying lactose -reduced or lactose -free products . Using lac tase enzyme tablets or drops . Tablets or drops containing the lactase enzyme (Dairy Ease, Lactaid, others) may help digest dairy products. Not everyone with lactose intolerance is helped by these products. Reducing the dairy products doesn't mean that w e can't get enough calcium. Calcium is found in many other foods, such as: Broccoli Calcium -fortified products, such as breads and juices Milk substitutes, such as soy milk and rice milk Oranges Pinto beans Spinach Also make sure to get enough vitamin D , which is typically supplied in fortified milk. Eggs, liver and yogurt also contain vitamin D, and body makes vitamin D in the sun. Even without restricting dairy foods, though, many adults don't get enough vitamin D. Dietary tips for planning a menu for lactose intolerance patient avoid milk, paneer and milk based beverages or desserts all the food labels should be read before using, as that should be lactose free if nutrition supplement is given it should be lactose free PEPTIC ULCERS A peptic u lcer is a sore on the lining of stomach or duodenum. Rarely, a peptic ulcer may develop just above stomach in oesophagus called as oesophageal ulcer. Figure 12.2 Stomach and duodenum with ulcer SYMPTOMS & PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS I. Causes long-term use of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen an infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori Rare cancerous and noncancerous tumours in the stomach, duodenum, or pancreas \u2014 known as Zollinger -Ellison syndrome (ZES) Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digest ive tract eats away the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed. Digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects against acid. But if the amount of acid is increased or th e amount of mucus is decreased, it could develop an ulcer. Some other causes include: A bacterium. Helicobacter pylori bacteria commonly lives in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. Often, the H. pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's inner layer, producing an ulcer. Regular use of certain pain relievers. Taking Aspirin, as well as certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can irritate or inf lame the lining of stomach and small intestine. Peptic ulcers are more common in older adults who take these pain medications frequently or in people who take these medications for osteoarthritis. Other medications. Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as steroids, anticoagulants, low -dose Aspirin can greatly increase the chance of developing ulcers. It is not uncommon for people to have a peptic ulcer and no symptoms at all. However, one of the most common symptoms of peptic ulcers is indigestion -like pain. The pain may occur anywhere from the belly button to the breastbone. It can be brief or may last for hours. It is more severe when the stomach is empty or right after eating (depending on where it is located); sometimes it is worse during sleep. Eating certain foods may relieve it, and some foods may make it worse. Other symptoms may include: difficulty swallowing food food that is eaten comes back u p feeling unwell after eating weight loss loss of appetite Over -the-counter medications can often provide relief for these symptoms. Rarely, ulcers can cause severe signs and symptoms, such as: vomiting blood black and tarry stools, or stools with dark red blood nausea and vomiting that is especially persistent and severe MANAGEMENT OF PEPTIC ULCER & DIETETICS Treatment: - The type of treatment usually depends on what cause d the peptic ulcer. Treatment will focus on either lowering stomach acid levels so that the ulcer can heal, or eradicating the H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection treatment Patients infected with H. pylori will usually need antibiotics. This treatme nt is effective in most patients, and the ulcer will start to disappear within days. When treatment is over, the individual will have to be tested again to make sure the H. pylori have gone. Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs If the ulcer comes from NSAIDs, the patient will have to stop taking them. If the person cannot stop taking NSAIDs, the doctor may minimize the dosage and review the patient's need for them later. Follow -up treatment Even after the ulcer has healed and treatment has been compl eted, the patient may still have indigestion. In such cases, the doctor might advise some diet and lifestyle changes. In severe cases with bleeding, an endoscopy may be needed to stop the bleeding at the ulcer site. Dietary Management: Dietary changes can be important for treating and preventing peptic ulcers. It is important to avoid foods and f lavourings that induce the stomach to produce acids, such as chili powder, garlic, black pepper, and caffeine. Alcohol has the same effect on the stomach and should also be avoided. The diet should contain plenty of foods that provide plenty of vitamin A and fibre that dissolves easily. These can include: Sources of soluble fibre Oats Apples Oranges Carrots legumes flax seeds Nuts Barley Sources of vitamin A liver broccoli kale spinach sweet potatoes Foods that are high in antioxidants, such as a range of berries and snap peas, are recommende d. Green tea has also demonstrated a restrictive effect on the growth of H. pylori under laboratory conditions. A balanced diet filled with fruits and vegetables and lacking in intense spices and flavours should assist with a peptic ulcer.

Define the term food hazards, 2. Differentiate between different types of food hazards(physical ,chemical & biological), 3. Explain the causes, concepts and preventive measures of cholera, typhoid & salmonell osis. Figure 13.1 Types of Food Hazards A general definition of a hazard is a conditions or contaminants that can cause illness or injury. A food hazard refers to any agent with the potential to cause adverse health consequences f or consumers. It occurs when food is exposed to hazardous agents which result in contamination of that food. HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control point) is a food safety system that is recognised worldwide to determine significant hazards pertaining to specific products and processes. Food hazards may be biological, chemical and physical. Let's now discuss these hazards in detail. 1. Biological hazards : It includes microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds and parasites. Some of these are pat hogens or may produce toxins. A pathogenic microorganism causes disease and can vary in the degree of severity. Examples of biological hazards include Salmonella , E. coli and Clostridium botulinum . These hazards can come from raw materials or from food -processing steps used to make the final product. Microorganisms live everywhere: air, dirt, fresh and salt water, skin, hair, animal fur and plants. Microorganisms are classified into various groups. Since microorganisms are so widespread, it is important to understand when to be concerned about them and how to deal with them. Although thousands of kinds of microorganisms exist, only a few pose hazards to humans. Many microorganisms are beneficial. Certain kinds of yeast, molds and bacteria help make cheese, s our cream, yogurt and other fermented dairy products. Particular kinds of yeast are used in making beer, wine and other fermented beverages. We add these microorganisms to our foods intentionally, and they cause no harm. In fact, studies show that some of these microorganisms contribute to good health. In HACCP, \"hazards\" refer to conditions or contaminants in foods that can cause illness or injury. 2. Chemical hazards: The chemical hazards vary in the aspect of production they are related to. Some pote ntial chemical hazards could be prior to a processor receiving product, such as the improper use of pesticides or antimicrobial residues. Others could be chemicals used on processing equipment such as oils used on equipment or sanitizers. Furthermore, othe r potential chemical hazards may include substances that are safe or used in processing at certain levels but can cause illness or injury if consumed at too high of a concentration, such as sodium nitrite or antimicrobial solutions used in intervention ste ps. The HACCP team evaluates in the hazard analysis the likelihood of the chemical to cause illness or injury. Chemical contamination can happen at any stage in food production and proc essing. Chemicals can be helpful and are purposefully used with some foods, such as pesticides on fruits and vegetables. Packaging materials that are in direct contact with ingredients or the product can be a source of incidental chemicals, such as sanitiz ers or inks. Chemicals are not hazardous if properly used or controlled. 3. Physical hazards: It include objects that are hard or sharp such as glass, metal, plastic, stones, pits, wood, or even bone. Physical hazards can lead to injuries such as choking, cu ts, or broken teeth. Some foreign material in food products may not be a physical hazard but rather an undesirable foreign material such as hair, insects, or sand that are not likely to cause injuries. Physical hazards include any potentially harmful extra neous matter not normally found in food. When a consumer mistakenly eats the foreign material or object, it is likely to cause choking, injury or other adverse health effects. Physical hazards are the most commonly reported consumer complaints because the injury occurs immediately or soon after eating, and the source of the hazard is often easy to identify. FOOD BORNE DISEASE Food borne illness usually result from a few of the following reasons: 1. Consuming food obtained from infected plant or animal. 2. Food contaminated by insects, flies, rodents, etc. 3. Food which comes in the contact with sewage water or sewage polluted water. 4. Food handled in an unhygienic way. Microorganisms like salmonella, clostridium and staphylococci are responsible for the majority of food -borne illness. The main diseases which are transmitted by food are typhoid, dysentery, tuberculosis, infectious hepatitis and cholera. Some of the common symptoms of food illness are given below as food -borne illness generally affects the gastroi ntestinal tract. Symptoms includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain & diarrhoea. Food and Personal Hygiene: Hygiene is an important factor in order to prevent a food illness. It is so because food is the most potential medium through which disease - carrying organisms can be transmitted. So, it becomes important for food handlers to follow high standard of food hygiene. Hence one should follow the following practices: 1. Wash your hands with soap or water. Dry them properly with a towel or a hand dryer. 2. Keep your nails short and clean. 3. If you have cut or wounds on hands or fingers, cover them with proper dressing before handling food. 4. Do not touch hair, nose or any other potentially hazardous area or thing while preparing food 5. Cover your mouth and nos e while coughing and sneezing. 6. Store the food at proper temperature. CHOLERA: Cholera is an acute infection of the small intestine that cause severe watery diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration and even death, if untreated. It is caused by eating f ood or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. Cholera has been known and feared for centuries because of its occurrence in epidemics resulting in high mortality and social disruption. Figure 13.2 Tra nsmission of Cholera Causes: Vibrio cholerae is usually found in food or water contaminated by faces from a person with the infection. Common sources include: Municipal water supplies Ice made from municipal water Foods and drinks sold by street ve ndors Vegetable grown with water containing human wastes Raw or undercooked fish and seafood caught in waters polluted with sewage Incubation period: Incubation period for cholera infection is from few hours to 5 days, but commonly it is 1 to 2 days. Carriers in cholera: A carried is a person who is apparently healthy but is excreting the causative organism - Vibrio cholerae . Who gets the disease? Age & Sex: Cholera affects all ages, and both sexes. In areas, where cholera is endemic, children are af fected most. Economic Status: Occurrence of cholera is more in the low socio -economic groups mainly because of poor hygiene. Immunity: Affected person gets temporary immunity from previous episodes for future attacks. Such immunity will however be effect ive from 10 days to 7 months only after the onset of an attack. Symptoms Watery diarrhoea Vomiting Dehydration Rapid heart rate Loss of skin elasticity (the ability to return to original position quickly if pinched) Dry mucous membranes, including the ins ide of the mouth, throat, nose and eyelids Low blood pressure Thirst Reduce urine output Muscle cramps Management, Prevention and Measures Management: Since dehydration is the most common manifestation of cholera the very first step in the management of cholera is control of dehydration. With rehydration i.e., by making up of losses fluids and salts (electrolytes) cholera can now be effectively treated. The rehydration can be oral or intravenous. By this treatment, the death rate due to cholera can be r educed to 1 percent. World Health organisation recommends the use of oral fluid. The amount of oral fluid given depends upon extent of dehydration. In the case of mild dehydration i.e., the patient is thirsty, pulse is normal, tongue moist, skin pin ch retracts immediately, and the volume of oral fluid to be given would be 50ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours. In case of moderate dehydration i.e., when the patient is thirsty, pulse is rapid and weak , eyes are sunken and tongue is dr y and volume of oral fluid to be given should be 100 ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours. In case of severe dehydration i.e., when the patient is drowsy, cold, sweaty, pulse is feeble, blood pressure not recordable and skin pinch retracts very slowly, tongue is very dry, the patient must immediately be shifted to a nearby hospital. PREVENTION AND CONTROL: Sanitation measure - 1. Water control: As water is the most important vehicle for transmission of cholera, adequate steps must be taken for safe and adequate water supply. 2. Excreta disposal: Economical and effective excreta disposal must be undertaken. 3. Food sanitation: As food forms an important vehicle of infection, effective steps must be taken for proper food sanitation. 4. Disinfection s: The most effective disinfectant are cresol and bleaching powder. The patient stools, vomit, clothes and other items that have been contaminated must be disinfected. Vaccination -Vaccination against cholera as a specific prophylactic (medicine to prevent cholera) is available. Children below 5 yrs. who are main victims of cholera in endemic areas are poorly protected with the current vaccine, the degree of protection tends to increase with age. TYPHOID Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella t yphi, usually through ingestion of contaminated food or water. It occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Typhoid is manifested by fever with the gradual onset of headache, prolonged fever associated with anorexia. Non -sweating fever, mental dullness may be observed sometimes. Figure 13.3 Transmission of Typhoid Causes: A microorganism Sa lmonella typhi is the causative organism and mainly it affects the intestine and liberates toxins into blood circulation. The main mode of infection is by faecal -oral route. The typhoid infection mainly spread by water and food contaminated by faeces or urine of typhoid patients or carriers of the disease. There are certain social factors which contribution to the infection. These include: 1. The prevailing wrong defecation practices because of which faecal pollution of soil occurs leading to spread of infe ction through water, food and flies. 2. Low standard of personal hygiene. 3. Unhygienic health practices. 4. Low standards of food hygiene. 5. Illiteracy and health ignorance. Carriers in Typhoid: A small number who have suffered from typhoid may become carriers. The carriers may excrete the organism in faeces, urine or bile. Incubation period: The disease takes usually 10 -15 days with a range of 4 days to 3 weeks. Period of communicability: Period of communicability for typhoid lasts as long as typhoid bacilli a ppear in the excreta. Generally everybody is susceptible to the disease typhoid. Resistance to small infecting doses follows recovery from clinical disease or from unapparent (sub -clinical) infection or from active immunization. In areas where typhoid is endemic attack rates usually decline with age. Management, Prevention and Measures Three lines of measures can be described against the control and prevention of typhoid fever. They are: 1. Control of reservoir: The reservoir of infection for typhoid fever exists in patients, contacts and carriers. Isolation of cases is essential to prevent the spread of the infection. Appropriate treatment should be ensured by proper medical care. Since patient's stools, urine and is articles are the main sources of infect ion in typhoid fever, they should be properly disinfected. 2. Control of sanitation: Following measures are included: Protection, purification and chlorination of public water supplies. Sanitary disposal of human excreta. Control of fly breeding. Boiling or pasteurisation of milk and dairy products. Identification and adequate supervision of typhoid carriers. 3. Immunization: Vaccine is available for immunization against typhoid fever. While improved sanitation ad strict domestic and personal hygiene are primary in preventing typhoid, immunization has a complimentary role. Though immunization does not offer 100 percent protection against typhoid, it has got a major role in prevention. Management In case of any prolonged fever, it is essential to seek p roper medical attention. Once the diagnosis of the disease is confirmed clinically and bacteriologically (biochemically) specific treatment should be administered under strict medical care. It is essential that medical treatment for typhoid should be under strict medical care. Proper nutrition and dietary care should be taken since the gastro -intestinal system is involved. Authentic advice from qualified medical people should be obtained. SALMONELLOSIS Salmonella infection (salmonellosis) is a common b acterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through faeces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food. Typically, people with salmonella infection have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps within eight to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a few days without specific treatment. In some cases, the diarrhoea associated with salmonella infection can be so dehydrating as to require prompt medical attention. Life -threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond your intestines. The risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher if you travel to countries with poor sanitation. Causes: Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are infected with salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by faeces. Commonly infected foods include: Raw meat, poultry and seafood. Faeces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water. Raw eggs. While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce. Fruits and vegetables. Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing wi th water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads. Management, Prevention and Measures Preventive methods are especially important when preparing food or providing care for infants, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Be sure to cook food thoroughly and refrigerate or freeze food promptly. Wash your hands Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent the transfer of salmonella bacteria to your mouth or to any food you're preparing. Wash your hands after you: Use the toilet Change a diaper Handle raw meat or poultry Clean up pet faeces Touch reptiles or birds Keep things separate To prevent cross -contami nation: Store raw meat, poultry and seafood away from other foods in your refrigerator If possible, have two cutting boards in your kitchen \u2014 one for raw meat and the other for fruits and vegetables Never place cooked food on an unwashed plate that prev iously held raw meat Avoid eating raw eggs Cookie dough, homemade ice cream and eggnog all contain raw eggs. If you must consume raw eggs, make sure they've been pasteurized. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- CHAPTER 14: PERSONAL HYGIENE & FOOD HYGIENE Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the terms food hygiene, food safety & food sanitation, 2. Enumerate the scope of e nvironmental sanitation, 3. List the various habits included in maintenance of personal hygiene. The human body can provide places for disease -causing germs and parasites to grow and multiply. These places include the skin and in and around the openings t o the body. It is less likely that germs and parasites will get inside the body if people have good personal hygiene habits. Maintaining personal hygiene is essential for more than one reason; social, health, personal, psychological or just as a way of lif e. Maintaining a good standard of hygiene helps keep infections, illnesses and bad odors at bay. The importance of hygiene should be taught from an early age to help cultivate good habits. Personal hygiene can be defined as an act of maintaining cleanlines s and grooming of the external body. Maintaining good personal hygiene consists of bathing, washing your hands, brushing teeth and sporting clean clothing. Additionally, it is also about making safe and hygienic decisions when you are around others. One o f the most fool proof ways to safeguard yourself and others from illness is through good personal hygiene. This means cleaning your hands, especially, but additionally your body. Good personal hygiene not only enhances your overall appearance, its importan ce is directly related to prevention of diseases, infections, and unpleasant odours. GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE Good personal hygiene habits include: Washing the body often. If possible, everybody should have a shower or a bath every day. However, there may be times when this is not possible, for example, when people are out camping or there is a shortage of water If this happens, a swim or a wash all over the body with a wet sponge or cloth will do Cleaning the teeth at least once a day. Brushing the teeth after each meal is the best way of making sure that gum disease and tooth decay are avoided. It is very important to clean teeth after breakfast and immediately before going to bed washing the hair with soap or shampoo at least once a week washing hands w ith soap after going to the toilet Washing hands with soap before preparing and/or eating food. During normal daily activities, such as working and playing, disease causing germs may get onto the hands and under the nails. If the germs are not washed off before preparing food or eating, they may get onto the food Changing into clean clothes. Dirty clothes should be washed with laundry soap before wearing them again Hanging clothes in the sun to dry. The sun's rays will kill some disease -causing germs and parasites Turning away from other people and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue or the hand when coughing or sneezing. If this is not done, droplets of liquid containing germs from the nose and mouth will be spread in the air and other people can breathe them in, or the droplets can get onto food. Types of personal hygiene Each person's idea of personal hygiene differs. These main categories are a useful place to start for building good hygiene habits: Toilet hygiene Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Scrub with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse with warm water, and dry with a clean towel. If you don't have running water or soap, an alcohol -based hand sanitizer will also work. Use one that's at least 60 percent alcohol. Shower hygiene Personal preference may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils. You should also wash your hair at least twice a week. Shampooing your hair and scalp helps remove skin b uild up and protects against oily residues that can irritate your skin. Nail hygiene Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away build up, dirt, and germs. Tidying your nails help s you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body openings. You should also avoid biting your nails. Teeth hygiene Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities. Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash. These two steps can help prevent tooth decay and eliminate pockets where bacteria and germs can build up. Sickness hygiene If you're not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others. This includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, wiping down shared surfaces with an antibacterial wipe, and not sharing any utensils or electronics. Also, immediately throw away any soiled tissues. Hands hygiene Germs on your h ands can easily enter your body through your mouth, nose, eyes, or ears. Wash your hands: when you handle food before you eat if you handle garbage when you sneeze any time you touch an animal Likewise, wash your hands after changing a baby's diape r, helping someone clean themselves, or when cleaning a cut or wound. FOOD HYGIENE AND SANITATION Food hygiene is the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety of food from production to consumption. Food can become contaminated at any poi nt during slaughtering or harvesting, processing, storage, distribution, transportation and preparation. Lack of adequate food hygiene can lead to foodborne diseases and death of the consumer. Food hygiene constitutes a basic necessity of Good Manufacturin g/Agricultural Practices and the development of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) .The personal cleanliness and hygiene of food preparers are critical to protecting against foodborne i llness. In addition to regular hand washing, some states require food preparers to wear latex gloves as an additional safeguard. Clean hair and clean clothing are essential. If a food preparer is dirty, the risk for food contamination increases greatly. Fo od sanitation and hygiene guidelines require food preparers to wear hats, hairnets and beard guards to make sure that hair doesn't contaminate food. Similarly, wearing aprons outside the food preparation area isn't permitted since bacteria are so easily ca rried back to the kitchen. Food sanitation is essential aspect of food preparation. Food sanitation implies: Cleanliness Preparing Storing & Serving of food & water Some items that need particular attention are: A safe and potable water supply Selecti on of wholesome ingredients & Hygienic handling Water is essential in food preparation. Water is used to wash food before cooking. Clean the containers make beverage. It should be free from pathogenic bacteria. Water is potable if It is free from pathoge nic bacteria It is free from harmful bacteria It contains dissolved salts or minerals ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION AND SAFETY It is generally accepted that the assurance of food safety is primarily connected with the elimination of contamination in the full cycle of food production, from raw materials through manufacturing to finished products and kitchen operations. Among potential contaminants, primarily pesticides, heavy metals, and some biological contaminants have to be taken in consideration. The majori ty of these contaminants are of environmental origin. So it is understandable that a prerequisite of the production of safe food is the hindering of pollution in the environment. In this chapter some aspects of interrelations of food safety and environment al sanitation will be treated. Integrated Pest Management and Food Safety The last 40 years of the twentieth century saw a remarkable scientific revolution in agriculture, in which chemical technology played a major role. A broad range of chemicals is now used in agriculture to reduce the losses caused by different pests. Pests \u2014including insects, mites, pathogens (disease -causing microorganisms), weeds, nematodes, rodents, and others \u2014contribute to high farm -producing costs and reduced quality and yie lds. Farm production losses to pests are estimated to exceed 35% annually. So it is understandable that reduction of these losses by using different chemicals is important from the point of view of increasing the effectiveness of agricultural production. T he use of chemicals in agricultural production has provided numerous benefits in terms of increasing production and quality. However, as a result, consumers are exposed indirectly to chemicals, usually in minute quantities. Although the level of residues i n food is low, they represent an additional health hazard for people consuming residue containing food. Because some types of these chemicals, such as organo -chlorine pesticides, heavy metals, and triazine herbicides, could not be degraded by naturally occ urring soil microorganisms, the soil and water could also be polluted. In addition, it should be mentioned that because of transformation of pesticides in plants and soil, different metabolites are formed. Some of them may also be toxic. For pesticides, l ess than 1% of all the wells surveyed had concentrations slightly above levels considered safe for human health, while about 1% of the community wells and about 2.4% of the private rural wells contained nitrate concentrations above the maximum contaminant level established to protect human health. Any harmful health effects of pesticides are usually associated with the amount or dose of the pesticide. For example, a chemical worker who during manufacture of a pesticide harmful to humans accidentally comes into direct contact with large amounts of the pesticide could face serious injury. Yet, because the danger is so great, strict safety requirements have drastically reduced the likelihood of such an industrial accident occurring. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecological approach to pest suppression. Establishment of an integrated pest suppression system should be based on thorough knowledge of: Crop and animal production methods Biology and ecology of each pest species and basic information on th e genetics and physiology of pest species Relationships of the pests with the crop and other biological and physiological components of the ecosystem Potential economic damage of each pest and pest complex The issue of food safety and hygiene is a unive rsal concern. This is because everyone has to consume food. This is a requirement for all people across the nation as well as the globe to be concerned about to be healthy and enjoy the food they must consume. --------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER -15: FOOD ADULTERATION Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the terms food adulteration, and list the common adulterant s 2. Demonstrate the common methods for testing adulterants at home, 3. List the various standards as set by FSSAI for food products. INTRODUCTION For good health, we must have good food. By good food, we mean nutritionally balanced, wholesome and safe foo d. Adulteration in food products is a part of under nutrition. Adulteration leads to loss of nutrients in food products and sometimes may prove very harmful for the body. Moreover, the consumer is cheated not only for his money by adulteration but also in quantity and quality as well. Adulteration of food stuffs is commonly practised in India by the trade. The consumers like to get maximum quantity for a price as low as possible. The sellers must meet the needs of the buyers, to be able to exist. This is a vicious cycle. When the price of food production is higher than the price which the consumer is prepared to pay, seller is compelled to supply food product of inferior quality. Thus, adulteration occurs. Food adulteration can be defined as the intentiona l addition or substitution or abstraction of substance which adversely affect the nature, substance and quality of food products. It can be at the time of harvesting, storage, processing, transportation or distribution. TYPES OF ADULTERATION Adulteration may be intentional or unintentional. The former is a wilful act on the part of the adulterator intended to increase the margin of profit. Incidental contamination is usually due to ignorance, negligence or lack of proper facilities. A. Intentional adulteran ts: Intentional adulterants are sand, marble chips, stones mud, chalk powder, water, mineral oil and coaltar, dyes. These adulterants cause harmful effects on the body. B. Incidental adulterants: Raw foods such as meat, fish, milk and vegetables grown on sewage are likely to be contaminated with harmful micro -organisms. These are generally destroyed during cooking or processing of food. Some of the micro - organisms may survive due to inadequate heat processing. Further, some of the foods, if consumed in the ra w state, may cause food poisoning. Recent studies have shown that food grains legumes and oil seeds when stored in humid atmosphere are infected by pathogenic fungus which can cause serious illness. To check the growing tendency of food adulteration, Gov ernment of India had introduced \"Prevention of Food Adulteration Act\" (PFA) in 1954 . This Act is based on international standards, keeping in mind the Indian conditions. This Act came into force on June 1, 1955. FSSAI (FOOD SAFETY AND STANDARD AUTHOR ITY OF INDIA) Figure 15.1: FSSAI symbol In 2006, the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) has been established under the food safety and standard Act, 2006 which consolidates various acts. The Act has laid down science ba sed standards for articles of food and regulates their manufacture, storage, distribution, and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption and for matter and incidents connected therewith. The following foodstuffs should be deemed to be adulterated: - 1. If it is not of the nature, substance, and quality which it ought to be. 2. If it contains cheaper or inferior ingredients incidentally or intentionally. 3. If it has been prepared by a process which alters the nature, substance, or quality of foodstuff. 4. If any constituent has been abstracted partially or wholly from it like abstraction of cream from milk. 5. If it has been prepared, packed, or kept under unsanitary conditions. 6. If it is infected with insects, worms, etc. 7. If it is obtained from sick or diseased animal, e.g., milk and meat of diseased animals. 8. If it contains poisonous ingredients which are injurious to health. 9. If the container renders it poisonous or injurious to health. 10. If it contains unpermitted colours or any excessive amount of permitted ones. 11. If it contains prohibited preservatives or an excessive amount of permitted ones. 12. If it does not satisfy the prescribed standards laid down by the authorities even though they do not have adverse effect of health. STA NDARDS: Standards framed by FSSAI are prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011, Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation, 2011 and Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants , Toxins, and Residues) Regulations, 2011. The FSSAI has prescribed standards for following food products: Dairy products and analogu es Fats, oils and fat emulsions Fruits and vegetable products Cereal and cereal products Meat a nd meat products Fish and fish products Sweets & confectionery Sweetening agents including honey Salt, spices, condiments and related products Beverages, (other than dairy and fruits & vegetables based) Other food product and ingredients Proprietary food Irradiation of food The development o f standards is a dynamic process based on the latest developments in food science, food consumption pattern, new food products and additiv es, changes in the processing technology leading to changed specifications, advancements in food analytical methods, and identification of new risks or other regulatory options. If a food product violates one or more of the above said standards, it will b e regarded as an adulterated food and the seller will be punished under the law. According to PFA Act, Food Adulteration includes: - Intentional addition, substitution or abstraction or substances which adversely affect the purity and quality of foods. Incidental contamination of foods with deleterious substances such as toxins and insecticides due to ignorance, negligence or lack of proper storage facilities. Contamination of the food with harmful insects, micro -organisms like bacteria, fungus, moulds, etc. during production, storage and handling. Adulteration of food may endanger health if the physiological functions of the consumer are affected due to either addition or the removal of a vital component. Adulterant is any material which is employed or which could be employed for the purpose of adulteration is defined as an adulterant. TABLE 15.1: COMMON ADULTERANTS IN FOOD ILL EFFECTS OF ADULTERANTS In the earlier times, people used to prepare different eatables at home so that it is fresh, clean and healthy. But today everyone is so busy that they do not have time to cook food at home and rely on instantly made items. These have different kinds of preservatives that are used to keep them in good conditio n for a long time. But these are really harmful and have an adverse effect on our health. Today almost all the food items that you will get in the market have some or the other kind of adulterant which brings down the nutritional value and causes different types of health hazards. Let's know more about adulteration and how it is harmful to your health. 1. METANIL YELLOW Metanil yellow is a food colorant used extensively in various foods. It is also used as an adulterant in different spices especially turmeri c and regular Indian foods like pulses. Metanil yellow belongs to \"non -permitted\" category of food colour. Continued consumption of this toxic food color leads to adverse life -threatening effects in humans. Consumption of metanil yellow in food may affect our nervous system and may cause brain damage. Metanil yellow consumed through food enters our digestive system directly. Studies reveal that metanil yellow causes ga strotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and damages the intestine. 2. ARGEMONE OIL Consumption o f adulterated mustard oil (Brassica nigra) with argemone oil (Argemone mexicana) even for a short duration leads to a clinical condition referred as epidemic dropsy. In humans, argemone oil contained in adulterated mustard oil causes oxidative stress and death of red blood cells via met -hemoglobin formation by altering pyridine nucleotide(s) and glutathione redox potential. Argemone oil contamination poses a serious threat to human health. 3. KESARI DAL Excessive consumption of kesari dal produces Lathyris m (form of crippling, paralysis of both lower limbs) mainly in boys and men in the age group of 5 to 45 years. This disease manifests itself in 2 -4 months if the diet consists of 40% or more of kesari dal. The disease starts with the stiffness of knee joi nts and legs, with pain around the knee and ankle joints. Within 10 -30 days of the onset of symptoms, paralysis of the lower limbs sets in. The patient gradually becomes crippled as his knees are bent and stiff. Table 15.2: Common Methods for Detecting A dulterants at Home CHAPTER 16: READING AND UNDERSTANDING FOOD LABELS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the term Food Label and its importance, 2. List the advantages and disadvantages of food labels. 3. Elaborate on the labelling provision in existing food laws. A food label can be defined as a panel found on a package of food which contains a variety of information about the nutritional value of the food item. There are many pieces of informa tion which are standard on most food labels, including serving size, number of calories, grams of fat, included nutrients, and a list of ingredients. This information helps people who are trying to restrict their intake of fat, sodium, sugar, or other ingr edients, or those individuals who are trying to get enough of the healthy nutrients such as calcium or Vitamin C. Food label is any tag, brand, mark, pictorial or other descriptive matter, written, printed, stencilled, marked, embossed or impressed on, or attached to, a container of food. Food labelling includes any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal. The la bel may either be engraved or attached on to the packaging of the product. Figure 16.1: Nutrition Facts A food label must have the following: - Name of the product. Brand name Trademark Manufacture's name and address. Name of the country in which the product is made. Ingredients Net weight/ volume/ length Use of the product Maximum retail price (inclusive of all the taxes) Warning and precautions Directions for use Standard mark Date of manufacture Date of best before Batch/lot number Details of colour or added preservatives Figure 16.2: Label ADVANTAGES OF A FOOD LABEL Labels assist a consumer in making a wise decision. The label provides detailed information about a food's nutrient content. You can use the label compare two similar foods to decide what would be the healthier choice. The list of ingredients is essential in case a person is allergic to some ingredient. They also help to see the quality of the product throu gh the given standardised marks. The rates and the amounts can be checked and compared. In case of any defect the manufacturer can be contacted directly through the address given. A consumer can refer the label as and when required. Any special scheme offered by the manufacturer is also mentioned on the label. Labels guide the consumers how to store and use the products. LIMITATIONS OF A FOOD LABEL. Labels may not give complete information. The print may be blurred, small or overlapping. Labels of popular brands may be initiated in case of sub -standard products. HOW TO READ A FOOD LABEL Most foods in the grocery store have a nutrition facts label and list of ingredients. When you go for grocery shopping, take the time to read the nutrition fac ts labels on the foods you purchase. Compare nutrients and calories in one food to those in another. The information may surprise you. Make sure you are not buying foods high in calories, saturated and trans fats, sodium and added sugars. INFORMATION OF T HE NUTRITION FACTS PROVIDED BY LABEL Serving Size \u2014 This is how much of the food is considered a \"serving\". A package may contain multiple servings. If you eat more or less than the serving size listed, you need to adjust the amount of nutrients and calor ies you are eating. Calories \u2014 This tells you how much energy is in the food. It is helpful to know if you are cutting calories to lose weight or want to manage your weight. Total Fat \u2014 This is the amount of fat found in one serving of the food. It inclu des the amount of \"bad fats\" (saturated and trans fats) and \"better fats\" (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats). Fat is higher in calories than protein or carbohydrates. So, cutting back on your fat intake will help you reduce the amount of calories y ou eat. Saturated Fat \u2014 Eating too much of these \"bad fats\" can raise your cholesterol and your risk of heart disease and stroke. Limit your saturated fat intake to less than 5 to 6 percent of your total calories. For a person who needs 2,000 calories a d ay, this is about 11 to 13 grams of saturated fat. Trans Fat - These fats are also considered \"bad fats\" because they can raise LDL (LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN) cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Choose foods with \"0\" grams of trans fat and read the ingredients list to avoid foods made with \"hydrogenated oils\". Everyone can benefit by limiting trans fats. Cholesterol \u2014 The FDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating less than 300 mg of cholesterol a day to maintain normal cholesterol levels. They also recommend consuming less than 200 mg per day if you are at high risk for (or have) heart disease. Sodium \u2014 Watch for both naturally -occurring and added sodium in food products. Salt is sodium chloride. Most people should take in less tha n 1,500 mg of sodium each day. That's equal to a little more than \u00bd tsp. of salt. Total Carbohydrates \u2014 A carbohydrate is a type of sugar. Carbohydrates in food are digested and converted into glucose, or sugar, to provide the cells of the body with energy. Choose carbohydrate -based foods with high amounts of nutrients. These include vegetables, fruits and whole -grain, breads, cereals and pasta. Dietary Fibre \u2014 Dietary fibre describes several materials that make up the parts of plants your body can't dig est. As part of a healthy diet, soluble fibre can help decrease your risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. Whole grains and fruits and vegetables include dietary fibre. Most refined (processed) grains contain little fibre. Sugar \u2014 The amount lis ted includes both sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as fruit and milk, and sugars that are added to foods, such as soft drinks and other sweetened foods and beverages. There are lots of different names for \"added sugars\" such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, dextrose, high -fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, concentrated fruit juice, and honey. Look at the ingredients list and make sure that there aren't a lot of \"added sugars\" listed in the Protein \u2014 This is one of the components in food that provide us with energy. Animal protein contains saturated fat. Choose fish and skinless poultry and limit your intake of red meat. Use low -fat dairy products. Try other sources of protein such as beans, nuts, seeds, tofu and other soy -based products. Vitamins and Minerals \u2014 Vitamins and minerals are important parts of your diet. Eating a variety of foods will help you reach your daily goal of 100 percent of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron. Daily Value \u2014 The standard daily values are guides for peo ple who eat 2,000 calories each day. If you eat more or less than that, your daily value may be higher or lower. IMPORTANCE OF A FOOD LABEL. Ensuring food safety is a shared responsibility between governments, producers, industry and consumers. Food la belling is one way in which consumers can get knowledge about the food they consider buying. Correctly following the information provided on food labels (such as expiry dates, handling instructions and allergy warnings) can help consumers prevent unnecessa ry food -borne illness and allergic reactions. Reading food labels will make it much easier for you to compare foods and find the foods that have the nutritional value your child needs. It will help you and your family make healthy choices about the foods you are buying. Food labels can help you limit the amount of fat, sugar and cholesterol in your diet by making it easy for you to compare one food item with another and choose the one with lower amounts. Conversely, you can use food labels to find food items higher in vitamins, fibre and protein. The nutritional information found on a food label is based on one serving of that particular food. That is one of the most common mistakes people make when reading food labels. A food label may indicate th at a food has 100 calories and only 5 grams of sugar, for example. But if you look at the number of servings, it may state three. That means that if you were to eat the entire package, you would be getting three times the amount shown on the food label. In this example, 300 calories and 15 grams of sugar. Don't be fooled, always look at what makes one serving (which the food label information is based on) and how many servings in that package STANDARD/CERTIFICATION MARK This is a mark given to a product which meets certain standards with respect to the quality of the product in terms of: Material used Method of manufacturing Packing Sale Performance The standard mark indicates that a product has been produced in accordance with the norms laid down by the standardising agency. Standard marks also encourage manufacturers to provide better competition in the market and also upgrade the quality of their products. STANDARD MARKS WITH REFERENCE TO FOOD PRODUCTS A. ISI MARK It is a certification mark given by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). INDIAN STANDARD INSTITUITION (ISI) prescribes standards for product specification, methods of testing, etc. It develops consciousness among manufacturers and encou rages them to produce quality products. It gives the manufacturers licences to use the ISI mark. This is given only after ensuring that the manufacturer is capable of producing the products as per the requirement on the continuous basis. The quality is m aintained right from the raw material through the process to the finished product. This ensures that the finished product is in the conformity to the laid down standards. It also publishes many informative pamphlets and booklets on standards relating to many products. ISI mar is given to - custard powder, common salt, baking powder, cocoa, milk powder, condensed milk, wafers, coffee, ice cream, chewing gum, drinking chocolate, mineral water, etc. B.AGMARK This was set up by Directorate of Mark eting and Inspection of Government of India. It establishes norms for agricultural and livestock product at natural and processed stages. It categorises commodities into various grades depending on the degree of purity. These grades re 1,2,3,4 or extra -large, large, medium, small, etc. These standards also specify the type of packing to be used for different products for example special egg trays, milk polybags, oil bags or cartons. AG MARK is given to: Ghee, butter, oil, wheat flour, rice, powdered suga r, spices, eggs, fruits, etc. B. FPO (FRUIT PRODUCT ORDER) C. It lays minimum standards relating to the quality of various preserved foods made from fruits and vegetables. It lays standard of hygiene and sanitation. It lays minimum standards that must be maintained throughout the farming, manufacturing, processing and retailing of the product. It also gives instructions for packaging, labelling and temperatures of food containers. FPO is given to - pickles, jams, jellies, ketchup, frozen and canned food. NUTRITION LABELLING The food industry contributes to nutrition education by offering products that correspond to the current needs of the consumer and by informing them about product ingredients and nutritional characteristics. Nutrition labelling refer s to the standardised presentation of nutrient content of the food. Generally, the claims fall into some broad categories NUTRITION CLAIMS - They can be categorised as representations which state, suggest or imply that a food has particular nutritional pr operties including energy value, content of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. List of ingredients and mandatory declaration cannot be treated as a nutrition claim. NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIM - This is a nutrition claim that describes the leve l of a nutrient contained in a food for example - low in fat, rich in iron or low sodium. COMPARITIVE CLAIM - It is a claim that compares nutrient levels or energy value of two or more foods. The foods being compared should be different versions of same food or similar food. The difference in nutrient content and energy value should be given. NUTRIENT FUNCTION CLAIM - This is a claim that describes the physiological role of a nutrient in the growth, development and normal function of the body e.g. contains c alcium for stronger teeth. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF NUTRITION LABELLING To make nutrition labelling useful, available and accessible to consumers. At the same time, they should be clear, simple, accurate, practical, readable, informative, consistent a nd legible. The serving size should be realistic. LABELLING PROVISIONS IN EXISTING FOOD LAWS THE FOOD SAFETY AND STANDARDS ACT, 2006 Under this Act every package of food shall carry a label giving the following information: The name, trade name or description of food contained in the package. The name of ingredients used in the product in descending order of their composition by weight or by volume as the case maybe. In case, both colour and flavours are used in the product, the label should me ntion. If gelatin is used as an ingredient, a declaration should be made using the words \"gelatin animal origin\". A label should not contain any statement, claim, design, device, fancy name or abbreviation which is false or misleading in any particular way. The Act also makes it mandatory that labels should not use words implying recommendations by medical profession. The package, label or advertisements of edible oils and fats should not use expressions like 'super etc. COMPULSORY BEST BEFORE DATE Government has made it mandatory with effect from July 1999 that all packed food items should necessarily display BEST BEFORE DATE . It has been made mandatory that every container of milk substitute or infant food shall indicate in a clear conspicuous and easily readable manner an important notice which reads, 'MOTHER'S MILK IS BEST FOR BABIES' in capitals. LABELLING GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS In Indian context in November 2000, the Ministry of Agriculture announced that genetically engineered seeds and food would not be allowed in the country until their safety was scientifically proved. MARKETING THE 'ANIMAL ORIGIN' FOOD From October 2001, it has become mandato ry for all foods containing ingredients of animal origin to sport a brown dot encased in a brown box. As of now, milk and milk products if they are used as an ingredient are exempted from this order. _______________________________________________________ ____________________ CHAPTER 17: HFSS FOODS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS Learning objectives: After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Understand the concerns associated with the consumption of HFSS foods. 2. Highlight the risk facto rs of HFSS foods in children's 3. List the steps to enhance availability of wholesome and nutritious food among children. [WU1] As per \"Dietary Guidelines for Indians, 2011\" by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), a balanced diet is one which provides all nu trients in required amounts and proper proportions. It should provide around 50 -60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from complex carbohydrates, about 10 -15% from proteins and 20 -30% from both visible and invisible fat. In addition, it should provide other non -nutrients such as dietary fibre, antioxidants, which bestow positive health benefits. The guidelines depict the importance of foods through a \"Food Pyramid\" (Figure 17.1). Balanced diet is recommended through a blend of four basi c food groups such as cereals, millets and pulses; vegetables and fruits; oils, fats and nuts; milk and animal foods. Notably, food items such as burgers, pizzas, fries, chocolates, ice creams, jams etc. are not considered the right choice to meet nutrient needs and must be eaten sparingly. Figure 17.1 Food Pyramid HFSS Foods' and ingredients of concern As per WHO Document titled \"Marketing of Foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar to Children - Update 2012 -2013\", foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar are commonly termed as HFSS Foods. Sugar: Sugar is empty calories with no beneficial effect and there is no safe level of its intake. High use of sugar, particularly fructose, is harmful. Studies have established direct relations hip of sugar with obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Salt: Salt is added for preservation and enhancing the taste of food. High salt content in diet is strongly associated with high blood pressure and related cardiovascular diseases. Evidence sugg ests that high salt intake increases mass of left ventricle, stiffens and narrows arteries, including coronary and renal arteries. It increases the probability of stroke, severity of cardiac failure and tendency for platelets to aggregate . As per WHO, cutt ing down on dietary salt intake to recommended 5 g per day has a major impact on reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA): SFAs are widely used in packaged foods including cookies, crackers, and snack chips. When consumed in excess of the recommended (limit less than 10% of total calorie intake), SFAs are known to clog arteries and increase risk of heart attack and stroke. Trans Fatty Acid (TFA): TFAs are formed during the process of hydrogenation of vegetable oils (PHVOs) to make it semi solid that enables longer shelf life, better form and texture. Typically they are found to be high in bakery products and snacks that are deep -fried in PHVOs. TFAs are well known to have an adverse impact on blood lipid levels a s they reduce the amount of good cholesterol (HDL) and increase bad cholesterol (LDL). Their consumption increases insulin resistance and promotes obesity. WHO recommends less than 1% of calories from TFAs. Besides the above key ingredients of concern, c affeine used in carbonated beverages and energy drinks is an addictive stimulant, which, if consumed in excess, can lead to impaired muscle and nerve functions, dehydration and a host of other disorders9. Consumption of caffeine, particularly among school children, is a matter of concern and needs to be strictly regulated in compliance with the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Regulations made there under. Unhealthy diet leads to metabolic changes and conditions such as overweight, high blood pressu re, raised blood glucose and cholesterol, which are among the leading causes of NCD deaths in India. Childhood obesity Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Overweight children are likely to become obe se adults. As per WHO, about 44% of the diabetes burden and 23% of the CVD burden is attributable to overweight and obesity. Overweight children are more likely than non -overweight children to develop insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and car diovascular diseases at a younger age, which in turn are associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability. Studies have established the link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among school children o f Delhi, Amritsar, and Southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post -pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle -income groups. Hypertension In India, hypertension is the leading NCD risk and estimated to be attributable for over 10 per cent of all deaths. Hypertension is strongly associated with h igh Body Mass Index (BMI) and salt intake. As per WHO, the amount of dietary salt consumed is an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk. World Heart Federation says that a universal reduction in dietary intake of abo ut 3 gm. of salt, would lead to a 50% reduction in the number of people needing treatment for hypertension. The same decrease would lead to a 22% drop in the number of deaths resulting from strokes and a 16% fall in the number of deaths from coronary heart disease. Diabetes and pediatric metabolic syndrome Type 2 diabetes which is very common in adults is now increasingly being reported in children. The leading risk factor for kids is being overweight, often connected with an unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the risk factors for type -2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease characterized by abdominal obesity and others such as high blood pressure and increased plasma glucose. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) CHD affects Indians with greater frequency and at a younger age than counter parts HFSS food consumption in India Consumption of 'HFSS Food' is steeply increasing both in urban and rural areas. The ease of availability, taste, low cost, aggressive marketing and advertisements and peer pressure make them popular with children. HFSS food replacing balanced diet is a key issue: As per NIN dietary guidelines \"the shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased intake intensive promotion of HFSS foods and beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary behavior. Irrational preference for energy -dense foods and those with high sugar and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially c hildren. The increasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the resulting burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases necessitate systematic nutrition educational interventions on a massive scale.\" Additionally, a lot is at stake if balanced diet is replaced: A diverse range of macronutrients and micronutrients in its most natural form; Original flavors, colors and aroma that continue to keep the appetite alive for a lifetime; A wide range of time tested spices and herbs that continu e to act at a prophylactic level (preventive) at sub -therapeutic levels. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Several countries have taken steps to enhance availability of wholesome and nutritious food to school children and to restrict/limit availability of HFSS Foods among them. With respect to India, the proposed guidelines are based on following principles: i) Children are not the best judge of their food choice. They have limited understanding on the impact of food on their health. Broadly, they are not aware about the concept of balanced diet and what kind of food is to be consumed and avoided to achieve it. They also lack required know -how on diseases and its relation to diet. While on one hand, they lack awareness and necessary discretion, such products are be ing promoted by manufacturers. They are one of the biggest viewer groups of television and food advertisements constitute a major share of overall TV, radio and print advertisements across the world. ii) Schools are not the right place for promoting HFSS food s. Schools are a place to learn right values and constructive behaviors for a lifetime. Since food consumption at school is significant part of the overall daily diet, schools should not allow the canteens to promote food habits that negatively impact the health of children. iii) Benefits of balanced, fresh and traditional food cannot be replaced. Frequent consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and fats and low in other essential macro and micronutrients is detrimental and should best be avoided. Such eating behaviors may extend beyond schools and become a dietary habit. iv) It is necessary to improve the dietary habits of school children by providing and appropriate mix of foods that enhances the wholesomeness and nutrition and also encourages them avoid consump tion of unhealthy diet. v) Physical activity is another important element of promoting growth and help in reducing the risks and incidence of non "}
