At its core, Temazcal is a purification ritual from a traditional Mesoamerican (mainly Mexico) that aims to release toxins in our bodies. Years later, the Temazcal ceremony is a gift to the world as it has helped many travelers in their spiritual journey and brought wellness to their emotional and physical state. How, you may ask? To give you an idea without many spoilers, the Temazcal ceremony begins as you travel into the hut and sit in darkness which symbolizes a pregnant woman. Inside the womb, you will go through a rebirthing experience with the shaman's guidance. At the center, hot stones release an intense heat of steam when water is poured, which makes you sweat a lot! So, as you spend hours sweating from the heat, you are actually releasing toxins from the body - Now, this is where the Temazcal improves your wellbeing! \"Temazcal Is Steeped In Mexican Heritage\" WELLNESS AND HEALING BENEFITS: CLEANSING THE BODY AND SOUL With years of guiding Temazcal ceremonies, Erick Colibr\u00ed, our shaman friend, explains that the benefits improve our bodies' physical and spiritual state. On the physical aspect, the intense heat makes us sweat profusely and carries out the toxins. Furthermore, shamans apply various herbs such as rosemary and rue to enrich the steam to clean our breath and throat. Also as we inhale the steam from the herbs, it clears the bacterias in our stomach and lungs. On the other hand, the spiritual aspect of Temazcal reflects our intentions. As we travel into our inner spirit and [aim to let go of negative emotions](https://www.digital-nomad-couple.com/mexico/tulum-travel-guide/tulum-retreat/), the ritual allows us to let the feelings within you flow out.
