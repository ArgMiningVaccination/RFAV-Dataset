Subsequently, this information may be used to inform decisions and guide efforts to improve community health and wellness. A Community Health Needs Assessment provides information so that communities may identify issues of greatest concern and decide to commit resources to those areas, thereby making the greatest possible impact on community health status. This assessment was conducted on behalf of Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital as part of a larger project sponsored by the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC) by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). PRC is a natio nally-recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting Community Health Needs Assessments such as this in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. Methodology This assessment incorporates data from both quantit ative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health -related data); these quantitative components allow for comparison to benc hmark data at the state and national levels. Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey of various community stakeholders . PRC Community Health Survey Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for t his study is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to hea lth promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues. The final survey instrument was developed by the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC) and PRC. Community Defined for This Assessment The study area for the survey effort (referred to as the \" Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital Service Area \" in this report, or \"ABH Service Area \") is comprised of 34 residential ZIP Codes based on patient origination . This area definition is illustrated in the following map. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 6 Sample Approach & Design A precise and carefully executed methodology is critical in asserting the validity of the results gathered in the PRC Community Health Survey . Thus, to ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology \u2014 one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews \u2014 was employed. The primary advantages of telephone interview ing are timeliness, efficiency and random -selection capabilities. The sample design used for this effort consisted of a sample of 534 individuals age 18 and older in the Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital Service Area . Because this study is part of a larger e ffort involving multiple regions and hospital service areas, the surveys were distributed among various strata. Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent th e Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital Service Area as a whole. All administration of the surveys, data collection and data analysis was conducted by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). For statistical purposes, the maximum rate of error associated with a sample size of 534 respondents is \u00b1 4.2% at the 95 percent level of confidence. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 7 Sample Characteristics To accurately represent the population studied, PRC strives to minimize bias through application of a proven telephone methodology and random -selection techniques. And, while this random sampling of the population produces a highly representative sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight\" the raw data to improve this representativeness even further. This is accomplished by adjusting the results of a random sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (poststratification), so as to eliminate any naturally occurring bias. The following chart outlines the characteristics of the Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital Service Area sample for key demographic variables, compared to actual population characteristics revealed in census data. [Note that the sample consisted solely of area residents age 18 and older; data on children were give n by proxy by the person most responsible for that child's healthcare needs, and these children are not represented demographically in this chart.] Population & Survey Sample Characteristics (ABH Service Area, 2015) Sources: Census 2010, Summary File 3 (SF 3). US Census Bureau. 2015 PRC Community Health Survey, Professional Research Consultants, to 39 40 to 64 65+ White Hispanic Other Actual Population Weighted Survey Sample Further note that the poverty descriptions and segmentation used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the US Department of Health & Human Services. These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number of persons in the household (e.g., the 2014 guidelines place the poverty threshold for a family of four at $23,850 annual household income or lower ). In sample segmentation: \" low income \" refers to community members living in a household with defined poverty status or living just above the poverty level, earning up to twice the poverty threshold; \" mid/high income \" refers to those households living on incomes which are twice or more the fe deral poverty level. The sample design and the quality control procedures used in the data collection ensure that the sample is representative. Thus, the findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the defined area with a h igh degree of confidence. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 8 Online Key Informant Survey To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey was also implemented as part of this process. A list of r ecommended participants was provided by MCHC member hospitals ; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. P otential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online ; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation . In all, 10 community stakeholders in DuPage and Will counties took part in the Online Key Informant Survey, as outlined below: Online Key Informant Survey Participation Key Informant Type Number Invited Number Participating Community/Business Leader 26 5 Other Health (Non -Physician) 1 0 Physician 1 0 Public Health Expert 11 1 Social Services Representative 20 4 Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below. DuPage County Health Department DuPage Federation on Human Services Reform Elmhurst CUSD 205 Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council Naperville School District 203 People's R esource Center Village of Addison Through this process, input was gathered from several individuals whose organizations work with low-income , minority populations (including African -American, Asian, autistic children, the elderly, Hispanic, Indian, low - income residents, multilingual, non -English speaking ) or other medically underserved populations (including the disabled, elderly, homeless, LGBT community, mentally ill, non -English speaking, undocumented, uninsured/underinsured, youth ). In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow -up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. Results o f their ratings, as well as their verbatim comments, are included throughout this report as they relate to the various other data presented. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 9 NOTE: These findings represent qualitative rather than quantitative data. The Online Key Informant Survey was desig ned to gather input from participants regarding their opinions and perceptions of the health of the residents in the area. Thus, these findings are based on perceptions, not facts. Public Health, Vital Statistics & Other Data A variety of existing (seconda ry) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of this Community Health Needs Assessment. Data were obtained from the following sources (specific citations are included with the graphs throughout this report): Center for Applied Resea rch and Environmental Systems (CARES) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Infectious Disease, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Se rvices, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, National Center for Health Statistics Communit y Commons Connecticut Department of Public Health ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery National Cancer Institute, State Cancer Profiles OpenStreetMap (OSM) US Census Bureau, American Community Survey US Census Bureau, County Business Patterns US Census Bureau, Decennial Census US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service US Department of Health & Human Services US Department of Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Inve stigation US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Note that secondary data indicators reflect county -level data for DuPage and Will counties . Benchmark Data Illinois Risk Factor Data Statewide risk factor data are provided where available as an additional benchmark against which to compare local survey findings; these data are reported in the most recent BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Prevalence and Trend Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and th e US Department of Health & Human Services. State -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 10 Nationwide Risk Factor Data Nationwide risk factor data, which are also provided in comparison charts, are taken from t he 2013 PRC National Health Survey ; the methodological approach for the national study is identical to that employed in this assessment, and these data may be generalized to the US population with a high degree of confidence. National -level vital statistic s are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Healthy People 2020 Healthy People provides science -based, 10 -year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans. The Healthy People initiative is grounded in the principle t hat setting national objectives and monitoring progress can motivate action. For three decades, Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time in order to: Encourage collaborations across sectors. Guide individuals toward mak ing informed health decisions. Measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy People 2020 is the product of an extensive stakeholder feedback process that is unparalleled in government and health. It integrates input from public health and preventi on experts, a wide range of federal, state and local government officials, a consortium of more than 2,000 organizations, and perhaps most importantly, the public. More than 8,000 comments were considered in drafting a comprehensive set of Healthy People 2020 objectives. Determining Significance Differences noted in this report represent those determined to be significant. For survey -derived indicators (which are subject to sampling error), statistical significance is determined based on confidence interv als (at the 95 percent confidence level) using question -specific samples and response rates. For secondary data indicators (which do not carry sampling error, but might be subject to reporting error), \"significance,\" for the purpose of this report, is det ermined by a 5% variation from the comparative measure. Information Gaps While this assessment is quite comprehensive, it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interes t. It must be recognized that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's health needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as the homeless, institutionalized persons, or those who only speak a language other than English or Spanish \u2014 are not represented in the survey data. Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregnant women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender residents, undocumented residents, and members of certain racial/ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be represented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses. In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community. However, there are certainly a great number of medical conditions that are not specifically addressed. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 11 IRS Form 990, Schedule H Compliance For non -profit hospitals, a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) also serves to satisfy certain requirements of tax reporting, pursuant to provisions of the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act of 2010.

Keep in mind: A significant positive or negative shift in total population over time impacts healthcare providers and the utilization of commun ity resources. Urban areas are identified using population density, count, and size thresholds. Urban areas also include territory with a high degree of impervious surface (development). Rural areas are all areas that are not urban. It is important to unde rstand the age distribution of the population as different age groups have unique health needs which should be considered separately from others along the age spectrum.

We know that taking care of ourselves by eating well and staying active, not smoking, getting the recommended immunizations and screening tests, and seeing a doctor when we are sick all influence our health. Our health is also determined in part by access to social and economic opportuniti es; the resources and supports available in our home s, neighborhoods, and communities; the quality of our schooling; the safety of our workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and relationships. The conditions in which we live explain in part why som e Americans are healthier than others and why Americans more generally are not as healthy as they could be.

Experience symptoms of psychological distress. Receive less social -emotional support. Have lower employment rates. There are many social and physical factors that influence the health of people with disabilities. The following three areas f or public health action have been identified, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF ) and the three World Health Organization (WHO) principles of action for addressing health determinants. Improve the conditions o f daily life by: encouraging communities to be accessible so all can live in, move through, and interact with their environment; encouraging community living; and removing barriers in the environment using both physical universal design concepts and opera tional policy shifts. Address the inequitable distribution of resources among people with disabilities and those without disabilities by increasing: appropriate health care for people with disabilities; education and work opportunities; social participatio n; and access to needed technologies and assistive supports. Expand the knowledge base and raise awareness about determinants of health for people with disabilities by increasing: the inclusion of people with disabilities in public health data collection e fforts across the lifespan; the inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion activities; and the expansion of disability and health training opportunities for public health and health care professionals.

Mental health is essential to personal wel l- being, family and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contribute to co mmunity or society. Mental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior that are associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Mental disorders contribute to a host of problems that may i nclude disability, pain, or death. Mental illness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders. Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability. The resulting disease burden of mental illness is among the highes t of all diseases. Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain goo d physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people's ability to participate in health -promoting behaviors. In turn, problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. The existing model for understanding mental health and mental disorders emphasizes the interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors throughout the lifespan. In behavioral health, researchers identify: risk factors , which predispose individuals to mental illness; and protective factors , which protect them from developing mental disorders. Researchers now know that the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders is inherently interdisciplinary and draws on a variety of different strategies. Over the past 20 years, res earch on the prevention of mental disorders has progressed. The major areas of progress include evidence that: MEB disorders are common and begin early in life. The greatest opportunity for prevention is among young people. There are multiyear effects of m ultiple preventive interventions on reducing substance abuse, conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, aggression, and child maltreatment. The incidence of depression among pregnant women and adolescents can be reduced. School -based violence prevention can r educe the base rate of aggressive problems in an average school by 25 to 33%. There are potential indicated preventive interventions for schizophrenia. Improving family functioning and positive parenting can have positive outcomes on mental health and can reduce poverty -related risk. School -based preventive interventions aimed at improving social and emotional outcomes can also improve academic outcomes. Interventions targeting families dealing with adversities, such as parental depression or divorce, can be effective in reducing risk for depression in children and increasing effective parenting. Some preventive interventions have benefits that exceed cost s, with the available evidence strongest for early childhood interventions. Implementation is complex, it is important that interventions be relevant to the target audiences. In addition to advancements in the prevention of mental disorders, there continu es to be steady progress in treating mental disorders as new drugs and stronger evidence -based outcomes become available.

Ours is a high -achieving, data -driven community demanding excellence of all. Adults set the tone. Most are well -educated striving for success in their careers. These parents also measure their own success by how their children perform. Students feel tremendous pressure to \"exceed expectations\" academically and athletically. Many adults have experienced the added stress of job loss since the economic crisis in 2008 and many have struggled with economic insecurity since. This h as created stress and challenged coping skills. It has forced both parents to work to maintain prior standards of living. As costs outpace income, people worry tremendously about how to keep up and get ahead. Children feel all of this. Regardless of ci rcumstances, they are also still expected to compete and perform, to display the right labels on their shoes, bags and phones. Denial and stigma are the biggest mental health challenges. - Community/Business Leader The biggest challenge is facing up to th e issues in our lives that lead to such results as alcohol and drug abuse, domestic abuse and a whole raft of co -dependent behaviors. - Community/Business Leader Lack of Resources Since the decommissioning of services and hospitals an increasing number of the mentally unwell are also the unhoused and unemployed. Few major providers exist for low income folks who have mental health challenges. Barriers exist for those of moderate and upper level income. Schools still cannot meet the need of students and l ocal practitioners are not well versed at screening or referrals for support. - Social Service Representative People who are underinsured or uninsured have a very hard time accessing mental health treatment. - Social Service Representative Stigma Understanding that it is a common need, dealing with the stigma. Being able to navigate the health care system and the health care financing systems to access the right care at the right time.

Together, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing the nation today, accounting for more tha n $500 billion in healthcare expenditures and related expenses in 2010 alone. Fortunately, they are also among the most preventable. The leading modifiable (controllable) risk factors for heart disease and stroke are: High blood pressure High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes Poor diet and physical inactivity Overweight and obesity The risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if major improvements were made across the US population in diet and p hysical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. There are significant dispariti es in the follow ing based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and socioeconomic status: Prevalence of risk factors Access to treatment Appropriate and timely treatment Treatment outcomes Mortality Disease does not occur in isolation, and cardiovascular disease is no exception. Cardiovascular health is significantly influenced by the physical, social, and political environment, including: maternal and child health; access to educational opportunities; availability of healthy foods, physical education, and extracurricular activities in schools; opportunities for physical activity, including access to safe and walkable communities; access to healthy foods; quality of working conditions and worksite health; availability of community support and resources; and access to affordable, quality healthcare.

People who are overweight have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Almost 60% o f adults are overweight or obese. To maintain a proper body weight, experts recommend a well -balanced diet which is low in fat and high in fiber, accompanied by regular exercise. Lack of physical activity . People who are not physically active have twice th e risk for heart disease of those who are active. More than half of adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Tobacco use . Smokers have twice the risk for heart attack of nonsmokers. Nearly one -fifth of all deaths from cardiovascular disease, or about 190,000 deaths a year nationally, are smoking -related. Every day, more than 3,000 young people become daily smokers in the US Modifying these behaviors is critical both for preventing and for controlling cardiovascular disease. Other steps that adults who have cardiovascular disease should take to reduce their risk of death and disability include adhering to treatment for high b lood pressure and cholesterol, using aspirin as appropriate, and learning the symptoms of heart attack and stroke.

The elderly population will more than double by the year 2050, with most of that growth occur ring between 2010 and 2030. It only stands to reason that health problems, such as heart disease and stroke, will increase. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 65 Cancer About Cancer Continued advances in cancer research, detection, and treatment have resulted in a decline in both incidence and death rates for all cancers. Among people who develop cancer, more than half will be alive in five years. Yet, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. Many cancers are p reventable by reducing risk factors such as: use of tobacco products; physical inactivity and poor nutrition; obesity; and ultraviolet light exposure. Other cancers can be prevented by getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. In the past decade, overweight and obesity have emerged as new risk factors for developing certain cancers, including colorectal, breast, uterine corpus (endometrial), and kidney cancers. The impact of the current weight tre nds on cancer incidence will n ot be fully known for several decades. Continued focus on preventing weight gain will lead to lower rates of cancer and many chronic diseases. Screening is effective in identifying some types of cancers (see US Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] recom mendations), including: Breast cancer (using mammography) Cervical cancer (using Pap tests) Colorectal cancer (using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Age-Adjusted Cancer Deaths Among the leading causes of cancer deaths are l ung cancer , prostate cancer among men, breast cancer among women, and colorectal cancer (both genders).

Area MCHC Region IL US Cancer Risk About Cancer Risk Reducing the nation's cancer burden requires reducing the prevalence of behavioral and environmental factors th at increase cancer risk. All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. At least one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States are due to cigarette smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, about one -third of cancer dea ths that occur in the United States each year are due to nutrition and physical activity factors, including obesity. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 68 Cancer Screenings The American Cancer Society recommends that both men and women get a cancer -related checkup during a regular doctor's checkup. It should include examination for cancers of the thyroid, testicles, ovaries, lymph nodes, oral cavity, and skin, as well as health c ounseling about tobacco, sun exposure, diet and nutrition, risk factors, sexual practices, and environmental and occupational exposures. Screening levels in the community were measured in the PRC Community Health Survey relative to : prostate cancer (PSA an d/or digital rectal examination); female breast cancer (mammography); cervical cancer (Pap smear testing); and colorectal cancer (sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing). Female Breast Cancer Screening About Screening for Breast Cancer The US Prevent ive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1 -2 years for women age 40 and older. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12 -33 months signi ficantly reduces mortality from breast cancer. Evidence is strongest for women age 50 -69, the age group generally included in screening trials. For women age 40 -49, the evidence that screening mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammography is smaller, than it is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortality benef it for women undergoing mammography at ages 40 -49, but the delay in observed benefit in women younger than 50 makes it difficu lt to determine the incremental benefit of beginning screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. The absolute benefit is smaller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among women in their 40s than it is among older women. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizable to women age 70 and older (who face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by comorbid disease. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increase along a continuum with age, whereas the likelihood of harms from screening (false - positive results and unnecessary anxiety, biopsies, and cost) diminish from ages 40 -70. The balance of benefits and potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age. The precise age at which the potential benefits of mammography justify the possible harms is a subjective choice. The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to specify the optimal screeni ng interval for women age 40 -49. US Preventive Services Task Force, Age ncy for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Phys icians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 69 Cervical Cancer Screenings About Screening for Cervical Cancer The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends screening for cervical cancer in women who have been sexually active and have a cervix. Rationale: The USPSTF found good evidence from multiple observational studies that screening with ce rvical cytology (Pap smears) reduces incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. Direct evidence to determine the optimal starting and stopping age and interval for screening is limited. Indirect evidence suggests most of the benefit can be obtained b y beginning screening within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age 21 (whichever comes first) and screening at least every 3 years. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening substantially outweigh potential harms. The USPSTF recommends again st routinely screening women older than age 65 for cervical cancer if they have had adequate recent screening with normal Pap smears and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. Rationale: The USPSTF found limited evidence to determine the bene fits of continued screening in women older than 65. The yield of screening is low in previously screened women older than 65 due to the declining incidence of high -grade cervical lesions after middle age. There is fair evidence that screening women older t han 65 is associated with an increased risk for potential harms, including false -positive results and invasive procedures. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening are likely to exceed benefits among older women who have had normal result s previously and who are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. The USPSTF recommends against routine Pap smear screening in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that the yield of c ytologic screening is very low in women after hysterectomy and poor evidence that screening to detect vaginal cancer improves health outcomes. The USPSTF concludes that potential harms of continued screening after hysterectomy are likely to exceed benefits . US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Phys icians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines. Colorectal Cancer Screenings About Screening for Colorectal Cancer The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscop y detects early -stage cancer and adenomatous po lyps. There is convincing evidence that screening with any of the three recommended tests (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) reduces colorectal cancer mortality in adults age 50 to 75 years. Follow -up of positive screening test results requires colonosco py regardless of the screening test used. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Phys icians, American College of Physicians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines.

Specific methods of detection, intervention, and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of th e airways characterized by episodes of reversible breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Daily preventive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have asthma to lead active lives. COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow l imitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarette smoke). Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD. The burden of respiratory diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, and states. Because of the cost to the healthcare system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid fo r with higher health insurance rates, lost productivity, and tax dollars. Annual healthcare expenditures for asthma alone are estimate d at $20.7 billion. Asthma . The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since t he mid - 1990s. The causes of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include: Having a parent with asthma Sensitization to irritants and allergens Respira tory infections in childhood Overweight Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, in particular for low -income and minority populations. Populations with higher rates of ast hma include: children; women (among adults) and boys (among children); African Americans; Puerto Ricans; people living in the Northeast United States; people living below the Federal poverty level; and employees with certain exposures in the workplace. While there is not a cure for asthma yet, there are diagnoses and treatment guidelines that are aimed at ensuring that all people with asthma live full and active lives.

B oth unintentional injuries and those caused by acts of violence are among the top 15 killers for Americans of all ages. Many people accept them as \"accidents,\" \"acts of fate,\" or as \"part of life.\" Howev er, most events resulting in injury, disability, or d eath are predictable and preventable. Injuries are the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 to 44, and a leading cause of disability for all ages, regardles s of sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. More than 180,000 people die from injurie s each year, and approximately 1 in 10 sustains a nonfatal injury serious enough to be treated in a hospital emergency department. Beyond their immediate health consequences, injuries and violence have a significant impact on the well -being of Americans by contributing to: Premature death Disability Poor mental health High medical costs Lost productivity The effects of injuries and violence extend beyond the injured person or victim of violence to family members, friends, coworkers, employers, and communit ies. Numerous factors can affect the risk of unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors, physical environme nt, access to health services (ranging from pre -hospital and acute care to rehabilitation), and social environment (from pare ntal monitoring and supervision of youth to peer group associations, neighborhoods, and communities). Interventions addressing these social and physical factors have the potential to prevent unintentional injuries and violence. Efforts to prevent unintenti onal injury may focus on: Modifications of the environment Improvements in product safety Legislation and enforcement Education and behavior change Technology and engineering Efforts to prevent violence may focus on: Changing social norms about the acceptability of violence Improving problem -solving skills (for example, parenting, conflict resolution, coping) Changing policies to address the social and economic conditions that often give rise to violence Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 79 Leading Causes of Accidental Death Leading causes of accidental death in the area include the following: Leading Causes of Accidental Death (DuPage/Will Counties, 2013) Sources: CDC WONDER Online Query System.

Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to absorb and use glucose (sugar) as fuel for the body's cells. Without a properly functioning insulin signaling system , blood glucose levels become elevated and other metabolic abnormalities occur, leading to the development of serious, disabling complications. Many forms of diabetes exist; the three common types are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. Effective therapy can prevent or delay diabetic complications. Diabetes mellitus: Lowers life expectancy by up to 15 years. Increases the risk of heart disease by 2 to 4 times. Is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult -onset blindness. The rate of diabetes mellitus continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady rise in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus, and possibly earlier onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is growing concer n about the possibility that the increase in the number of persons with diabet es mellitus and the complexity of their care might overwhelm existing healthcare systems. People from minority populations are more frequently affected by type 2 diabetes. Minority groups constitute 25% of all adult patients with diabetes in the US and rep resent the majority of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle change has been proven effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high -risk individuals.

Dementia is not a disease itself, but rather a set of symptoms. Memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, although memory loss by itself does not mean a person has dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of all diagnosed cases. Alzheimer's disease is the 6 th leading cause of death among adults age 18 ye ars and older. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that up to 5.1 million Americans age 65 years and older have Alzheimer's disease. These numbers are predicted to more than double by 2050 unless more effective ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease are found.

They are responsible for premature death and exact a high economic price from both the private and public sectors. Nearly 25% of the Medicare budget is used to treat people with chronic kidney disease and end -stage renal disease. Genetic determ inants have a large influence on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. It is not possible to alter a person's biology and genetic determinants; however, environmental influences and individual behaviors also have a significant influenc e on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. As a result, some populations are disproportionately affected. Successful behavior modification is expected to have a positive influence on the disease. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) funded by the national Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) show that moderate exercise, a healthier diet, and weight reduction can prevent development of type 2 diabetes in persons at risk.

Arthritis commonly occurs with other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Interventions to treat the pain and r educe the functional limitations from arthritis are important, and may also enable people with these other chronic conditions to be more physically active. Arthritis affects 1 in 5 adults and continues to be the most common cause of disability. It costs more than $128 billion per year. All of the human and economic costs are projected to increase over time as the population ages. There are interventions that can reduce arthritis pain and functional limitations, but they remain underused. These include: increased physical activity; self -management education; and weight loss among overweight/obese adults. Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength leading to an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). In the United States, an estimated 5 .3 million people age 50 years and older have osteoporosis. Most of these people are women, but about 0.8 million are men. Just over 34 million more people, including 12 million men, have low bone mass, which puts them at increased risk for developing oste oporosis. Half of all women and as many as 1 in 4 men age 50 years and older will have an osteoporosis -related fracture in their lifetime. Chronic back pain is common, costly, and potentially disabling. About 80% of Americans experience low back pain in their lifetime. It is estimated that each year: 15%-20% of the population develop protracted back pain. 2-8% have chronic back pain (pain that lasts more than 3 months). 3-4% of the population is temporarily disabled due to back pain. 1% of the working -age population is disabled completely and permanently as a result of low back pain. Americans spend at least $50 billion each year on low back pain. Low back pain is the: 2nd leading cause of lost work time (after the common cold). 3rd most common reason to u ndergo a surgical procedure. 5th most frequent cause of hospitalization.

Yet millions of Americans live with visual impairment, and many more remain at risk for eye disease and preventable eye injury. The eyes are an important, but often overlooked, part of overall health. Despite the preven table nature of some vision impairments, many people do not receive recommended screenings and exams. A visit to an eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated eye exam can help to detect common vision problems and eye diseases, including diabetic re tinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, and age -related macular degeneration. These common vision problems often have no early warning signs. If a problem is detected, an eye care professional can prescribe corrective eyewear, medicine, or surgery to minimize visio n loss and help a person see his or her best. Healthy vision can help to ensure a healthy and active lifestyle well into a person's later years. Educating and engaging families, communities, and the nation is critical to ensuring that people have the infor mation, resources, and tools needed for good eye health. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Hearing Trouble About Hearing & Other Sensory or Communication Disorders An impaired ability to communicate with others or maintain good balance can lead many people to feel socially isolated, have unmet health needs, have limited success in school or on the job. Communication and other sensory processes contribute to our overa ll health and well -being. Protecting these processes is critical, particularly for people whose age, race, ethnicity, gender, occupation, genetic background, or health status places them at increased risk. Many factors influence the numbers of Americans w ho are diagnosed and treated for hearing and other sensory or communication disorders, such a social determinants (social and economic standings, age of diagnosis, cost and stigma of wearing a hearing aid, and unhealthy lifestyle choices). In addition, bi ological causes of hearing loss and other sensory or communication disorders include: genetics; viral or bacterial infections; sensitivity to certain drugs or medications; injury ; and aging. As the nation's population ages and survival rates for medically fragile infants and for people with severe injuries and acquired diseases improve, the prevalence of sensory and communication disorders is expected to rise.

However, infectious diseases remain a major cause of illness, disability, and death. Immuni zation recommendations in the United States currently target 17 vaccine - preventable diseases across the lifespan. People in the US continue to get diseases that are vaccine -preventable. Viral hepatitis, influenza, and tuberculosis (TB) remain among the le ading causes of illness and death across the nation and account for substantial spending on the related consequences of infection. The infectious disease public health infrastructure, which carries out disease surveillance at the national, state, and loca l levels, is an essential tool in the fight against newly emerging and re -emerging infectious diseases. Other important defenses against infectious diseases include: Proper use of vaccines Antibiotics Screening and testing guidelines Scientific improvement s in the diagnosis of infectious disease -related health concerns Vaccines are among the most cost -effective clinical preventive services and are a core component of any preventive services package. Childhood immunization programs provide a very high return on investment. For example, for each birth cohort vaccinated with the routine immunization schedule, society: Saves 33,000 lives. Prevents 14 million cases of disease. Reduces direct healthcare costs by $9.9 billion. Saves $33.4 billion in indirect costs .

In the era of increasingly effective treatments for HIV, people wit h HIV are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Deaths from HIV infection have greatly declined in the United States since the 1990s. As the number of people living with HIV grows, it will be more important than ever to increase national HIV prevention and healthcare programs. There are gender, race, and ethnicity disparities in new HIV infections: Nearly 75% of new HIV infections occur in men. More than half occur in gay and bisexual men, regardless of race or ethnicity. 45% of new HIV infe ctions occur in African Americans, 35% in whites, and 17% in Hispanics. Improving access to quality healthcare for populations disproportionately affected by HIV, such as persons of color and gay and bisexual men, is a fundamental public health strategy fo r HIV prevention. People getting care for HIV can receive: Antiretroviral therapy Screening and treatment for other diseases (such as sexually transmitted infections) HIV prevention interventions Mental health services Other health services As the number of people living with HIV increases and more people become aware of their HIV status, prevention strategies that are targeted specifically for HIV -infected people are becoming more important. Prevention work with people living with HIV focuse s on: Linking to and staying in treatment. Increasing the availability of ongoing HIV prevention interventions. Providing prevention services for their partners. Public perception in the US about the seriousness of the HIV epidemic has declined in recent years. There is evidence that risky behaviors may be increasing among uninfected people, especially gay and bisexual men. Ongoing media and social campaigns for the general public and HIV prevention interventions for uninfected persons who engage in risky behaviors are critical.

Despite their burdens, costs, and complications, and the fact that they are largely preventable, STDs remain a significant public health problem in the United States. This problem is largely unrecognized by the public, polic ymakers, and health care professionals. STDs cause many harmful, often irreversible, and costly clinical complications, such as: reproductive health problems; fetal and perinat al health problems; cancer; and facilitation of the sexual transmission of HIV i nfection. Because many cases of STDs go undiagnosed \u2014and some common viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital herpes, are not reported to CDC at all \u2014the reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis represent only a fraction o f the true burden of STDs in the US. Untreated STDs can lead to serious long -term health consequences, especially for adolescent girls and young women. Several factors contribute to the spread of STDs. Biological Factors. STDs are acquired during unprot ected sex with an infected partner. Biological factors that affect the spread of STDs include: Asymptomatic nature of STDs . The majority of STDs either do not produce any symptoms or signs, or they produce symptoms so mild that they are unnoticed; consequ ently, many infected persons do not know that they need medical care. Gender disparities . Women suffer more frequent and more serious STD complications than men do. Among the most serious STD complications are pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterus), infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Age disparities . Compared to older adults, sexually active adolescents ages 15 to 19 and young adults ages 20 to 24 are at higher risk for getting STDs. Lag time between infection and complications . Often, a long interval, sometimes years, occurs between acquiring an STD and recognizing a clinically significant health problem. Social, Economic and Behavioral Factors. The spread of STDs is directly affected by social, economic, and behavioral factors. Such factors may cause serious obstacles to STD prevention due to their influence on social and sexual networks, access to and provision of care, willingness to seek care, and social norms regarding sex and sexuality. Among certain vulnerable populations, historical experience with segregation and discrimination exacerbates these factors. Social, economic, and behavioral factors that affect the spread of STDs include: racial and ethnic disparities; poverty and marginalization; access to healthcare; substance abuse; sexuality and secrecy (stigma and discomfort discussing sex); and sexual networks (persons \"linked\" by sequential or concurrent sexual partners ). Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Chlamydia. Chlamydia is the most commonly re ported STD in the United States; m ost people who have chlamydia don't know it since the disease often has no symptoms. Gonorrhea.

Their well -being determines the health of the next generation and can help predict future public health challenges for families, communities, and the healthcare system. The risk of maternal and infant mortality and pregnancy -related complications can be reduced by increasing access to quality preconception (before pregnancy) and inter -conception (between pregnancies) care. Moreover , healthy birth outcomes and early identification and treatment of health conditions among infants can prevent death or disabil ity and enable children to reach their full potential. Many factors can affect pregnancy and childbirth, including pre -conception health status, age, access to appropriate healthcare, and poverty. Infant and child health are similarly influenced by socio -demographic factors, such as family income, but are also linked to the physical and mental health of parents and caregivers. Ther e are racial and ethnic disparities in mortality and morbidity for mothers and children, particularly for African Americans. These differences are likely the result of many factors, including social determinants (such as racial and ethnic disparities in in fant mortality; family income; educational attainment among household members; and health insurance coverage) and physical determinants (i.e., the health, nutrition, and behaviors of the mother during pregnancy and early childhood).

This stu dy found that behavior patterns represent the single -most prominent domain of influence over health prospects in the United States. The daily choices we make with respect to diet, physical activity, and sex; the substance abuse and addictions to which we f all prey; our approach to safety; and our coping strategies in confronting stress are all important determinants of health. The most prominent contributors to mortality in the United States in 2000 were tobacco (an estimated 435,000 deaths), diet and activity patterns (400,000), alcohol (85,000), microbial agents (75,000), toxic agents (55,000), motor vehicles (43,000), firearms (29,000), sexual behavior (20,000), and illicit use of drugs (17,000). Socioeconomic status and access to medical care are al so important contributors, but difficult to quantify independent of the other factors cited. Because the studies reviewed used different approaches to derive estimates, the stated numbers should be viewed as first approximations. These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating healthcare costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive orientation in the US healthcare and public health systems has become more urgent.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 119 Nutrition , Physical Activity & Weight Nutrition About Health ful Diet & Healthy Weight Strong science exists supporting the health benefits of eating a healthful diet and maintaining a healthy body weight. Efforts to change diet and weight should address individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such a s schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, and communities. The goal of promoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger. Americans with a healthful diet: Consume a variety of nutrient -dense foods within and across the food groups, especially whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low -fat or fat -free milk or milk products, and lean meats and other protein sources. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium (salt), and alcohol. Limit caloric intake to meet caloric needs. Diet and body weight are related to health status. Good nutrition is important to the growth and development of children. A healthful diet also helps Americans reduce their risks for many h ealth conditions, including: overweight and obesity; diverticular disease; and some can cers. Diet reflects the variety of foods and beverages consumed over time and in settings such as worksites, schools, restaurants, and the home. Interventions to support a healthier diet can help ensure that: Individuals have the knowledge and skills to ma ke healthier choices. Healthier options are available and affordable. Social Determinants of Diet. Demographic characteristics of those with a more healthful diet vary with the nutrient or food studied. However, most Americans need to improve some aspect of their diet. Social factors thought to influence diet include: Knowledge and attitudes Skills Social support Societal and cultural norms Food and agricultural policies Food assistance programs Economic price systems Physical Determinants of Diet. Acce ss to and availability of healthier foods can help people follow healthful diets. For example, better access to retail venues that sell healthier options may have a positive impact on a person's diet; these venu es may be less available in low -income or rur al neighborhoods. The places where people eat appear to influence their diet. For example, foods eaten away from home often have more calories and are of lower nutritional quality than foods prepared at home. Marketing also influences people's \u2014particular ly children's \u2014food choices.

Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: early death; coronary heart disease; stroke; high blood 2 diabetes; b reast and colon cancer; falls; and depression. Among children and adolescents, physical activity can: improve bone health; improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness; decrease levels of body fat; and reduce symptoms of depression. For people who are inactive, even small increases in physical activity are associated with health benefits. Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physical activity levels among youth, adults, and ol der adults. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity is important to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to improve levels of physical activity. Factors positively associated with adult physical activity include: postsecondary education; higher in come; enjoyment of exercise; expectation of benefits; belief in ability to exercise (self -efficacy); history of activity in adulthood; social support from peers, family, or spouse; access to and satisfaction with facilities; enjoyable scenery; and safe nei ghborhoods. Factors negatively associated with adult physical activity include: advancing age; low income; lack of time; low motivation; rural residency; perception of great effort needed for exercise; overweight or obesity; perception of poor health; and being disabled. Older adults may have additional factors that keep them from being physically active, including lack of social sup port, lack of transportation to facilities, fear of injury, and cost of programs. Among children ages 4 to 12, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: gender (boys) ; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and parental support . Among adolescents ages 13 to 18, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: par ental education ; gender (boys) ; personal goals ; physical education/school sports ; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and support of friends and family. Environmental influences positively associated with physical activity among children and ad olescents include: Presence of sidewalks Having a destination/walking to a particular place Access to public transportation Low traffic density Access to neighborhood or school play area and/or recreational equipment People with disabilities may be less likely to participate in physical activity due to physical, emotional, and psychological barriers. Barriers may include the inaccessibility of facilities and the lack of staff trained in working with people with di sabilities.

They can help change individuals' knowledge and skills, reduce exposure to foods low in nutritional v alue and high in calories, or increase opportunities for physical activity. Interventions can help prevent unhealthy weight gain or facilitate weight loss among obese people. They can be delivered in multiple settings, including healthcare settings, worksi tes, or schools. The social and physical factors affecting diet and physical activity (see Physical Activity topic area) may also have an impa ct on weight. Obesity is a problem throughout the population. However, among adults, the prevalence is highest fo r middle -aged people and for non -Hispanic black and Mexican American women. Among children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity is highest among older and Mexican American children and non -Hispanic black girls. The association of income with obesity varies by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Body Mass Index (BMI), which describes relative weight for height, is significantly correlated with total body fat content. T he BMI should be used to assess overweight and obesity and to monitor changes in body weight. In addition, measurements of body weight alone can be used to determine efficacy of weight loss therapy. BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2). To estimate BMI using pounds and inches, use: [weight (pounds)/height squared (inches2)] x 703. In this report, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. The rationale behind these definitions is based on epidemiological data that show increases in mortalit y with BMIs above 25 kg/m2. The increase in mortality, however, tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is reached. For persons with a BMI 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially from cardiovascular disease, are generally increased by 50 to 100 percent above that of persons with BMIs in the range of 20 to 25 kg/m2.

With working parents, meals are what is quick and e asy and carryout rather than quick, easy and healthy. - Community/Business Leader Need for nutritionally dense, active lifestyles in order to promote healthy weight for all residents. In addition, there is significant disparity within the county borders r elated to socioeconomic status. - Public Health Expert Infrastructure Our nation is headed in the wrong direction with regards to fitness, activity and nutrition. Look at any local parade, the kids are heavier than 15 years ago. Look at any local epidemi ological measure, kids and adults are heavier. We live in an area that was built on a suburban model that discourages walking. Nutritional choices are weighted against people in general, more so for those with low income as fresh and healthy foods are mo re expensive than processed. - Social Service Representative Contributing Factors Our eating habits continue to drive this issue. The quality of our food is also an issue, although more and more people and companies are climbing on the organic and non -GMO band wagon. Digital addictions plague our youth, who would rather play video games than play outside. Accessibility to indoor space where seniors can walk in safety for free is another important component. - Community/Business Leader Obesity Obesity is an epidemic in the US. - Social Service Representative COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 136 Substance Abuse About Substance Abuse Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, families, and communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costl y social, physical, mental, and public health problems. These problems include: Teenage pregnancy Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Domestic violence Child abuse Motor vehicle crashes Physical fights Crime Homicide Suicide Substance abuse refers to a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior -altering substances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Social attitudes and p olitical and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make substance abuse one of the most complex public health issues. In addition to th e considerable health implications, substance abuse has been a flash -point in the criminal just ice system and a major focal point in discussions about social values: people argue over whether substance abuse is a disease with genetic and biological foundations or a matter of personal choice. Advances in research have led to the development of evide nce-based strategies to effectively address substance abuse. Improvements in brain -imaging technologies and the development of medications that assist in treatment have gradually shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. There is now a deeper understanding of substance abuse as a disorder that develops in adolescence and, for some individuals, will develop into a chronic illness that will require l ifelong monitoring and care. Improved evaluation of community -level prevention has enhan ced researchers' understanding of environmental and social factors that contribute to the initiation and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, leading to a more sophisticated understandi ng of how to implement evidence -based strategies in specific social and cultural settings. A stronger emphasis on evaluation has expanded evidence -based practices for drug and alcohol treatment. Improvements have focused on the development of better clinical interventions through research and increasing the skills and qualific ations of treatment providers.

Scientific knowledge about the health effects of tobacco use has increased greatly since the first Surgeon General's report on tobacco was released in 1964. Tobacc o use causes: Cancer Heart disease Lung diseases (including emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction) Premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and infant death There is no risk -free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smo ke causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: severe asthma attacks; respiratory infections; ear infections; and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smokeless tobacco causes a number of serious oral health problems, including cancer of the mouth and gums, periodontitis, and tooth loss. Cigar use causes cancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus, and lung.

People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of disease and premature death. Benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, but quitting tobacco use is beneficial at any age. Many factors influence tobacco use , disease, and mortality. Risk factors include race/ethnicity, age, education, and socioeconomic status. Significant disparities in tobacco use exist geographically; such disparities typically result from differences among states in smoke -free protections, tobacco prices, and program funding for tobacco prevention.

It impacts: overall physical, social, and mental health status; prevention of disease and disability; detection and treatment of health conditions; quality of life; preventable death; and life expectancy. Access to health services means the time ly use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes. It requires three distinct steps: 1) Gaining entry into the health care system; 2) Accessing a health care location where needed service s are provided; and 3) Finding a health care p rovider with whom the patient can communicate and trust.

People with a usual source of care have better health outcomes and fewer disparities and costs. Having a primary care provide r (PCP) as the usual source of care is especially important. PCPs can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with patients and provide integrated services while practicing in the context of family and community. Having a usual PCP is associated wit h: Greater patient trust in the provider Good patient -provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care Improving health care services includes increasing access to and use of evidence -based preventive services. Clinical preventive services are services that: prevent illness by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into a disease (pri mary prevention); or detect a disease at an earlier, and often more treatable, stage (secondary prevention).

Good oral health improves a person's ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch , chew, swallow, and make facial expressions to show feelings and emotions. However, oral diseases, from cavities to oral cancer, cause pain and disability for many Americans. Good self -care, such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing, and professional treatment, is key to good oral health. Health behaviors that can lead to poor oral health include: tobacco use; excessi ve alcohol use; and poor dietary choices . The significant improvement in the oral health of Americans over the past 50 years is a public health success story. Most of the gains are a result of effective prevention and treatment efforts. One major success is community water fluoridation, which now benefits about 7 out of 10 Americans who get water through public water systems. However, some Americans do not have access to preventive programs. People who have the least access to preventive services and denta l treatment have greater rates of oral diseases. A person's ability to access oral healthcare is associated with factors such as education level, inco me, race, and ethnicity. Barriers that can limit a person's use of preventive interventions and treatment s include: limited access to and availability of dental services; lack of awareness of the need for care; cost; and fear of dental procedures. There are also social determinants that affect oral health. In general, people with lower levels of education an d income, and people from specific racial/ethnic groups, have higher rates of disease. People with disabilities and other health conditions , like diabetes, are more likely to have poor oral health. Potential strategies to address these issues include: Implementing and evaluating activities that have an impact on health behavior. Promoting interventions to reduce tooth decay, such as dental sealants and fluoride use. Evaluating and improving methods of monitoring oral diseases and conditions. Increasing the capacity of State dental health programs to provide preventive oral health services. Increasing the number of community health centers with an oral health component.
