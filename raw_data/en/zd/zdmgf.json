EuropeCopenhagen TO THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCESINFORMATION CENTER(ERIC) The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations with primary responsibility forinternational health matters and public health. Through this Organization, which was created in 1948, the health professions of over 180 countries exchange their knowledge and experience with the aim of making possible theattainment by all citizens of the world of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life.The WHO Regional Office for Europe is one of six regional offices throughout the world, each with its own programme geared to the particular health problems of the countries it serves. The European Region embraces some 850 million people living in an area stretching from Greenland in the north and the Mediterranean in the south to the Pacific shores of Russia. The European programme of WHO therefore concentrates both on the problems associated with industrial and post-industrial society and on those faced by the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In its strategy for attaining the goal of health for all the Regional Office is arranging its activities in three main areas:lifestyles conducive to health, a healthy environment, and appropriate services for prevention, treatment and care.The European Region is characterized by the large number of languages spoken by its peoples, and the resulting difficulties in disseminating information to all who may need it. Applications for rights of translation of Regional Office books are therefore most welcome.

That agreement did not come lightly.The whole idea that countries as different as thosein the European Region would he able to agree ona common policy was met with disbelief by many.That politicians should stick their necks out, byclearly defining what levels of improvement theywould try to reach within a given time, was abhor-rent to those who felt that caution should always beparamount. After all, what would happen if atarget was not reached wouldn' t someone be heldaccountable? With all the uncertainties of the fu-ture, how could anyone dare to estimate the targetlevels to aim for? Nevertheless, as debate raged throughout the Re-gion over the first draft of the targets sent tocountries in 1983, the idea started to catch on. Thedraft was modified in the light of comments fromMember States, and the second version was pre-sented to the thirty-fourth session of the WHORegional Committee for Europe in September 1984 .Consensus had been created and the Europeanhealth for all policy with its 38 targets was born.What would follow? Would the voluminous docu-ment merely gather dust on a shelf, as so manyother international agreements had done? Today, nearly a decade later, we know that whatbegan as a theoretical document on the agenda ofthe Regional Committee in 1984 has grown into aRegion-wide inovement that reaches into parlia-ments, government departments, city halls, themeetings of medical associations, the agendas ofnursing associations, debates in pharmaceuticalassociations, development plans for schools ofpublic health, the discussions of hospital adminis-trators, the action plans of national diabetes associ-ations, the research agendas of medical schools,the assistance programmes of intergovernmentalorganizations and elsewhere. Most important, lo-cal action deriving from the health for all policyhas started directly to influence the lives of asteadily increasing portion of the 850 million peo-ple in the European Region. The European health ix 1 1 xHealth for all targets for all policy and targets have become a powerfulpublic health movement in the Region.Why is this so? Health for all was not imposed bylaws and regulations, nor did it lure countries,institutions or groups with financial incentives. Itsucceeded simply because its ideas proved to besensible,practical and, above all, capable of inspir-ing people to think afresh, to take new initiativesand to work together in new ways, The policy' sbroad health agenda covers lifestyles, the environ-ment and health services, addressing all levels ofsociety and reaching out to all partners and sec-tors that can influence health. The health for allpolicy indicates very practical ways of stimulatingbetter health development in the democratic , plural-istic societies of the Region today. Thus, it offersnot only a vision of where to go for better healthand quality of life hut also a map showing how toget there. The policy used target setting at theinternationc! national and local levels to com-municate complex health goals to a wide range ofgroups and partners in countries, and establisheda system for monitoring progress towards the tar-gets using specific indicators and a thorough evalu-ation at set intervals. Through these means, thehealth for all policy brought a new philosophy tothe health development process in the countries ofthe Region. This open accountability forces coun-tries, institutions and groups to measure the im-pact of political and administrative decisions onthe health of the people, or on the performance ofthe systems that carry out interventions. A cycle was established: target setting, implemen-tation, monitoring, evaluation and the reformulationof targets and approaches. In this cycle, work forhealth for all becomes a continuous, natural learn-ing process that ensures that people learn systemati-cally from their successes andfailures and throughthe international comparison permitted by WHOdate Jases from those of others.And we need to learn! Although a Region-wideevaluation in 1991 showed that our progress isencouraging, the problems ahead are formidable.The most dramatic are the challenges facing thecountries of the central and eastern part of theRegion, not least a shortage of basic drugs andsupplies. These countries' problems with healthand health care do not differ in nature from thoseof the rest of the Region, but in degree and relativeimportance. All Member States must therefore takea similar approach to solving their problems. Some 20 of the original 32 countries that made theEuropean health for all policy in 1984 have used itas the framework for their own national health forall policies. Now the new democratic countries ofthe central and eastern part of the Region need todo the same. No other measure will help them somuch to create a cohesive framework for develop-ment and to exploit all the resources for health thatthey must now muster in their present criticalsituation.Problems are not confined to one part of the Re-gion, however; all countries face a formidablechallenge in helping their citizens choose healthierlifestyles, in improving the organization of theirhealth services, in helping health professionalssystematically to improve the quality of their careand in mobilizing societies to create healthierenvironments. Healthy environments mean not onlyfreedom from the risks posed by pollution but alsothe creation of homes, neighbourhoods and citiesthat are safe and that promote health in a variety ofways, including the stimulation of personal inter-action and support networks involving individuals,groups and communities. 12 Forewordxi Since the birth of the European movement forhealth for all, we have learned much from theaction taken at all levels. There have been suc-cesses and failures; ideas have sprung up and newstrategies been conceived and tested. Substantialprogress has been made and many countries havealready achieved a number of the European targetsthat were set for the year 2000. Thus, the time came to take the European targets amajor step forward, drawing on all our recent ex-perience to formulate new levels or directions ofachievement. The secretariat of the WHO RegionalOffice for Europe undertook the major task of revis-ing the targets, with the help of hundreds of expertsand the active and vital feedback of the MemberStates of the Region. This process reached its culmi-nation at the forty-first session of the RegionalCommittee in Lisbon in 1991, at which the MemberStates updated the 1984 targets, retaining theirframework and direction but adding the new ele-ments, the new ideas and the new priorities that theRegion now requires.On behalf of the Regional Office, 1 extend warmthanks to all the countries, institutions and individu-als who have participated in this task. The work hasbeen carried out with an impressive degree of unity, awillingness to try new ideas from many sources and anability to combine all the elements into a new whole. The first book on the European targets was a bestseller, translated into 19 languages and issued inmany thousands of copies throughout the Region.May this version reach even further out and serveas an inspiration for many new initiatives through-out our continentmaking today' s reality into thetomorrow of our dreams! 13J.E. AsvallWHO Regional Director for Europe The broad perspective The European policy and targets for health for allunite the 850 million people in t Member Statesthat constitute the European Region of WHO. This isan area whose borders are marked by the westernshores of Greenland, the Mediterranean, and thePacific shores of the Russian Federation. This booksets out the improvements in health that are soughtby the year 2000, and describes the strategies forachieving them through healthier lifestyles, improve-ments in the environment and the provision of highquality services for prevention, treatment and care.The desired improvement in health status and thefactors that contribute to it are expressed as targets,some of which are quantified. The targets are in-tended to fuel the debate on health policies andtheir implementation in Member States. While notlegally binding on any country, they express acollective commitment by Member States and pro-vide help in setting targets that reflect the needs,priorities and values of different countries.The new and revised targets incorporated in thisbook reflect changes that have taken place in theEuropean Region since 1984 and a more up-to-dateunderstanding of the problems involved in targetsetting and achievement. They are oriented towardsthe strategic action needed to achieve health for all.The development of health for all and thefirst European targetsThe Thirtieth WorldHealth Assembly laid the foundation for health forall in May 1977 when it decided that \"the mainsocial target of governments and WHO in the com-ing decades should be the attainment by all citizensof the world by the year 2000 of a level of healththat will permit them to lead a socially and eco-nomically productive life\" (resolution WHA30.43).This goal has global application and significance.Its particular relevance for the European Region isthat, although considerable intellectual and finan-cial resources have been invested, a great potentialfor health improvement remains and serious in-equalities in health persist, both among MemberStates and among groups within individual coun-tries.In 1980, the thirtieth session of the RegionalCommittee for Europe met in Fez, Morocco, and 1 14 2Health for all targets approved the common European strategy for at-taining health for all. The strategy called for funda-mental changes in approaches to health develop-ment. It focused on four areas of concern: lifestylesand health, risk factors affecting health and theenvironment, the reorientation of the health caresystem, and the mobilization of political, manage-rial and technological support to bring about thesechanges. It also asked for a higher priority forhealth promotion and disease prevention, for posi-tive steps by all sectors of society whose activitiesaffect health, and for more emphasis on the role ofindividuals, families and communities. Improvedprimary health care was seen as the major approachto achieve these changes.Years of working together in the Regional Com-mittee had already demonstrated the common con-cern of Member States to improve the health andquality of life of their people. This history providedthe background for the ambitious decision to for-mulate specific regional targets, despite the widedifferences in social and economic conditions inthe Region. Their successful foemulation and theiradoption by the thirty-fourth session of the Re-gional Committee in 1984 were decisive eventsthat gave a strong impetus to the wide politicalacceptance and implementation of the Europeanhealth for all strategy.These events were a breakthrough in health develop-ment in the Region. For the first time, the MemberStates had agreed to adopt a single health policy as acommon basis for individual and cooperative action.They also agreed to review their health situation andbring their policies and programmes in line with thehealth for all strategy. The process of implemen-tation would be supported by systematic monitoringand reporting of progress every second year from1983 onwards (subsequently changed to every thirdyear by resolution wHA39.7). The Regional Com-mittee and World Health Assembly would considerthe progress reports. In addition, the progress madewould be evaluated every six years, beginning in1985. D rogress and problems since 1985 Consid-erable progress has been made in several sig-nificant areas since the publication of the originaltargets in 1985. The concepts, principles and strat-tgies of heal'h for all have become widely reflectedin national, regional and local policies and mostsignificantthe day-to-day health care practicethroughout the Region. The monitoring and evalu-ation exercises that have taken place have deep-ened understanding of the progress made towardsthe achievement of health for all and the problemsand dilemmas inherent in this process. The declar-ations, strategies and action plans that have comeout of a number of WHO meetings have confirmedthe strong relevance of the principles of health forall and clarified suitable approaches to their appli-cation.Progress reports have shown the gains that havebeen achieved and the problems that remain. Lifeexpectancy for the Region as a whole continues toincrease and the overall maternal and infant mor-tality rates have dropped. Mortality rates for majordiseases, including ischaemic heart disease, havefallen. Motor vehicle accidents occur less frequently.Transfrontier environmental pollution and hazard-ous wastes are more effectively controlled, and thequality of drinking-water has improved. Primaryhealth care has become more widely available. Theendorsement of health for all by all Member Statesand the development of health for all policies andstrategies in nearly all countries of the Region haveprovided valuable support for this work. 15 The broad perspective 3 Notwithstanding this progress, serious problemsremain. Inequalities in health status between coun-tries have not generally declined and in some casesthey have increased, particularly between the coun-tries in the central and eastern part of the Regionand the rest. On average, cancer mortality is stillincreasing. Tobacco use, the excessive use of alco-hol and the abuse of drugs continue to be seriouslifestyle problems. Homicide and suicide are stilltoo frequent. Progress in achieving cooperationbetween different sectors of government and withother sectors, such as private industry, in the inter-est of health has been disappointingly slow. Specific lines of actionUsing the forum ofWHO conferences, ministers of health and ofrelated sectors have applied the principles andstrategies of the European health policy to developspecific lines of action. The first European Confer-ence on the Prevention and Control of ChronicNoncommunicable Diseases held in Varna, Bul-garia, in 1987 outlined future tasks, including fur-ther research in the field of prevention and control.A conference in Tbilisi, USSR, in 1990 analysed therelationship between inadequate family planningservices and the high number of abortions andadopted the Tbilisi Declaration, which deals broadlywith this problem area.An international conference on health promotion,held in Ottawa in 1986, considered lifestyles con-ducive to health and produced the Ottawa Charterfor Health Promotion. The Charter outlines a com-prehensive strategy for health promotion with fivedimensions: healthy public policy, supportive en-vironments, personal skills, community action andNoriented health services. It reaches beyond tra-daional health services with broader terms of refer-ence, putting more emphasis on health as opposedto illness and creating a different relationship withthe community. A second international conferenceon health promotion, focusing on healthy publicpolicy, was held in Adelaide, Australia, in 1988and a third on supportive environments for healthin Sundsvall, Sweden, in 1991.The first European Conference on Tobacco Policy,held in Madrid in 1988, developed a plan of actionthat had as its foundation the aim of promotingnonsmoking as the norm in Europe. The first Euro-pean Conference on Food and Nutrition Policy washeld in Budapest in 1990 to establish the ground-work for national food policies and action plansthat would be sensitive to nutritional issues.Strong concern about health issues in the environ-ment led to the unanimous adoption of the Euro-pean Charter on Environment and Health by29 Member States and the Commission of theEuropean Communities, at the First European Con-ference on Environment and Health held in Frank-furt in 1989, The Charter sets out predictive andpreventive strategies that will reverse negative trendsin the quality of the environment and will improveliving conditions and increase wellbeing. It definesthe entitlements and responsibilities of individu-als, as well as public and private organizations. Itemphasizes the implementation of policy by iden-tifying strategies and priorities for prevention,management and control.Addressing the development of appropriate serv-ices, the first European Conference on Nursing,held in Vienna in 1988, defined the need for a newtype of primary health care nurse at the communitylevel.Finally, to mobilke support for health for all, aEuropean Conference on Planning and Management 16 4Health for all targets for Health, held in The Hague in 1984, developed anew cincept of health planning and made a break-through in thinking on how health for all develop-ments could be stimulated in the ?luralistic so-cieties of the Region today. Following the Edin-burgh Declaration at the World Conference onMedical Education in 1988, European ministers ofhealth and of education met in Lisbon at the Min-isterial Consultation for Medical Education in Eu-rope. They adopted the Lisbon Initiative, whichstates that medical education in the Region shouldfrom now on be based on the European health forall policy and the principles of the EdinburghDeclaration.Updating the targetsThe original targetbook set 1990 as the achievement date formore than half the targets. This, together with thewidespread changes that have taken place in theRegion since 1984, meant that the targets neeckdupdating. In 1989, the Consultative Group on Pro-gramme Development (cGPD) and the RegionalCommittee at its thirty-ninth session decided thatan update was timely, but that the basic structure ofthe target book should be retained and only neces-sary changes introduced. Views and guidance onthe updating were obtained through a questionnairesent to Member States in 1989. An epidemiologicalreview was carried out to supplement the results ofthe 1988 health for all monitoring exercise, and aconsultation on future trends in society was heldearly in 1990. The Regional Health DevelopmentAdvisory Council (RHDAC) then held a brainstorm-ing session on target updating. The fortieth sessionof the Regional Committee endorsed all these pre-paratory activities. In 1991, the CGPD and an infor-mal consultation on updating the European re-gional targets for health for all made further sug-gestion3 on the content of the update document.Based on all these different inputs, the targets wererevised and an updated set of targets was approvedat the forty-first session of the Regional Commit-tee in 1991.As in 1984, the underlying aim of the updating hasbeen to set targets that are \"a blend of today'sreality and tomorrow's dreams\". The formulationof targets varies according to the nature of theproblem they address and the extent of knowledgeavailable on the existing situation. The levels setfor quantified targets are not the result of elaboratemathematical modelling, but are based on histori-cal trends, analysis and expected future evolution.The base year for the targets remains 1980, and theyear 2000 is now the completion date for all ofthem. In other words, the targets have become adescription of the state of health, the factors con-tributing to health, the health policy, and the linesof action desired at the end of this century. Forreference, the relationship between the subjectsdealt with in the updated targets and the 1984targets is shown in Annex I.In the 1985 target book, indicators were included toprovide the basis for systematic monitoring andevaluation of progress in each Member State and inthe Region as a whole. Member States have usedthem in reporting progress to WHO in 1985, 1988 and1991. The indicators were revised in 1988 in thelight of experience up to that point. Additionalrevisions have been made to reflect the reformu-lation of targets that has taken place (Annex 2). Aplan of action has also been revised (Annex 3),indicating the major steps that Member States andWHO will take in cooperation to monitor and evalu-ate their progress towards the targets and, ultimately,to update the targets further to bring them into thetwenty-first century. The revised indicators and plan17 The broad perspective5 of action were approved at the forty-first session ofthe Regional Committee in 1991. Ctatus of the targetsThe updated targets in-dicate the improvements that could be expectedif all the will, knowledge, resources and technol-ogy already available were pooled in pursuit ofcommon goals. The targ, 's represent the joint aspi-ration of all the Member States of the EuropeanRegion, an aspiration that will inspire and motivatethem when they are setting their own targets andpriorities and assessing their own capacities. Themeans used to reach each target are the responsibil-ity of individual Member States, taking into ac-count their political, legal, social and economicpositions and the practicalities of their health sys-tems and organizational structures. Content and structure of this book Theremainder of this section introduces the con-tents of the different chapters and targets and theirinterrelationships.Chapter 1 concludes by identifying the majorthemes of the European health for all policy that areessentially the values and principles that underliethe targets.Chapter 2 deals with the changing social, politicaland economic situation in the Region, and dis-cusses the prerequisites for health. Since 1984,remarkable changes have taken place. The popu-lation has grown older and the structure of familylife has changed. Concern about the environmentand its effects on health has grown rapidly. Un-precedented political and economic developmentshave occurred in the central and eastern part of theRegion, and the evolution of European integrationhas continued. These trends are discussed and theirimplications for the future of health are explored.Fig. 1 gives a brief overview of the content andstructure of the target chapters (3 7). The healthoutcomes that are sought through the application ofthe health for all strategy in the European Regionare the subject of Chapter 3 (targets 1 12). Tar-gets 112 express in specific and, where possible,quantified terms the improvements in health statussought over the 20 years between the RegionalCommittee approval of the health for all strategy in1980 and the year 2000.These health outcomes have four interrelated themes,which are woven throughout the 12 targets: ensuring equity in healthby reducing gaps inhealth status between countries and betweengroups within countries;adding life to yearsby helping people achieve,and use, their full physical, mental and socialpotential;adding health to lifeby reducing disease anddisability;adding years to lifeby increasing life expect-ancy.The first 12 targets fall into three categories: thebasic health for all goals, the health of vulnerablepopulations and specific health problems. Thesetargets set the objectives and agenda for the threechapters (46) that follow, which address thechanges in lifestyles, the improvements in the en-vironment, and the developments in prevention,treatment and care that will make their achieve-ment possible.Chapters 4, 5 and 6 address the main strategies forachieving health for all. Chapter 4 (targets 13 17)is 6Health for all targets Fig. 1.

It thereforestresses the importance of intersectoral action as abasis for strengthening the opportunities for healthpromotion in all settings of life such as cities,places of work, schools and homes.19 The broad perspective 7 Chapter 5 (targets 1825) is concerned with thecontribution of the environment to health and drawson the philosophy and strategies of the EuropeanCharter on Environment and Health and on thereport of the World Commission on Environmentand Development.\u00b0 It reflects the emerging com-mitment to environmental policies that lead toecologically sustainable development, the preven-tion and control of risks, and equitable access tohealthy environments. The targets' aim is to pro-vide opportunities for people to live in communi-ties with socially and physically supportive envi-ronments.Chapter 6 (targets 2631) addresses the provisionof appropriate services for prevention, treatmentand care. Locally accessible primary health care isthe focus of the chapter, supported by secondaryand tertiary care that is comprehensive and respon-sive to health needs, and supplemented by servicesfor people with special needs. A central theme ofthe chapter is the effective management of human,financial and physical resources in a manner that isconsistent with the development of cost-effectiveservices of quality.The interventions proposed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6require sustained political, managerial and fin-ancial support and mobilization, linket: togetherthrough an infrastructure that allows a coordi-nated approach to policy formulation andimplementation. These are the subjects of Chap-ter 7 (targets 3238).

The targets in Chapter 7 empha-size how important it is for institutions to inspire,mobilize and guide health development, to facili-tate intersectoral cooperation and community par-ticipation, and to manage human resource develop-ment. The chapter also deals with the research andinformation support necessary for health for alldevelopment, as well as the need to develop appro-priate mechanisms to strengthen ethical consider-ations in decisions relating to health.The targets set out in Chapters 3 to 7 are closelyinterrelated. The relationships between targetswithin each chapter are illustrated in the introduc-tory sections. More detailed connections, withinand between chapters, are discussed in the sectionson individual targets.Chapter 8 is the final chapter in the book. It bringstogether some conclusions about the Europeanhealth for all policy and some challenges and prob-lems facing its implementation. It also picks up thetheme of the interconnectedness of the targets in adifferent way, by illustrating how taking action onhealth for all does not mean tackling targets one byone. Different components of the targets can becombined into cohesive programmes of actionthe example given is of a potential programme ofaction on tobacco that combines components frommany different targets. ajor themes of the European healthpolicyThe first target book identified sixmajor themes that ran through the whole docu-ment. These remain equally relevant in this revisedbook, but to them must be added a seventh, aconcern with ethics. Although this is implicit in thefirst target book, only now does it find explicit 20 8Health for all targets recognition through the commitment in the newtarget 38 to take into account ethical considerationsin all decisions relating to health. The seven themesset out below are essentially the values and prin-ciples that underlie all 38 targets and the Europeanhealth policy they express.Equityis the essence of health for all. Equity inhealth means that all people have a fair oppor-tunity to realize their full health potential. Itrequires action to reduce inequalities in healthstatus between and within countries. Equitypolicies involve improving the living and work-ing conditions of the disadvantaged, so as toraise the standards of their physical and socialenvironment to levels closer to those of morefortunate groups.The concern withethicsis a new theme re-flected throughout thi; book. The basic prin-ciple of equity can be seen as a reflection of aprofound concern for ethics. Ethical issues arisethroughout all arenas in the health sector inhealth policy, in connection with the rights ofindividuals, groups of patients and whole com-munities, and in connection with specific healthcare interventionsas well as in connectionwith the intersectoral policies and actions thatare required for the achievement of health forall. The European health policy seeks appropri-ate mechanisms to strengthen ethical consid-erations in ail decisions relating to the health ofindividuals, groups and populations.People themselves will achieve health for all.Well informed and well motivated, actively par-ticipating communitiesare key elements in set-ting priorities, and in making and implementingdecisions. This approach makes the best use ofexisting human resources while strengtheningindividua' self-worth and knowledge and en-couraging the provision of social support.The main emphasis of health policy and strat-egy is onhealth promotionanddisease preven-tion.This gives people a positive sense ofhealth so that they can make full use of theirphysical, mental and social capacities. Thisemphasis needs to be reflected in the pro-motion of positive lifestyles, the building ofsupportive environments and the reorientationof health services.Primary health careshould be the focus of thehealth service system. This means meeting thebasic health needs of each community throughservices that are located as close as possible towhere people live and work, are easily access-ible, and involve the community in their devel-opment, planning and implementation.Many sectors of society need to collaborate inthe achievement of health forall. lrtersectoralactionis needed to ensure access to the pre-requisites for health and protection from risksin the physical, economic and social environ-ment. Such action implies cooperation amongagencies of government at the national, re-gional and local levels and with otIrr sectorssuch as business and industry, labour unionsand professional groups. It also implies a con-stant search for quality and cost-effectiveness.An increasing number of health problems tran-scend national frontiers. Strong internationalcooperationis required to ensure environrnen-tal protection, access to adequate resources forhealthy living, and the provision of care that isof high quality and takes the best advantage ofcurrent knowledge and technology.21 The broad perspective9The future The targets presented in this bookmaintain the effort to change the course ofhealth development in the Region that started withthe first target book. What is at stake is ultimatelythe health and wellbeing of the Region's children,of the coming generations. The success of thehealth for all movement will mean that all childrenof the Region will have a much better chance of:being born healthy to parents who want themand who have the time, the means and the skillsneeded to bring them up and care for themproperly;being educated in societies that endorse thebasic values of healthy living, encourage indi-vidual choice and allow it to be exercised freely;being provided with the basic requirements forhealth and being effectively protected againstdisease and .:r.cidents.It also means that all people would have an equalopportunity of:living in a stimulating environment of socialinteraction, free from the risk of war or civilconflict, with full opportunities for playingsatisfying economic and social roles;growing old in a society that supports the main-tenance of their capacities, provides for a se-cure, purposeful retirement, offers care whencare is needed and, finally, allows them to diewith dignity. 22 The future of healthin the European Region Opportunity and challenge Since the adop-tion of the original regional targets in 1984,political developments have had profound effectson the social fabric and the conduct of publicaffairs in all parts of the Region. The ending of theCold War and of its sterile ideological divide in theRegion means that issues of public policy for healthcan now be discussed openly and ideas and experi-ence freely exchanged. The impetus for politicaland economic change in the central and easter', partof the Region continues as these countries movetowards a pluralistic democracy and a marketeconomy. The evolution in western and southernEurope of the European Community, and the poss-ible eventual creation of a wider European eco-nomic, social and political entity, will necessitatecooperation, openness and flexibility throughoutthe Region.Concomitant with the geopolitical and economictransformations, the Region has been going througha phase of technological innovation and rapidsocial change that has serious health consequences.The effects of change demonstrate the importanceof both international cooperation and a soundpublic health infrastructure in all Member States.Growing attention to the relationships betweenhealth, environment and economic developmentunderscores the point. The protection and pro-motion of health require an environment in whichphysical, social and psychological factors are allgiven due importance. Environmental standardsneed to be continually reviewed to take account ofnew knowledge about the relationships betweenthe environment, economic development andhealth. Environmental problems do not halt atnational borders and their resol ution requires anecological health policy and intersectoral action atthe international level.The European Charter on Environment and Health,adopted at Frankfurt in 1989, highlighted issuesrequiring urgent action at local, national and inter-national levels. These include global disturbances tothe environment, such as the destruction of theozone layer and climatic change; safe and adequatedrinking-water supplies with hygienic waste dis-posal for all urban and rural communities; the micro-biological and chemical safety of food; the impacton the environment and on health of various energy 11 23 12Health for all targets options, of transport, especially road transport, andof agricultural practices, including the use of ferti-lizers and pesticides; the quality of air, especially inrelation to oxides of sulfur and nitrogen; and thequality of indoor air (residential, recreational andoccupational) including the effects of radon, pass-ive smoking and chemicals.The Charter also drew attention to the managementand disposal of hazardous wastes, to the need forcontingency planning for accidents and disasters.and to the health aspects of urban development andrenewal. The opening of national borders acrossthe Region and the speedier flow of goods andinformation could well affect lifestyles and healthbehaviour. A comprehensive and coherent approachto health protection and promotion is thereforeclearly needed, encompassing both human behav-iour and environmental factors.Research and development leading to advances inme'cal and related technology, including geneticentAeering, will result in new and better optionsfor prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and nurs-in3 tmre. Some of the advances also raise difficultethical issues, however, which need to be debatedsince they often concern matters of life and deathand pose policy questions about the use of limitedhealth resources. Coincidentally, continuing de-velopments in information technology will lead tobetter information support for heaith policy anddecision-making at all levels, thereby enhancingthe quality of policy development in Member Statesand the efficiency of its implementation.Information technology will also facilitate WHO'stask as a clearing-house for the exchange of infor-mation and ideas in support of policy and practicewithin Member States. One consequence of geo-political change is that the European Region nowcomprises over 50 Member States. Some of thenew states will be small and will need particularsupport. Many will need help to develop demo-cratic practices in policy-making and iinplemen-tation and specifically to strengthen their publichealth infrastructures.Possible futuresThe relevance for the 1990sof the updated European targets can be seenvery clearly by putting them in the context of anumber of possible trends in a future Europe. Theseare not predictions, but could all be plausible on thebasis of what is already known.Despite certain current difficulties facing MemberStates, .,ome underlying trends point . towards im-proved economic performance. In particular, greaterintercountry economic cooperation should createmore favourable conditions for growth in MemberStates. Systematic development assistance fromthe international community will be a forcefulstimuks for the restructuring and expansion of theeconomies of the countries in the central and east-ern part of the Region. This assistance will protectthose countries from the full consequences of thetransition from their previous economies, andthereby stabilize the Region as a whole.The equitable distribution of the results of im-proved economic performance should lead to greatermaterial wellbeing and an associated health gainfor all. An alternative possibility, however, is that,e ven with an economic upturn, inequity in healthwill increase through widening differences betweensocioeconomic groups and also between affluentregions and economically backward ones. The wid-est gap could be between the employed, particu-larly those with skills in strong demand, and theunemployed who lack those skills, as well as the24 apparently unemployable, disabled and other so-cially disadvantaged groups. Long-term unemploy-ment will have a particularly negative effect onhealth where there is little experience of how toalleviate its worst socioeconomic and psychologicaleffects. The downward social and economic mobil-ity of those who have previously lived in securematerial circumstances will also be detrimental tohealth, and the numbers of these so-called new poorare likely to grow. Health may also be adverselyaffected by continued mobility and the splitting upof family structures, further urbanization throughdrift from the rural areas, and changes in socialsecurity systems that limit benefits.Migration will increase both from outside the Re-gion, by people seeking greater economic oppor-tunities, and from within, by people moving to moreaffluent areas. Flows will mainly be from east towest and south to north, with touesm in the oppositedirections. Migration carries both positive and nega-tive health and social consequences for the migrantsand the host community. One particular risk mightbe social and political pressures to distinguish be-tween the rights of the indigenous population whohave citizen status and those of migrants. The healthconsequences of these movements have bothintersectoral and international significance.The shape of the population pyramid in the Regionhas changed markedly this century and will changefurther in coming decades. Europeans already enjoya longer life span than the peoples of any otherregion in the world, and it is still lengthening. Thenumber of the very old, that is people over 80 yearsof age, will increase considerably. They have farmore health problems and disabilities than youngerage groups, which will mean a corresponding in-crease in the need for health and social services forthis population. In the past the children, particularlyThe future of health in the European Region 13 daughters, of the frail and dependent elderly haveacted as \"cover carers\" for their parents. In future,for various social and economic reasonn, womenmay be less likely to forego paid employment tocare for relatives. Even families retaining strongemotional ties may be scattered geographically. Aparticular difficulty can arise when the children ofthe very old themselves start to experience theheahh and mobility problems associated with ag-ing and are increasingly unable to fulfil what wouldhave been an expected and welcome role. Thehealth and social policy implications of the needsof the very old and the adequacy and quality of theservices they receive, or should receive, are mattersrequiring close scrutiny.At the same time, the active group of the third age isgrowilig. Spanning late middle-age to the mid or late60s, this group includes people who have retiredfrom their regular occupations and who have longsince fulfilled their family connnitments as childtearers. They are physically fit and psychologicallyready for stimulus and challenge. They have manyyears of active retirement in front of them, but todaythey receive very little recognition except from theleisure industry. Public policy and the social systemwill need to mobilize this gr.ip, so that its memberscan fully realize their potential contribution to society.Higher educational levels and greater sophisticationwill lead patients and other users of health andsocial services to demand more choice and partici-pation. This trend will stimulate a better quality ofcare and encourage the emergence of new pro-fessional attitudes towards the users of services. Itshould also result in s greater commitment to thereallocation of health sector resources, and a re-view of the education of health professionals lead-ing to a more comprehensive understanding of thehealth needs of a community. 25 14Health for all targets Further, whatever the macroeconomic trends in theRegion, the pressures on health sector resources,whether driven by demographic, technological orother forces, will continue if not intensify. Con-scious efforts will be required to achieve a moreequitable distribution of limited resources, bettermanagement and greater efficiency in performance.The most positive projections for the future de-scribe a society that will become more responsible,cooperatk e and caring. Increasing political, eco-nomic and social convergence will foster agree-ment to tackle urgent transboundary health prob-leins. Local communities will be the workshops formaking living and working environments morehealthy. Equality between the sexes will increase,with mutual respect and support. Technologicaland economic changes will see not only a reductionof working hours but the creation of new forms ofsocial organization, including those that share theburden of care of the growing number of peoplewho will need various forms of assistance. Whilethe activities of voluntary and mutual support groupsmay often need to be underpinned by effectivepublic services, this trend towards self-help cer-tainly warrants reinforcement by health policy.In this scenario, work will still be a very importantsource of personal identity, but each individual'sparticipation in the labour market will have greaterflexibility. Acquiring the education, knowledge andskills to be applied at work will be seen as a life-longendeavour, not as confined to adolescence and earlyadulthood. Society will abandon fixed expectationsof the behaviour of individuals and groups occupy-ing various social roles. It will be ready to accept awider variety of cultural differences and a multitudeof different lifestyles, and will expect constructivesocial and political outcomes from the interactionbetween different groups.None of these trends and projections can beexpected to work out exactly as they have beenintroduced here. Much will depend on how thepolitical trend of the 1980s of applying marketprinciples to all forms of social organizationultimately works out in the 1990s. Public policymay come to be seen in terms that narrow the rangeof issues on the political agenda to those minimiz-ing public spending and redefining collectiverights. Nevertheless, the emphasis on individualresponsibility and opportunities for economic self-advancement need not necessarily replace thevalues of solidarity, mutual support and collectiveaction that were originally behind the creation ofthe twentieth-century welfare state.It will therefore be important to continue to debatethe issues covered in this sketch of possible fu-tures. Further national and international researchand trend analysis can build up a sound base ofevidence on which crucial decisions affecting thepeople of the Region can be made. This shouldensure that political debate is not limited to strat-egies for economic growth, but also focuses onpeople's health and the quality of their lives.Prerequisites for healthThe Region's cur-rent trends will not alter the basic nature ofcountries' health development needs, and the fun-damentals of the European health for all strategywill therefore remain as relevant in the year 2000 asthey are in 1993, and indeed were in 1980 when thestrategy was first formulated: to prevent and con-trol disease, to promote and maintain health, toensure a healthy environment, and to provide healthservices appropriate to people's needs. The re-gional targets are a reflection of present and antici-pated trends, perceived problems and known re-sources and technology. 26 The future of health in the European Region 15 Much still has to be done to prevent disease anddisability, to create the conditions for healthy liv-ing and to make health care more responsive topeople's needs. Such improvements as are achievedwill not have their full effect, however, if certainprerequisites for health are not met. The mainpolitical responsibility for securing these prerequi-sites falls on governments, but the challenge mustbe taken up at all levels of policy-making withincountries. All public bodies and private sectororganizations and enterprises have a part to play,since their decisions and actions address thoseaspects of life that are prerequisites for the health oftheir voters, customers and clients. Peace War remains the most serious of all threatsto health. The devastation that a war entails, whetherin terms of the people killed, wounded, perma-nently disabled and displaced from their homes andcommunities, or of its impact on the environment,is well understood. The health argument againstnuclear war has been forcefully debated in recentyears. It must not be forgotten, however, that hos-tilities within countries and so-called conventionalwar are also terrible threats to humanity. The 1991Gulf hostilities and their aftermath have very clearlydemonstrated the results of a major internationalarmed conflict. In 19921993, fighting has broughtterrible suffering to millions of people in the Re-gion, especially in former Yugoslavia and the formerSoviet Union.The nuclear threat and Cold War assumptions nolonger shape geopolitics. The end to the old formsof international tension in the Region promisesnew opportunities for all its peoples to work to-gether in harmony for a better future. It is disap-pointing, therefore, that the movement towardsindependence in some parts of the Region has beenaccompanied by armed conflict. In addition, thereis concern that the improvement in internationalrelations may be offset by the renewal of deep-seated but hitherto suppressed antagonisms be-tween ethnic and religious groups, both in theirown and other countries. Moreover, conflicts be-tween such groups and controversies between im-migrants and local populations may increase as aresult of the opening of borders, especially in areasexperiencing serious economic problems.Peace is not just the absence of war. It cannot becalled peace if civil unrest and ethnic conflictcontinue to erupt into violence and armed struggleas they do in some countries. As threats to health,these forms of aggressioil are scarcely less seriousthan war itself, in the psychological trauma thatcomes from living in fear of violence, in the effectsof intentional injury and post-trauma distress syn-drome such as suffered by torture victims, and inthe indirect effects of long-term damage to thesocial, physical and economic structures of thecountries and communities affected.Peace is, like health itself, a positive sense ofwellbeing and security, implying the opportunityfor all to develop to the full their own humanpotential. It assumes the possibility that all coun-tries can participate actively on a basis of solidarityand reciprocity in the development of a more stimu-lating and satisfying world for their populations.The health sector should continue to do whateverboth fits in with its basic role and can help topromote harmony and reduce international tension.In each country, the health sector should continue totake the lead in fostering close, long-term collabor-ation on health problems across national borders.The bilateral and international research, meetingsand contacts involved, in addition to improving 27 16Health for all targets health, will increase understanding and forge linksbetween individuals, institutions and countries,thus demonstrating the value of mutual cooper-ation. Equity in health and the satisfaction of basicneedsIn the commitment to health for all lies thefundamental principle of equity. This means thatall human beings have the right to equal opportuni-ties to develop and sustain their full health poten-tial. This principle has two aspects: equity amongnations and equity among the people within eachcountry. Very large differences in standards ofliving remain between the countries of the Region.These differences in socioeconomic developmenttranslate into disturbing inequalities in health status.The increased flow of information on these mat-ters, particularly from the countries in the centraland eastern part of the Region, has given a clearpicture of the sharp contrasts in health status and inaccess to health services between and within coun-tries of the Region.Pockets of social and economic deprivation are oftenfound in the more developed countries of the Euro-pean Region. Life expectancy is lower and infantmortality is higher in these disadvantaged socio-economic groups than in the rest of the population.Various such disadvantaged groups have been iden-tified, such as very old people, refugees and immi-grants, members of ethnic minorities, people livingin specific deprived geographical areas, and singleparent families reliant on either low wages or statebenefits. The numbers in these groups are likely togrow in countries facing economic difficulties andthe dislocations of political change.A major task in any national policy-making, if it isto be consonant with health for all values, must bethe establishment of a consistent and long-termstrategy capable of attacking the causes of socialinequity. It must address the problems of insuf-ficient disposable income to satisfy basic needssuch as food, good nutrition and decent housing,the lack of neighbourhood amenities including sani-tation and safe drinking-water, and poor educationand employment opportunities. The targets shouldbe seen as proposing the health component of anational social policy to reduce inequity. Political will and public support Today's chal-lenges mean that health has to 1.4.. seen as a responsi-bility not only of the health sector but also of othersectorswhether they be education, media, trans-port, agriculture, industry or others. The OttawaCharter for Health Promotion and the EuropeanCharter on Environment and Health both reinforcethis basic strategic intent of health for all. Strongpolitical will and the mobilization of public sup-port are needed to ensure that the necessary actionis taken. The process of sustaining and mobilizingfurther support should be seen as a national responsi-bility at the highest level and pursued in all sectorsthroughout the country. Ministries of health, to-gether with other health authorities and private andprofessional bodies, should act in concert to sus-tain commitment to the values as well as the ..etobjectives of health for all.Precisely how people are mobilized depends on thecultural and social patterns and the constitutionaland political structures in the country concerned.Nevertheless, mobilization involves engaging theactive support of civic and religious leaders andother public figures, such as those representingbusiness, trade unions and influential non-governmental organizations in all sectors of so-ciety. Continuing efforts must be madc to ensure 28 The future of health in the European Region 17 that the health professions, various social groupsand particularly community organizations becomeand remain active collaborators in pursuing healthfor all objectives. The experience of engaging allthese groups in the broad health for all movementover the past decade suggests that the effort tomobilize their support pays its own dividend. International cooperation The strong, collec-tive political commitment of Member States isessential to maintain the impetus for the actionrequired by the regional targets. Resolutions adoptedby the United Nations General Assembly and theWorld Health Assembly call on countries to de-velop their own health for all strategies and take thenecessary steps to ensure their implementation.A key problem for the less developed countries ofthe Region is a lack of investment and inadequatedevelopment in the health sector. A major challengefor the European Region, therefore, is how to secureand sustain concrete forms of solidarity that enablethe more developed countries to offer effective sup-port and collaboration to those less well providedfor, thus ensuring the rapid development of theirhealth sectors. Solidarity of this sort was shown inthe 1980s when the countries of the Region helped topromote and support the rational development ofcomprehensive health care systems in southernEuropean countries. Another significant and timelyindication of regional solidarity was the initiativetaken by the Regional Committee in 1990 to createa regional programme, EUROHEALTH, to intensifycooperation in health with the countries of centraland eastern Europe. The programme is designed tohelp these countries reform and strengthen theirhealth care systems and base their health policies onhealth for all values. Its greatest potential lies in itscoordination with the European Community's PHAREprogramme (on aid for economic restructuring incountries of central and eastern Europe), the Councilof Europe's DEMOSTHENE programme (to promotefellowships in those countries) and the WHO/UN10EFaid programme to the Commonwealth of Independ-ent States.The Regional Committee, by its continuing interestin the periodic health for all monitoring and evalu-ation exercises, and individual Member States, bytheir readiness to report and share their experienceand achievements, have sustained their commit-ment. The updating of the targets now is the strong-est possible message to all concerned that health forall values remain relevant to Member States andtheir commitment to it remains as clear as ever. 29 3Achieving better health The twelve targets in this chapter describe thedesired health outcomes of the health for all strat-egy in the European Region. They set out theimprovements in health status that the RegionalCommittee approved in the health for all strategyin 1980 and that remain the goal for the year 2000.These targets set the agenda for the three sub-sequent chapters, which address the changes inlifestyles, the environmental improvements andthe developments in prevention, treatment and carethat will make these outcomes possible.The outcome targets can be grouped into three dif-ferent categories (see Fig. 2) reflecting differentconcerns within public health. These are the basichealth for all goals, the health of vulnerable popu-lation groups, and specific health problems. Chap-ter 3 provides a framework for comprehensive policydevelopment, planning and implementation to sup-port each target. Details of the policies and imple-mentation measures required to achieve the targetsin this chapter are taken up in the next three chapters.The main concern in Chapter 3 is strategy. Thestrategies suggested all rely heavily on improvedaccess to the prerequisites for health such as food,shelter and income, the creation of safe and sup-portive physical and social environments, oppor-tunities to lead healthy lifestyles and easy accessto primary health care. The unique quality ofstrategies based on equity is that they must beparticularly responsive to the needs of the disad-vantaged. The health for all goal The first categorycomprises two targets concerned with the basicpolicy orientation of the European health for allstrategy: the achievement of equity in health andthe improvement of health and quality of life. The health of vulnerable groups The sec-ond category contains four targets (of whichthree have a new focus) concerned with the healthof particular population groups: people with dis-abilities, children and young people, women, andthe elderly. Three considerations have influencedthe selection of these groups as requiring specialattention: the people in each of these groups often 19 30 20Health for all targets Fig. 2.

C pecific health problems The third categoryconsists of six targets concerned with specifichealth problems: cancer, cardiovascular disease,other chronic diseases, communicable disease, ac-cidents, and mental disorders and suicide. Theyhave much in common in terms of strategic per-spective and policy development. Common themeswithin the targets in this category include a concernwith the development and implementation of strat-egies for prevention and with the quality of life ofpeople with the problem in question.31 Achieving better health 21 Target 1Equity in health By the year 2000, the differences in health status between countries and between groupswithin countries should be reduced by at least 25%, by improving the level of health ofdisadvantaged nations and groups. This target can be achieved if:monitoring of differences in health status between different geographical areas andsocioeconomic groups within each country is strengthened;priority is given to implementation of measures to reduce differences in healthstatus;the basic prerequisites for health, such as food, housing and education, are availableto all;living and working environments that support health are more accessible;adequate health care is made accessible to all;disadvantaged nations obtain special assistance and attention. Problem statementThe most widely avail-able indicators of differences in health statusin the European Region are based on mortality.Around 1980, infant mortality in different coun-tries ranged from 91 to under 7 deaths per 1000 livebirths, while life expectancy at birth varied from 63to 77 years. While there has been progress in someareas, such as infant mortality, other indicators ofhealth status show that inequalities have continuedto grow rather than decline in recent years.' \u00b0 The information on health status presented throughoutChapter 3 is derived from a combination of Regional Officesources: two reports (1,2) and the health for all database.The main contributors to inequalities in healthstatus are exposure to unhealthy, stressful livingand working conditions, inadequate access to healthand other public services, and health-damagingbehaviour where the degree of choice available tothe individual is restricted. These factors are oftenout of the direct control of the people involved andtend to cluster and reinforce each other. Within countries, marked inequalities in health sta-tus exist between the more and the less privilegedgroups. Differences between socioeconomic groupsare often very large and may amount to several yearsin life expectancy. Several studies (3 13) haveshown a more than twofold difference in infant 32 22Health for all targets mortality and in mortality from injuries, poison-ing, violence, lung cancer and myocardial infarction,as well as a threefold difference for cirrhosis of theliver. Variations in morbidity and disability aresimilar to those for life expectancy. For example, astudy in one Member State ( 14 )has shown that42% of people with lower incomes suffer chronicillness as opposed to 18% of the high-incomegroup. Information on changes over time in thedifferences in health status between populationgroups is rarely available. In general, however,such differences more often appear to increase orpersist than to decrease.These major inequalities remain, despite policiesin all Member States that support equity and aim toreduce inequalities in health status. There are fewexamples of comprehensive efforts to examine thehealth impact of public policy systematically amongdifferent groups and regions.Suggested solutionsThe reduction of in-equalities in health status between groups andregions requires information on their real extentand on contributing factors. This would gain politi-cal recognition of the problem and ensure thatpriority is attached to it. Economic and socialpolicies need to address the underlying factors.Experience in countries shows that equity policiesare implemented more effectively when decision-making is devolved to local levels and mechanismsexist for public participation at all stages.The health sector should advocate policies that aimto improve the living and working conditions ofdisadvantaged people, so that their physical andsocial environments approach those of more fortu-nate groups(15 ).This implies aiming for adequatedisposable income, adequate and safe housing,appropriate food, equal opportunities for education,high standards of occupational health and safety,and clean water supplies for the entire population.It also requires effective intersectoral action ineducation, housing, urban planning, agricultureand environmental protection, based on a sysiem-atic assessment of health impact in governmentaland nongovernmental sectors (16).Arrangementsto encourage intersectoral action are needed at theinternational, national, federal, regional and locallevels.Policies should also aim to help people to adopthealthy lifestyles. This, too, requires intersectoralaction to ensure that leisure and exercise facilitiesare accessible and reasonably priced, that edu-cational facilities and programmes are universallyaccessible and provide information to supporthealthy choices, and that food distribution net-works ensure wide access to inexpensive and nu-tritious food.Reduction of inequalities in health status also re-quires equal access to health care and an uptake ofservices that relates to need. The geographic distri-bution of health care resources should reflect theneeds of the entire population. Provision of hightechnology services for sections of the populationshould not be at the expense of the provision ofmore basic services for all. Service use should notbe restricted by social or economic disadvantage,and services should be sensitive to the needs ofminority groups. To achieve this, disadvantagedgroups within the ponulation will require specialassistance and attention.The effective planning and implementation of meas-ures to reduce inequalities in health will requirestronger efforts in research, monitoring and evaluation. 33 Achieving better health23 Many statistical systems in the health sector do notrecord the information needed to address the issuesof equity and cannot support the monitoring andevaluation of policy and practice.The transboundary nature of many factors contri-buting to inequalities in health status means thatcooperation at the international level is essential.This is obvious in areas such as the control of airand water pollution. Intercountry collaboration isalso important where specific assistance is offered,either directly from country to country or throughWHO coordination. Turkey has, for a long time,received a particularly high proportion of the coun-try programme budget in the European Region.More recently, the Regional Committee, in Septem-ber 1990, approved the EUROHEALTH programme toprovide assistance to countries in central and easternEurope over the next five years. This initiativedemonstrates that international solidarity can becalled on to deal with inequalities between countries.While tackling this target within the European Re-gion, the wider global context must not be neglected.The current financial crises in many developingcountries in other WHO regions underlines the needfor Member States in the European Region to becertain that policies aimed at improving health intheir own countries do not contribute to deterio-ration in developing countries. Target 2-Health and quality of life By the year 2000, all people should have the opportunity to develop and use their ownhealth potential in order to lead socially, economically and mentally fulfilling lives. This target can be achieved if:monitoring of health potential and quality of life is strengthened;active participation in community life is encouraged;access to the prerequisites for health, especially education, is improved;healthy lifestyles based on effective coping skills become widely accepted;health and environmental aspects of living and working are improved and socialnetworks strengthened;greater emphasis is placed on the quality of life in providing primary, secondary andtertiary care. 3 4 24Health for all targetsProblem statementHealth is created andlived by people in all the settings of their every-day lives. WHO views health as a positive conditioninvolving the whole person. It defines health as astate of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease ordisability. Health for all is concerned with creatingstructures and mechanisms that empower and sup-port individuals in developing and using their owncapabilities to the fullest extent possible. It aims toenable them to realize their full potential for healthand thereby enhance the quality of their lives.The achievement of this aim is hampered by lack ofaccess to the prerequisites for health, especiallyeducation, by obstacles in the physical and socialenvironment that interfere with the choice of healthyways of living, and by health-threatening aspectsof living and working environments (17). The rapidsocial, economic and political changes that are nowoccurring in the European Region present newchallenges to Member States to provide conditionsthat are supportive of health. By emphasizing apositive concept of health and an intersectoralapproach to health action, these challenges can bemet.Some population groups are particularly vulner-able. They lack opportunities to use their capabili-ties to the full, so that they cannot develop theirhealth potential. In some cases this creates handi-caps or functional limitation. Groups particularlyaffected include elderly people, single parents withyoung children, shift or night workers, ethnic min-ority groups and migrant workers (18),people withdisabilities, people in institutions, and those livingwith chronic disease(19,20).The particular ob-stacles that these groups face in developing andusing their health potential need to be addressed byactions specifically tailored for them.Suggested solutionsThe achievement of thistarget will require policies and programmes thatreflect a balanced concern with the quality of life andthe physical, mental and social aspects of health. Improvements in living and working con-ditionsImprovements in living and working con-ditions can be achieved by protecting the quality ofthe natural environment and by ensuring that com-munities have safe and adequate housing, parksand recreational areas. Both social and physicalenvironments are important in maintaining health.A growing body of knowledge points to the healthgains achieved by avoiding stress and participatingactively in social networks involving families,friends and the community (21 ). Health for allprogrammes need to emphasize the health benefitsof social support and to strengthen the settings inwhich these can be achieved.Educational programmes that aim to empowerpeople to develop their own physical, mental andemotional capabilities play an important part inachieving this target. Preschool, school and adulteducation programmes should aim to improve in-dividuals' skills in areas such as decision-making,interpersonal relationships, and coping strategies.They should help people to inform themselvesabout healthy lifestyles and harmful behaviour andempower them to make healthy choices. Specific actionCertain population groups re-quire action specifically tailored for them to helpthem realize their health potential and attain a goodquality of life. Reallocation of resources both withinand outside the health sector will be necessary toachieve this. Issues affecting specific groups arediscussed further under the targets for people with 35 Achieving better health25 disabilities (target 3), elderly people (target 6),children and young people (target 7), women (tar-get 8), people at work (target 25) and people withspecial needs (target 30). Quality of lifeQuality of life is also an importantissue throughout the health care system, and requiresa significant adjustment of priorities and reallocationof resources. It is particularly important that care andresources are not used only to cure disease or toprolong life. Proper provision must also be made toenhance the quality of life for chronically disabled orill people and for those who are terminally ill, whoshould be ensured a dignified death (22).A great deal of effort has been expended on devisingmeans to measure the quality of life, and severalinstruments are now available (23 28).Greateremphasis needs to be given to monitoring healthpotential and quality of life, through the use ofappropriate population surveys and special studieswhere necessary. Monitoring many of the targets inthis chapter requires quality of life measures that canbe applied to disadvantaged groups to assess theextent to which they achieve equity. These groupsinclude people with disabilities (target 3), peoplewith chronic diseases(29)(targets 4, 9 and 10),elderly people(30)(target 6), and people with mentaldisorders (target 12). In some areas, suitable measure-ment instruments will require further development. Target 3-Better opportunitiesfor people with disabilities By the year 2000, people with disabilities should be able to lead socially, economically andmentally fulfilling lives with the support of special arrangements that improve their relativephysical, social and economic opportunities. This target aims at:the provision of equal opportunities;an improvement in the status of people with disabilities;allowing people with disability to improve their quality of life and develop theirhealth potential.a a The question of preventing the incidence of disability is closely related to many other targets, inparticular targets 4, 11 and 12. 36 26Health for all targets it can be achieved by implementing strategies that:promote positive attitudes in society towards people with disabilities;create non-handicapping environments;promote independent living for people with disabilities, through rehabilitation andsocial support;provide appropriate services and support to those who do not have the functionalability to remain independent and to their families or other carers.Problem statementWhile estimates vary,about 10% of the population in the EuropeanRegion probably suffers from significant long-term disability. This means that some 85 millionpeople would benefit from policies and services toalleviate the consequences of impairment and dis-ability. These numbers will increase as the popu-lation grows older. The main causes of disabilityare locomotor disorders, sight and hearing prob-lems, injuries, mental disorders and cardiovasculardisease.There will always be people who suffer impair-ment and disability despite the best preventive andrehabilitative efforts, but this need not result inhandicap. People with disabilities are socially handi-capped when they are denied the opportunitiesgenerally available to others to enjoy family life,education, employment, housing, access to publicfacilities and freedom of movement. They can behelped to lead satisfying and productive livesthrough improvements in physical and social en-vironments.Despite improvements in recent years, in mostEuropean countries the integration of people withdisabilities into their communities is far fromsatisfactory. They still suffer restricted educationalopportunities because of limited mobility or be-cause their abilities and potential are not recog-nized. They are often denied employment, or aregiven menial and poorly paid jobs, when propertraining and placement could enable them to meetprevailing work standards. Children with disabili-ties may be confined to institutions that are morecustodial than educational. People with disabilitiesare often denied the right to self-determination intheir own lives and are unable to participate in theactive life of their community. This socially in-flicted deprivation is especially acute for peoplewith mental disabilities.To alleviate social handicap, stronger legislationis required in areas such as access to employment,transport, public services and buildings. The con-cept of equalizing the opportunities for independ-ent living has not been widely adopted in theEuropean Region and community-oriented re-habilitation is limited. The effectiveness of dis-ability policies is often weakened by a dispro-portionate allocation of available resources intohighly specialized technology and services for 3 7 Achieving better health27 acute life-threatening conditions. The problems ofimpairment and disability have not been adequatelyaddressed and intersectoral support services(health, social services, education, employment,housing) have not been coordinated. Finally, alack of internationally comparable data on thecauses and prevalence of disability and handicaphas contributed to an underestimation of the ex-tent of the problem and its economic and socialimpact. Suggested solutionsAll legislation and policydevelopment should take into account, explic-itly, the needs of people with disabilities (31 ).Countries would benefit from a comprehensivepolicy to create equal opportunities for people withdisabilities, which aims to integrate them fully intothe social and economic life of their communities.Such policies need to be supported by a strategy forimplementation that combines national or federalsupport with local action.Health authorities should take the lead in estab-lishing coordinated intersectoral action on behalfof people with disabilities, as well as providingeffective primary care and rehabilitation services,which should be holistic, multidisciplinary, flex-ible and based on best current practice. Servicesshould be delivered through community-basedworkers and facilities and coordinated with socialwelfare, education and training. Technical aids andequipment that enable people to function inde-pendently should be more readily available topeople with disabilities. Some countries use insti-tutes of technology, others rely on industry tomarket aids and equipment. Priority should also begiven to the provision of social support for inde-pendent living. Some people will always be unableto live independently; appropriate services andsupport must also be made available to them andtheir carers.The successful implementation of policies to re-lieve handicap requires a clear definition of respon-sibilities for planning and monitoring, effectivecoordination between decision-makers and serv iceproviders, and the involvement of people withdisabilities in decisions affecting them. Support isneeded for the establishment or strengthening ofnongovernmental organizations of people with dis-abilities.Intersectoral coordination is essential for voca-tional training and placement, basic education,access to transport and public facilities, programmesto support independent living and the creation ofnon-handicapping environments. While integra-tion within the workforce is desirable, shelteredemployment for people with disabilities will beessential in some cases. In many countries, thevaluable experience of local voluntary organiz-ations can form the focus for work ir1 this area,which may require support through legislation orregulations.Efforts to improve opportunities for disabledpeople will be assisted by better comparative infor-mation aboat the incidence and prevalence of dis-ability among Member States, about the aids andservices that have been shown to improve physicaland social independence, and about training indisability management.Finally, positive attitudes need to be developedtowards people with disabilities. This will requireextensive campaigns, aimed at all age groups, tohelp them recognize the abilities of disabledpeople, and to work towards a fully integratedsociety.38 28Health for all targets Target 4-Reducing chronic disease By the year 2000 there should be a sustained and continuing reduction in morbidity anddisability due to chronic disease in the Region. This target can be achieved through:a reduction of at least 10% in morbidity and disability due to chronic disease;a reduction of at least one third in diabetes complications, and particularly blind-ness, renal failure, amputations, pregnancy complicatIons and coronary heaadisease;a reduction in the severity of dental caries and periodontal disease to the pointwhere children have no more than two decayed, missing or filled teeth by the ageJf 12 years;a sustained and continuing reduction in morbidity, disability and suffering associ-ated with degenerative, rheumatic, neurological and chronic respiratory diseaseand allergies;ensuring access to genetic counselling and appropriate preventive measures for allat risk;adopting a strategy for the reduction of chronic and noncommunicable diseases(see also targets 9, 10 and 12) operating on common risk factors and integratinginterventions in different sectors of the community;improving the statistical base for monitoring chronic disease, giving priority to dataon years of life free from disability and major disease. problem statementThis target addresseschronic diseases that are major public healthproblems because of the pain, suffering, inconven-ience and loss of physical capacity that they cause.Increased life expectancy, together with the abilityof medical technology to postpone death withoutalways restoring health, means that the prevalenceof some of these chronic conditions is increasing.The historic focus on mortality as an indicator ofhealth policy achievement has resulted in non-life-threatening diseases receiving a relatively low pri-ority until now. The prevention of these conditionsand the alleviation of their consequences is a majorchallenge for health care systems. The specific39 Achieving better health29 cases of cardiovascular disease and cancer are con-sidered under targets 9 and 10. The main focus oftarget 4 is chronic disease such as degenerativerheumatic, neurological and chronic respiratorydiseases, diabetes, and allergies.Comprehensive data on the prevalence of chronicdiseases and their effects on quality of life areextremely limited. Prevalence figures for cardio-vascular diseases range from 10% to 40% in differ-ent Member States, and musculoskeletal diseasesfrom 7% to 24%. Prevalence rates are higher amongolder people and among those with lower socio-economic status. The consequences of non-communicable diseases are a considerable burdento sufferers, in some cases resulting in functionalimpairment and handicap, and adversely affectingthe quality of life over much of the life span. DiabetesDiabetes is a potentially life-threateningdisease that remains undiagnosed in a large pro-portion of the population. It is estimated to affect30 million people in the European Region. It isparticularly important because of its complications,which include cardiovascular disease, blindness, re-nal failure, amputations and problems in pregnancy.Many of these are preventable, but effective actionrequires collaboration between health professionals,the community and affected individuals. Dental diseaseRecently, the frequency and se-verity of dental caries and periodontal disease havefallen dramatically in a number of countries, thoughin others the rates are unchanged or increasing. Theglobal goal of no more than three decayed, missingor filled teeth at the age of 12 years has alreadybeen achieved in 53% of the relevant population inthe Region.AllergyBasic knowledge about hypersensitivityand allergic conditions has advanced in recentyears. Information on the prevalence and conse-quences of allergies is still inadequate, thoughpossible recent increases have been attributed tochanges in lifestyle and eating habits. Recent find-ings show that food allergies can be much morefrequent, and with more varied symptomatology,than previously recognized. There is also concernabout smoking as a co-factor in allergies. Genetically determined conditions Geneticallydetermined conditions, such as thalassaemia majorand neural tube defects, which cause major disabil-ity, impairment and discomfort, are receiving in-creasing attention in the Region because of a greaterunderstanding of their extent and better opportuni-ties for early detection, prevention and treatment. Suggested solutionsProgress towards this tar-get willbe affected by action on cardiovasculardisease (target 9), cancer (target 10), accidents(target 11), mental disorders (target 12) and thehealth of people at work (target 25). Policy developmentPeople in the Region wouldbenefit from comprehensive policies on the preven-tion of chronic noncommunicable diseases and thealleviation of their consequences. A useful approachis countrywide integrated dis-ease primary multisectoral action andcommunity participation. Each policy needs to takeaccount of the specific characteristics of the particu-lar disease and must encourage close collaborationwith community groups, especially those that rep-resent people suffering from chronic conditions. 4 0 30Health for all targets Service provisionService provision should becoordinated intersectorally, building on cooperativeaction with all other relevant agencies, such as socialservices, and fitness and recreation services. It shouldactively support the partners, families and friendsinvolved in the care of individuals with chronicdisease. Some countries already have policies thatprovide a framework for the development of net-works of community care and social support centresfor people with particular chronic diseases. Practicalmeasures that can be taken to alleviate the pain andloss of function associated with chronic diseasesinclude specific therapeutic measures such as jointreplacement, physical fitness training, dietary change,lifestyle adjustment and rehabilitation services. Tech-nical aids that can enhance the functional capacityfor independent living should be developed andmade readily available. Environmental improvement General environ-mental measures such as pollution control will makean important contribution to the alleviation of theconsequences of respiratory disease. Specific movesto control tobacco consumption, through the controlof smoking in public and support for smoking pre-vention and cessation, are also important in reducingthe consequences of these conditions (34). DiabetesA diabetes strategy should focus on theearly identification and management of the diseasebased on an active partnership between healthprofessionals and diabetic individuals. Major in-itiatives to improve diabetes care and reduce itscomplications have been taken by health depart-ments in Member States in cooperation with theInternational Diabetes Federation and WHO,result-ing in the St Vincent Declaration in October 1989(35). The development of baseline data for themonitoring of diabetes complications is a priorityfor the years ahead. Dental diseasePrimary prevention strategies re-quire the education of children, parents and teachers.Fluoridation of drinking-water has a role to play. Itremains controversial in some regions and localities,where alternative preventive approaches such as theuse of fluoride salt, toothpastes, gels or tablets shouldbe developed. Other important measures are incen-tives for dentists to prevent secondary caries. AsthmaThe effective recognition and treatmentof asthma offers the scope to reduce associatedmortality and morbidity. Therapy can be directedat the prevention of attacks and the early recogni-tion and effective treatment of attacks, which willminimize side-effects and treatment-induced com-plications. Peak flow meters can enable individu-als to measure their own lung function and thuscontribute to early intervention. AllergiesFurther research is required to estab-lish the underlying etiology of most allergies. Untilthis is achieved, guidelines for the design of inter-vention programmes cannot be drawn up. Whereprevention is not possible, emphasis should beplaced on improving treatment regimes to reduceassociated morbidity, and on reducing exposure tosuspected co-factors, such as smoking. A reductionin the chemicals in food and in the environmentmay also have a positive impact. Genetically determined conditions Progressin this area will require greater public awareness ofthe conditions involved and their causes. Action is 41 Achieving better health 31 required to promote ready access to genetic coun-selling, fetal diagnosis and related services. Thismay involve screening during childhood, beforeconception, early in pregnancy and in the neonatalperiod (36). In some countries, the use of prenatalscreening services has resulted in the reduced inci-dence, or even elimination, of certain geneticallydetermined conditions. The extremely importantand difficult ethical issues involved make it essen-tial that technical interventions are used only whenthe individuals concerned are offered an extensive,informed choice.information Tomeasure progress towards thistarget, action needs to be taken to improve thestatistical base for monitoring chronic disease andits effects. Priority should be given to monitoringlife spans free of disability. Such data are currentlyavailable in only a few Member States. Measuringthe quality of life for people with chronic disease isalso important. Priorities for the future also includenew approaches to research, to determine the inci-dence and prevalence of these diseases and theirassociated consequences, and training geared toprimary care and community support. Target 5-Reducing communicable disease By the year 2000, there should be no indigenous cases of poliomyelitis, diphtheria, neonataltetanus, measles, mumps and congenital rubek in the Region and there should be asustained and continuing reduction in the incidence and adverse consequences of othercommunicable diseases, notably HIVinfection. This target can be achieved by control strategies implemented through well organizedhealth care systems ensuring effective epidemiological surveillance, education, treat-ment and care and aimed at achieving:vaccination of al/ eligible people against eradicable diseases and other communi-cable diseases that can be contained with vaccination;a sustained and continuing reduction in the rate of transmission of HIV infection andalleviation of its negative consequences, including social reactions to people withHIV infection and AIDS;a reduction of 25% in the mortality associated with pneumonia and diarrhoea!diseases in children and with hepatitis B;a sustained and continuing reduction in the rate of transmission of, and severecomplications associated with, sexually transmitted diseases. 4 2 32Health for all targets problem statementCommunicable diseasein the European Region remains an importantcause of morbidity. Almost one third of the popu-lation is affected by communicable disease or itsassociated complications each year (37).Diseases controlled by vaccination The elimi-nation of measles requires immunization coverageclose to 100%, but in 1989/1990 some 30% of thetotal population of the Region lived in countrieswhere immunization rates were below 80%.A drastic change in attitudes towards vaccinationwill be needed to eliminate measles throughout theRegion by the year 2000. Mumps and rubella canbe eliminated with lower immunization rates thanfor measles(38,39).thv infection andAIDSInfection with the hu-man immunodeficiency virus (Hiv) remains a seri-ous challenge because of its consequences, the lackof effective treatment and the present limited op-portunities for prevention. Some 48 000 cases ofacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Aips) hadbeen reported in the Region by early 1991. About500 000 Europeans were estimated to have con-tracted HIV infection by the end of 1990 (40).Thistotal could reach 1.5 million by the year 2000,when heterosexual transmission may be the pri-mary mode of transmission. The chronic nature ofAIDS, which can last for months or years, and theneed for medical, nursing, counselling and socialservices is placing new pressures on the organiz-ation and financing of health services. The socialstigma and discrimination associated with the dis-ease is raising special problems in terms of viol-ation of individual rights and loss of social supportfor people who are HIV positive.Other diseases not controlled by vaccinationOtherdiseases such as acute respiratory infections,including pneumonia, and diarrhoea] disease canalso be largely controlled through better case man-agement, especially in children and infants (41).Suggested solutionsSeveral diseases can beeliminated if effective measures are taken, andthe incidence and consequences of others can besubstantially reduced.Diseases controlled by viccination Strategiesfor the control of communicable diseases that arepreventable through immunization ha've been de-veloped under the auspices of WHO and are incor-porated in the Expanded Programme on Immuniz-ation (EP1). Country programmes, based on thesestrategies, have achieved remarkable progress. Theyaim to increase immunization coverage, improvesurveillance at the regional, national, federal andlocal levels, develop laboratory services and en-sure vaccine quality. The development of a com-bined vaccine for measles, mumps and rubellaallows a common approach to these diseases, andexperience in some Member States indicates thateradication of these diseases is possible. Thesetechnical programmes have to be accompanied bytraining for health personnel and encouragement ofcommunity action if they are to be fully effective.thy infection andAIDS A reduction in the rateof HIV transmission can at present only be achievedthrough energetic health education and health pro-motion programmes that are integrated with publichealth and treatment services. An effective strategyinvolves striking a balance. It needs to be based onan epidemiological assessment that includes theuse of diagnostic facilities, seroepidemiologicalsurveys and seroprevalence data reporting. It mustinclude health promotion, partictflarly informationand education to encourage safer sexual practicesamong the general population as well as among 43 Achieving better health33 individuals who practise high-risk behaviour. Pre-venting the spread of infection through blood sup-plies requires a safe supply of blood, the correct useof blood and blood products, and the screening ofblood and organ donors. The prevention of perinataltransmission requires intensive and widespread healtheducation and outreach, aimed particularly at inject-ing drug users and their sexual partners. All theseapproaches to the prevention of HIV transmissionhave to be sensitive to the social, cultural and linguis-tic characteristics of the population and carried outin close cooperation with nongovernmental organ-izations working in the field.When developing programmes for diagnosis, coun-selling, care and clinical management, existingfacilities and personnel need to be assessed todetermine where increases in or reallocation ofresources are required to ensure that coordinatedand comprehensive services can be provided. Thepsychological and social effects of HIV infectionand AIDS mean that information, education andcounselling must be available to those affected bythe disease, their partners and others with whomthey have contact (42). Measures are also needed toensure that the basic human rights of those suffer-ing from HIV infection are protected and to changethe negative societal attitudes underlying discrimi-nation and other adverse social reactions towardspeople who are HIV positive or who have AIDS.Finally, the evaluation of health promotion workon HIV infection and AIDS is an important priority,together with the dissemination of results bothwithin and between countries.Other diseases not controlled by vaccinationMortality associated with diarrhoeal disease inchildren can be reduced through higher hygienestandards, the provision of safe drinking-water andfood, the use of oral rehydration salt and the promptdelivery of other appropriate medical care at theprimary lev -1. The reduction of mortality associ-ated with pneumonia in children requires improve-ments in case management and effective access tomedical care services to facilitate early diagnosis.More effective targeting of at-risk populations willserve to decrease the incidence of acute hepatitis B.In the long term, effective vaccination policies willbe associated with a decrease in the carrier state andhence a reduction in mortality associated withchronic disease. In the short term, mortality associ-ated with chronic disease may be reduced slightlythrough better management of chronic liver diseaseand treatment with interferon.The rate of transmission of major sexually trans-mitted diseases can be reduced and severe compli-cations prevented by systematic health educationfor prevention backed up by early diagnosis andtreatment, carried out within a well organized pri-mary health care system. Target 6-Healthy agingBy the year2000,life expectancy at birth in the Region should be at least 75 years and thereshould be a sustained and continuing improvement in the health of all people aged 65 yearsand over. 4 4 34Health for all targets This target aims at achieving:an increase in life expectancy at birth to at least 67 years for men and 74 years forwomen in every country in the Region;aa reduction of at least 25% in the differences in life expectancy at birth amonggeographical areas and socioeconomic groups and between the sexes;an increase in the number of years people aged 65 and over live free from disability,and an improvement in the quality of their lives.It can be achieved by implementing strategies that:encourage full and active participation of the elderly in community life;prolong the period of healthy aging through lifestyle changes and supportiveenvironments;provide appropriate services and support to elderly people in need. a These figures refer to life expectancy in individual countries, whereas the figure of 75 years inthe target itself relates to life expectancy in the Region as a whole.Problem statementLife expectancy at birthvaries throughout the Region, both betweencountries and between groups within countries. Themost recent figures available, for around 1989/1990,range from 74 to 64 years for men across the differ-ent countries in the Region and from 81 to 69 yearsfor women; 47% of the total population of theRegion live in countries where male life expectancyat birth is under 67 years, but only 16% of the totalregional population live in countries where femalelife expectancy is less than 74 years. The achieve-ment of an overall life expectancy of 75 years for theRegion as a whole by the year 2000 depends particu-larly on progress in the central, eastern and southernparts of the Region.In 1960, 14.4% of the European population wereover the age of 60 years. By 1980, this proportionhad increased to 16.9% and it will rise to 20.2% bythe year 2000. The age group that is growing mostrapidly is the over 80s. The number of people inthis age group is predicted to grow from 16 mil-lion to 21 million between 1980 and 2000. Thesedemographic changes will have profound impli-cations for the future of health policy and healthservices, especially long-term care. If the needs ofthe elderly are to be met effectively within theboundaries of sustainable cost, policies and pro-grammes will have to be adopted that help theelderly to remain active and healthy for as long aspossible. Improvements in care and the increased survival ofthe sick have led to a shift in emphasis fromprolonging life expectancy to increasing the expec-tation of active life or of life free of disability.Although reduced functional capacity is correlatedwith advancing age, what percentage of reduced 45 Achieving better health35 function is due to preventable loss of fitness and/orsocial contacts is not clear. Many aging people donot show symptoms of mental or physical decline;on the contrary, they tend to enjoy a level of healththat permits them to lead socially and economi-cally healthy lives. Seven out of ten people in theage group 7080 years require no assistance incaring for themselves (43).Morbidity in the aged is characterized by multiplepathology, nonspecific presentation and a highincidence of complications of both disease andtreatment. About 20% of those aged 60 or older arefree of symptoms (44). Of the remainder, a largeproportion report more than one condition or symp-tom. The most common problems are arthritis,reduced vision and hearing, dementia, depression,sleep disturbance, incontinence, unsteadiness, so-cial isolation and institutionalization. These prob-lems must receive priority in action and research toachieve healthy aging.During this century, the average educational leveland socioeconomic conditions of the elderly haveimproved. These changes contribute to better healthstatus and also mean that in the future the elderlywill be better informed, more politically involvedand able to participate more actively in commu-nity lire. New problems are emerging, however,because of the migration of younger generations,the entry of more women into the woi kforce andthe greater complexity of everyday life. Thesechanges lead to more social isolation among theelderly and fewer informal carers to support them.Other formal care arrangements therefore have tobe planned.Aging and health tend to be low priorities in thegovernment policies of most Member States. Healthpromotion and disease prevention programmesgeared to the needs of older people are poorlydeveloped in such areas as physical activity, appro-priate eating, reduction of alcohol use, control ofprescription drugs and maintenance of social net-works and security. Most areas have few commu-nity structures for care and social support, andmore effort is needed to improve the accessibilityof housing, transport and community activity. Suggested solutionsEach country needs acomprehensive policy to create better oppor-tunities for healthy aging, based on the objective ofmaintaining maximum functional capacity through-out the latter years of life and balancing this withappropriate care where needed. The policy needs tobe supported by a strategy for implementation thatcombines national or federal support with localaction. The health sector should act as a strongadvocate for comprehensive economic and socialpolicies that enhance the relative position of theelderly. Health authorities can also act as advocatesfor coordinated intersectoral action on behalf of theelderly while providing effective primary care,rehabilitative services and institutional facilitieswhere needed.The successful implementation of policies to makethe latter years of life as healthy as possible re-quires a clear delineation of the responsibilities forplanning and monitoring it, effective coordinationbetween relevant decision-makers and service pro-viders, and the involvement of elderly people indecisions affecting them. Appropriate mechanismsto achieve this will vary according to circum-stances. National, federal, regional or local bodiesmay be assigned special responsibility for the eld-erly. To be effective, such bodies require readyaccess to decision-makers and representation fromthe elderly. 4 G 36Health for all targets Broad central policies should provide the frame-work within which coordinated local action, involv-ing governmental and nongovernmental organiz-ations, can be taken to address key areas. Theseinclude income support, retirement practices, hous-ing and transport, catering services, fitness and rec-reational activities, and opportunities for partici-pation in community life. The prevention of socialisolation has been shown to help maintain functionalcapacity and support healthy aging. It can be achievedby measures such as providing better educationalopportunities for those aged over 65, for examplethrough universitios of the third age, and creatingspecific organizations that allow older people to usetheir knowledge and experience for the benefit of thewhole community. One Member State has done thisby setting up town councils of the wise.Efforts need to be focused on maintaining physicalfitness for as long as possible. This presupposeseducating people in healthy lifestyles, in the man-agement of stress, in the need for adequate exerciseand nutrition, and in the prevention of loss ofautonomy as well as the prevention of disease. Thisprocess should begin in middle age to be fullyeffective, although many benefits can still be gainedfrom lifestyle changes late in life.More intensive efforts should be made to spreadcurnnt knowledge about the aging process andways of maintaining functional capacity and post-poning the onset of chronic disease and disability.Training and research towards this end shouldreceive high% r priority.The future rapid growth in numbers of people aged85 years and over will create a special demand fornew programmes and facilities to provide long-term care. These will need to achieve a balancebetween institutional care and community services,with a high degree of coordination between health,social services and the voluntary secto-r. Providinginformation and effective means of support forself-help groups and informal care givers is alsoparticularly important. This support will need to bestrengthened and supplemented in future when theproportion of people in the middle age groups,from which many informal care givers are drawn,falls. It will be a particular challenge to providehumane, high quality care within the bounds ofacceptable cost.A specific policy goal should be to provide oppor-tunities and encouragement for those aged over 65to remain active participants in the social andcultural life of the communities to which theybelong. They should be regarded not as a burden, oras medical and social problems, but as a valuableresource, bringing life experience and wisdom totheir communities. Target 7-Health of children and young people By the year 2000, the health of all children and young people should be improved, givingthem the opportunity to grow and develop to their full physical, mental and social potential. 4 7 Achieving better health 3 7 This target aims at achieving:comprehensive support of children and their families, according to their healthneeds and socioeconomic circumstances;a reduction of infant mortality rates in countries with rates currently between 10 and20 per 1000 live births to below 10, and in countries with rates currently above 20per 1000 live births to be/ow 15;a reduction of 25% in the differences in infant mortality rates between geographicalareas and socioeconomic groups;a reduction of 25% in mortality and serious injury in children and young people,notably due to accidents.lt can be achieved by implementing strategies that:protect children as vulnerable members of society, with all appropriate measures inaccordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child;organize disease prevention and health surveillance for all children, including goodantenatal, postnatal, preschool and school health services;promote breastfeeding of infants by the greatest possible proportion of mothers,including working mothers;promote healthy patterns of living among children and young people;ensure social, economic and psychological support for disadvantaged children,including those with long-term illness and disability, and for their families;ensure that all young peop/e are informed about, and have easy access to, facilitiesand support to avoid unplanned parenthood. problem statementThere are several majorreasons why the health and wellbeing of chil-dren and young people are of special importance ina country's health policy. They make up a substan-tial part of each country's population, on averagearound 20% in the Region as a whole. Improvingthe health of young people and their attitudes tohealth behaviour is an important humanitarian andeconomic investment. They are a vulnerable groupin society, often lacking political power, and theirhealth and wellbeing thus reflect the will and abil-ity of society to care for all its citizens. Thisvulnerability is perhaps most clearly seen in theproblem of child abuse, including sexual abuse,which is a significant problem in all sections ofsociety. Adult knowledge, attitudes and behaviourin health matters are learned and cemented in theformative years of childhood and youth. The UnitedNations has proposed special protection for chil-dren through its Convention on the Rights of the4 8 38Health for all targets Child, adopted in 1989, which applies to all thoseaged under 18 years unless national or federal lawsrecognize an earlier age of majority (45). Childhood mortalityIn most countries of theRegion, childhood mortality has now reached acomparatively low level. Efforts are still required,however, to decrease mortality differences betweencountries and between socioeconomic, ethnic andother subgroups within countries. Infant mortalityrates have continued to decline in recent years incountries throughout the Region. Nevertheless, ac-cording to the latest available data from around1989, 20% of the total population of the Region livein countries where rates are above 20 per 1000 livebirths. For these countries, action is still required tocontinue the reduction in the infant mortality rate.The problem of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)must also be tackled, which is estimated to accountfor 1.5 to 2.5 infant deaths per 1000 live births (46).Accidents, especially road accidents, are particu-larly important as a cause of mortality and disability,being the cause of about one quarter of all deaths inchildren aged 514 years and one third in youngpeople aged 1524 years. Childhood morbidityGreater medical know-ledge and better technology mean that more chil-dren survive premature birth, congenital malfor-mations, accidents and malignant diseases. Theirsurvival is often not free of disability and handicap.This, in conjunction with the growing prevalenceof environmentally provoked diseases such as al-lergies, means that long-term health problems willincrease among children and young people. Theyand their families require comprehensive, continu-ous and coordinated social, psychological and eco-nomic support. These developments raise ethicalissues and questions of priority that have hithertonot needed to be addressed.In many parts of the Region, infections and othertraditional threats to children's health have de-clined in importance, but vigilance is still needed.The maintenance of the established health protec-tion and disease prevention programmes, espe-cially immunization, is of prime importance.Some children are more exposed to the risk of illhealth than others: children in and after wars,refugees, immigrants, children from ethnic ininori-ties, and children from poor families. Their spe-cific problems may include mental health prob-lems (18), anxiety, problems with relationships,and aggressive behaviour. All of these may havefurther consequences in their adult lives.Although the consequences of substance abuse (al-cohol, tobacco and illicit drugs) will usually appearas physical, mental and social injuries in adulthood,increasingly the abusive behaviour is established inchildhood and adolescence. A recent survey (47) inthe European Community among young people aged1115 years showed that 61%.have already hadcontact with alcohol, and 14% could be consideredregular drinkers (i.e. they drink wine, beer, apdritifsor spirits at least once a week). Data on smokingfrom the same survey showed that, in 1990, 5% ofthe 1115 year olds already smoked at least once aweek. An earlier study (48) in 11 European countriesrevealed that by the age of 15, only one third ofchildren reported they had never smoked. Suggested solutionsBetter health for chil-dren and young people can be attained only bymultisectoral efforts. The first step is to ensurepolitically that their rights as human beings and49 Achieving better health39 members of society are protected according to theUnited Nations Convention(45).The Conventiontreats the civil, political, economic, social andcultural rights of children as elements in an inter-dependent, mutually reinforcing package. It em-phasizes the right of every child to participate indecisions affecting both the present and the future.The empowerment of children to exercise this andother rights can be facilitated through educationand other means that support the development ofself esteem, skills and abilities. The Conventionspecifically mentions the rights of all children tothe highest standard of health and medical careavailable, and to protection from abuse, neglectand other threats to health and wellbeing. Policy developmentCountries will benefit froma comprehensive policy that aims to protect thehealth of children and young people and to promotethe development of healthy patterns of living. Animportant component will be strategies to preventthe abuse of children and young people, for exam-ple through violence, sexual abuse (including childprostitution) and economic exploitation.Health goals already achieved should be continu-ously defended by programmes of prevention, healthsurveillance, family support, care and rehabilitation.Important components include good antenatal andpostnatal care as well as preschool and school healthservices. All young people should have the necess-ary information and access to services, counsellingand other support to prevent unplanned parenthood.Although all these programmes should be directedtowards the whole population of children and fami-lies, special attention should be paid to the leastprivileged groups and the individuals at greatestrisk. The outcomes of these programmes need to becontinuously evaluated.Special emphasis should be put on social and eco-nomic factors as causes and consequences of illhealth. One important area is the protection ofchildren and young people from the harmful effectsof others' smoking, through establishing their rightto a smoke-free environment (one of the principlesformulated at the Madrid conference (34)on actionon smoking). BreastfeedingContinued action is necessary insome parts of the Region both to sustain reductionsin the overall level of infant mortality and to reducethe differences between geographic areas and socio-economic groups within countries. The promotionof breastfeeding by the greatest possible propor-tion of mothers, including working mothers, shouldbe encouraged. Health professionals need to play asensitive and supportive role in encouraging womento establish and continue breastfeeding. This canbe supported by legislation on maternity leave,appropriate hospital ward routines and the imple-mentation of the 1981 International Code of Mar-keting of Breast-milk Substitutes (49,50). Health promotionThe fact that children andyoung people depend to a great extent on otherindividuals for protection and care, and are influ-enced by the behavioural patterns they witness,makes them vulnerable but also offers opportunitiesfor health promotion activities. Attitudes and behav-iours developed in childhood and adolescence re-lated to diet, exercise, sexual practices, safety habitsand the use of tobacco, alcohol and psychoactivedrugs have health consequences that continuethroughout life. Schools are particularly importantas settings in which programmes can be geared toencourage high self-esteem, interest in physical ac-tivity and the adoption of healthy lifestyles (51,52). 5 0 40Health for &l targets They can provide individuals with accurate infor-mation and empower them to take their own deci-sions. Youth organizations, clubs and sports move-ments also have an important role in promotinghealthy lifestyles among young people (53). Ac-tions taken in response to targets 14, 15, 16 and 17will also be relevant here. Long-term disabilityFinally, for children andyoung people with long-term illness and disability,appropriate intersectoral mechanisms need to beset up to ensure that they, and their families, re-ceive the necessary social, psychological and eco-nomic support to allow them to live to the fullestextent of their capabilities. Actions taken relatingto the targets on better opportunities for peoplewith disabilities (target 3) and on communityservices to meet special needs (target 30) will alsobe relevant here. Related targetsThe reduction of mortality andinjury due to accidents among children and youngpeople is discussed as part of the specific target onaccidents (target 11), and the reduction of mortalityfrom pneumonia and diarrhoeal diseases in thetarget on communicable diseases (target 5). InformationTo deepen our knowledge as a basisfor action and its evaluation, documentation on thehealth and wellbeing of children and young peopleshould be improved. This should include the view-points of children and young people and be collectedin a systematic way that suits the social context. Target 8-Health of women By theyear 2000,there should be sustained and continuing improvement in the health ofall women. This target aims at achieving:a reduction in maternal mortality to less than 15 per 100 000 live births;a substantial reduction in health problems that are unique to women;a substantial reduction in health problems of women re/ated to their socio-economic status and the burden of their multiple roles;a substantial reduction in the incidence and adverse health consequences of sexualharassment, domestic violence and rape;sustained support for women providing informal health care; 51 Achieving better health 41 a reduction of at /east 25% in the differences in maternal mortality rates betweengeographical areas and socioeconomic groups.It can be achieved by implementing strategies that:pay special attention to women's health;provide improved support and care during pregnancy, including the balanced useof perinatal technology;accordingly make significant changes in the social environment and in lifestylepatterns.ProblemstatementWomen are one of thegroups in the population that often suffer rela-tive disadvantage in terms of their health and socialstatus. Women have unique health needs that re-quire specific and tailored action within the healthand other sectors. They have health problems con-nected with the reproductive function and the meno-pause; health problems related to women's socio-economic status, including violence, rape and othersexual harassment and abuse; and health problemsand a need for support that relate to women'smultiple roles in society, especially for those womenproviding maternal or informal health care. The most frequently used indicators of health sta-tus are based on mortality data, and such indicatorssuggest that the health of women is better than thatof men. Nevertheless, the more limited data avail-able on morbidity often indicate higher levels inwomen than in men. In terms of self-reportedlevels of health, in 11 out of the 12 Member Stateswhere this information is available, a lower per-centage of women than men reported their health asfair/average or better than average. The differencesin reported health between women and men seemto be greater in those populations with poorerhealth.These indicators, however, do not adequately de-scribe the particular health problems that womenexperience. Women tend to see their health in asocial context, and not just in terms of illness orinjury. Dissatisfaction with a purely physical ap-proach to health and ill health has led in all coun-tries of the Region to the establishment of women'sself-help groups. These groups focus on a widearray of issues, using a range of methods to try toput women's health affairs on public and politicalagendas. The unique health problems of women are relatedprimarily to the reproductive function. The mostimportant of these are breast and cervical cancer(covered under target 10), genitourinary infectionsand pelvic inflammatory disease. Sexually trans-mitted diseases, notably chlamydia, also pose awidespread, though often unrecognized, threat towomen's health and fertility. Comprehensive dataon the prevalence and consequences of pelvic in-flammatory disease are not available throughoutthe Region. The scale of the problem can be illus-trated, however, by figures from studies elsewhere.They estimate that the risk of pelvic inflammatorydisease in women aged 1519 years is 1 in 8 (54),and that pelvic inflammatory disease accounts for 5 2 42Health for all targets up to 20% of hospital admissions for gynaeco-logical problems and is associated with health carecosts in the United States of over one billion dol-lars annually (55).Although maternal mortality is no longer a majorproblem in most countries in the Region, 48% ofthe total population of the Region still live incountries with maternal mortality rates above 15per 100 000 live births. In most of these countries,trends appear to be decreasing, however, in somecases clearly linked to better access to facilities forfertility control. Of particular concern are thosecountries, covering some 1.5% of the total regionalpopulation, where maternal mortality rates in 1990were higher than in 1980.Women's health problems differ according to theirage. The problems of young women tend to beassociated with limited information and experiencein dealing with everyday health issues and withsecuring access to appropriate health services. Theytend to centre around the mental and social conse-quences of adolescent pregnancy, a higher incidenceof sexual harassment and the consequences of lowsocioeconomic status. Middle-aged women experi-ence the stress and negative consequences of fulfill-ing multiple roles both as workers and as providersof care for their families. Elderly women are oftendeprived of the opportunity to lead a productive lifeand encounter negative stereotyping. Health careproviders tend to ignore the fact that the health ofolder men and women is influenced by differentphysical and social factors. Older women have tocope longer with chronic conditions such asosteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, hyperten-sion, diabetes, and consequent mobility problems.The effects are compounded where criteria for socialsecurity, such as disability determinations, and pen-sion benefits do not apply to men and women equally.The relative social position of women has a sig-nificant influence on their health status. Violence,rape and other sexual harassment and abuse canaffect women of all ages. Incidents may be domes-tic, involving family members, may occur at theworkplace, involving colleagues or bosses, or mayoccur in public places. Evidence is now grow-ing about the extent of these problems and theirlong-term effects on the health of women. Thehealth sector alone cannot deal with these prob-lems. Promising initiatives and specific projectshave been developed in some places, often basedaround self-help groups that women themselveshave initiated.Women's economic situation is generally lessfavourable than that of men. Poverty is a generalindicator for ill health but, in a survey in oneMember State (56), proportionally more womenthan men in low-income groups report their healthas being less than good. In some countries, ad-equate child support is still lacking, causing socialand economic problems for working mothers.Women often receive less formal education and areoften engaged in work that pays less, is less inter-esting and is of relatively low status. Limitedaccess to full reproductive choice through edu-cation, means of contraception and access to safeabortion can also diminish health status. Suggested solutionsThese suggested solu-tions follow the lines of a number of inter-national conventions, agreements and decisions.Member States are urged to adopt, or implementtheir existing commitments to:the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies forthe Advancement of Women (in particular,paragraphs 148162 on health) and related53 Achieving better health43 United Nations Economic and aocial Councilresolution E/CN.6/1990/L.25;the United Nations Convention on the Elimi-nation of All Forms of Discrimination AgainstWomen and the Convention on the PoliticalRights of Women;World Health Assembly resolution WHA38.27on women, health and development and follow-up reports;United Nations General Assembly resolution44/76 on elderly women; andCouncil of Europe recommendations on socialmeasures concerning violence within the fam-ily (R(90)2) and on the elimination of sexismfrom language (R(90)4). Policy developmentEvery country would ben-efit from a comprehensive policy to promote thehealth of women. This should aim to secure signifi-cant changes in the social environment and life-style patterns that influence the relative position ofwomen and should address their specific healthneeds. The policy needs to be supported by astrategy for implementation that combines nationalor federal support with local action. Health authori-ties can act as advocates and can be role models forcoordinated economic and social policies that sup-port women's health. They can also develop pri-mary and secondary care services that are accept-able to women and sensitive to their needs.Intersectoral policies are needed to promote thehealth of women. They are most likely to be effec-tive, however, if they are planned and monitored bya specific authority that has overall coordinatingresponsibility. Such a body must have access todecision-makers in key areas and include rep-resentatives of women's groups. This is in accord-ance with one of the recommendations made at theAdelaide conference on healthy public policy (57),which states that:for their effective participation in health promo-tion women require access to information, net-works, and funds. All women, especially thosefrom ethnic, indigenous, and minority groups, havethe right to self-determination of their health, andshould be full partners in the formulation of healthypublic policy to ensure its cultural relevance.In all countries of the Region, women's voluntaryand self-help groups already play an important rolein the promotion and protection of women's health.Policy on women's health should not aim to re-place or institutionalize these groups. It shouldrather create the conditions under which women'shealth can be promoted. There are a few examplesof such comprehensive policies, such as the Na-tional Agenda for Women, including the NationalPolicy on Women's Health, established in 1988 inAustralia(58,59).The following suggestions drawon these documents, as well as on the WHOreportPositive approaches to promoting women' s health(60).Activities and policies to attain this target shouldaddress issues affecting women's total life span,and not just their reproductive years. These issuesshould include reproductive health and sexuality,aging, emotional and mental health, violence againstwomen, occupational health and safety in pro-fessional and domestic workplaces, the multipleneeds of female carers, and the health effects of sexrole stereotyping.Specific action needs to be taken in a number ofareas. Services to meet women's particular healthneeds should be improved, including health infor-mation adequately aimed at women. They shouldbe given satisfactory access to advice on fertility 5 4 44Health for all targets control, contraceptionand the safe termination ofpregnancy (within constitutional and legislativeconstraints). Support and care during pregnancyshould be improved and the use of perinatal tech-nology should be balanced. Facilities dealing withdifferent aspects of women's health should be in-tegrated (such as services for sexually trans-mitted diseases, cancer screening and contracep-tion). Appropriate measures should be taken toprevent and control problems due to chlamydia.Research and data collection should be promotedin all relevant areas. Women should participate indecision-making about all matters pertaining tocommunity and personal health, including thetraining of providers of care, the allocation ofresources, monitoring the effectiveness and qualityof services, legislative and regulatory action, andconsciousness-raising. Target 9-Reducing cardiovascular disease Bythe year 2000, mortality from diseases of the circulatory system should be reduced, inthe case of people under 65 years by at least 15%, and there should be progress inimproving the quality of life of all people suffering from cardiovascular disease. This target can be achieved by:implementing preventive measures acceptable to the population that aim atreducing the levels of major risk factors such as smoking, hypertension,hypercholesterthemia, overweight and a sedentary lifestyle;improving access to effective and acceptable methods of diagnosis, including earlydiagnosis, and treatment;providing physical, psychological and social rehabilitation for people with cardio-vascular disease. Droblem statementCardiovascular diseasesare a major public health problem in Europe.In 1985, they caused 35% of the deaths among menand 30% of the deaths among women in the 25 64year age group in the Region, while for the popu-lation aged 65 and older they accounted for 54% ofall male deaths and 60% of all female deaths. Thesediseases account for about one third of permanentdisability and a large portion of health care costs.Cardiovascular disease mortality rates have declinedsignificantly in the European Region. If currenttrends continue, countries covering 44% of the totalpopulation in the Region are likely to ichieve the Achieving better health45 15% reduction in mortality for people under 65 bythe year 2000 called for in the target. The rate ofdecline in cardiovascular disease has acceleratedsince 1980. For example, the average regional mor-tality rate per 100 000 people under 65 has droppedby around 1.5 annually since 1980, compared with0.5 in the previous decade. Although cardiovasculardisease mortality rates increase with age, in somecountries decreases have been observed for peopleover the age of 65 as well as for younger groups. Todate, the decline among older people has been morerapid for women than for men. Increasing survivalrates suggest a growing prevalence of cardiovasculardisease morbidity and associated disability.Cardiovascular disease mortality rates differ greatlybetween countries. Around 1988, age-standardizedmortality rates for men aged under 65 years variedfrom ahigh of 256 per 100 000 population to a low of70. The rates for women in the same age groupvaried between a high of 104 per 100 000 and a lowof 22. For age groups over the age of 65, the variationbetween the countries with the highest and lowestmortality rates is three - to fourfold for men and three- tofivefold for women. The highest mortality rates occur incentral and eastern Europe. These differences indi-cate a large untapped potential for preventive action.During the 1980s, age-standardized rates ofischaemic heart disease declined substantially inboth sexes under the age of 65, in countries in thenorth and west of the Region. In several countries,dramatic declines have begun to occur after severaldecades of rising mortality rates. In other coun-tries, however, most of which are located in thecentral and eastern part of the Region, rates in-creased substantially during the 19S0s.The risk of cardiovascular disease is significantlyinfluenced by a number of indiyidual and populationcharacteristics. The links between habitual diet, lev-els of blood cholesterol-lipoprotein and cardio-vascular disease are well established. Smoking, es-pecially of cigarettes, contributes significantly tocoronary heart disease. High alcohol intake increasesthe risk of cardiovascular disease as well as highblood pressure. Lack of physical activity is associ-ated with high levels of the other major risk factors.Suggested solutionsThe most effective wayto reduce the mortality and morbidity associ-ated with cardiovascular disease is by the promo-tion of healthy lifestyles. The key aims are preven-tion of smoking (both preventing people starting tosmoke and helping smokers to stop), promotion ofphysical fitness, promotion of balanced nutritionincluding a lower intake of saturated fat and salt inthe diet, and better stress management. This callsfor countrywide community-based programmessupported by appropriate national or federal andlocal economic and social policy, in areas such asfood and nutrition, tobacco, alcohol, and fitnessand leisure facilities. The active participation ofthe community and the involvement of the massmedia are essential. Several countries have adoptedcomprehensive approaches to cardiovascular dis-ease prevention, including those participating intheCINDIandMONICA(on monitoring trends incardiovascular diseases) projects. Several coun-tries now have smoking prevention strategies andnutrition policies that are beginning to show posi-tive results. Measures discussed under the targetson healthy living (target 16) and on dealing withsmoking reduction (target 17) will also contributeto the achievement of this target.This primary prevention strategy can be supple-mented by a strategy for dealing with high-riskgroups in the population, by identifying and helping 46Health for all targets individuals in need of special protection. This willinclude the use of both non-drug and drug treat-ment to control hypertension and reduce serumcholesterol levels.For patients suffering from cardiovascular disease,the priority should be avoiding the recurrence andprogression of the disease. Improved access toeffective and acceptable methods of diagnosis andtreatment is very important in reducing the effectsof cardiovascular disease. Comprehensive careshould include physical, psychological and socialrehabilitation, and advice on the modification ofbehaviour to reduce risk. Attention also needs tobe given to the quality of care and the use ofappropriate technology (further discussed undertarget 31). Continued research is needed into thequality and cost-effectiveness of surgical andnonsurgical treatments. The quality of life ofpeople with cardiovascular disease must also bemaintained and monitored.Finally, priority must be assigned to this issue bymaking greater efforts to promote the spread of theknowledge that has been obtained and to initiatechanges in the structure and practices of the healthsector. This will involve a reallocation of resources,stronger emphasis on prevention in health servicepractice and new approaches to training primaryhealth care workers. Target 10-Controlling cancer By the year 2000, mortality from cancer in people under 65 years should be reduced by atleast 15% and the quality of life of all people with cancer should be significantly improved. This target can be achieved if:the incidence of tobacco-related cancer is reduced as a result of major efforts todecrease smoking rates;cervical and breast cancer mortality is reduced through the establishment ofscreening and early treatment programmes including steps to improve acceptance;living and working environments are made more healthy;the best available knowledge in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and palliativecare is applied in an appropriate way to all peop/e with cancer. 5 7 Achieving better health47Problem statementCancer is a major publichealth problem and an important concern forpeople in the Region. In 1985, for the EuropeanRegion as a whole, cancer caused about 30% of alldeaths among men and 40% of those among womenin the age group 2564 years. Although somecountries show decreasing trends for standardizedmortality from cancer in people aged under 65,nearly two thirds of the population of the Regionlive in countries where cancer mortality is stillincreasing.Cancer mortality varies considerably between coun-tries. Around 1988, for those aged under 65, mor-tality rates ranged from 175 to 67 per 100 000population for men and from 107 to 56 for women.The countries in the central and eastern part of theRegion have the highest mortality and the mostunfavourable trends.The increase in overall cancer mortality during the1980s has been due mainly to lung cancer, whichaccounts for around one third of all cancer deaths inmiddle-aged men. Breast cancer is the leadingcause of death from cancer among women in allcountries. Mortality rates for breast cancer areincreasing in most countries for both under andover 65-year-olds, though the rates vary consider-ably between countries. Mortality rates from cervi-cal cancer are decreasing in most countries for bothage groups, 064 years and 65 years and over,although they vary considerably between coun-tries. Some countries have reported an increase inthe incidence of melanoma, predominantly due tooverexposure to sunlight.The risk factors associated with cancer present amixed picture. The prevalence of smoking has de-creased among males in the 11 European countrieswhere information on trends is available. Reportedtrends for women are less favourable, with 5 out ofthe 11 countries showing an increasing prevalenceof smoking, albeit from initially low levels. Debatescontinue about the importance of dietary factors,such as greater consumption of animal fat in thedevelopment of cancer and a greater consumption offibre in cancer prevention. Overexposure to sunlightis a growing problem(61).Considerable progress could be made in cancer con-trol(62).Ten Member States have a cancer policy ornatipnal plan, but not all of them are comprehensiveand the priorities set in policy are not always re-flected in programme activities and resource allo-cation. Only one quarter of the countries in theRegion are fully covered by population-based can-cer registries that provide the necessary foundationfor planning, managing and evaluating cancer ser-vices. The resources available for cancer control areoften inappropriately distributed because modernmanagerial techniques are not used in priority set-ting. Preventive health education has rarely beensupplemented with legislative and regulatory meas-ures that would make it more effective. The potentialof screening for early detection has not been fullyrealized because of problems in organizing the ser-vice and lack of acceptance by the women for whomthe service is intended. Excessive emphasis has beenplaced on providing treatment, and resources areoften wasted on therapy that is ineffective, whilepalliative care and pain control, which would im-prove the quality of life for cancer patients, havebeen neglected. Properly trained health profession-als with knowledge of treatment and supportive carepractices are also scarce.Suggested solutionsEvery country shouldconsider the potential benefits of comprehen-sive cancer control policies that make an explicit58 48Health for all targets political commitment to improving prevention andtreatment(63).Such policies should define theobjectives of comprehensive cancer control and therelative priority of each objective, and indicate theresources and measures required to attain theseobjectives. In many instances, this policy will bepart of an overall plan for the prevention andcontrol of noncommunicable disease.A striking example of the benefits of a long-termcommitment to cancer prevention can be found inthe experience of one Member State (64).Over theperiod 19701987, this country reduced cancermortality in people under 65 by 22% through acombination of anti-smoking campaigns and inten-sive screening of specific groups. Primary preventionStrategies for implementationneed to strike the appropriate balance between pre-vention, treatment and care. They can be based oninformation obtained from population-wide cancerregistries, either covering the entire country or somesuitable sample of different areas or regions. In mostcountries, the prevention of smoking should receivemore attention than it does at present. Reduction ofsmoking, by preventing the recruitment of new smok-ers and helping existing smokers to stop, would bethe most important contribution to the primary pre-vention of cancer (measures for smoking preventionare discussed under target 17) (65).It would alsoreduce the incidence of other conditions, notablycardiovascular disease (target 9). Environmental in-itiatives such as reducing occupational exposure toasbestos (targets 21 and 25), preventing air pollution(target 21) and lowering iatrogenic exposure to X-rays will make an important contribution to a reduc-tion in cancer incidence. Modifications in diet andchanges in sexual and reproductive behaviour mayalsohave a beneficial effect.ScreeningEvidence shows that mortality fromcancer of the cervix and breast could be substan-tially reduced by regular screening followed byimmediate treatment (66,67). The greatest declinesin cervical cancer mortality have occurred in coun-tries that have compleie registration of the eligiblepopulation combined with individual invitation forscreening and follow-up programmes. Screeningprogrammes must be accessible and acceptable towomen and should include counselling services todeal sensitively with the consequences of falsepositive and false negative findings. Both scien-tific and cost considerations will be necessary todecide the periodicity of screening. Physicians andnurses engaged in primary care can play an impor-tant role in encouraging women to use such pro-grammes. Intensive efforts should also be made todevelop techniques for the early detection andtreatment of other types of cancer. Screening meth-ods for colorectal cancer are at present under inves-tigation. CareThe use of guidelines on the management ofcare(68)can help to ensure that people receivequality care throughout the health service system(see target 31). Higher priority also needs to be givento the organization and delivery of palliative care inthe community, with attention to the timely move-ment of patients from intensive treatment to support-ive care (69). Voluntary organizations and self-helpgroups can play a major role in the rehabilitation ofcancer patients. Pain control deserves more atten-tion, with better training of health professionals anda review of drug legislation to make relevant phar-maceuticals more easily available in the community(70).The quality of life of people with cancer mustalso be maintained. Monitoring is vital in all set-tings where people with cancer are undergoing treat-ment or palliative care. 5 9 Achieving better health49 Education, training and research More inten-sive efforts need to be made to spread currentknowledge about diagnosis and treatment amonghealth care personnel. Finally, emphasis shouldalso be given to population-based research on can-cer prevalence and to evaluating the effectivenessof cancer control measures. Target 11Accidents By the year 2000,injury,disability and death arising from accidents should be reduced byat least25%. This target can be achieved through:joint action by the health, education, transport, law, engineering and industrialsectors to reduce accidents related to traffic, home, work, sports and leisure, givingpriority to reducing by 25% death and injury in children and young people;rapid response to the health needs that arise during emergencies and disasters andtheir aftermath. problem statementAccidents are a signifi-cant public health problem in the EuropeanRegion, causing death, injury and prolonged dis-ability. While the overall scale of mortality fromaccidents is known, fewer data are available on theextent of injury and prolonged disability. Accidentstake a wide variety of forms including road acci-dents, drowning, fires and falls in the home, andpoisoning by chemicals and medicine; they alsooccur in association with sports and leisure activi-ties. They occur disproportionately among chil-dren, young people and the elderly. Unintentionalinjuries, in addition to causing severe human suf-fering, have enormous repercussions in lost pro-ductivity and medical care costs.Road accidentsAlthough the incidence of roadinjuries has declined by 18% since 1970, roadaccidents are still one of the main causes of deathamong young people, especially males. In 1985,around one third of all deaths in the age group1524 years were caused by road accidents. Alco-hol use is known to be a significant factor in a largeproportion of road accidents (71 ). Occupational accidentsOccupational accidentsare indicators of system failures at the workplace,with an estimated risk of 3 accidents per 100 work-ing population per year, resulting in a mortalityrate of 5.96 per 100 000 working population (72).60 50Health for all targets Accidents and falls associated with the handling ofequipment remain the largest cause of morbidity,accounting for millions of days of time lost fromwork and high health care costs. In many countries,accidents at work are decreasing because of im-proved safety measures. Nevertheless, the infor-mation needed to identify the factors that lead tooccupational accidents, including exposure to un-safe products, is not always available. Home and leisure accidents Home and leisureaccidents are known to be major causes of morbid-ity, particularly among children and the elderly(73). The risk of poisoning varies from country tocountry, involving several different agents includ-ing medicines, household products and pesticides.Burns are also a common problem. The gmwinginterest in physical fitness has increased the numberof people participating in sports activities, with aconsequent increase in the number of accidents. DisastersEmergency situations resulting fromnatural and man-made disasters are a significantproblem, as they are unpredictable and affect manyservices. They always require the rapid provision ofemergency health services. Chemical and radiationaccidents also require rapid identification of thetoxic agent involved and the applic...tion of appropri-ate countermeasures. The long-term effects of disas-ters are also significant. In addition to medical careand access to water and sanitation facilities, foodand shelter may have to be restored while servicesmay have to be provided to deal with the psychosocialproblems associated with the disaster (74 76).Suggested solutionsPreventing accidents andreducing injuries require the combined effortsof many fields. Health, education, transport, urbanplanning and many branches of industry need to takeintersectoral action based on strong advocacy led bythe health sector (see target 37). In designing ormodifying living and working environments, par-ticular attention needs to be paid to eliminating andreducing hazards (see Chapter 5). Priority should begiven to research into, and the achievement of,product safety through legislative controls, the useof standards and the appropriate use of economicincentives. Research is also needed on human be-haviour patterns and accident psychology.The consequences for individuals' health of acci-dents or disasters necessitate action to provideappropriate acute medical intervention, rehabili-tation services, and support for those sufferinglong-term disability (see targets 3 and 4). Road accidentsMany initiatives have beenlaunched to improve the safety of transport. Theseinclude improving road networks, imposing speedlimits, harmonizing the dimensions of vehicles,adding new safety features to vehicles, introducingseat belt regulations, and using education and thelaw to improve drivers' behaviour. Strong meas-ures to prohibit drinking and driving are particu-larly important (see target 17). These initiativeshave considerably reduced accidents and injuries.Traffic saturation on routes continues to be a prob-lem, but can be eased by improvements in publictransport networks. Population growth and indus-trial development in many European cities is caus-ing congestion through competition for scarce space.Solutions to these problems will require progress-ive changes in the pattern of life in urban areasand, in some cases, regional planning will be neededto reverse the flow of population towards urbancentres.61 Achieving better health 51 Occupational accidentsWhile the number ofaccidents and injuries in the workplace is declin-ing, the continued development of new technologi-cal processes will require a corresponding develop-ment of protection for the workforce. The role ofoccupational health services in tackling this prob-lem is covered in target 25 (77). Home and leisure accidents In most cases,home accidents can be prevented by simple meas-ures, but the general population needs to be moreaware of how to make their homes safer places.Education and information campaigns will assist inthis, and should be aimed particularly at the needsof children and the eiderly. Rules to promote safeparticipation in sports and leisure activities need tobe reinforced and implemented. Greater safety insports can be achieved through the use of safersports equipment, protective devices and betterfacilities.Educational programmes on accident preventionmust start early, for example with expectant par-ents and preschool children. This is crucial in viewofthe high number of accidents affecting childrenand because life-long values and behaviour pat-terns are formed, to a large extent, in early life. DisastersTo respond effectively to natural andman-made disasters, programmes need to be devel-oped at the national, federal, regional and districtlevels to maintain a state of preparedness for disas-ters and to alleviate their consequences. Theseprogrammes must be intersectoral and should in-volve services such as health, environment, com-munications, transport and public information, toensure coordinated management. They need to pro-vide for a rapid response during both the emer-gency and the rehabilitation phases associated withdisasters. Community health workers must betrained in areas where disasters are likely to occur,as well as in adjacent communities that may beaffected by the disruption of the health infrastructurein the disaster area. The network of WHO collab-orating centres for disaster preparedness needs tobe reinforced. The centres participation in trainingin preventive and mitigatory measures in MemberStates needs to be developed. Target 12-Reducing mental disorders and suicide By the year 2000, there should be a sustained and continuing reduction in the prevalenceof mental disorders, an improvement in the quality of life of all people with such disorders,and a reversal of the rising trends in suicide and attempted suicide. 62 52Health for all targets This target can.be achieved through:improvement in societal factors, such as unemployment and social isolation, thatput a strain on the individual;improved access to measures that support people and equip them to cope withdistressing or stressful events and conditions;improved access to measures that support carers, both formal and informal, andpeople with mental disorders, especially dementia;development of comprehensive community-based mental health services withgreater involvement of primary health care;special efforts to prevent health-damaging types of behaviour such as substanceabuse;programmes for suicide prevention.Droblem statementAt least 5% of the popu-lation in the Region is estimated to suffer fromserious diagnosable mental disorders (neuroses andfunctional psychoses), although prevalence esti-mates vary widely from study to study (78 - 80).At least an additional 15% of the population isestimated to suffer less severe, but potentially inca-pacitating, forms of mental distress. These con-ditions affect social wellbeing and create the risk ofmore serious mental health problems and life-threatening behaviour such as suicide, violenceand substance abuse.Demographic trends in the European Region meanthat dementia will become an increasing problemin the future, as the prevalence of dementia isstrongly age-related. A meta-analysis of 47 studies(81) yielded average estimates of the prevalenceof moderate or severe dementia of 1.4% for the65 - 69 age group, rising to 38.6% for the90 - 95 age group. Recent studies show the lowestestimates for these age groups to be 0.6% and 19%respectively (82).Conditions that increase people's vulnerability tomental distress are increasing. They include stress-ful lifestyles, prolonged unemployment, high mo-bility and weakening of family and social networkswith resulting loss of social support and growingsocial isolation (31). Current socioeconomicchanges, particularly in the central and eastern partof the Region, add an additional dimension to theseproblems. Po.itical change throughout the Regionis likely to encourage greater migration in thefuture. Indicators of social violence, such as deathsfrom homicide and purposeful injury, are rising.In most countries, suicide rates in 1988/1989 werehigher than in 1970. Some countries that showed asignificant increase in suicide rates during the 1970sand early 1980s are now experiencing a levellingoff or a slight decline. In other countries, however,data for the late 1980s still show increasing trends.In 1985, suicide was the first, second or third mostprevalent cause of death in adolescents and youngadults, depending on the country. In the EuropeanRegion as a whole, it accounted for 15% of deaths63 among males aged 1524 and 19% 2534, with rates of 12% and 14%, respec-tively, for females in the same age groups. In mostcountries, rates of suicide for those over 65 years ofage are high compared with rates for other agegroups. This will become an increasingly impor-tant problem as the population ages. Data on theincidence of attempted suicide and deliberate self-harm are not available on a complete or consistentbasis throughout the Region. Reports from a numberof centres suggest, however, that parasuicide, whichis most prevalent among those age 2 15 39, seemsto have increased dramatically over the past twodecades (83,84), even taking into account the diffi-culties of interpreting data on parasuicide in differ-ent countries, cultures and religions.Progress in moving from institutional care to flex-ible comprehensive community-based mental healthservices appears to be slow. Existing mental healthservices have not been well integrated with primarycare provided through general practitioners or healthcentres, even where there is a stated intention to doso (85). Increases in the number of mental healthprofessionals with specialized training have not beenaccompanied by any development in coordinatedapproaches to care and integrated clinical practice,especially for those requiring long-term care. Thereduction in the number of large mental hospitals isa positive trend in the Region, but the size of remain-ing mental hospitals continues to be large and theycontinue to operate alongside, rather than within, thegeneral health care system. The number of psychi-atric beds in general hospitals has grown by 50%,but it remains less than 10% of the total beds setaside for psychiatric care (86).Achic- /ing better health53 and mechanisms to support a comprehensive set ofcommunity-based services. Such services need tobe made more accessible and appropriate and mustactively reach out into the community. They shouldbe based on policy, legislation and furiding mech-anisms that support their development. Mentalhealth programmes need to be better coordinatedwith primary hc alth care, public health and socialservices at the community level, and the staffinvolved need broader training (see target 28 onprimary health care and target 30 on communityservices to meet special needs). The quality of lifeof people with mental disorders will have to bemeasured to assess the provision and quality ofsuch services. Quality of servicesThe development of moresensitive care for mentally ill people needs to begiven priority. This will require a more holisticapproach to the training of health and social carepersonnel, as well as better information for thepublic about available services. Efforts are re-quired to continue the move from institutional tocommunity-based care wherever possible (see tar-get 29). The human rights and auality of life ofpeople who are in hospital because of mental healthproblems must be maintained and protected. Sev-eral Member States have suitable monitoring sys-tems: external observers or committees, set up withappropriate representation, have rights of visit andaccess to protect human rights in hospitals (seetarget 38). Representatives of people with mentaldisorders, their carers and voluntary organizationsworking in the field need to be actively involved inshaping the planning and provision of services. Sunested solutionsImprovements in mentalPreventionNew and more widely available ap-health will require the development of structures proaches are needed to equip people to deal with 64 54Health for all targets the distressing conditions associated with culturaland social change in society (31).The discussionunder the individual targets in Chapter 4 providesspecific examples of measures that can be adopted.These include educational programmes to strengthenpeople's coping skills and preventive interventionfor people facing crisis, unemployment or socialisolation. They also include programmes that willstrengthen both formal and informal social net-works, as well as specific measures to providesupport to people with mental health problems, andto their carers, both formal and informal. Theservices involved must be made available in pri-mary care settings. An important primary preven-tion measure is to design living and working en-vironments with mental and social needs in mindand provide ettings that help to break down socialisolation and encourage participation in commu-nity life (see targets 24 and 25). Because of theirgrowing numbers, the particular needs of migrants,the unemployed and other vulnerable groups in thepopulation require priority attention. SuicideReversing trends in suicide rates willrequire national or federal and local programmesfor suicide prevention. At least one Member Statehas already started implementing a comprehensivenational programme, the first stages of which in-volved research and the planning of strategy. Prac-tical preventive programmes have now begun andwill be followed up and evaluated. Better coordi-nation is particularly important between mentalhealth services and those provided by general hos-pitals, primary care services, substance abuse ser-vices and voluntary groups. Information on effec-tive approaches needs to be more widely dissemi-nated, and monitoring and research need to beimproved. The role of the media also needs atten-tion(83).Substance abuseSpecial efforts are needed toprevent the problems associated with health-damaging behaviour such as substance abuse. Atpresent, a health promotion approach, directed ateducating families and strengthening the skills ofyoung people, appears to be the most realisticmeans of affecting positively the formation ofrelevant attitudes and behaviours at an early stagein life. The role of families, schools and preschooleducation in this process will be decisive. Servicesfor mental health and for drug and alcohol abusealso need to be more closely integrated at the locallevel. Specific examples of approaches that can beused are discussed further under target 17 (tobacco,alcohol and psychoactive drugs) and other targetsin Chapter 4. ResearchInternational comparative research intothe causes, consequences and incidence of mentaldisease and mental distress will help improve theplanning and provision of services for the future.

The lifestyles of societies, socialgroups and individuals overlap to create recurringpatterns of action. Attitudes, competence and be-haviours that influence health are shaped by thisexperience and the social meanings inferred fromit. They are not merely rational decisions to acceptor avoid health risks. T1-neans that healthylifestyles have to be promoted as realistic andattractive alternatives that people can, in fact, actupon. \"To make the healthy choice the easierchoice\", one of the guiding principles of the healthfor all philosophy and especially of health pro-motion, means cicating opportunities for people totake practical action.Since 1984, when the European health for all tar-gets were adopted, public interest in positive health,in healthy ways of living and eating, and in physi-cal and mental wellbeing has increased in the Euro-pean Region. This trend has been supported bymedia interest in health issues and in the spread ofhealth promotion programmes. Although many fac-tors may have influenced this development, thestrong lifestyle and health component of the Euro-pean health for all policy and the correspondingRegional Office programme must surely haveplayed an important part in raising awareness andmotivation.In most countries, however, successes in lifestylechange have been confined largely to the middlestrata of society, where socially and economicallyprivileged people have greater opportunities to livehealthy lives. Disadvantaged people who face basicproblems in their daily lives have less time andfewer resources to devote to healthy lifestyles andenvironmental concerns. Practices that are harmfulto health, such as smoking and excessive use ofalcohol, tend to occur more frequently amongpeople with low incomes, partly as a means ofcoping with stress. The resulting inequitable ac-cess to health remains a major challenge for healthpolicy. It puts some individuals and families at adisadvantage, and results in high costs to society.TheOttawa Charter: a strategy for health pro-motionThe relationships between lifestyles, 5970 60Health for all targets environment and health are complex, as are theimpacts of policies that shape them. In conceptualterms, they are expressed as multidimensionalmodels that can be difficult to translate directlyinto action. The Ottawa Charter for Health Pro-motion (1), adopted at aWHOconference in 1986,addresses this challenge. It stresses a new healthfor all mandate for the health sector that goesbeyond traditional health services. It emphasizeshealth rather than illness. This new health mandatehas three key features. It aims to enable people toreach their full health potential; it encourages ad-vocacy for health; and it seeks to mediate conflict-ing ihterests in society so as to support healthdevelopment.The Charter has set a new direction for healthpromotion by defining a comprehensive, butstraightforward, strategy with five components:healthy public policy, supportive environments,personal skills, community action and reorientedhealth services. Building healthy public policy Policies thatshape the economic and social conditions underwhich people live also create opportunities andincentives for them to select or reject healthy pat-terns of living. The policies of governments and ofthe private corporations that control the productionand promotion of certain consumer goods affectlifestyles in ways that are at times harmful. Tar-get 1 (equity in health) addresses tile link betweenpoverty and ill health. The promotion of healththrough lifestyle changes can only be effective ifthe political and societal resolve exists to improvethe overall standard of living.Healthy public policy (2) provides the foundationfor promoting physical and social environmentsthat support the adoption of healthy patterns ofliving. Its aim is to ensure equitable access to theprerequisites for health, whether in the form ofconsumer goods, supportive living environments orservices that contribute to healthy living. It helps tomake healthy choices the easy choices. Decision-makers at all levels and in all sectors must be awareof the consequences for health of their decisions.They must also be willing to accept their share ofresponsibility for health in their communities.Ethical issues must be considered when healthypublic policies are being devised. A delicate bal-ance must be achieved between respect for theindividual's right to free choice and the duty ofsociety to promote the health of its population. Creating supportive environments Health iscreated in the context of everyday life. The environ-ments of work, learning, leisure and family lifemust be health enhancing. Supportive environ-ments have both physical and social dimensions. Astrategy for creating supportive environments muststrengthen the social support systems that are of-fered by families, friends, self-help groups andother social network& These can provide benefitsin everyday life as well as support in adversecircumstances, such as unemployment and mi-gration (3,4).In many areas, urbanization and technological devel-opment are rapidly changing the environment. Suchchanges can present opportunities to influence eventsin the interest of the promotion of health. Fortu-nately, public concern for the protection of natural,built and social environments is becoming stronger,as is concern for the conservation of resources. Thisprovides an essential bridge between environmentalconservation and the promotion of health. 71 Lifestyles conducive to health 61 Developing personal skillsStrengthening peo-ple's capacity to make personal choices and copewith stressful situations is a formidable challengefor modern society. Self-esteem is an essential partof a person's ability to apply health knowledge andchoose a healthy lifestyle. Health education mustparticularly emphasize personal and social devel-opment and the building of health competence.Recognition of the importance of personal skills asa basis for a healthy lifestyle is leading to a newemphasis in health education on empowerment.This means developing people's skills and high-lighting their options so that they can exercisemore control over their lives. Strengthening community action Communitiesin modern society do not always define themselvesthrough physical proximity. Many arise aroundcommon issues or causes, such as self-help groupsand environmental conservation.Involving communities in setting priorities, mak-ing decisions and taking action lies at the heart ofeffective health promotion. Successful initiativesthroughout the European Region have been basedon this principle, for example in cardiovasculardisease and in women's health.Community-based health promotion strategies haveseveral benefits. They draw on existing human andmaterial resources while strengthening people's senseof self-worth, widening their knowledge base andexpertise, and providing them with an avenue forsocial support. They create a sustainable and adapt-able resource, sensitive to social and cultural values. Reorienting health services Health for all urgesthe whole of the health service sector to movetowards health promotion. This means that healthcare must include a focus on health and diseaseprevention. Organizational changes are now takingplace in several countries in the Region to embracean expanded mandate in health promotion, to em-phasize disease prevention in primary care, to in-clude health education as part of patient services inhospitals, and to strengthen health care facilities assettings that promote health.Health services are major employers. Their staffform an important reference group for the rest ofthe community. Their active participation in healthpromotion and their own example can therefore beof added benefit to the whole population.Sickness insurance funds, where they exist, canalso be involved in health promotion and diseaseprevention programmes. rive interrelated targets The targets in thischapter weave together the five components ofthe Ottawa Charter to create a comprehensive ap-proach to the support of positive changes in livingpatterns. This can be characterized as an environ-mental approach in that it explicitly recognizes theconstraints and impacts of physical, economic,social and cultural environments on the choicesand actions of individuals and groups. It seeks topromote health by modifying such constraints andinfluences as well as by working with individuals.The targets require the mobilization and moti-vation of a wide range of partners, both inside andoutside the health sector, as advocates for healthand as mediators between differing interests insociety. They also require widespread efforts toempower individuals and groups to exercise morecontrol over their lives and their health. The ta, -etsemphasize health promotion, intersectoral action72 62Health for all targets and community participation, which are key prin-ciples of the health for all strategy.Fig. 3 groups the targets of the chapter into policy,action and outcome. Target 13, on healthy publicpolicy, calls on both the public and the privatesectors to adopt policies that will support health. Theimplementation of such policies will provide the basisfor the changes sought in target 14, which focuses ondeveloping opportunities for health promotion in allthe settings of daily life: workplaces, schools, homes, Fig. 1neighbourhoods and cities. Target 15 deals with theneed to develop public and professional competencein health, including effective health education forthe general population supported by well informedand trained health professionals, and the need toincrease health awareness in other sectors. The lasttwo targets address effective health promotion. Tar-get 16 is concerned with healthy patterns of living.Target 17 deals with reductions in the health-damaging consumption of substances, such as alco-hol, tobacco and drugs, that create dependence.

This target can be achieved if:policies are formulated as an essential component of health for all policy in MemberStates and are continuously updated and developed;the impact on health of existing puLic policies in all sectors is periodically assessed;mechanisms are being used at country, regional and local levels to involve peoplein policy-making and implementation;effective mechanisms are being used at country, regional and local levels to supportintersectoral action;legislative, financial and administrative support for health promotion is strength-ened and investment in health increased;indicators are developed to provide the basis for monitoring progress towardshealthy patterns of living. problem statementCommitmentto healthypublic policy varies significantly betweenMember States. Where progress is being made, it isoften fragmentary and half-hearted. The rapid paceof social, economic and political change, particu-larly in central and eastern parts of the Region,risks eroding any progress that has been madebecause of economic scarcity, fiscal upheaval andpolitical transition. There is a gross imbalance inthe influence on policy exercised on the one handby several powerful and wealthy interest groups,such as the tobacco and food industries, and on theother by those concerned with public health. Forsome products, such as tobacco, WHO's attempts todevelop an international consensus on policy havebeen supported by the European Community, butsuch cooperation needs further strengthening. Ef-fective means to ensure consumer involvement inpolicy development do not exist in many MemberStates.The economic and political priorities of countriesare often inconsistent with progress towards healthypublic policy. Recent WHO conferences have ex-posed this conflict, including the European Con-ference on Tobacco Policy(5)held in Madrid in 7 4 64Health for all targets 1988,and the European Conference on Food andNutrition Policy (6) in Budapest in 1990. Severalareas of policy conflict are now widely recognized.First, government subsidies are used to support theproduction of unhealthy products. Under the Com-mon Agricultural Policy, for example, the Euro-pean Community has subsidized tobacco and alco-hol production as well as a range of less thandesirable food products. The current estimated valueof these subsidies for tobacco alone is aboutUS $1500 million (7).Second, controls on the advertising of unhealthyproducts such as alcohol and tobacco are inad-equate in most countries. In one country (8), thetobacco inductry was recently estimated to be spend-ing more than US $300 million per year to promotesmoking. This amounted to about US $6 for eachperson in the country.This d, products officially considered dangerousand unhealthy in one country are often exported toother countries, particularly developing ones. Ex-amples of such products are tobacco with high tarcontent, dairy and animal produce with a highconcentration of fat, and hazardous pharmaceuti-cals.Fourth, the pricing and taxation of consumer prod-ucts often work against healthy choices. Whilealcohol and tobacco have often been priced at highlevels to discourage consumption, these prices donot always keep pace with inflation. At the sametime, products and services that contribute to health,such as fresh fruit and vegetables, non-alcoholicdrinks, exercise facilities and contraceptives, arenot subsidized enough to promote easy access.This results in the purchase of less healthy prod-ucts, especially among lower income families.Fifth, urban planning and construction practicesoften fail to recognize the need to create environ-ments that are safe, accessible and conducive tosocial interaction and physical activity. Insufficientgreen space is allowed for play and recreation, theneeds of car drivers are placed before the conven-ience and wellbeing of pedestrians and cyclists,and urban renewal projects often ignore the impor-tance of maintaining socially cohesive neighbour-hoods. Suggested solutionsThe effective formu-lation and implementation of healthy publicpolicy require the creativity, resources and com-mitment of many people, including the generalpublic, those in government, business, industryand the media, and professional groups. Legisla-tive, financial and administrative support are alsoneeded if health promotion is to be strengthened(2,9).Countries with market economies (or moving to-wards such structures) must see public policy forhealth as an investment, with a considerable long-term pay-off in both social and economic terms.Countries reforming their economic structure todecentralize commercial planning and organiz-ational management need to make special efforts toensure that the benefits and methods of healthypublic policy are made widely known to decision-makers throughout the political and economic sys-tem.The growing public concern about wellbeing, en-vironment and ecology and the increasing activityof consumer groups provide the support needed tobegin progress towards healthy public policy. Theactive involvement of the community is crucial;without it, healthy public policy will not receive 75 Lifestyles conducive to health 65 the popular ar ci political support it needs. Poli-ticians and other decision-makers in all sectorsneed to be highly conscious of the impact theirdecisions have on people's health. Better infor-mation and health impact analysis will help sup-port this process, as will investment in research andin the dissemination of up-to-date knowledge.A comprehensive examination of the health needs,capacities and prerequisites of population groups isthe most effective approach to the development ofhealthy public policy. The population targets inChapter 3 address groups that must receive urgentattention if equity in health is to be achieved. Thesettings approach described in target 14 provides adecentralized strategy for implementing healthypublic policy.Knowledge is growing rapidly about the organiz-ational structures and management systems thatsupport the formulation and implementation ofhealthy public policy. Five years ago, this experi-ence was limited to national or federal governmentorganizations, but it has now become much morewidely available at regional and local levels.National and federal experience has mainly beengained with policies that influence access to con-sumer products such as food, tobacco and alcohol.This experience illustrates the importance of estab-lishing mechanisms that ensure continuity in policydevelopment, maintain the interest of policy-makersand consolidate gains that are achieved. Experiencealso shows the importance of developing compre-hensive strategies that reinforce each other and ofproviding adequate opportunity to consult all whohave an interest in the policy outcome, includingthe general public, producers and manufacturers.Experience with the processes of policy formu-lation at the local level has been gained through theWHO Healthy Cities project and the networks withincountries associated with it. Coordinating commit-tees that direct the projects bring together citypoliticians, municipal department heads and majorinterest groups in the community. They generateinformation and awareness and search for oppor-tunities for innovative projects, such as strengthen-ing the health aspect of urban redevelopment. In-formation exchange, the building of networks, ad-vice and financial support have been used as incen-tives for project development.Europe is a long way from applying the concepts ofhealthy public policy comprehensively and con-sistently in all sectors. A growing number of exam-ples can be used, however, to explain the concept,explore its practical implications and demonstratethe creative use of policy opportunities.First, information to help consumers make healthychoices can be made more accessible and appropri-ate. Health education authorities have been pro-ducing such material for some time. In some placesconsumer groups and business are now taking onthe responsibility of doing so. In some MemberStates, the role of sickness insurance funds in-cludes informing the people they insure about haz-ards to health in general and how to avoid them,and about disease prevention. Food labels are beingused to identify levels of fat, sugar, salt and addi-tives in products. Restrictions on tobacco and alco-hol advertising are widespread and, in some Mem-ber States, standard rotating health warnings areprinted on cigarette packets.Second. environmental controls can heln to ensurepublic access to safe products and environments.Standards of water, air and food quality have beenadopted throughout the Region (see Chapter 5).In several countries, car seat belts have become7 6 66Health for all targets mandatory. Prohibition of smoking in public areasand workplaces is becoming more common.Third, taxation and financial incentives can be usedto protect the environment, improve access to pub-lic facilities and encourage healthy consumer pat-terns. Environmental protection is encouraged bysubsidies for public transport and for the produc-tion of unleaded petrol. Access to buildings can bemade easier for people with disabilities throughsubsidies for the renovation of housing and publicbuildings. Tobacco and alcohol are taxed at highlevels in several Member States to discourage theiruse and, in some cases, these revenues are used tofinance health promotion.Fourth, public financing can be used creatively toimprove access to services for health promotionand disease prevention. In several countries, self-help initiatives in health promotion are supportedthrough financial andior other resources from thepublic health service. In one country, revenuesobtained from sickness insurance funds are beingused to finance health promotion in the workplace(/0).One of the major challenges of the next decade willbe to apply the experience gained in the develop-ment and implementation of healthy public policyto a wider array of situations in more MemberStates and communities. For this to happen, policyanalysis and evaluative research will be required tocapture the knowledge that is available, coupledwith coordinated dissemination and training ef-forts to spread this knowledge throughout MemberStates and in different sectors. Target 14-Settings for health promotion By the year 2000, all settings of social life and activity, such as the city, school, workplace,neighbourhood and home, should provide greater opportunities for promoting health. This can be achieved if in all Member States action is taken in line with certain conceptsand principles, such as those of the WHO Healthy Cities network, including steps tostrengthen opportunities for health promotion in the various settings by:concentrating health promotion on settings of daily living;facilitating community participation in decisions regarding health and the environ-ment and health promotion;fostering cooperation between sectors, to create better opportunities for healthyliving;encouraging the involvement of various disciplines in health promotion. 77 Lifestyles conducive to health 67 problem statement Much disease, disabilityand premature death would not occur if set-tings where people live and work gave greatersupport for healthy living. The settings approachto health promotion uses decentralized strategiesthat aim to make the physical and social settingswhere people spend their lives contribute to theirhealth. Homes, schools, workplaces and recreationareas can all make major contributions that com-plement each other. They can minimize risks tohealth in the environment; facilitate social inter-action and break down social isolation; and incor-porate activities that contribute to the promotionof health.Problems in the physical environment that under-mine health have become widely recognized overthe past decade. The challenge that exists through-out the Region is particularly important in thecentral and eastern part. Acute problems of air,noise and water pollution and inadequate wastedisposal make healthy living impossible. The dif-ferences between wealthy suburbs and deteriorat-ing inner city neighbourhoods are increasing. Manyschools are unhealthy places for children. Em-ployers often do little to protect the safety or pro-mote the health of their employees.The social environment with all of its complexityis also a major factor in health. Households in theRegion range from multiple generations of rela-tives living together to individuals living alone.Widespread migration disrupts family units andother social support systems. Feelings of alien-ation and powerlessness are growing, especiallyamong minority groups and people with low in-comes. Social and health services are often inflex-ible and insensitive to changing social realities andspecial needs. This has a serious impact on thosewho are most vulnerable.Major contributions to health promotion can beincorporated into everyday activities. Every effortmust be made to take advantage of the oppor-tunities presented in this way.Suggested solutionsPromoting healthy set-tings for living is the strategy for implementinghealthy public policy at the local level. Four prin-ciples must be respected when developing suchstrategies. The strategies should:enable individuals and communities to exer-cise greater freedom to act in the interest oftheir own health;mediate between the conflicting interests ofvarious groups and organizations involved increating better health;facilitate the political, social, community andorganizational processes used to arrive at newstructures and methods for planning anddecision-making;create new partnerships and coalitions for healththat bring together different professional groupsand sectors, united in the common purpose ofpromoting health.The challenge is to offer incentives and support forthe creation of settings where physical character-istics and social processes interact to enhancehealthy living. Housing and neighbourhoods canbe designed to strengthen the supporting and car-ing functions of families and friends. Schools andrecreation areas can encourage social experiencesthat shape and maintain healthy behaviour amongchildren. Workplaces can be safe and offer oppor-tunities to be productive in an environment thatencourages healthy lifestyles. Health centres andhospitals can be designed and organized to encour-age an interest in health and offer models of healthy78 68Health for all targets living. The city environment can offer older peopleand those with disabilities opportunities to liveindependehtly and participate actively in communitylife. Activities to strengthen personal skills andcompetence and provide relevant knowledge canbe incorporated into the social interactions thattake place in all the settings of daily life. Vulner-able and disadvantaged groups have limited accessto services and education provided outside thenormal settings of their daily lives. Health pro-motion and health education need to operate on anoutreach basis if such groups are to be successfullytargeted.Promoting settings for healthy living requires actionthat cuts across traditional departmental lines anddemands the creativity and resources of organiz-ations in both the public and the private sectors.The achievement of equity, sustainable develop-ment and social mobility cannot be adequatelyaddressed by any single organization acting alone.The challenge is to foster a new organizational andmanagerial culture that will break down the bar-riers and establish trust between sectors to facili-tate a more comprehensive approach to solvingproblems.Many playersincluding city planners and socialworkers, housing and traffic administrators,teachers and environmental officers, business em-ployers and community activists will have to beinvolved in health promotion that has a settingsperspective. Structures will have to be created thatbring community groups, organizations and pro-fessional disciplines together. The complex, inter-related nature of physical and social influences onhealth will need to be more clearly understood,explained and addressed in decision-making.This will require new ways of providing infor-mation and training for different professionalgroups. Flexible forms of project management thatshare resources and facilitate cooperative decision-making will have to be used.The active involvement of people is a major factorin the success of a settings approach to healthpromotion. The people who live, learn and work inthe settings where health is being promoted mustbe actively involved in deciding what those set-tings willlike. People in positions of responsi-bility must give fewer directives and spend moretime and energy on negotiation. A variety of struc-tures and processes will be needed to encourageand allow people to arrive at their own definition ofissues that are important for their health, makeplans to deal with them, and work actively towardstheir implementation.Strategies for strengthening the contribution ofphysical settings to health are highly developed inthe Region. The European Charter on Environmentand Health (11), adopted in Frankfurt in 1989,provides a framework for such strategies. Meas-ures to prevent the pollution of air, water and soiland to improve waste management, all criticalhealth issues, are addressed by targets in Chapter 5,as are measures to make urban and rural settle-ments more supportive of health, and to promotethe health and wellbeing of people at work.Programmes that will facilitate social interactionin various everyday settings and strengthen theircontribution to health are less well developed.Social support clearly reduces stress and the dam-age caused by psychological responses to it. Fami-lies and social networks influence patterns of liv-ing and general wellbeing, so initiatives shouldacknowledge, facilitate and further develop thiscare and support. The activities of health and socialservice agencies should help informal care givers79 Lifestyles conducive to health 69 to perform their tasks and increase their problem-solving capacities.The main advantage of the settings approach tohealth promotion is that it allows the active in-volvement of the people most concerned and thetailoring of activities awl initiatives to their spe-cific requirements and local circumstances. Someexamples are set out below. Health-promoting schools Schools are a keysetting for the promotion of health. They can im-prove the health of the total school population andact as supportive environments for health. The so-cial, environmental and ecological aspects of schoollife offer many opportunities to promote health bothin the school and in the community outside. Toimplement this idea, a European network of schoolsis being set up jointly by WHO, the European Com-munity and the Council of Europe. Its aim is todemonstrate that schools can provide a healthy andsafe setting for working and learning. This can beachieved by addressing a number of different areas.To start with, aims should be clearly set to promotehealth and safety for the whole school community,both pupils and adults, including support staff andteachers. Action can be taken in the physical schoolenvironment by improving buildings, play areas,facilities, safety measures and meals. A compre-hensive health education curriculum should also beplanned, which incorporates school health services.The main aim of health education activities di-rected at pupils is that of empowerment. Theseactivities should strive to enable all pupils to fulfiltheir full physical, p,ychological and social poten-tial, to promote their self-esteem, and to equipthem with the skills and knowledge necessary tomake sound decisions about personal health. Theyshould also help them to be active in the preser-vation and improvement of a safe physical environ-ment, by becoming more aware as consumers.Efforts can be made to encourage healthy life-styles, and to present a realistic and attractive rangeof healthy choices for schoolchildren and staff, aswell as promoting individual, family and commu-nity responsibility for health. A further aim is tofoster good relations between staff and pupils,among pupils, and among the school, home andcommunity. Community resources to support healtheducation and health promotion can be used tosupport these activities. Health-promoting workplaces The challengehere is to make employers understand that makingthe healthy choice is a wise business decision. Thisis equally true whether the employer is a localgovernment authority, a university, a union or ahospital, or is in the commercial sector. In un-healthy working environments, many employeessmoke, some are hypertensive, overweight andsedentary, some have mental health and substanceabuse problems, many more are prone to lowerback pain, and a large proportion experience burn-out on the job.The concept of the health-promoting company isinherently simple. Every owner, manager and em-ployer, whether public or private, wants productiv-ity. Satisfied workers contribute to the efficiencyarid effectiveness of the enterprise. Absenteeism isalways costly. Unnecessary medical care costs areindefensible. Employees and their families are of-ten important customers. It therefore follows thatinvestment in the health of staff, through the creationof healthy workplaces, is a long-term benefit for theemploying organization and the wider community80 70Health for all targets as well as for individual employees. No countrycan afford to waste its health care resources, nor itslabour force, nor the competitive economic viabil-ity of its commercial sector. Healthy cities, healthy neighbourhoods, healthyhomesSignificant experience has been gainedthrough the WHO Healthy Cities project. This projectdemonstrates the importance of a strategy thatbalances a long-term sense of direction with theflexibility to take advantage of immediate oppor-tunities for action. High visibility for local healthissues is essential to gain the commitment of citypoliticians. Once such political commitment hasbeen gained, departmental structures and mana-gerial processes can be changed so that theyallow wider participation in decisions that affecthealth. Innovative cooperative projects dealingwith equity, housing, traffic control, recreation,access to public facilities and services, and otherinfluences on the quality of city life then becomepossible.Implementation depends on the strength of for-mal and informal mechanisms for intersectoralplanning and decision-making. The links betweenpolitical and executive leadership achievedthrough Healthy Cities coordinating committeesand the interdepartmental communication that isgenerated can contribute greatly to success. Theproject offices linked to these committees provideneutral ground that facilitates coordination. Theyalso offer leadership by exchanging informationand advice and seeking out opportunities for ac-tion.Especially important are mechanisms that enableinterest groups, neighbourhood associations andindividual citizens to take part in making plans anddecisions about the settings in which they have aparticular interest. In many Healthy Cities projects,citizen representatives are members of coordinatingcommittees and neighbourhood associations areinvolved in defining the needs of the community.Community development and self-help activitiesare offered financial and other support. Experiencein some local projects has shown how reachingvulnerable and disadvantaged groups through thesettings of their daily lives can help them to articu-late their views on priorities for action, empowerthem to work actively towards the promotion ofhealth in a variety of ways, and facilitate theiraccess to services. Target 15-Health competenceBy the year2000,accessible and effective education and training in health promotionshould be available in all Member States, in order to improve public and professionalcompetence in promoting health and increasing health awareness in other sectors. 8 Lifestyles conducive to health 71 This target can be achieved by:making existing knowledge about health better known;emphasizing a wider range of lifestyle issues, including self-esteem, personal skillsand social support;giving training and education in health promotion to all health professionals;training other groups and disciplines to increase awareness of health promotionopportunities;providing an effective infrastructure and adequate resources for implementing andcoordinating health education programmes.Problem statementHealth education pro-grammes have been developing in MemberStates for over 25 years. In most cases, they havefocused on giving individuals information that willhelp them change their behaviour in relation tospecific risks to health. More recently, a number ofprogrammes have addressed a wider range of life-style issues and emphasized the importance of self-esteem, personal skills, a sense of coherence in lifeand social support as prerequisites for healthy liv-ing. Despite this, lifestyles that are a risk to healthcontinue to be widely prevalent as do unsupportivephysical and social environments. Examples aresmoking, problem drinking and harmful dietarypractices, as well as environmental pollution andhazardous and stressful routines in the workplace.Personal values, beliefs, social norms and culturalpatterns are now widely recognized as major deter-minants of lifestyle. People's access to the prerequi-sites for health and the time to take advantage ofthem are equally important. Some people may dam-age their health because they are unaware of the risksthey are taking or of the possible alternatives. Otherpeople may be aware of the health risks. The dailyinfluences exerted on them may nevertheless leadthem into harmful eating, drinking and smokinghabits, sedentary lifestyles with little time for physi-cal activity and leisure, and stressful work routines.People who follow these patterns have little motiv-ation to change their lives or to seek help. They lackthe health competence and information that wouldenable them to make their own healthy choices andto resist negative social pressure. They are unableand unmotivated to take advantage of available helpand to be effective advocates for the creation ofhealthy settings for living.Problems can often be caused by a conflict betweenhealth education messages and messages that comefrom other, more compelling sources. Tobacco, al-cohol and food advertisements often advocate un-healthy lifestyle practices but make the image verydesirable. The advertisers have greater resources andbetter media expertise than are available to healtheducators. Health education needs to highlight theadvantages and enjoyable aspects of health. Theparticular needs, concerns and living patterns ofchildren, young people, women, older people, peo-ple with disabilities and ethnic minorities are notadequately reflected in educational programmes.New knowledge about physical activity, nutrition,stress, social support and other health issues takes along time to reach the public. Confusion and loss of82 72Health for all targets interest can result when this new knowledge is seento contradict other, outdated information that isstill being offered.People need support and continuous encourage-ment when they decide to change their lifestylepatterns, but facilities and programmes to giveassistance are not available in many communities.Most primary health care programmes do not treatdisease prevention as a priority, nor do they incor-porate effective health education. If health workersare to be effective advocates of health in the com-munity, able to assist those seek;ng help, they needa better understanding of the effect of environmen-tal factors on health, the influence of personalvalues and social norms on lifestyle choices, andthe dynamics of motivation and behavioural change.Effective advocacy also requires health workers tobe credible examples of healthy living, with theirown lifestyles providing role models.Budgetary resources, operational strategies andorganizational structures are often inadequate tomeet the challenge of a broader concept of healtheducation. Current evidence of cost-effectivenessindicates that a much greater investment than the 13% of health budgets now allocated to healthpromotion will be needed if significant gains are tobe achieved. In many Member States, health edu-cation authorities have not had strong enough man-dates to provide effective visible leadership. Norhave they had sufficient autonomy to resist thepolitical and social pressures that arise when life-style issues become controversial.Effective health promotion requires approachesthat actively involve leaders and workers in avariety of settings such as schools, workplaces,cities, labour unions, businesses and recreationalcentres. Unfortunately, the strategies often usedare not comprehensive enough to enlist these re-sources and gain confidence and active support.Self-help groups concerned with health issues arealso a valuable resource. But health authorities oftendo not recognize their efforts, do not provide finan-cial and technical help to strengthen them, and donot explain adequately the problems of competingclaims for resources. Advances are being made inthe use of joint initiatives between the media and thecommunity, such as community television, to buildawareness and encourage discussion of environ-mental and similar issues. Much could be done tomake more effective use of these approaches inhealth education. Of course, health education is notenough; a healthy choice needs to be available andeasy in order to be made possible. Suggested solutionsThe responsibility forhealth promotion is shared among individuals,community groups, health-related professions, healthand social service institutions and governments.Health promotion supports personal and social de-velopment through a number of measures, amongwhich health education plays a vital role (I ).Within a health promotion framework, the centralaim of health education should be to build healthcompetence among the general population. Thisrequires programmes to empower people, to im-prove their self-esteem and to help them developand use their physical, mental and emotional capa-bilities to the fullest extent (12). This can be achievedby strengtheng their decision-making, inter-personal relationships and coping strategies, andemphasizing people's options so that they canexercise more control over their lives.Health promotion must emphasize the economic,social and personal benefits of healthy living. It83 Lifestyles conducive to health 73 should adopt a positive approach that links health toenvironment, ecology and sustainable development.This means that health promotion is a key compo-nent of the health for all strategy, with health educa-tion its main tool. Health education messages needto be linked to other efforts to ensure people gainaccess to the prerequisites for health. For example,the impact of health education will be strengthenedif it is visibly linked to pricing and taxation policiesfor tobacco, alcohol and food products. Health edu-cation can also contribute to the promotion of set-tings for healthy living. In the case of health-promoting schools, this means using opportunitiesthroughout the curriculum to study and discuss allaspects of health. Support can also be given to theadult population, to become effective advocates forenvironmental improvement, linking health to eco-logical concerns and sustainable development.Experience shows that effective national or federalhealth promotion institutes must have stronger man-dates and a higher degree of autonomy. They canthen provide leadership in developing strategy andmobilizing support at the community level, as wellas providing technical and material resources, pro-moting research and disseminating new knowledge.These institutes should also develop educationalcourses and in-service training materials for all dis-ciplines and professional groups. Training pro-grammes for health promotion need to move fromcontent input to competence output.Strategies for health education must include a mix ofcentralized and decentralized actions, which recog-nize every setting in the community as an educationalopportunity and investment (see target 14). For exam-ple, school and preschool health education, healthpromotion in the workplace and adult educationcan all contribute to physical fitness programmes.Self-help groups concerned with various disabilitiesor chronic diseases, as well as those for people wish-ing to stop smoking, control drinking or lose weight,are active in health education in many countries.Commercial organizations such as food suppliersare beginning to deliver health messages both at theworkplace and in the marketplace. An important partof the strategy is to gain the confidence of suchpotential partner outside the health sector and to takethe time to find ways of helping them achieve theirown primary goals while delivering a health mess-age. The emphasis needs to be on providing politi-cal, technical or financial support and on increasingawareness of health promotion opportunities amongother groups and disciplines outside the health sec-tor.Health services should play a stronger role in pro-moting health and preventing disease by offeringmore health education( 13 ).In primary health care,this will need innovative approaches to the organiz-ation of care, systems of remuneration and staffingarrangements( 14 ).The basic and specialist trainingof physicians, nurses and other health professionalsmust give greater emphasis to health promotion.This means not only the inclusion of new subjectmatter that addresses social, economic and psycho-logical factors in lifestyle choices, but also the use ofdifferent training methods.Several major European educational campaigns forhealth offer new opportunities and support. Exam-ples are theWHOAction Plan for a Tobacco-freeEurope and the European Community programme,Europe Against Cancer.The financial and economic constraints facing allMember States mean that the cost-effectiveness ofhealth promotionits value as an investment mustbe clearly established if a sound investment policy isto be developed.84 74Health for all targets Target 16-Healthy livingBy the year 2000, there should be continuous efforts in all Member States to activelypromote and support healthy patterns of living through balanced nutrition, appropriatephysical activity, healthy sexuality, good stress management and other aspects of positivehealth behaviour. This target can be achieved by taking a holistic approach to promoting healthy patternsof living, including:increasing health and environmental awareness;developing and strengthening coping skills;promoting healthy eating patterns based on recommended nutrient standards anddietary guidelines;promoting healthy physical and other leisure activities;encouraging the giving and receiving of social support problem statementHealth promotion hasrefocused thinking about health to emphasizemeasures that help people to increase their wellbeingand protect against illness. These approaches havebeen described by using terms such as wellbeing,self-care, positive health behaviour and health main-tenance. The continuing challenge for health pro-motion is to move beyond the focus on health-damaging behaviour that predominated in the pastand to encourage examination of \"the other side ofthe coin\". It should emphasize health rather thandisease and set up a continuum for action movingfrom prevention of disease to promotion of health.This is part of a wider change in values that isemerging in the Region, promoted by ecologistsand environmental conservationists who are con-cerned about the future of the planet as well as itspeople. Recognition of the interrelationship be-tween health and the quality of the environment hasintroduced ecological ways of thinking into healthpromotion (/).Health promotion should take advantage of thegrowing body of knowledge about the positiveeffects on health of a range of personal skills, socialfactors and individual behaviours. Important amongthese are nutrition, physical activity, sexuality,stress management and family planning. Each ofthese areas poses its own particular problems to beovercome, if this target is to be achieved. NutritionOvernutrition, undernutrition and un-balanced nutrition can all lead to health problems. 85 Lifestyles conducive to health 75 The percentage of total dietary energy from fat is amajor indicator of a healthy diet. In 1989, much ofthe population of the Region lived in countrieswhere the value of this indicator was consideredtoo high (over 35%). Too little fibre and too muchfat, sugar and salt in diets are common problems inmany countries. Disorders associated with iodinedeficiency are still endemic in parts of the Region.Problems are probably also caused by iron de-ficiency in women of reproductive age. Obesity isa Fignificant problem in most countries and, sinceit is very difficult to cure when established, preven-tion is critical.Places still exist in the Region where access to foodis at times inadequate, raising questions of equity.In many countries undergoing transition from cen-tralized economies, food shortages caused by prob-lems in distribution and marketing periodicallyhave serious consequences (6).Poorly balanced nutrition may sometimes be due tolack of knowledge about diet, exacerbated by foodadvertising that encourages unhealthy choices. Themenus in cafeterias, restaurants and fast-food out-lets, however, have a more important effect on foodchoice. The development of food processing tech-nology has influenced agricultural production andfood availability more than any deliberate edu-cation campaign on nutrition. In many cases, how-ever, the effects of technology have been bene-ficial. In developing healthy public policies, it isimportant to keep in mind that food processing isthe largest industrial activity in some countries,exceeding by far that of alcohol and tobacco pro-ducers ( 15 ). Physical activityThe contribution of physicalfitness and appropriate physical activity to healthand wellbeing has become widely acknowledgedin many countries, but its full potential has yet to berealized. Physical fitness, acquired in youth andmaintained throughout life by appropriate regularphysical activity, helps maintain strength, allowsthe body to function in a healthy way, helps preventdisease and disability, and makes an importantcontribution to rehabilitation. Older people, in par-ticular, should continue appropriate regular physi-cal activity so as to preserve their functional ca-pacity as long as possible. A challenge for healthpromotion in the future will be to disseminateknowledge about what constitutes appropriatephysical exercise, counteracting any misleadingclaims from sections of the fitness industry. An-other challenge will be to secure better access tosports and leisure facilities for all groups in thepopulation. SexualitySexuality that involves supportive, car-ing, mutually consensual sexual relationships has agood effect on health. Conversely, a number ofpractices that are widely agreed to be undesirablehave a deleterious effect on health. They includethe sexual abuse of children; the physical, psycho-logical and social exploitation of men and womenthrough the purchase of their sexual services; un-safe sexual practices that lead to unwanted preg-nancies; and sexual violence, often caused by alco-hol and drug abuse.Unresolved personal and social conflicts aboutacceptable expressions of sexuality can also beimportant contributors to individual health prob-lems. People who hide their sexual orientation forfear of discrimination or other intolerant reactions,including physical violence, live less than fulfill-ing lives ( 16). They come under stress, experiencealienation and social isolation, and can be placed in8 76Health for all targets situations that are not conducive to safe sexualpractices.The emergence of the AIDS epidemic has increasedthe fear and conflict associated with issues ofsexual behaviour. It has also led to the need formore open discussion, which in some countries isnow taking place. Health promotion has an impor-tant role to play in these discussions, first, byhighlighting the value of healthy sexuality as acontributor to health and, second, by supportingthe adoption of safe sexual practices, which reducethe spread of HIV and other sexually transmitteddiseases. Stress managementThe preservation of physi-cal and mental health depends on people's ability tocope with the stresses of life, dealing with them inpositive ways rather than through health-damagingbehaviour (12). Regular physical activity, relax-ation and social interaction all promote health andare effective coping mechanisms. People who feelin control are less likely to become ill and, forthem, stress can even have a positive effect. Unfor-tunately, the lives of many people do not allowbalanced and controlled lifestyles that are con-ducive to health. Patterns of behaviour detrimentalto health sometimes arise when individuals cannotcope adequately with stresses such as rapid socialchange, loneliness, bereavement, unemploymentor unsatisfying work. Family planningAll couples and individualshave the basic right to decide freely and responsi-bly the number and spacing of their children. Insome places, this right is still not recognized andreproductive health choices still have to be madeknown and available. The lack of universal accessto safe and effective family planning can result inhealth problems, including psychological distress,raised abortion rates and unplanned pregnancies. Suggested solutionsHealthy public policy(2) provides the foundation for achieving ac-cess to health through consumer products, livingenvironments, and health and other services (seetarget 13). Efforts to achieve healthy settings forliving in the city, at home, in the workplace and atschool provide the strategy (see target 14). Healtheducation is the process that creates the publicawareness and support needed to maintain healthysettings and change lifestyles. The combination ofpolicies and strategies needed varies according tothe issues involved.The introduction of ecological ways of thinkinginto health promotion, based on increasing aware-ness of the interrelationship between health and thequality of the environment, raises central questionsfor both research and action. It shifts the emphasisfrom the effect of individual behaviour on health tothe influence of complex patterns of living. Thechanges in values promoted by ecologists andenvironmental conservationists need to be built on,and awareness of these interactions needs to bestrengthened throughout the population.Eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physicalactivity, allowing time for rest and relaxation, andmaintaining supportive social and sexual relation-ships all contribute to health. As understandinggrows of what contributes to health, the close inter-action between health and self-esteem, a sense ofbelonging and community, rewarding relationshipsand a strong sense of self-worth becomes clear. Allthese can be reinforced by actions taken to encour-age the giving and receiving of social support. S7 Lifestyles conducive to health 77 Healthy nutritionIn most societies, eating is anenjoyable experience associated with convivialsocial contact and the taste of good food. Scientificknowledge about nutrition has grown to the pointwhere the contribution to health of various nutri-ents and amounts of food is reasonably well under-stood (17). Personal taste, cultural traditions, pat-terns of social behaviour and the availability (in-cluding affordability) of food continue to be majordeterminants of what most people eat. Dietaryguidelines have to be formulated in ways that makethem useful and used. Measures that encourage theproduction of varied and nutritious food productsand equitable access to good food should be apriority for policies on food supply and nutrition.The paper on a framework and options for actiondiscussed at the first European Conference on Foodand Nutrition Policy, in Budapest in 1990, pro-vides a good starting point for such policies (6).Campaigns to promote healthy eating habits requirethe cooperation of food producers and retailers. Insome cases, this will involve joint ventures innutrition education, involving both the public andprivate sectors. The growing number of meals thatpeople consume outside their homes means thatinstitutional as well as private catering must beconsidered. Healthy nutrition will also be sup-ported by action to improve food labelling (seetargets 13 and 22) and associated measures toprovide people with the necessary information andskills to become discerning consumers of foodproducts. School health education and school mealservices have an important role to play in encour-aging healthy eating in future generations of adults.These educational programmes can be reinforcedby complementary efforts in other settings such asthe workplace and the home. In the broad attemptto help people with eating disorders, support forself-help groups is essential.Adequate numbers of nutrition experts are neededto initiate many of the activities envisaged, and inmany countries training such personnel will be animportant priority. Appropriate physical activity Appropriatephysical activity can be a joyful experience and animportant factor in improving the quality of life.Social attitudes towards physical activity have un-dergone a fundamental change over the past dec-ade, providing an excellent basis for future action.Individuals should be encouraged to incorporateappropriate physical activity into their daily rou-tine. This requires the promotion of sports andphysical activity programmes, as well as action tomake them more accessible to people in all socialand age groups. Physical activities combined withrecreation that strengthen social and family tiesshould be enjoyable and inexpensive. This requirestown and country planning to protect both opencountiyside and parks for walking, relaxing andsocializing and to provide opportunities for swim-ming and cycling. It should guarantee access tothem for people with disabilities. Good healthpromotion campaigns stimulate awareness of ac-tivities that combine social involvement with physi-cal activity. Dancing and other enjoyable forms ofphysical exercise are too often forgotten or notrecognized as being healthy. Healthy sexualitySexuality is increasingly rec-ognized as a strong human force that makes apositive contribution to health, when it is allowedexpression in the context of caring, supportive,mutually consensual relationships. Member Statesshould endorse the view that, in accordance withfundamental human rights, consenting adults candecide how to lead a healthy sexual life. Important88 78Health for all targets differences in cultural values and traditions con-tinue to exist between countries and in populations,but the rights of individuals to self-determinationin their choice of sexual orientation must also beconsidered. The challenge for health promotion isto support positive expressions of sexuality in amanner sensitive to cultural values. This meanstaking action to support the rights of all adultsto form sexual relationships with consenting part-ners of their own choice, and to promote respectand tolerance for individuals' decisions in thismatter.Knowledge about options, safe sexual practicesand contraception is essential for healthy sexuality,which also requires individuals to have personalskills and characteristics such as self-esteem toenable them to define their wishes clearly. Sexualbehaviour should be included as an integral part ofschool curricula on healthy living skills. Healthpromotion for adolescents and young adults shouldaddress sexuality and safe sexual practices. Con-doms and other contraceptives should be easilyavailable and affordable, to provide protectionagainst sexually transmitted diseases, HIV infec-tion and unwanted pregnancies. Counselling andother relevant services that are accessible, afford-able and confidential should also be available to allpopulation groups.Action is also needed to combat the problemscaused by unacceptable expressions of sexuality,such as the sexual abuse of children or adultsand the exploitation of women and men who sellsex. In the long term, education for healthysexuality along the lines set out above, togetherwith other actions designed to achieve healthfor all, should reduce the occurrence of such ex-pressions of sexuality. Where and when they doarise, a mix of appropriate legislative, educativeand administrative measures is required to dealwith them. Relevant legislation will include pro-tecting the rights of vulnerable groups such aschildren and women (see targets 7 and 8). Themanagement of sexual abuse requires appropriatemechanisms to be available to health and socialwelfare agencies, which enable them to end theabuse in a manner that does not penalize the abused.For example, where abuse occurs in the home, theabused rather than the abuser is often removedfrom the home. Experience is growing in howbest to deal with these problems. Services havebeen set up to help families and other social groupssolve problems and resolve conflicts. Informationfor vulnerable groups, particularly children, shouldfocus on ways of recognizing and exposing abused obtaining help. Special arrangements must beavailable to make the environments of vulnerablepeople safe, where necessary. In some countries,self-help groups and nongovernmental organiz-ations have carried out innovative and effectiveactivities in this area, which can provide examplesfor others. Good stress management Health promotionprogrammes must recognize the primary impor-tance of coping ability as a factor in lifestylechoices. Overeating, smoking, drinking, drug tak-ing and lack of physical exercise are indications ofan inability to cope with stress.Health professionals need to develop an interestand skills in health promotion and be ready to studythe effectiveness of new approaches. Active meth-ods of stress management that enhance health mustbe devised and promoted. These can includeproblem-solving skills, a proper balance betweenwork and leisure, the ability to relax in stressfulsituations, and the use of sports, meditation and 89 Lifestyles conducive to health 79 other recreational activities. The emphasis shouldbe on empowering people with the necessary skillsto cope effectively with stress, as well as trying toremove the causes of stress (see targets 1, 2, 14).Coping ability can be strengthened by measures topromote settings that support healthy patterns ofliving. These are settings that encourage socialinteraction, recognize and facilitate systems of infor-mal social support, allocate time for leisure andrelaxation, and encourage appropriate physical ac-tivity. They take a variety of forms. In the homesetting, whether in a rural or urban area, oppor-tunities should exist for social contact and rec-reation, and the settlement design should allowspace for recreation and encourage a strong senseof community. Workplaces must be designed torecognize the importance of social contacts be-tween workers. Health-promoting schools need toincorporate health throughout the curriculum, pro-vide opportunities for physical activity and for thereinforcement of healthy behaviour, and introduceprogrammes to strengthen coping skills in students(4). Communities also need to provide programmeson stress management that are particularly attunedto at-risk population groups such as unemployedpeople, migrants or refugees. Family planningMeasures to support familyplanning must recognize people's right to decidethe number and spacing of their children. This rightmust be supported by universal access to safe andeffective means of contraception, counselling onreproductive choices, and services such as thetermination of pregnancy where appropriate andlegal. This will require additional government sup-port in many Member States.School health education has an important role toplay in promoting healthy sexuality as a basis forindividual and family life. Such education mustencourage men and women to accept equal res-ponsibility for the avoidance of unwanted preg-nancies, for family planning and for child rear-ing. Social policies should facilitate this moreequal division of responsibility in family planningand child rearing, and include an emphasis oncommunicating the opportunities for men in theseroles. Target 17-Tobacco, alcoho: and psychoactive drugs By the year 2000, the health-damaging consumption of dependence-producing substancessuch as alcohol, tobacco and psychoactive drugs should have been significantly reduced inall Member States. 90 80Health for all targets This target can be achieved if well balanced policies and programmes in regard to theconsumption and production of these substances are implemented at all levels and indifferent sectors to:increase the number of nonsmokers to at least 80% of the population and protectnonsmokers from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke;reduce alcohol consumption by 25%, with particular attention to reducing harmfuluse;obtain a sustained and continuing reduction in the abuse of psychoactive drugs,including inappropriate use of prescribed drugs.Problem statementBehaviour that is a riskto health has been a preoccupation of healtheducation for several decades. The use of tobacco,alcohol and both illegal and prescribed psychoactivedrugs have received the most attention. Patterns ofconsumption in each of these three areas varythroughout Member States, but trends towardgreater use are still found in many places. In termsof tobacco consumption, 68% of the total popu-lation of the Region live in countries where con-sumption levels are not yet decreasing, while 61%of the total population of the Region live in coun-tries where alcohol consumption levels are increas-ing. Tobacco and alcohol use are part of the daily livesof many people in the Region. Attitudes towardsthe use of different substances vary in fundamentalways, and there are significant differences betweenparts of the Region. The drinking of alcohol iswidely accepted in almost every country. Smokingis becoming socially less acceptable, especially inwestern and northern Europe, following persistenthealth education on this issue. While the consump-tion of illegal drugs has been increasing for severalyears, this problem has not yet received wide-spread public attention.Differences in consumption patterns and trendsbetween groups in the population pose seriousproblems for the development of preventive meas-ures. Tobacco consumption, for example, is grow-ing in some places among younger age groups andwomen. The most serious concerns about drug usealso focus on the young. At the same time, sub-stance abuse in general is growing among peoplewho have fewer economic and social opportuni-ties, raising questions of equity in health.Effective policies require an appropriate balancebetween three different control measures. Educa-tion and support, legislation and regulations, andfiscal policies all have a role. Policy developmentmust ensure that the health impact of fiscal policiesis not neglected. Governments must combat mis-leading accusations that policies that aim to reduceconsumption inhibit individual freedom of choice. Tobacco Smoking is now recognized as a majorcause of lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease,chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Concern isalso growing about low birth weight in infantswhose mothers smoked during pregnancy, and thedevelopment of cancer and other diseases among 91 Lifestyles conducive to health 81 nonsmokers who are exposed to tobacco smoke.During 1985, an estimated total of just over 1.1 mil-lion deaths in the European Region were due totobacco(18).During 1990, the figure was just over1.2 million. In 1995, it is expected to be be nearly1.4 million.The general pattern of smoking in the Region haschanged considerably over the last 30 years. Sig-nificant improvements have been achieved in coun-tries that have introduced comprehensive tobaccocontrol policies and well developed education pro-grammes. While consumption has decreased in theRegion as a whole, it has continued to increase insome countries. Women and young people are nowthe targets of the most aggressive marketing strat-egies of the tobacco industry. Major cigarette pro-ducers are also taking advantage of the new mar-keting opportunities in the central and eastern partsof the Region.The harmful effects of tobacco use, in both eco-nomic and social terms, are now widely recog-nized. Nevertheless, the large profits and perceivedeconomic advantages associated with the produc-tion and marketing of tobacco have severely lim-ited the policy options for reducing consumption.Some governments neglect the potential healthimpact of fiscal policies. AlcoholDrinking alcohol is a common featureof the cultures of the European Region. It is associ-ated with conviviality, consumption of food andrelief of stress, and its widespread acc itance has afundamental influence on alcohol policy in mostMember States.The likelihood of health problems developing inassociation with alcohol use increases as theconsumption of alcohol increases. Most health-related problems occur in association with habitualdrinking in excess of appropriate levels (whichdepend on sex and other factors such as bodyweight). Other health problems arise when theconcentrated consumption of large amounts of al-cohol in a short period of time (\"binge drinking\")results in violence or road traffic accidents.In view of this, the general increase in the rates ofalcohol consumption in most countries of the Re-gion from the mid-1950s to about 1980 is disturb-ing. Consumption doubled in some countries andtrebled in a few. The most recent trends for theperiod 19861989 show that increases have con-tinued in countries covering 61% of the total popu-lation of the Region. Trends have been markedlydifferent for the consumption of beer, wines andspirits. Wine and beer have been substituted forspirits in some places, beer for wine in others, andwine for beer elsewhere. There are only two coun-tries in the Region (covering only some 3% of theregional population) in which the consumption ofspirits, winesandbeer decreased between 1986and 1989. The number of occasions on which it isconsidered appropriate to use alcohol has also tendedto increase, while drinking has spread among groupswhere it was formerly less prevalent, such as womenand young people. The introduction and accept-ance in some countries of low alcohol beer has beena welcome development. Psychoactive drugsThe use of illegal drugs hasbecome more common in many countries in theRegion over the last two decades. The harmfuleffects on individuals, their families and society ingeneral are now widely recognized. While somecountries show an encouraging trend towards thelevelling off of drug use, prevalence continues to 9 2 82Health for all targets increase in others. About one million people inthe Region are currently estimated to be dependenton illegal drugs. As economic and social changesoccur in the central and eastern part of the Region,fear is growing that trafficking in illegal drugswill become more common. The spread ofAIDSand Ho/ infection has added a serious newdimension to the illegal drug problem and is acause for increased social concern. The situationis exacerbated by the ineffectiveness of drug con-trolpolicies,byinsufficient coordination ofdrug control programmes both in and betweencountries, and by the ineffectiveness of pro-grammes aimed at prevention, treatment and re-habilitation.Awareness is also growing of the harmful con-sequences of using prescribed psychoactive drugs,owing to both inappropriate prescribing and thegrowth of an illicit market. It is, unfortunately, stillcommon practice to turn to drugs to deal withsocialandpsychologicalproblems. Theoverprescribing of psychoactive drugs, especiallyto women and elderly people, is a serious aspect ofthis problem. In some countries in the Region, theproblems are compounded by the ineffective en-forcement of laws controlling prescription.Suggested solutionsMeasures to preventsmoking and the harmful use of alcohol anddrugs are an important aspect of healthy publicpolicy (see target 13). Because of the degree ofsocial concern and conflict associated with the useof these substances and the economic and politicalinterests involved, strategies in this area should bebased on clear policies with achievable objectives.An appropriate balance should be attained betweeneducational and regulatory measures, to reflectpolitical and cultural norms.International collaboration is crucial in controllingthe harmful use of substances. A good example ofsuch collaboration is control on trafficking in il-legal drugs carried out through the United NationsCommission on Narcotics. The influence of Euro-pean Community measures on the production andmarketing of alcohol and tobacco, including sub-sidies for production in both areas, suggests a rolefor public health advocacy in these areas. Theinternational marketing practices adopted by to-bacco and alcohol companies require equivalentcooperation at the international level to combatthem, as is provided in the WHOAction Plan for aTobacco-free Europe. A European Alcohol ActionPlan has been prepared.Clear leadership at the highest appropriate level ineach country is necessary to prevent the harmcaused by substance use. This must be supportedby strategies for local action that involve the cre-ation of settings for healthy living and the use ofhealth education, especially in schools and at theworkplace. The design of health education pro-grammes must be in line with the model of healtheducation discussed earlier. They must recognizethe importance of economic and social constraintson the individual choice of behaviour. They mustrecognize that behaviour damaging to health maybe adopted as a means to cope with daily stress.Treatment and rehabilitation programmes shouldbe designed to support and complement the workof self-help groups and nongovernmental organ-izations. TobaccoAt the European Conference on Tobac-co Policy in Madrid in 1988, Member States agreedto promote nonsmoking and smoke-free environ-ments as the norm in the Region. This can beachieved through a combination of educational 93 Lifestyles conducive to health 83 programmes, regulatory measures (including tax-ation, pricing and controls on advertising), environ-mental controls creating smoke-free environments,and programmes to support people who wish tostop smoking. The challenge for the next decade isto implement the measures adopted in the guide-lines that came from the Conference.TheWHOpublication that resulted from the Con-ference (5) sets out guidelines that include a charteragainst tobacco, ten strategies for a smoke-freeEurope and a check-list of over 100 activities to bepursued by countries throughout the Region. Thecharter promotes the rights of all people to beprotected from tobacco smoke and tobacco pro-motion, to be informed of the unparalleled risks oftobacco use, and to breathe air free from tobaccosmoke at work, on public transport and in publicplaces, and the rights of smokers to receive helpand encouragement to overcome their addiction totobacco.These rights can be fulfilled by governments, busi-nesses, public services, regional and local healthservices, and nongovernmental organizations acrossthe Region. Relevant action includes legislationand fiscal measures to raise the price and curtail theproduction and consumption of tobacco, to freepeople from the promotion of tobacco, and toprovide comprehensive educational programmesfor children and adults to help them live free fromaddiction to tobacco. The suggested actions gainparticular strength from the many alliances beingbuilt to counter pressures to sell tobacco to youngpeople.Policies that have achieved the most significantresults are comprehensive in their approach. Theyinclude, for example, reducing the availability oftobacco to children, providing intensive healtheducation in schools, imposing strong c -Nntrols onadvertising, running vigorous anti-tobacco cam-paigns, making provisions for smoke-free publicplaces, and maintaining relatively high pricesthrough taxation. Where a taxation policy is used,prices should keep pace with or exceed inflation.Health education appears to be most successfulwhen carried out as part of the school and pre-school health curriculum and in work settings. Animportant development in recent years has been asteady increase in the number of settings that areestablished as smoke-free environments. They in-clude public places, transport facilities, worksites,hospitals and clinics. More emphasis needs to beput on health promotion in schools, preschool set-tings and the workplace, on smoking cessation, andon programmes for expectant young parents. Fi-nancing will have to be assured for these activities.Some Member States are concerned that measuresto discourage tobacco growing and cigarette manu-facture will have adverse effects on the economyand on employment, at least in the short term. Morecareful analysis is needed, both in countries and atthe international level, of the economic con-sequences of tobacco production. More health-oriented goods that can replace tobacco need to beidentified, and strategies developed to compensatefor lost tax revenue. Alcohol The health and social problems causedby alcohol use can be prevented or reduced both bygeneral measures to reduce alcohol consumptionand by specific measures aimed at high-risk groupsand situations.An effective alcohol policy must tackle both sup-ply, through controls on production, distribution, 9 4 84Health for all targets advertising and price, and demand, through healtheducation and prevention programmes. In addition,it must include comprehensive treatment services.The relative importance of these instruments willvary from one country to another. Countries thathave few controls on the supply side tend to em-phasize treatment or health education and preven-tion. Control policies have been shown to reducelevels of alcohol consumption and thereby themagnitude of alcohol-related problems. Politicalacceptability and public support are vital to theeffectiveness and continuity of an alcohol policy.In countries where restrictive policies have beenintroduced without sufficient public support, anincrease in illicit production has followed.The alcohol, catering and entertainment industriesare major employers and contributors to gross dom-estic product and tax revenue. The industries' struc-ture is such that a small number of firms con-trol most of the market. This, together with theindustries' international organizations, should al-low negotiation of a common approach towards acode of practice on self-regulation, for a productthat causes society not only harm but also somebenefit.At thelocallevel, broad-based multisectoralcommunity programmes are needed to achievecommunity-wide changes in lifestyle and reducethe sale and use of alcohol. Individual motivationand ability to avoid the harm done by alcohol usecan be strengthened in the settings of everydaylife such as health-promoting schools, health-promoting workplaces and healthy cities (see tar-get 14).Educational campaigns not only have an impact onindividual drinkers, but also raise support for pro-grammes that urge moderation in the sale and useof alcohol. The theme and message of suchcampaigns should be to drink less often and less oneach occasion.Primary health care is the setting where individualsat risk from heavy drinking can be identified andhelped to reduce their alcohol consumption. Instru-ments are available for screening and interventionin this setting. A number of innovative approachesto the treatment of people who drink too much havebeen successful and should be more widely dis-seminated. Psychoactive drugsBetter information materialand programmes are needed for use in schools,workplaces and the mass media. An important aimis to help people understand the influence of socialand cultural attitudes on the use of drugs and othersubstances as a means of coping. More effectivemechanisms of social support should be developedfor those who are especially vulnerable to sub-stance abuse. These mechanisms could include abroad range of outreach activities, self-help groups,treatment centres, half-way houses and shelters, ailaimed at improving prevention, treatment and re-habilitation services for people with drug and alco-hol problems, including social violence. More vig-orous research is needed to develop innovativeapproaches to prevention, taking into consider-ation a broad range of possible measures in differ-ent sectors. Early recognition aril intervention atthe primary health care level are especially impor-tant. Similarly, the development of better methodsfor evaluating treatment programmes and a sys-tematic search for more effective methods of treat-ment must be given high priority.Inappropriate prescribing of psychoactive drugshas harmful consequences. Coordinated action is 95 Lifestyles conducive to health 85 needed to increase the emphasis on appropriate 8.prescribing practices in the training of health pro-fessionals. Such training needs to encourage theuse of other, more appropriate therapeutic meas- 9.ures instead. Various alternatives exist for combat-ing the depression or anxiety caused by what are, atroot, social rather than psychological problems.These alternatives include self-help groups, andgroups and courses facilitated by experts. Trainingand education in health promotion for all health 10.professionals, as discussed in target 15, will help toincrease their awareness of these alternatives.

Healthy environment Targets 1825 are concerned with the contri-bution of the environment to health and are basedon the strategies of the European Charter onEnvironment and Health. They link together theemerging commitment to environmental policiesthat could lead to ecologically sustainable develop-ment, the prevention and control of risks to thepopulation, and equitable access to healthy environ-ments. Their aim is to provide people with oppor-tunities to live in communities with socially andphysically supportive environments (see Fig. 4).Since the United Nations conference in Rio deJaneiro in 1992, the consensus has been that thehighest priority needs to be given to protecting theenvironment. Global policy aims at developmentthat is balanced and sustainable, so that socio-economic growth and the ecosystem are in har-mony and mutually supportive. Highly industrial-ized Europe has a particular responsibility in theglobal community.Europe is far from the ideal of an environment thatis free from hazards to health, provides psychologi-cal and aesthetic support for personal developmentand is equitably accessible to all. An importantRegion-wide consensus, based on a strong concernwith health issues, led to the unanimous adoptionof the European Charter on Environment and Health(/) by 29 Member States and the Commission ofthe European Communities in 1989, as a set ofprinciples to guide the development of nationalpolicies. The 1991 Sundsvall Conference on sup-portive environments for health showed that thereis considerable interaction between the physicaland social environments (2).The health of the environment The environ-ment has gradually improved in several coun-tries, especially in the north of Europe. Air qualityhas improved owing to reductions in sulfur dioxideemission and the lead content of petrol. Manycountries have also achieved improvements in ar-eas such as housing, parks, nuclear safety and thesocial environment. On a regional scale, however,the overall environment has not improved in thelast decades owing to growing industrialization,the introduction of new technologies, the increas-ing use of chemicals, more intensive agricultural 8798 88Health for all targets Fig.4. i-lealthy environment Fig. 1 Healthy environmentsTarget 24 Human ecologyand settlementsTarget 25 Health of people at work Strategic actionTarget 20 Water qualityTarget 21 Air qualityTarget 22 Food quality and safetyTarget 23 Waste management and soil pollution PolicyTarget 18 Policy on environment and healthTarget 19 Environmental health management practices, increasing energy consumption, the grow-ing consumption of material goods in general,growing amounts of industrial and communitywaste, increasing motor vehicle traffic and rapidurbanization. In many countries, air pollution, ex-posure to chemicals, the contamination of soil ...ndwater, hazards to food safety and exposure to bio-logical agents have tended to increase.For a multitude of reasons, the state of the environ-ment varies widely within the Region. By the 1970sand 1980s, the northern and western parts had estab-lished infrastructures and policies for environmentand health. They are now dealing with the complexenvironmental problems of post-industrial so-ciety. Elsewhere, particularly in eastern, central andsouthern parts of the Region, basic problems of 99 community hygiene and sanitation remain. Un-checked industrial pollution in several central andeastern European countries is of particular concern. Environment-related health problems Inpost-industrial societies, the major environment-related diseases and disorders include cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, respiratory disorders, allergies,reproductive problems, locomotor disorders, psy-chological and neurological disorders, and acciden-tal injuries. Since large groups of the population areexposed to many risk factors, even a small increasein risk levels may significantly increase the inci-dence of a particular disorder.The environment is usually only one of several causalfactors in disease development, and it interacts withbiological agents, lifestyles and hereditary factors. Itsrelative importance is rarely known with any precision.In some cases, different factors are synergistic andmultiply the risk from the individual factors. Despitescientific uncertainties, a reasonable conclusion is thatan improvement in the environment is likely to increasehealth and reduce illness. No evidence exists of anyhealth benefits from poor environments.In countries with less developed infrastructures, thetraditional epidemic diseases, often of microbiologi-cal origin, may still pose important problems. Theyare associated with environmental deficiencies (forexample, enteric diseases in children are due to poorsanitatior) and with low water and food hygiene.Similarly, certain occupational activities may resultin specific diseases such as pneumoconiosis. Achiev-ing reductions in these environment-related diseasesdoes not primarily require new knowledge and tech-nology, but better management. The most difficultenvironmental problems come together in the urbanenvironment, which requires particular attention.Healthy environment89 E mphasis on implementation Current workon the environment and health shows that stressput on the environment soon results in changes thatare an impending hazard to human health. Pre-ventive measures should therefore be aimed atareas such as air, water, soil, waste and food,as well as specific living and working environ-ments.Every Member State should formulate and imple-ment an effective policy for environment and health,taking into account the best principles of diseaseprevention, health promotion and human ecology.Implementation requires well integrated planningand managerial systems at all levels and a clearidentification of priorities. No practical activitycan be carried out without well functioning infra-structures and adequate human resources and equip-ment. Particular attention should be given to themechanic -ns that ensure multisectoral collaborationin practice. In certain parts of the Region, improve-ments in the basic infrastructures of environmentalhygiene are also needed.Environmental problems cross national bOrders, soactive collaboration is needed between countriesand with international organizations. This shouldfacilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge, ex-perience and technology, and should benefit fromthe expanding activities of the WHO Regional Of-fice for Europe through its Centre for Environmentand Health.Better national and international information sys-tems on env ironment and health are needed toimprove the awareness, motivation and partici-pation of the public, politicians and industry. Inter-national collaboration is also required to help somecountries improve their infrastructures, trainingand access to resources.100 90Health for all targets Target 18 - Policy on environment and health By the year 2000, all Member States should have developed, and be implementing, policieson the environment and health that ensure ecologically sustainable development, effectiveprevention and control of environmental health risks and equitable access to healthyenvironments. This target can be achieved if all Member States adhere to the principles of the FrankfurtCharter and collaborate internationally in the control of transfrontier and globalenvironmental threats. This will require action in all Member States to:review, adapt and develop their environment and health policies in the light of theEuropean Charter on Environment and Health, as an essential component of healthfor all policy;formulate and implement country, regional and/or local laws, regulations, incen-tives and practices accordingly;establish country, regional and local mechanisms for involving people in policydevelopment and implementation.Problem statementToday, peuple are wellaware that the general environment is deterio-rating. Human health .s influenced both by threats toanimal and plant life, and by constraints on eco-nomic development in large parts of the planet. Theenvironment itself can have both positive and nega-tive effects on health. The agents involved can be theplaces where people live, work or relax, specificagents such as microorganisms, physical forces orchemicals, or more general agents such as the atmos-phere, soil and water.Until a few years ago, health policies had rarelybeen linked to concerns with the general environ-ment and so had not benefited from the strongpopular ecological movement. While collaborationin the prevention and control of health risks in theenvironment has been improving, there is stillscope for further intersectoral action between sec-tors, levels, institutions and countries.A common aim for the general environment, aswell as health, is an ecologically sustainable devel-opment brought about by the prudent managementof the earth's resources and the biosphere, withoutjeopardizing future generations. The EuropeanRegion may be failing to achieve sustainability.Evidence for this is the depletion of the stratosphericozone layer, the deterioration of large areas of theMediterranean and Baltic seas and Europe's majorrivers, reliance on energy from high sulfur fossilfuels that increase acid deposition and groundwater 101 Healthy environment91 pollution, the wide use of grossly polluting tech-nology, ill-considered land use and agriculturalpractices, and general profligacy and carelessnesswith resources and waste products.Many problems in the past resulted from the falsenotion that the needs of the environment and healthconflicted with those of economic development.Some sections of the population are especially vul-nerable. People who work with certain processes orlive near certain industrial plants may be particularlyexposed to specific agents. Infants and children takein more of a contaminant relative to their size than doadults. Social equity in terms of access to a healthyenvironment has not been achieved, nor has it en-tered fully into the public awareness.The interaction of the physical environment withthe social environment and people's lifestyles hasmany effects on health. In some countries, how-ever, environment and health policies are still some-times confined to inspectorate functions in thephysical environment. C uggested solutionsThe governments of theRegion and the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities have acknowledged the growing con-cern for the environment. They recognized theurgency of effective action to protect the environ-ment and health by unanimously adopting the Eu-ropean Charter on Environment and Health inDecember 1989.The principles of the Charter provide a framework,linked to the health for all strategy, from whichMember States can derive policies for environmentand health. The Charter emphasizes predictive andpreventive strategies, the need to reverse negativetrends in the environment, and the use of the en-vironment as a resource for improving living con-ditions and increasing wellbeing.The Charter also proposes the entitlements andresponsibilities of individuals and of public andprivate organizations, the principles of publicpolicy, its strategic elements and the priorities forprevention. It suggests arrangements for the man-agement and control of environmental health haz-ards and provides guidance for future activities.The practical implementation of its principles isparticularly stressed (/).In the European Region, important concerns aboutthe environment include: global disturbances suchas the destruction of the ozone layer and climaticchange; urban development, planning and renewalto protect kealth and promote wellbeing; safe andadequate drinking-water supplies and hygienicwaste disposal for all urban and rural communities;the quality of surface, ground and coastal waters;the microbiological and chemical safety of food;the environmental and health impact of variousenergy options, of transport (especially road trans-port) and agricultural practices, including the useof fertilizers and pesticides, and of waste disposal;air quality, especially in relation to oxides of sulfurand nitrogen, photochemical oxidants and volatileorganic compounds; indoor quality (residential,recreational and occupational) including the ef-fects of radon, exposure to tobacco smoke, chemi-cals and biological contaminants; persistent chemi-cals and those having chronic effects; hazardouswastes including their management, transport anddisposal; biotechnology and, in particular, geneti-cally modified organisms; contingency planningfor and in response to accidents and disasters; andcleaner technologies as preventive measures. Theirpriority will differ from country to country.102 92Health for all targets Where possible, a preventive approach shouldbe adopted in tackling these priorities. This in-cludes protecting the health of vulnerable groups.Careful risk and environmental impact assess-ments should be undertaken before any new tech-nologies, industrial sites or chemicals are intro-duced.A multisectoral approach is necessary, and allinvolvedgovernments, communities, industryand individualsmust assume greater responsibil-ity and accountability. This will, in many coun-tries, require a review and adjustment of nationaland local laws, regulations, incentives and prac-tices. For example, the principle that the polluterpays should be adopted. This means that everypublic and private body that causes or may causedamage to the environment is made financiallyresponsible.The Charter calls for effective monitoring, analy-sisand assessment of environmental healthhazards, as well as appropriate research on preven-tive technologies and environmental epidemiol-ogy. All this would be aided by the collection,analysis and assessment of data on environmentand health at the national level in the Region. Ifgovernments communicated such information toresponsible authorities, communities and individu-als, as well as to those making decisions on en-vironment and health, this would have a crucialeffect on the implementation of environment andhealth policies and on the shaping of public opin-ion.TheWHOHealthy Cities project has demonstratedthat great benefits are derived from linking socialenvironment policies with the promotion of healthylifestyles. This link aims to ensure that the environ-ment not only is free from health h. zards but alsoprovides a supportive basis for healthy living by allpeople.Since the adoption of the Charter, Member Stateshave been reviewing and strengthening their poli-cies to meet the environment and health problemsof the 1990s and to reverse the current decliningtrends in the quality of the environment. Somegovernments have already published countrywidepolicy documents for the environment, which in-clude aspects relevant to health and outline strat-egies for environment and health for the year 2000and beyond. These policies should not only tacklenewly emerging environmental health hazardsand risks, but also prevent the perpetuation ofestablished health hazards and risks in the environ-ment.The European Region should also contribute tointernational programmes for the control of globalenvironmental threats. All the countries in theRegion should therefore support the implemen-tation of international agreements on the control ofenvironmental threats, such as the Montreal Proto-col on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes andtheir Disposal, and the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe's Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. They shouldalso collaborate in subregional programmes suchas the United Nations Environment Programme'sMediterranean Action Plan and the Helsinki Con-vention to protect the Baltic Sea. 103 Healthy environment93 Target 19-Environmental health management By the year 2000, there should be effective management systems and resources in allMember States for putting policies on environment and health into practice. This target can be achieved by implementing the policies advocated in target 18following the strategic elements and priorities of the Frankfurt Charter. This requiresaction to conserve natural resources, promote sustainable development, control healthrisks in air, water, soil, food and waste, and create environments that support health andwellbeing where people live and work. it can be brought about if Member States:establish systems for environmental monitoring and impact assessment, linkingenvironment and health information;use country, regional and local mechanisms to involve government, industry,primary producers and community groups in environmental health action based onfull sharing of information;consider the impact on environment and health of policies and strategies in sectorssuch as urban planning, energy, transport, industrial development and agriculture;mobilize adequate resources from all sectors to achieve environmental healthtargets;develop management systems, operational methods, appropriate technology, re-search and training to support environmental health management problem statementManaging the environ-ment has become a high political priority,owing to the significant impact on human healthof technological accidents involving chemicalsand radioactivity. Current political, economicand social change in the Region has further raisedawareness and public anxiety about such incidents.Signif.:ant progress has been made in the develop-ment of legal frameworks that permit the introduc-tion of standards for acceptable levels of hazardouschemicals in food, air and drinking-water. Particularefforts have been made to harmonize the implemen-tation of environmental standards throughout thecountries of the European Community. Usually,however, monitoring and control strategics tend tobe limited to single sources of exposure and focus ona dozen or so of the most incriminated substances.Moreover, many of the strategies are based on compli-ance with standards that are not always directly relatedto actual exposure. Some counties in the Region do,however, practise an integrated pollution control policy. 104 94Health for all targets Although specific hazards to health in the environ-ment must be identified and controlled, it is theirtotal impact and their interaction with social con-ditions and lifestyles that are important.In some countries, the responsibility for differentmedia (such as air, water or food) is split betweena multitude of institutions, levels and sectors. Thismakes it difficult to takz a coherent and compre-hensive management approach, or even to collectand link information on exposure and risk. Despitedifferences in the organization of environmentalhealth services between countries, most are gearedto the control of environmental health hazardsrather than their prevention.A number of countries lack an adequate infrastruc-ture and mechanisms to anticipate intentional orunintentional releases of toxic chemicals and otherhazards and to assess the extent of damage caused.They are also ill-equipped to estimate the contribu-tion of environmental and other factors to local andnational health status. In many countries, the ten-dency is to focus on isolated events and problems,rather than to take an epidemiological view. Thisweakness in information systems means that noindicators of impact and quality have been devel-oped, so it is difficult to monitor the effectivenessof policies and strategies.The inadequacy of public information and healtheducation has inhibited public involvement in envi-ronmental health management. Pridrities have some-times been set on the basis of emotions and pressurefrom interest groups, rather than of scientific facts.The numbers and qualification of environmentalhealth personnel have increased to an appropriatelevel in most European countries. There may, how-ever, be too few experienced personnel in the centraland eastern parts of the Region to cope with theaccumulated problems of industrial pollution. Suggested solutionsThe European Charteron Environment and Health provides the policyframework and strategy for environment and healthin the Region (see target 18). The aim is not merelya low level of health hazards, but a clean andharmonious environment that supports health andstimulates healthy lifestyles. The emphasis is onstrategies that are collaborative, predictive andpreventive and are properly planned, implementedand evaluated.The health sector has a leading role in the epi-demiological surveillance and assessment of thehealth impact of environmental factors and in com-municating conclusions to other sectors of societyand the general public.A comprehensive strategy for prevention requiresappropriate incentives, technologies, and legislativeand administrative mechanisms. It also needs toensure that information about the importance ofprevention reaches all sections of the community.Fiscal, administrative and economic instrumentsand land-use planning all have an important role inpromoting environmental conditions conducive tohealth.Managing the implementation of shared environ-ment and health objectives requires activities, re-sources and support from different levels, sectorsand public and private institutions. They have dis-tinct but complementary roles and responsibilitiesin the development of health criteria and indicatot sfor evaluation, in the strengthening of environmen-tal health services, and in the creation of durableintersectoral links. 1051 Priorities and standards that are set on the basis ofscientific risk assessment can make a useful contribution to feasible, timely and cost-effective action.The Charter specifically refers to the WHO guide-lines for drinking-water quality (3) and the WHO airquality guidelines for Europe (4).As for strategies for the control of chemicals, theyshould include notification procedures for newchemicals and systematic examination of existingchemicals. Contingency planning is vital and shoulddeal with all types of serious accident, includingthose with transfrontier consequences.The needs of the countries in the central and easternpart of the Region differ widely between countriesand areas. But they all present a new challenge forthe development of appropriate, coordinated con-trol aid monitoring strategies. Support and exper-tise from other countries in the Region may beneeded. The first priority is to reduce the knownhealth hazards in the environment and to reversethe environmental decay and neglect as part ofeconomic reconstruction.Medical and other professionals, such as toxi-cologists and epidemiologists, should pay greaterattention to the environment. National and inter-national programmes of training in such disciplinesshould be strengthened accordingly. Similarly,Healthy environment95 greater emphasis should be put on the health as-pects of environmental impact assessment. Re-search programmes in environmental epidemiologyshould be encouraged at all levels and should aimto clarify the links between the environment andhealth. Collaborative international studies in toxi-cology and epidemiology could play an importantrole.Action in the environment and health field requiresdata of good and comparable quality. The develop-ment of environmental health data and informationsystems based on environmental epidemiologyshould therefore be encouraged. Strategies for pre-venting noncomrnunicable diseases, in particular,would benefit from better prediction, identification,monitoring and assessment of the impact of theenvironment on health.A good share of the practical implementation ofenvironment and health strategies takes place at thelocal level. The role of communities, interest groupsand individuals is crucial, and better mechanismsare needed to assist their participation. Peopleshould be given a clear voice in decisions abouttheir own environment and health, not only be-cause they have a right to know but also becauseactive communication and participation motivatepeople to protect the environment and to use it as aresource for health. Target 20-Water quality By the year 2000, all people should have access to adequate supplies of safe drinking-waterand the pollution of groundwater sources, rivers, lakes and seas should no longer pose athreat to health. 1 )6 96Health for all targets This target can be achieved if water conservation strategies are implemented to meetevolvinn environmental health problems and needs. Achievement of these strategiesrequires:providing access to adequate and continuous supplies of safe drinking-water thatmeetWHOdrinking-water quality guidelines;ensuring effective wastewater disposal, sanitation and protection of drinking-waterresources;taking appropriate intersectoral action to prevent contamination of water sourcesby agricultural and industrial pollution.Problem statementDuring the InternationalDrinking Water Supply and Sanitation Dec-ade, almost all settlements in the Region wereconnected to a supply of drinking-water. On thewhole, urban areas are well off, though some slumdistricts in southern and eastern parts of the Regionare inadequately or poorly served. Services in Medi-terranean towns with a large seasonal influx oftourists are periodically interrupted. Furthermore,a lot of water of drinking quality is lost because ofleakage from distribution systems in many citiesand rural areas. Many rural areas have too fewwater connections in the home: about 12% of peoplestill need to go to a public fountain, while more than3% are served by inadequate systems.The provision of effective sewage disposal facilitiesis lagging behind. Some 6% of rural and 1% of urbandwellers are reportedly served by inadequate sys-tems. These relatively small reported figures shouldnot serve to hide other problems. Even where peoplehave access to flush toilets, this creates wastewaterthat must be collected, treated and disposed of orreused. Many towns still lack appropriate seweragenetworks, many dwellings in the suburbs are notconnected to such systems, and domestic and indus-trial pollutants are often discharged untreated intothe aquatic er vironment. Concern has been expressedin some instances about the unsafe disposal of thesludge produced by wastewater treatment plants.Deficiencies in the disposal of wastewater canresult in a wide range of organic and inorgaricpollutants reaching fertile soils, drinking-watersources and recreational waters. This creates ahealth risk for the population exposed to contami-nated food or water.Both economic and population growth are increas-ing the domestic, industrial, agricultural and rec-reational demand for clean water. The low price ofwater further encourages its use. At the same time,water is becoming increasingly scarce because ofthe climatic changes that are taking place in theRegion. Unless proper pricing, conservation, sur-veillance and control measures are instituted, pol-lution is likely to increase. International collaborationNot all countrieshave comprehensive water policies. When riverscross or constitute international borders, or wherelarge water sources are shared by countries, inter-national collaboration becomes essential. This isparticularly the case in the implementation of inter-national agreements and conventions.10 7 Healthy environment97 Microbial contaminationWater-related dis-eases, especially diarrhoeal diseases, are a majorcause of death in young children in the poorercountries of the Region. Enteric diseases and hepa-titis A have been associated with swimming inpolluted lake and sea waters. The consumption ofseafood harvested from contaminated areas hasalso resulted in many cases of infection. Waterbornediseases can thus pose a major threat to tourism anddamage exports,The risk from parasites (particularly Crypto-sporidium) and viruses in the water supply is widelyknown. The presence of these pathogens in drink-ing-water may be responsible for sporadic cases ofdisease as well as for large outbreaks. Unfortu-nately, many of these organisms are difficult todetect and are resistant to the disinfectants nor-mally used in the water industry. Chemical contaminationLead is often foundin older water pipes. 'Fhere is evidence of its detri-mental effects on health, including children's intel-lectual performance.Excess concentrations of certain naturally occur-ring substances, such as arsenic, may pose healthproblems. Suggested solutionsThe European Charteron Environment and Health (I) urges MemberStates to take all necessary steps to provide ad-equate water and sanitation.The International Drinking Water Supply and Sani-tation Decade has demonstrated the value of aninternational approach, in an area where the techni-cal solutions are generally known and whereproblems often cross national boundaries. The needfor a common Region-with. strategy for the post-Decade period should therefore be considered.Countries will be able to build on the drinking-water coverage already achieved during the WaterDecade, and should give more attention to suppliesin rural areas and to the quality of drinking-water.They can define explicit and attainable levels ofservices appropriate to their specific needs.Emphasis should also be laid on the appropriatetreatment of wastewater and the protection ofgroundwaters by preventing pollution and leakageof potentially toxic materials.In many parts of the Region, safe drinking-waterhas been taken for granted and provided free ofcharge. The increasing scarcity of water of goodquality may require the introduction of charges.These could recover the cost of investments fromboth users and polluters, as part of water conser-vation policies to balance thc priorities of differentwater users.National strategies should aim to provide the wholepopulation with safe drinking-water, by managingand maintaining its collection, treatment and dis-tribution. Effective legislative, administrative andtechnical measures are also needed for the surveil-lance and control of pollution of surface water andgroundwater and for the protection of fresh andmarine waters from pollution. Monitoring and in-formation management should be reinforced toallow rational planning, implementation and evalu-ation of the actions taken.Considerable technical knowledge about water al-ready exists. Research could therefore concentrateon developing technologies to investigate the risk1,a 98Health for all targets factors associated with the presence of pollutants,such as lead or Cryptosporidium. Research couldalso look into lowering the costs of the construc-tion, operation and maintenance of water andwastewater systems.There is ample scope for international solidarity.All coastal countries need to reach agreement onthe development and implementation of measuresto protect the quality of seawater, particularly inareas with bathing beaches or where seafood isharvested. Countries that share water resourcesalso need to develop protocols and agreements onpollution control. Target 21-Air qualityBy the year 2000, air quality in all countries should be improved to a point at whichrecognized air pollutants Go not pose a threat to public health. This target can be achieved if all Member States:conduct surveillance of outdoor and indoor air quality;take appropriate intersectoral action to reduce air pollution originating fromindustrial and energy production sources, taking account of the WHO air qualityguidelines for Europe;adopt appropriate legislation and administrative and technical measures to controlair pollution and comply with criteria for safeguarding human health. Problem statementThere are many air pol-lutants, and they come from various sources.Some pollutants of regional and global significanceare sulfur dioxide (so2), particulate and semivolatile compounds (VOC andSVOC) and chlorofluorocarbons (cFc). Some of these,and others such as tobacco smoke, are important forindoor air quality.so2andSPM Between 1900 and 1985, global So2emissions from artificial sources increased aboutsixfold to some 90 million tonnes of sulfur per year,of which about 25% is emitted in the EuropeanRegion (5). In many countries, local pollution hasgreatly diminished in recent years. SPM concentrationhas increased, however, in cities of western andsouthern Europe. Many urban areas, notably in east-ern Europe, have levels of SO2, SPM and associated Healthy environment99 pollutants that are 24 times the relevant levels ofthe WHO air quality guidelines for Europe. NOx Total emissions of human origin in the Re-gion were estimated to be about 13 million tonnesof nitrogen per year in 1983 (5). Emissions havebeen increasing in most countries. Smog episodesEpisodically elevated concen-trations of air pollution in winter and summer havebecome common in many cities (6).Two types ofsmog can be distinguished. The winter-type smogcontains SO2 and SPM and stems from the combus-tion of sulfur-containing fossil fuel. The effects ofwinter-type smog depend on circumstances andareas. Sulfuric acid is thought to be primarilyresponsible for the effects on health. The summer-type smog results from photochemical pollution,which arises from atmospheric reactions of hydro-carbons and NOR stimulated by intense sunlight. Insummer-type smog, 03 is considered the biologi-cally most active pollutant. Global climate changeThe emission of tracegases and carbon dioxide (032) through humanactivity produces a change in heat radiation fromthe atmosphere to space, causing the \"greenhouse\"effect. About 50% of this effect is caused by CO2and the rest by methane, NOR, 03 in the troposphereand CFC. Some 95% of the global CO2 emissions ofhuman origin arise in the northern hemisphere.Between 1950 and 1984, they increased about three-fold, to an estimated carbon emission of 5300 mil-lion tonnes per year. The release of CO2 from defores-tation is second only to fossil-fuel combustion asan artificial source. The present global concen-tration of CO2 is 630 mg/m3 (350 ppm), which is25% higher than at the beginning of the industrialrevolution, when it was only 500 mg/rn3 (280 ppm). Ozone layer depletionThe 03 layer provides ascreen that protects living organisms from the harm-ful effects of ultraviolet (uv) radiation. When theartificial stable CFC and halons are transported tothe stratosphere, they react with and remove 03.The large increase in production of CFC in the early1970s has now been reduced.Ozone layer depletion, resulting in increased UV-Bradiation at the earth's surface, may seriously dam-age human health through skin cancer and melanoma,suppression of the immune system and cataracts.Sizeable effects can also be felt by agricultural cropsand aquatic ecosystems. A full overview of the poss-ible magnitude of these effects cannot yet be given.High concentratkms of urban air pollutants, suchas SO2 and SPM, increase respiratory symptoms,morbidity and mortality. Evidence also suggeststhat increases in cancer mortality are associatedwith exposures to polynuclear aromatic hydrocar-bons (PAH), benzene and possibly other carcino-gens. Heavy metal compounds and SVOC have bothdirect and indirect (through the food chain anddrinking-water) effects on health, depending on thespecific pollutant.The reduction in recent years of local pollution bySO2 and SPM has resulted, in many countries, in areduction in the incidence of bronchial conditionsand an increase in winter sunshine.Air pollution from road traffic NOR, particles indiesel fumes and leadcan have adverse effects onhealth, particularly in urban areas and close to busymain roads.110 100Health for all targets Indoor air qualityMost people in the Regionspend most of their time indoors, but few of thesubstances commonly found in indoor air havebeen well studied (7). Since the mid-1970s, thequality of indoor air has been further affected byenergy conservation measures, and by changes inbuilding design and in the materials used in con-struction and in household goods.The major indoor air pollutant in many places istobacco smoke. The effects of passive smoking areof special concern. Children of parents who smokehave more respiratory symptoms than children ofnonsmoking parents. Evidence shows that regularexposure to environmental tobacco smoke increasesthe risk of lung cancer and of low birth weightfollowing exposure during gestation (8).Other major pollutants are radon (associated with anincreased risk of lung cancer), viable particles (as-sociated with infectious diseases, including Legion-naires' disease, parasitic diseases and allergic ail-ments), asbestos and other inorganic fibres (associ-ated with asbestosis, lung cancer and interactionwith smoking), formaldehyde (associated withendothelium irritation), and NO2 and other combustionpmducts, VOC and SVOC (associated with impairedrespiratory function and respiratory illness) (9).Another indoor air quality problem is the \"sickbuilding\" syndrome. It is associated with the occu-pancy of large, often newly constructed or remod-elled buildings, and is characterized by eye, nose andthroat irritation, mental fatigue, headaches, nauseaand dizziness. Most ofthese buildings are workplacesand have forced ventilation systems with partialrecirculation of the air and low ventilation rates.Many cities in the Region are subject to air pollu-tion that directly affects human health. Millions ofpeople are estimated to live in areas where airpollution is severe enough to cause thousands ofpremature deaths as well as chronic illness anddisability each year (10).If prevention and control measures are not in-creased, air pollution will get worse. The upwardtrends in pollution are fuelled by economic growth.Increasing industrialization (producing SO2, SPM,NOX'CO2' heavy and CFO, moreintensive agriculture (producing and NOR),more vehicle traffic (producing NOx and so2) andmore domestic heating (producing CO2) all contrib-ute. Rapidly increasing urbanization means evenfaster deterioration of environmental conditions incities.Fortunately, the signs are that pollution trends canbe reversed. Industrial emissions have been con-siderably reduced, particularly in northern andwestern Europe, thanks to more effective controlsand the closure of many older factories. In someheavily industrialized areas, however, especially ineastern Europe where soft brown coal is used in ahigh proportion of domestic heating and powergeneration, pollution levels remain high.The production and release of CFC peaked in 1974.The subsequent decline is due to consumer edu-cation and restrictions on non-essential uses inseveral countries.Several countries have introduced incentives orregulations to reduce the exhaust emissions of cars,but increased traffic density has often counter-balanced this reduction. Suggested solutionsThe European Charteron Environment and Health (1) urges Member1 11 Healthy environment101 States to pay attention to air quality and to observetheWHOair quality guidelines for Europe (4). Ofparticular concern are the oxides of sulfur andnitrogen, the photochemical oxidants (summer-type smog) and voc, as well as radon and tobaccosmoke in indoor air.An air quality policy should address the manyagencies responsible for action. Its aim is tostrengthen the legislative, economic and technicalmeasures that should reduce national and local airpollution at least to the levels of the WHOairquality guidelines for Europe. The control of long-range transboundary air pollutants, such as SO2 andNOR, needs effective international agreements.Given the generally unfavourable trends in pollu-tion, action should not await additional studies.Measures to reduce emissions from industry, dom-estic premises and motor vehicles and substantiallyto reduce indoor air pollutants should be intro-duced immediately.In cities, the simultaneous and well managed re-duction and control of all the major sources of airpollution (energy production, manufacturing in-dustry, incinerators, vehicles and the indoor en-vironment) would greatly enhance the health im-age and attractiveness of the city both to its owncitizens and to visitors. The improvements pro-duced by cleaner air were demonstrated conclu-sively in the London area in the 1960s, thanks tothe introduction of legislation.A number of Member States have already takenspecific action that will reduce environmental andhealth risks. Such action should, therefore, be ex-panded and includes, among others, the develop-ment and use of low-polluting alternative eneegysources, the use of alternative raw materials ortechnologies or the mc.lification of productionprocesses, a faster reduction of and more extensiverestrictions on the production and use of CFCandhalons, and continued intensified action on airpollution from vehicles.Indoor air quality would be improved by the pro-motion of smoke-free schools, worksites and pub-lic places. More attention to construction designand building materials would reduce the hazardfrom radon, various organic compounds and bio-logical contaminants. The improvement of ventil-ation in general, and the elimination of unventedheaters and cooking stoves, reduces the products ofcombustion indoors.TheWHOair quality guidelines for Europe need tobe revised and expanded periodically, as new evi-dence becomes available. This will make them ofconsistent use in countries and internationally, as abenchmark for the development of comprehensiveand effective air quality control laws and regu-lations.A better knowledge and information base is alsoneeded. Perhaps least is known about many of theindoor air pollutants. In the case of other pol-lutants, studies are needed to improve the under-standing of the short- and long-term interrelationbetween air quality and human health, so as todevelop and improve action strategies in cities andelsewhere.Research might look at: the measurement andassessment of personal and population exposuresand quantitative exposureresponse relationships;models of air pollution emission and dispersionthroughout the Region and assessments of popu-lation exposure; and, in selected areas, quantitativerisk assessment on the basis of actual human ex-posures and exposureresponse relationships. .112 102Health for all targets Target 22 - Food quality and safety By the year 2000, health risks due to microorganisms or their toxins, to chemicals and toradioactivity in food should have been significantly reduced in all Member Stees. This target can be achieved if the appropriate bodies in all Member States:introduce effective legislative, administrative and technical measures for the surveil-lance and control of food contamination at all stages of farming, slaughteringharvesting, food processing, distribution, storage, sale and use;reduce the mean weekly intake of chemical contaminants to or below the WHOguideline values for permissible weekly intakes;inform consumers on the composition of food;achieve full reporting of outbreaks of foodborne intestinal diseases;promote awareness of food hygiene and proper nutrition in all persons involved inproducing, handling and selling food. ProklemstatementMethods of food pro-duction, storage, distribution and preparationare rapidly changing. The international trade infood and tourism is expected to expand rapidly,owing both to the political opening of the centraland eastern part of the Region and to the establish-ment of a single market without trade barriers in theEuropean Community countries. Changing socialhabits and the entry of a large proportion of womeninto the labour market all over Europe have led tochanges in the pattern of food consumption, asmass catering increasingly replaces home cooking.These changes bring with them new problems offood hygiene and transboundary infections andintoxications. In addition to being a potential healthhazard, unsafe food may have serious economicconsequences for food exports and tourism.Chemical contaminationThe current levels ofcommon chemical contaminants in individual foodsand in total diet in most countries of the Region aregenerally well within the established WHO guide-lines for exposure limits. With the exception ofmost of the countries in the central and eastern partof the Region, the trend is generally downward, asthe use of persistent pesticides and environmentalpollution with other toxic chemicals is curtailed orbanned altogether. Food additives used to improvethe quality and appearance of foods undergo sys-tematic toxicological evaluation.In some situations, however, specific populationgroups may be unduly exposed. Considerable con-tarnination of food still occurs, including organo-chlorine pesticides and PCBS in human milk, 113 Healthy environment103 mercury and PCBs in fish, lead in canned foods andaflatoxins in nuts and cereals.A number of dramatic incidents involving the chemi-cal or radioactive contamination of foods have cre-ated considerable concern in the Region. A wellknown example is the toxic oil syndrome in Spain,which killed some people and seriously impaired thehealth of many others. Another well known incidentis the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the USSR Microbiological contamination Foodborne dis-eases have increased over the last few years andhave reached epidemic proportions in several coun-tries. The main infections are with Salmonella(especially S. enteritidis) and Campylobacterstrains. The current reported incidence rate of over1200 cases per million inhabitants in the Region isabout three times higher than that recorded in 1984.Since only a few of the acute cases of gastrointestinalinfections are reported in most countries, the numberof cases should probably be multiplied by at least10. Diarrhoeal diseases and other foodborne infec-tions and intoxications are still the most importantand frequent form of illness in tourists. Food safety servicesThe structure, staffing andorganization of national food safety services varywidely across the Region, reflecting the differentsocial, political and economic circumstances underwhich they were developed. In most countries, twoor more central government departments share re-sponsibility without appropriate intersectoral col-laboration. This leaves some areas with ill-definedpreventive strategies and inappropriately imple-mented control measures. In addition, few coun-tries have a comprehensive food policy that in-cludes health, the environment and the economy.For the last 30 years, the Joint FAO/WHO ExpertCommittee on Food Additives and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues have played amajor role in making safety assessments of dif-ferent chemicals in food. These two committeesdevelop exposure limits for chemicals in food,under the mandate of the Codex Alimentarius pro-gramme (11). Their recommendations are based onthe WHO principles and criteria for the safety evalu-ation of food additives and contaminants (12) andpesticide residues (13). Significant progress hasbeen made in legislative measures, based on thiswork.By contrast, important gaps remain in informationand communication. Communication with the tradeand the general public about unsafe food and drinksis not always effective, within countries or inter-nationally. The difficulty of clear and informativecommunication was demonstrated by the Cherno-byl nuclear accident. Initial uncertainties about thenature and extent of the accident and inadequateintersectoral contingency planning resulted in con-fused messages to the public. The measures im-posed in Europe to safeguard foodstuffs were oftencontradictory. Valid information about the dietaryintakes of population groups was not available,making it difficult to assess the real impact onhealth of contaminated food. Suggested solutionsA new approach to foodsafety has to be found if the vicious circle offood contamination and foodborne disease is to bebroken. More legislation, more standards and moreinspection and food control alone are not the an-swer. Rather, the appropriate strategy would sus-tain food safety as part of a comprehensive foodquality policy. It would strengthen international,national and local programmes for the monitoring114 104Health for all targets of food contamination and the surveillance offoodborne diseases. lt would also harmonize theeducation and training of food safety personnel,and implement policies of intersectoral collab-oration in food safety.As people become better informed, they canbe expected to demand food of higher qualitythat is both safe and nutritious. Meeting this de-mand will require a closer link between the profes-sional, scientific and commercial networks in thehitherto quite separate fields of food safety andnutrition.A special effort needs to be made to help thecountries in the central and eastern part of theRegion to cope with food safety problems. Information and monitoring Food safety re-quires stronger epidemiological services, accurate,adequate and comparable information, and bettercountrywide programmes for the monitoring andsurveillance of food contamination and foodbornediseases.Emphasis should be given to the epidemiologicalinvestigation of outbreaks of foodborne diseases,laboratoryinvestigationsandearlywarningsystems so as to harmonize European efforts infood safety, as part of the WHO SurveillanceProgramme for Control of Foodborne Infectionsand Intoxications in Europe. These efforts shouldinclude population investigations and sentinelstudies on infectious intestinal diseases, so as toassess the real incidence and assist risk manage-ment.Monitoring requires agreed standards of sam-pling, methods of analysis and analytical quality,and a consistent submission of data on agreedcontaminants and foods. Furt ly.tr, scientifically validdietary intake studies are to interpret dataand assess people's exy-05ure to hazardous chemi-cals and the associated potential risk. Such studiescould be adapted for the European Region fromstudies cairied out elsewhere by the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO), WHO and UNEP. The 1990 European Confer-ence on Food and Nutrition Policy (14) requestedFAO, WH and other international and nationalagencies to study the feasibility and cost of cre-ating reliable and accessible European sources ofinformation on food and nutrition.The safety aspects of food could be adequately andcost-effectively controlled by further developingand applying a programme that relies on the controlof selected critical points through hazard analysisrather than end-product testing. Specific trainingprogrammes could usefully be developed for foodinspectors, food technologists and caterers. Humanresource development in general would benefitfrom permanent European training programmesfor trainers.Food hygiene and safety require communicationwith the general public and the food business that isboth clear and informative. Only then can unnecess-ary food scares be avoided and people, industry andtrade be mobilized to undertake prompt and effec-tive prevention and control.The World Health Assembly, in resolutionWHA42.40, called for an intensification of inter-national action to prevent and control foodbornediseases. In the European Region, this includesintensifying collaboration between the various inter-governmental organizations already active in foodsafety and related aspects of food quality. 115 Healthy environment105 Target 23-Waste management and soil pollutionBy the year 2000, public health risks caused by solid and hazardous wastes and soilpollution should be effectively controlled in all Member States. This target can be achieved if all Member States:introduce effective legislative, administrative and technical measures for the man-agement of solid municipal and hazardous wastes;introduce effective measures for soil conservation and the relabilitation of pollutedsoil;adopteffectivemeasures to eliminate the health risks due to accumulation of wasteand soil pollution. Problem statementOwing to its physical,chemical or biological characteristics, haz-ardous waste requires special handling and dis-posal procedures to avoid risk to health or adverseenvironmental effects.Most hazardous waste originates from the manu-facturing industry and the use of chemicals. Medi-cal waste, such as that from hospitals, and certainwastes from research laboratories are also haz-ardous. Radioactive waste is clearly a major healthhazard. Municipal wasteMore municipal waste is gener-ated each year(15).In London, it increased between1968 and 1982 by some 25%, to about 0.4 tonnesper person per year(8).In the Netherlands in 1986,the figure was about 1 tonne per person per year(5). In the whole European Region, several hun-dred million tonnes of waste are generated eachyear. To this figure must be added industrial andconstruction waste, surplus manure, polluted soiland, for some countries, dredging sludge. Together,the total waste that needs handling and disposalmay amount to several thousand million tonnes peryear. Municipal waste disposal is likely be one ofthe most significant problems for many cities in the1990s and hence a major issue for the health ofcities.Many countr:cs have taken action to control thedisposal of waste, including domestic legislationin line with important directives from the EuropeanCommunity. Nevertheless, problems remain. Anumber of major incidents in recent years haveresulted in gross contamination of soil andgroundwater. In many less dramatic cases, unsatis-factory methods have led to a gradual build-up ofpollution as well as to occasional health hazards.Clandestine disposal in rivers and public sewerssometimes occurs, often involving hazardous waste. 116 106Health for all targets In some countries, pesticides are often handledwithout proper care and partly filled containersmay be left to rot. Facilities are not always avail-able for the collection and safe disposal of haz-ardous consumer products such as waste oil andhousehold chemicals. Potentially toxic materialsare still occasionally transported and stored with-out clear labelling and without adequate precautionsto prevent spills or seepage. Some countries haveno arrangements for educating users about poten-tial dangers. Soil pollutionSoil pollution is a growing con-cern for countries of the Region. The increasingpollution of urban and agricultural soils by toxicchemicals with a high absorption capacity, such asheavy metals and dioxins, has direct consequencesfor human health, food safety and groundwaterquality. The sources of soil pollution are spills, thedeposition of air pollutants, the excessive spread ofchemicals used in agriculture, and the improperdisposal of liquid and solid wastes on land. Agri-cultural soil pollution may reduce yields whileincreasing the concentration of unwanted chemi-cals in crops for human consumption and animalfeed. The infiltration of the chemicals intogroundwater aquifers endangers water resourcesand complicates their preparation for drinking-water supply.The problem of soil pollution is exacerbated byhigh stack dispersion of air pollutants over largeareas, the sludge and slurries applied to land, andthe disposal of waste in landfills. In some areas,pollutants have accumulated in soil to such a levelthat it is losing its agricultural fertility.Some central, eastern and southern European coun-tries (such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece,Poland, Romania and Slovakia) have identifiedsoil pollution as a serious environmei tal healthproblem. In some western European areas, such asBrittany in France, the soil is reaching saturationpoint for the disposal of pig manure. In otherplaces, the disposal of sludge and slurries on landhas irreversibly reduced the quality of water aqui-fers.If present trends continue, more food of unsafequality will be grown and more land may be com-pletely lost to agriculture. Intoxication of children,especially lead poisoning caused by dust frompolluted urban soil, will increase and the quality ofrural drinking-water will continue to deteriorate.These are all symptoms of a failure to recognizethat soils have a limited capacity to absorb and dealwith contaminants. Waste disposalThe uncontrolled handling anddisposal of hazardous waste may be a danger tohealth. Waste collection, transport and handlingmay be an occupational health hazard for workers.Disposal, dumping, storage or incineration may, ifcarried out improperly or ineffectively, cause haz-ards to health by polluting the environment. Thetransfrontier transport of hazardous waste increasesthese risks and adds the problem of less competenthandling of the waste far from its source. Waste reductionWaste is inevitably producedby industrial processes and by municipalities. Pub-lic concern initially focused on particular types ofhazardous waste, such as those produced by indus-try and hospitals. More recently, the public desirefor a less wasteful society has begun to turn indus-trial production cowards low-waste technologies.Although the incentives of resource recovery and117 Healthy environment107 energy conservation are leading to greater recy-cling and reuse, the quantities of waste that requiredisposal are still expanding in most countries. InformationThe quality and availability of wastedisposal statistics are extremely variable. Infor-mation about the total quantities of municipal wastecountries dispose of, the type and amount of wastedisposed of per person and changes in the impor-tance of the two major disposal options, land-fill and incineration, is very limited and availableonly to some countries in the Regien. Industrialand hazardous waste disposal cannot yet be wellquantified because of variations in the definitionsof the waste and different methods of reportingthe data. In spite of the knowledge accumulatedabout soil contamination, the impact of soil pol-lution on the health of the public is still not welldefined.Suggested solutionsA waste control policyshould cover legislative, administrative, tech-nical and educational measures. These measuresshould address safe collection, transport, handling,treatment and disposal of both municipal andhazardous wastes, the protection of soil from pol-lution, and effective international agreements onthe transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste.At the local level, a healthy city policy will includewaste prevention, control and disposal. It is goodpractice to inform the population about the size ofthe problem and the options for its solution, toeducate the public on new technological and mana-gerial developments, and to encourage every indi-vidual and business establishment to support soundmunicipal waste management. Rural areas alsoneed policies on waste and soil pollution.While landfill remains an important method ofwaste disposal, the selection of sites is becomingmore difficult. Therefole, greater use of f7iner-ation and energy recovery is necessary as an alterna-tive form of waste management. Waste preventionand reuse must also be encouraged, to furtherreduce the need for space.Prevention means that waste is not created. Non-waste or low-waste solutions and technologiesshould be developed and used. Today, the decisionto prevent waste is often made on the basis ofeconomic considerations alone. A health objective,such as preventing the release of certain environ-mentally harmful substances, can be more effec-tive. When another process or another raw materialproduces less hazardous waste, and the cost of thechange is covered by savings in the cost of re-moval, prevention becomes economically attrac-tive.Reuse is the useful application of waste products inthe same or another process. Technical measuresinclude the recycling of waste, the manufacture ofuseful by-products, alternative methods of pro-duction or the selection of alternative raw ma-terials. In principle, this provides secondary rawmaterials to replace primary raw materials. Thechances are that these secondary products will costappreciably less than primary raw materials, al-though sometimes this is because reuse is subsi-dized. Their quality and properties, of course, alsoplay a role.In the next decade or two, the reuse of municipalwaste could be increased by about 50% if theorganic fraction was collected separately and morepaper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics and textileswere recycled. To be fully effective, such separ-ation should start at each individual source. 1 1 108Health for all targets Some 50% more reuse of course waste also appearspossible because almost 70% of the total consistsof paper, bulky waste, cardboard, metal and wood.The reuse of construction and demolition waste canbe increased to 80% by better separation of itscomponents at the building site. Only little im-provement is possible with industrial waste, be-cause levels of recycling are already high. It may bepossible to recycle up to 25% of office, shop andservice sector waste. About 20% of all waste mustbe incinerated, including old tyres. This has thebenefit of producing energy but care must be takennot to increase air pollution by inappropriate orineffective means of incineration. With maximalreuse and recycling, only 15% of waste will have tobe disposed of in landfills, requiring an area that issome 40% less than at present (16).Hence, the primary indicator and standard for themagnitude of the removal problem could be seen asthe space required for waste that cannot be pro-cessed further. In addition, for some priority sub-stances, the level of emissions from waste inciner-ators should be the key measure. This applies inparticular to persistent substances such as metals,PCBS, dioxins and furans.Other measures that some countries have founduseful involve encouraging manufacturers andpackers to reduce the quantities of household waste(40% by weight is waste packaging) and indus-trial waste, to design waste materials that arereadily recoverable and recyclable, and to avoidnon-treatable composite materials. Another meas-ure has been to integrate into town plans the sitesand systems required to introduce selective collec-tion.Measures can be taken to reduce emissions andshould be used to a greater extent at disposal andincineration plants. Air pollution control at thesource, the optimum use of chemicals in agricul-ture and the safe disposal of waste will decreasesoil pollution. Some polluted soils may be rehabili-tated by incineration and destruction of the toxicchemicals they contain. Of course, the agriculturalfertility of such soils would have to be regenerated.The handling and rehabilitation of abandoned pol-luted land in former industrial areas around bigcities will require special attention.Better information is needed about soil pollutionand the public health problems associated with it.The main sources of pollution require investigation,whether they are the deposition of air pollutants,the indiscrimir ate spreading of chemicals,landfilling or waste applied to land.The handling of hazardous waste should followinternationally agreed procedures, including limit-ing transfrontier transport to the minimum, whilefollowing the principle that hazardous waste shouldbe taken care of by its generator, as close to itsgeneration point as possible. In principle, all coun-tries should aim to be self-sufficient in waste dis-posal capability. 1.19 Healthyenvironment109 Target 24-Human ecology and settlements By the year 2000, cities, towns and rural communities throughout the Region should offerphysical and social environments supportive to the health of their inhabitants.This target can be achieved if intersectoral, ecological approaches combining commu-nity planning and public health are used to improve the built environment and ifcountries take action to:ensure active community participation in determining needs and problems, and inthe processes of planning and action;adopt community planning approaches that emphasize ecological concerns andthe needs of people and facilitate social interaction in all human settlements;strengthen programmes for the construction of healthy houses and housing im-provement, including proper sanitation facilities and the provision of c !,:.11 spacesand recreational areas;meet the needs of special groups such as young families, the old and peoplewithdisabilities;introduce measures for intersectoral action to mobilize the support and resources ofall sectors in coTiunity improvement;reach agreement on international health criteria for community planning anddevelopment, including housing, management of domestic waste, noise controland safety, and strengthen legislative, administrative and technical measures andservites, problem statementMost people in the Re-gion now liv 't in towns. Structural changes incommerce and industry have resulted in more inner-city unemployment, poverty, and decay. Housingtends to be a particular problem for certain groups ofthe population. For example, housing is often poorfor elderly people, specially those who am physi-cally frail, in poor health, living alone or in need ofsome supervision (17).The percentage of homeless or unsuitably housedpeople is reported by only a few countries andvaries considerably, largely because of diverse na-tional definitions of standard accommodation.The central and eastern part of the Region, in par-ticular, not only has heavily polluted cities but alsohas rural communities with hazardous environmen-tal conditions, poor water supply and sanitation 160 110Health for all targets facilities, intensive pollution by agricultural chemi-cals, soil pollution from air pollutants or the landdisposal of wastes, and problems linked to manuredisposal especially from giant pig feedlots.Social and living environments tend to go hand inhand and have a combined impact on health andwellbeing. If present trends continue, inequitieswill increase, especially inequalities in access to ahealthy living environment.Many people in the Region spend less than 20% oftheir time in the open air and thus the indoorenvironment has a particularly important effect onhealth. New methods of construction and new ma-terials for furniture and fittings, together with moreeffective thermal insulation, have raised the levels ofpotentially harmful contaminants indoors. Radon inhouses is a major problem in some areas of theRegion and is probably second only to smoking asa contributor to the incidence of lung cancer. Con-versely, many of the poorer sections of the popu-lation live in badly insulated houses with inad-equate heating. Elderly people living alone areparticularly prone to hypothermia. Waste collection from houses is now general through-out most of the Region, particularly in urban areas.Difficulties in the finnl disposal of waste have in-creased in recent years, however, because of a grow-ing shortage of suitable land, and problems of scav-enging, composting and incineration.Community noise has greatly increased in manyareas. Unwanted noise causes stress and may causephysical impairment at high decibel levels.Commanity involvement in promoting environ-mental health in housing is rarely reported, and itsrole appears limited.Suggested solutionsAs theWHOHealthy Cit-ies movement has shown, a holistic policy isneeded to improve health and socioeconomic de-velopment in urban and rural communities. Thestrategy will differ from country to country.In western Europe, attention should De paid to re-establishing a social environment supportive tohealth, especially in deprived areas and under-privileged suburbs of big cities.In many areas in southern Europe, the first priorityremains to rehabilitate substandard housing andimprove the physical environment in the urbanfringes of quickly growing cities.In the central and eastern part of the Region, onepriority will be to reduce gross i ullution levels,especially air and soil pollution in major indus-trial cities. Another will be to improve environ-mental conditions in rural areas by upgradingthe water supply, sanitation facilities and housingstandards, by better control of the use of agri-cultural chemicals, by better management ofanimal waste, and by the rehabilitation of derelictland. This will also help to rehabilitate agricul-tural production and improve nutrition and foodsafety.Every country requires political will at both na-tional and local government levels to reverse un-healthy living conditions and inequities in accessto a healthy living environment. Local govern-ments know their particular circumstances. Theyshould therefore be encouraged to mobilize theirown and their community's resources to improvehealth, social and environmental conditions. Experi-ence in Oslo and other cities has shown the useful-ness of all residents participating in making theirneighbourhoods healthy. 121 Several western European countries are attemptingto provide a more supportive and healthy socioeco-nomic environment by directing urbanization awayfrom the larger conurbations, Some countries (no-tably France, Germany, the Netherlands and theUnited Kingdom) have paid special attention toethnic minority groups with low incomes, whomay constitute a sizeable proportion or even amajority of the population in certain areas. Theyrequire urban development policies that are sensi-tive to their needs, particularly in terms of afford-able and decent housing. In the central and easternpart of the Region, countries have long-term strat-egies that aim both at improving housing standardsand at modernizing the existing housing stock. Pedestrian and cycle paths, parks and playgroundsare important incentives for regular physical activ-ity and social interaction. These amenities, as wellas efficient rubbish collection and the absence oftraffic fumes and noise, all contribute to health andwellbeing and should be more widely available.The brutal urban architecture of the 1960s is beingreplaced by styles that appear to create a greatersense of wellbeing and belonging. Accident pre-vention in both homes and streets remains an im-portant element of health promotion in the urbanenvironment. Methods of dealing with community noise includetrying to increase public awareness of the harmfuleffects of noise, and reducing noise by means ofbuilding and traffic regulations and town planning.Developments in housing include legislation (onasbestos, formaldehyde and radon, for example),the establishment of housing criteria, and greateremphasis on the housing of vulnerable groups,particularly elderly and disabled people, includingsheltered housing. International health criteria forHealthy environment111 community planning and development also need tobe strengthened.Housing can be an important support to socialnetworks and to the integration of three or moregenerations of families. In Denmark and in severalother countries, regulations on new housing callfor easy access for the physically handicapped, andfor the provision of areas for leisure activities. InSweden itis estimated that, of the more than100 000 elderly people living in institutions, overhalf could live on their own with suitable support.A law on housing aims to reduce the number ofinstitutional beds by 50 000 by the year 2000.The Falktiping accident prevention programme inSweden, developed on the basis of intervention andevaluation in the community, has brought about a2530% decrease in local accidents (18), ResearchThree research topics will be of vitalimportance in the long run. One is the study of thehealth impact of trends in the economic and socialdevelopment of our societies, particularly in en-ergy production, agriculture, industry, transportand urbanization. Another is the study of the ef-fects of the environment on health, which caninform urban development plans and architecturalprojects. The third is interdisciplinary research intohuman ecology, involving public health and en-vironmental health institutes and the human ecol-ogy departments of universities. In addition, anumber of scientific studies may improve know-ledge in specific subjects, such as indoor air pol-lution, allergens in the indoor environment, thesick building syndrome, the mental health aspectsof housing and local environments, the interactionof family ant other supportive environments, andways of involving the public.122 112Health for all targets Target 25-Health of people at work By the year 2000, the health of workers in all Member States should be improved by makingwork environments more healthy, reducing work-related disease and injury, and promotingthe wellbeing of people at work. This target can be achieved if effective measures are implemented in all Member Statesthat:reduce disease, iniury, disability and absence from work resulting from exposures toworkplace hazards such as dust, noise, chemicals and stress;ensure that all employees have access to occupational health services;facilitate the adoption of work practices and routines that contribute to the healthand wellbeing of workers;promote healthy lifestyles such as healthy nutrition, physical exercise and non-smoking;promote cooperation between relevant interest groups and sectors such as labour,industry, environment, education and health, and with the International LabourOffice and other relevant international bodies, in the formulation and implemen-tation of strategies. Problem statementIn the European Region,health policies directed at the workplace are stillmainly confined to the prevention of occupationaldisease and injury, with minor medical care forworkers in some places. Attempts to integrate occu-pational health with primary health care and healthpromotion are rare, owing to separate organizationalstructures, lack of appropriate mechanisms for pro-cedure or insufficient occupational health expertiseamong primary health care workers. Occupational health services People at workare not comprehensively covered by occupationalhealth activities. Of about 100 000 physicians inoccupational health in the European Region, aboutone third to one half are full time. Of about172 500 occupational health nurses, about 60 000have been specifically mined in occupational healthand two thirds work on a full-time basis. Over100 million workers in transport, agriculture, smallindustries and construction, or in remote areas,remain without easy access to occupational healthservices. Many others, such as the self-employed,are not covered by services at all. Only about 45%of the economically active population in the Re-gion as a whole are estimated to be covered by in-plant or group occupational health services, while123 Healthy environment113 a further 30% are covered by more limited occu-pational health services linked to primary healthcare. Coverage varies greatly between countries,ranging from less than 10% to almost 100% of theeconomically active population (19). Occupational disease and accidents Preven-tion has focused on the early detection of occu-pational disease, and the exposure to many toxicagents and harmful physical factors at work hasbeen .educed. Nevertheless, workers in the Regionare exposed to a wide range of occupational healthand safety hazards, with an estimated 10.6 millionaccidents at work yearly, 21 000 of which are fatal.Many of these are preventable. Some 650 000 newcases of occupational disease are estimated to oc-cur annually within the European Region, with anaverage annual incidence of 1.85 per 1000 workers(19). In the future, as living and working environ-ments increasingly blend, the rates of some occu-pational diseases will gradually adjust to the levelsfound in the general population of working age. Economic implicationsThe cost of work daysI3st due to work injury such as trauma, low-backproblems and musculoskeletal damage runs intobillions of dollars and continues to grow. Their costto health care budgets is staggering (US $20 thousandmillion per year in the United States) and remainswithout question a priority issue. Lost days due toemployee illness reach high figures. In the Region,hundreds of millions of work days are lost annually,causing unnecessary human suffering and costingnations thousands of millions of dollars a year.Large numbers of the Region's total workforcealmost half the populationare also burdened bychronic disorders such as diabetes, visual andhearing impairments, cardiovascular diseases, in-fectious diseases, genetic disorders, cancers andsexually transmitted diseases. In addition, many ofthe environmental hazards to which the generalpopulation is exposed such as noise, chemicals anddustsare 10 to 100 times more concentrated atworkplaces. Improvement in the work environmentwould thus help to reduce external environmentalexposure.Of the present total of 355 million workers active inthe European Region, 232 million live and work inthe central and eastern part of the Region (19).Employment by sectorservices (50%), industry(35%) and agriculture (15%) in the Region as awholediffers between west and east. A predomi-nance is building up throughout the Region in theservice sector. This brings with it the problems ofnew skills and training, understaffing in other sec-tors and, in consequence, the risk of more injuriesand stress (see also target 1 on aspects of unemploy-ment). WomenWomen's health issues have physiologi-cal, biological, sociological, cultural and economicaspects. Probably around 150 million of the 355 mil-lion workers in the Region are women, and theirshare is gradually increasing. This highlights theneed, when planning work environments, to con-sider carefully the differences between the sexes inanthropometry, reproductive functions, physiologyand physical activity. The potential effects, such asinjury to genetic material, fetotoxicity and the poss-ibly elevated risk of psychomotor morbidity, areproblems that justify attention (see also target 8). Mental healthA number of workplace conditionsmay cause or trigger psychiatric disorders. The role 124 114Health for all targets of stress is well understood. Mental disturbancescan also result from exposure to pathogenic sub-stances employed in industrial processes, yet thewidespread tendency is still to attribute all suchcomplaints to nerves or hysteria and to neglect thereal causes. Low levels of exposure to toxic sub-stances are the rule rather than the exception inmodern plants, and careful attention is g;ven tonew chemicals released on the market. Neverthe-less, long-term exposure is not well studied andexperience shows that safety regulations are notalways observed. Indeed, situations continue toarise in which workers suffer exposure to toxins,sometimes of a high level (19). DietIt is increasingly recognized that dietarymodifications can significantly reduce the risk ofseveral major chronic diseases. They can also be amajor determinant of the health status and qualityof life of a population. Unbalanced nutrient intakeand overconsumption (leading to obesity and cardio-vascular disease) are issues on which health pro-motion programmes at workplaces need strength-ening, particularly thrci:gh awareness, informationand guidelines. Communicable diseaseTremendous progresshas been made in public health immunization, andsanitation policies have improved the coverage,health and productivity of people at work. Neverthe-less, a good proportion of existing occupationalmorbidity and mortality from such diseases as teta-nus and hepatitis B is both costly and preventable.First aid is a fundamental need in the workplace. Itsaves lives, limits impairment and reduces disabilitytime and health costs, yet millions of people atwork have no access to good first aid.High-risk occupational groups, who are likely toexperience adverse effects earlier than the generalpopulation, are not always systematically tracked.Surveillance programmes are not mandatory bylaw in all countries and wide variation exists intheir application and goals. Vulnerable groupsAge is a developing processand should be valued. Increasing life expectancymeans that more elderly people will continue theirworking life. Their physiological and psychologi-cal needs require special attention.Thousands of children are born disabled or withpotential disability each year. As adults they needto be better integrated into the workplace andsociety, and employers need to increase their re-cruitment of disabled people. Public health andoccupational health services need to make a sub-stantial contribution for people already exercisinga skill or profession who become disabled, as aresult of work injury or illness. More accurateassessments of disability and clear criteria for earlyreturn to work are also needed (see also target 3).One third of the countries in the Region haveachieved advanced levels in workplace conditions.They offer a relatively healthy environment, re-duced risk, injury and disease, and good access tooccupational health care. Even these are only in theearly stages of health promotion, however. Largerindustries have increased their investment inworkplace health and now provide occupationalactivities that complement each other in ways thatbenefit health. In other countries, occupationalhealth services need urgent development to meetexpectations, directives, legislation and people'sconcern for a safe and healthy working environ-ment.125 Healthy environment115 While countries continue to accumulate data oninjury and ill health, occupational health informationis often irregular, scattered, lacking or not compar-able. Difficulties occur with definitions and withsector boundaries, which include health, labour,environment, hygiene and other institutions. Thelack of overall coordination, precision and dissemi-nation of data hampers decision-making. In con-sequence, indicators of the health status of theworkplace are as yet poorly developed, and fewcountries have established a national baseline forworkers' health. Cuggested solutionsMany occupations en-hance people's physical, mental and social well-being. At the same time, work can play an impor-tant role in mortality, disease, injury, impairment,disability and psychological strain.A policy for healthy workplaces should thereforeemphasize the importance of preventive strategiesthat aim to reduce work-related health risks. It shouldalso support healthy practices, including a stimulat-ing job, flexible working hours, health-promotingarrangements, moderate exercise, balanced nutrition,the ability to cope with stress, a lack of sexual andracial harassment, nonsmoking, a moderate use ofalcohol and a lack of substance abuse. It could alsospell out some economic benefits, such as the reduc-tion in total health care expenditure and the increasein economic competitiveness.Changes in workplace settings can be made toencourage the adoption of healthy lifestyles. Thehealth and wellbeing of people at work would beenhanced if these issues received early attention.The principles and concepts being developed forhealth promotion at work deserve the support ofpublic health authorities, trade unions and employ-ees alike. In Finland and Sweden, pilot studies onoccupational health services for small workplaceshave recently been carried out and ways of cooper-ating with primary health care units investigated.Considerable experience of serv ices in smallworkplaces also exists in France. Practical, large-scale activities to provide services for small under-takings and the self-employed are taking place inItaly.The economic benefits to firms have already beendemonstrated in the United States, where well-being programmes have existed for at least 20 yearsand address exercise, smoking, diet, alcohol andstress. A healthy company is typically also a wealthycompany. In view of the long lead time for chronicdiseases, the full impact of today's positive healthpromotion at the workplace will be seen beyond theyear 2000. Health promotion in the workplaceneeds to be backed up by high-quality studies andreviews, as well as educational programmes for theprofessions emerging in this field.One aim of occupational health services is to coverall workplaces effectively. The organization andfunctions of occupational health services in the Re-gion vary in many respects. In every case, compre-hensive services require adequate support systems.These may be structured in different ways, depend-ing on local circumstances. They are likely to in-clude the surveillance of physical and mental illnesscaused or aggravated by work injury, work pro-cesses and exposure; health promotion; reportingand data employersand effective management; and collab-oration between labour and management. Speciallyimportant is the development of a methodology andpublic policies for the organization of health ser-vices for small industries and for the self-employed,126 116Health for all targets with easy access for those with special needs. Theoverall needs of women in the workplace need to bemore clearly identified and policies for their imple-mentation urgently established.Irrespective of the existing systems of funding foroccupational health services, formal support andincentives would increase the coverage and im-prove the service. Discussions should take place todevelop the methodology and administrative pro-cess required for interaction between occupationalhealth care and primary health care. The servicesshould add up to a national network that would linkinstitutions, industry, relevant government sectorsand national experts. They should facilitate theconcerted input of data on workers' health, as wellas research, comparability and effective decision-making. They should also identify new needs andgenerate new measures to deal with them, dis-seminate knowledge, and increase the exchange ofexpertise within and outside the national bound-aries.More and better educated occupational health staffof all disciplines are needed to offer training, edu-cation, decision-making, implementation, diagnosisand support services to meet the emerging needs inthe years ahead.The health of workers depends heavily on teamactivities involving a number of different pro-fessionals. They therefore need a high level ofknowledge of their own discipline and a core know-ledge of that of other members of the team. All themembers need a wider understanding of publichealth and environmental policies, as well as goodmanagement practice at all stages and levels. Edu-cational curricula and teaching methods should bedeveloped to meet the evolving requirements ofthese team professionals in the years to come.Better national occupational health databases areneeded. Baselines can then be identified from whichtargets for an appropriate and feasible reduction ofexisting major illness and injury can be developed.Measurements should be comparable throughoutthe Region, and consequently lead to the develop-ment of a valuable regional database for trends inEurope.Changing personal behaviour is a sensitive matter.Effective outcomes can only result from an in-formed workforce with a right to know and withhealth support and participation at all levels. Par-ticip.: 'an, health risks, attitudes and behaviourneed to be reflected better in the education andawareness of workers. The formulation and imple-mentation of strategies require proper legal foun-dations, as well as cooperation with interest groups,with other sectors of government and the economy,and with the International Labour Office, the Euro-pean Community and other relevant internationalbodies.

Copenhagen, WHO Re-gional Office for Europe, 1990 (WHO Re-gional Publications, European Series, No. 26). 128 6Appropriate care Health services are attracting increasingly close atten-tion and budgetary scrutiny in most Member States.Chapters 4 and 5 focused on policies, programmesand specific activities that can contribute signifi-cantly to the improvement of health and the preven-tion of disease by promoting and supporting healthypatterns of living and by ameliorating the environ-ment. These initiatives are complemented by develop-ments in the provision of comprehensive healthservices of good quality that are accessible to thewhole population. This is the third essential area ofaction in the regional health for all policy, and thischapter deals with the main issues involved. Healthcare functions include not only curative care but also:the maintenance and development of preven-tion services in such fields as immunizationand the surveillance of child growth and devel-opment;the provision of screening, early detection andtreatment programmes for different groups inthe adult population; andthe provision of rehabilitation and other servicesfor elderly and disabled people to maintain andrestore their capacity for normal daily living.Most countries of the Region now spend 3 10% ofgross national product on health care, three quar-ters of which goes on hospital care. Advances inhealth technology now allow safe and efficienttreatment of various conditions. Paradoxically, theyhave also contributed to an increase in the numberof people requiring care and to the demand forrehabilitation and continuing care at home and inthe community. Health care technology has beenso successful that some countries overuse it whileothers, particularly in the central and eastern partsof the Region, experience acute shortages of basicdrugs, vaccines and equipment. Serious efforts arebeing made to use health services more appropri-ately, taking account of the quality of life and thedignity of patients, particularly those who are seri-ously ill and dying, and emphasizing the quality ofthe care provided.Primary health care is the foundation of appropri-ate care. Its position and importance have to beconstantly restated to redress the balance weightedtowards technological health care syste fts. Pri-mary care is not the concern of general practition-ers alone, but involves other professionals such as 119 129 120Health for all targets nurses, social workers and community-basedpharmacists, who are equally important providersof health care and advisers on self-care.A consideration of the full spectrum of diseaseacute and chronic diseases, minor and major ail-mentsshows that health professionals provideonly a part, albeit an extremely important one, of allpersonal health care. Most care is self-administeredor provided by family members and friends. Yetindividuals and families are seldom given suf-ficient information to make informed choices aboutthe appropriate use of medical services or to par-ticipate equally with health professionals in mak-ing decisions. Many health care systems are not assensitive as they should be to the need's of individu-als and families, who as a result often make ineffec-tive use of services.The philosophy of health for all calls for betterinteraction, integration and coordination of ser-vices, for a multisectoral approach to prevention,health promotion, rehabilitation and care, and forformal recognition of the greater potential role ofindividuals, families and communities. Today, al-most no country is fully satisfied with these aspectsof its health services.The new governments in the central and easternparts of the Region face particular problems inreforming their health service systems in line withthe pluralism of their political programmes. Thedemand for health services is likely to increase,owing to the backlog of unmet need, demographictrends, growing consumer expectations and tech-nological progress. These countries also have tocope with problems related to health personnel,including demands for higher pay and the shortageof nurses and other professionals. Both govern-ments and staff have to deal with change anduncertainty, as new funding mechanisms and or-ganizational structures are introduced in the plural-ist settings now developing in these countries.The health service systems in all Member Statesare under increasing pressure to use all their re-sources efficiently, effectively and equitably. Theyare also expected to pay close attention to thesatisfaction of both the general public and userswith the services provided. The management has tobe responsive to a health services workforce thatexpects fair rewards, both in comparison with theearnings of other occupational groups and as arecognition of the responsibilities and tasks it car-ries out. The workforce also expects good con-ditions of work, and the opportunity to carry out itstasks in ways that are professionally and personallysatisfying.These trends reinforce the need for comprehensiveand linked information systems for all parts of thehealth service (community-based services, institu-tions and various agencies). These systems cantrack what is happening throughout the health ser-vice and provide timely, valid and relevant infor-mation for policy and operational decision-making.Such information systems must be very carefullydesigned to take into account concerns about ethicsand confidentiality.Both policy-makers and managers are under press-ure to act on the most urgent day-to-day problems.If they understand the basic principles of health forall, it will give them a valuable strategic frameworkwithin which to make shorter-term decisions.The need for greater equity in health requires force-ful action to reduce the politically indefensible andsocially unacceptable differences in access to ser-vices. These inequities can only be reduced by tackling I 3 0 Appropriate care121 the financial, cultural or physical barriers that limitaccess to appropriate care. Attention should also bepaid to the unequal access that may result fromdecisions about resource allocation, funding mech-anisms for services, and payment mechanisms forinstitutions and individual professional providers.The principle of multisectoral collaboration alsoneeds emphasis. Many patients' problems can onlybe addressed adequately if a number of sectors suchas social welfare, housing and transport act jointly.Accordingly, Chapter 6 has three groups of targets(see Fig. 5). The first group is concerned with thepolicies for health services (target 26) and theirimplementation through organization and manage-ment (target 27). Targets 28 30 foct, s on the threemajor types and settings of health care: primaryhealth care in the community, hospital care as itsupports primary care, and long-term care for thechronically ill and other groups with special needs.Target 31 explicitly addresses the quality and out-come of health care and technology.

Achievement of this target will depend on the adoption, implementation and constantupdating of clear-cut health service policies by appropriate bodies in all Member States,as an essential component of health for all policy. These policies should:clearly state the lines along which health services will develop;be based on the principles of physical and economic accessibility, quality andcultural acceptability;establish primary care as the foundation for service delivery, supported by systemsof secondary and tertiary care;make a commitment to continuing improvement in quality of care;secure the active participation of the public and health service providers in policyformulation and implementation. Problem statementMost countries in theEuropean Region have health service policies,but many of these policies have a very narrowfocus, concentrating on organizational issues andthe real but short-term needs of maintaining theinfrastructure of current service provision. Fewtake a wider view that encompasses importantcomponents of health service policy, such as re-sources and management issues (see target 27) orthe assurance of the quality of care and the use ofappropriate technologies (see target 31). Many policies claim to be set within the conceptualframework of health for all and acknowledge theprinciples of equity, accessibility and quality ofcare. Often, however, there are no mechanisms toensure that these principles become a reality. Thepursuit of productivity and efficiency, both laud-able and necessary aims, has resulted in a preoccu-pation with political expediency, cost containment,the financing of services and the payment of healthservice providers (/).Health service policy often divorces the issue ofhealth from the provision of services to deal with illhealth. It is largely concerned with the more glam-orous, high-profile technological services providedin modern hospitals. While these have an importantpart to play, an overall strategic direction is lack-ing. The long-term goal of improving the quality of 1;32 Appropriate care123 care at all levels and the health of the populationhas been lost.Health service policy is hard to realign to becomean essential component of health for all strategieswhen clear developmental direction and guidanceare missing. The principles of policy are simple toset out yet difficult to put into operation. Theyencompass aceessibility and quality. They defineprimary and continuing care as the foundations ofhealth service delivery, supported by secondaryand tertiary services. They require improvementsto the quality of all care and of specific tech-nologies. They encourage the participation of healthservice providers and consumers in the formu-lation, development, implementation and evalu-ation of policy.An equitable health service is without barriers toaccess for people in need. The organization of ser-vices can either limit or widen access. Currently, anumber of physical, financial and cultural barriersblock w:der access to services in many parts of theRegion. For example, health centres, doctors'premises, child health clinics and hospitals may beinconveniently located, incurring long, difficult orcostly journeys. The times at which services areavailable may be inconvenient to patients, and lan-guage or cultural factors may inhibit communicationbetween patients and health service personnel.Until recently, the hospital was regarded as thebasis of the health care system in almost everycountry in the Region. Today, many countries havepolicies that emphasize the central position of pri-mary care, with services that are comprehensiveand integrated, provided locally, organizedintersectorally, and supported by secondary andtertiary services. Nevertheless, this is not alwaysfollowed up with implementation strategies thatpromote primary health care. Too often the hospi-tal sector receives the largest share of health carefunding, while primary care services remain under-resourced. These services often include commu-nity nursing, homes for elderly people, home careservices, and suitable care for people with mentaldisorders and for substance abusers. Many peoplewho are most appropriately cared for in the com-munity and who should receive primary care nowfill hospital beds (2).In most Member States, care providers contributeto policy formulation through their professionalorganizations. Such participatory mechanisms arejust beginning to emerge in the central and easternparts of the Region. These countries have tradition-ally taken a unified approach to policy on healthservices and the education of health professionals.In many countries, efforts have been made to in-volve the public in policy formulation throughcommunity health councils, health insurance groupsand elected bodies. Unfortunately, these activitieshave not always resulted in true participation, andneed to be re-examined. Suggested solutionsTo develop health ser-vice policies as part of a wider health for allstrategy, all Member States should review theirexisting policies and realign them to allow universalaccess to services of high quality. Establishing pri-mary care as the cornerstone of health service policywould be a first step towards improving the qualityof care. The commitment to quality should alsoapply to improvements in secondary care and par-ticipatory policy development and implementation.Policies should have a clear strategic direction,while allowing flexibility and regular review as133 1 24Health for all targets implementation develops. It would be unrealisticto expect one model policy for health services to beof use everywhere. Many systems operate in theRegion at present. None are \"pure\" systems: nonational health service is funded entirely fromgeneral taxation nor is any system based wholly onprivate insurance payments.People should be clearly informed about the con-tent of the care they can expect to obtain. Theyshould know about the coverage of health needs,the functions and levels of care, the settings andtypes of health services and the standards of qual-ity. There is a danger, however, of specifying tooprecisely what exactly a health service will do inthe clinical arena. The policies most likely to suc-ceed are those conceived and implemented withbroad political, professional and public support inthe voluntary, public and private sectors.The means used to develop and act on agreed policywill vary according to circumstances. They typicallyinclude legislation and regulation to sustain thestrategic intent: the designation of legal responsi-bilities for the delivery of health services, and theidentification of functions and incentives for thecoordination, control and provision of services. Inaddition, field experience and epidemiological stud-ies have already proved useful in some countries byproviding disaggregated small-area statistics thatcan help to identify local health needs.Barriers to access can be tackled in many differentways. Policies on the financing mechanisms, owner-ship and functions of the provider institutions can beadjusted to ensure that people get the services theyneed when they need them. This means makingbasic health services available and accessible to peo-ple where they live and work, and reaching out to so-cially disadvantaged groups. It also means loweringprofessional and social barriers between service pro-viders and users, and improving communicationwith patients, self-help groups and social services.Health care policy needs to ensure that f.,ervices arecomprehensive and coordinated. The whole resi-dent population, including migrants, should haveaccess to a full range of services that can improvetheir physical and mental health and rehabilitatethose with physical, psychological and social dis-abilities. The services should actively addressgroups with specific health problems, includingthose needing long-term or terminal care.Balancing primary health care with.specialized careis an important task. Some countries have adoptedthe simple policy of devoting to primary health careany additional resources that become available.Equally important is a policy focus on quality. Allcare provided, whether by first-contact services orafter referral, should meet the individual's needsfor care. Care should be humane, using proceduresand technology of appropriate quality, and be pro-vided by competent, trained staff. In addition, thecare given should be a response to the individual'sinformed choice. To give care of high qualityrequires real commitment at all levels, from policy-makers through managers to staff delivering care.A commitment to quality can be promoted throughtraining at basic and postgraduate levels, throughthe accreditation of institutions, through the activeinvolvement of the health professions in policyformulation, implementation and review, andthrough continuous learning from feedback on per-formance and outcomes.Community groups, often in dialogue with healthprofessionals, can address public and individual134 consumer satisfaction with, and confidence in, thequality and level of services provided. The com-munity can help identify needs for expansion,reorientation or innovation in the health services.Policy should also address informal carers. Theyare an important health resource. They can work inAppropriate care125 partnership with voluntary services and health pro-fessionals to stimulate and support self-care andother forms of lay care. In addition, if communitygroups are involved they can help to educate thepublic in the informed and rational use of pro-fessional health services. Target 27-Health service resources and management By the year 2000, health service systems in all Member States should be managed cost-effectively, with resources being distributed according to need. This target can be achieved if:management of health care systems and institutions is based on outcome targets forimproved health and patient satisfaction;regionalization is adopted as a guiding principle in the allocation of resources tosecondary and tertiary care;systems are established that facilitate distribution of resources according to commu-nity needs;financing and budgeting mechanisms support the cost-effective use of resources;the tasks of health care providers are appropriately defined to enable effective careto be dispensed in line with agreed policies and functions and to offer attractiveconditions of employment;personnel management practices achieve teamwork, motivation, job satisfactionand the pursuit of excellence;information systems support planning and managementbased on health needs andcost-effectiveness. 135 126Health for all targets Problem statementTarget 26 sets out theneed for clear and well defined health servicepolicies that operate within the framework of healthfor all. Target 27 tackles the issues of cost-effectivemanagement and an equitable distribution of re-sources based on population needs. OrganizationHealth services everywhere areunder pressure because of the growth of technologyand of people's needs and expectations. In addi-tion, virtually all health service systems in theRegion are experiencing financial difficulties. Manyare undergoing organizational restructuring andintroducing new management arrangements. Thesereforms often require radical change to rationalizedecision-making and management operations andto review financing systems (3,4).A common problem, particularly in the central andeastern parts of the Region, is the assumption thatchange will quickly bring benefits. Furthermore, thefinancial costs of transition, the organizational dis-ruption and the =NI to develop new managementskills are often seriously underestimated. The man-agement of change needs considerable support.In some countries, the responsibility for health andhealth services is fragmented, while elsewhere it isfully centralized. In either case, there is often noincentive to meet the health needs of the populationrather than the needs of organizational hierarchiesand institutions. There are few clear, public andresponsive health policies that describe targets,functions, settings and quality of care. The ac-countability for health outcome, performance andcost-effectiveness is often absent or diffuse.Initiatives to reform the organization and manage-ment of health services have often been a piecemealresponse to the immediate problems perceived bythe government of the day. A long-term focus isusually lacking and management infrastructure ischanged with little thought for the long-term con-sequences. Crisis management is not likely to meettargets for improving the health of the whole popu-lation or to satisfy patients. It defeats the objectiveof reorganization because it hinders the search forcost-effective solutions and thus prevents or delaysthe distribution of resources according to need. FinancingMany funding systems are in oper-ation. Targets to reform systems of managementand finance should not seek to be prescriptive, butshould aim instead to provide a framework withinwhich effective implementation of the current policydirections in each country can be maximized.In some countries, reviews of financing mech-anisms have resulted in proposals to shift the bal-ance of service provision between the public andprivate sectors. Problems have often been tackledin isolation, such as the control of health servicecosts, the more effective use of resources, thereallocation of funds to agreed priorities for servicedevelopment, or the adequate funding of essentialservices. A recurring problem is the difficulty ofbalancing the pressures of public policy outside thehealth sector, such as the containment of inflationand restraints on public expenditure, with thosewithin the health system, such as the demands fromcare providers and consumers for better services,more modern technology and better care.Experience with public and private funding hasbeen varied. In the past decade, some countrieshave shifted towards public funding for health caresystems, while others have moved towards privatefunding. Public sector funding, particularly where 136 Appropriate care127 centrally controlled, can moderate health servicecosts and counteract inequities in access to care.Where governments do not give sufficiently highpolitical priority to health, however, public fundingmay lead to serious and damaging underfunding,continuing inequities and a lack of incentives forefficient and effective service delivery and use. Onthe other hand, private sector funding can facilitatepatient choice and provide physicians and other careproviders with greater rewards for skill and effort. Itdoes, however, risk increasing administration costsand may decrease the access disadvantaged peoplehave to care. It can also encourage inappropriatetreatment that is not relevant to patients' needs. Service distributionHealth care resources in-clude financial, staff and capital resources, such asbuildings and technological equipment. The exist-ing organization of these resources is not alwaysrational or based on the needs of individuals or ofthe population.Primary care is usually accessible to most of thepopulation. It does not in all countries, however,serve as the means of entry into a health care systemthat tnily identifies and meets needs. Some countrieslack health professionals with the appropriate train-ing, and others have too many in cities and too fewelsewhere. Social service personnel, such as socialworkers and home helps, are often in short supply.Secondary,,usually hospital-based, care is oftenconcentrated in the teaching hospitals of majorcities. The hospital sector has often found it diffi-cult to establish a rational countrywide network,organized to meet the needs of the population.PersonnelThe increased specialization of healthworkers, with the formal recognition of newprofessions, poses a formidable managerial chal-lenge. While these developments have often im-proved particular aspects of patient care, they havealso made it more difficult to match health workersto the functions and settings dictated by patients'needs. The result is that functions are often frag-mented, especially the diagnosis, treatment andcontinuing care of the individual patient. Increasedinterprofessional teamwork is- hard to achieve inthe face of hierarchical practices. Providers' lack ofmotivation and cooperation has sometimes ham-pered the implementation of health service poli-cies, because of inadequacies in communication,peer group support or incentives. Outcome and performance Changes in thefinancing of health services, ostensibly to redis-tribute resources according to need, have beenclosely allied to management reorganizations inmany countries. Outcome and performance targetshave rightly been espoused as the key to improvinghealth, the treatment of ill health, the quality ofhealth care and patient satisfaction.Experience has revealed difficulties in using thesemeasures because information is lacking and infor-mation systems for management decision-makingare inadequate in areas such as the allocation andcontrol of resources, service development, and themonitoring and evaluation of service outcomes. Suggested solutionsThe challenge is to or-ganize and manage health service resources sothat the policy objectives (universal access to healthservices, high quality of services, a focus on pri-mary health care and better patient health andsatisfaction) can be consistently met. Changes basedon political ideologies must be set within this137 128Health for all targets framework. They can still encompass a wide vari-ety of choice in the exact balance of funding sys-tems and in methods of managing health care andhealth care institutions.OrganizationThe trend in several countries istowards the separation of financing and delivery,as in the United Kingdom, or towards multiplesources of funding as in France, Germany and theNetherlands. The disaggregation of rigidly hierar-chical service structures into more autonomous orfree-standing institutions is a feature of many coun-tries in the central and eastern parts of the Region,while innovation has come from self-employedhealth care providers in Germany. A balance mustbe struck, however, between the decentralized pro-vision of services and central direction, so that theoverall policy objectives are not lost (5 8).Decentralization can also be achieved by devolu-tion to regions, as in parts of Scandinavia. In ageographical region or district, primary care of-fices and facilities can be distributed to cover basichealth needs at home and at work. At the sametime, hospitals and other health services can bedistributed to make up a service pyramid of differ-ent levels of specialization and catchment areas.The aim is to deliver the various components ofservice, such as prevention, diagnosis, treatmentand rehabilitation, in the settings most appropriateto the needs of the patients. One interesting ap-proach, used in a few pilot areas such as St Peters-burg and on a more geographically widespreadscale in the United Kingdom, has been to giveprimary health care providers funds with which topurchase secondary and other services on behalf oftheir patients (810). This has the potential toensure that all levels of service are responsive toneeds, and that primary care forms the basis ofhealth care delivery. On the other hand, such a highdegree of financial and management decentraliz-ation can also lead to uneven and unequally distrib-uted care. Evaluation and accountability are veryimportant, as has been demonstrated in Scandin-avia. There, central health departments have theimportant functions of analysing the characteris-tics of their areas, defining the level and quality ofservices that a population needs, evaluating themeeting of basic functional needs in the area, andpenalizing providers who do not meet requiredlevels of coverage or standards of quality (2). FinancingSeveral countries have found it usefulto review the balance of their public and privatefunding. Austria, particularly in the hospital sec-tor,and Israel offer examples of the introduction ofprivate business management and accounting meth-ods into the health services. The recent health carereform in the Netherlands aims at universal cover-age by insurance and a restructuring of the arrange-ments for financing and providing health care.Constant review is required to ensure that suchmethods indeed support health service efficiencyand cost-effectiveness, while improving qualityand accessibility. Routine outcome indicators, suchas those produced in the United Kingdom, can beused for this purpose.Any chosen form of health services financing (suchas general taxation, national health insurance, com-pulsory employment-related health insurance, orthe individual choice of a health insurance pre-mium and benefits package) and resource allo-cation (such as budget and other forms of prospec-tive allocation and reimbursement to institutions,agencies and providers) should ultimately ensurethat each individual is entitled to and receivesappropriate care. Devices such as out-of-pocketpayments by patients, including co-payments and 138 Appropriate care129 deductibles, as well as reimbursement mechanismsneed to be very carefully constructed. They mustensure that their intended purpose of generatingrevenue or deterring unnecessary use does not pre-vent patients from seeking care when they need it.The danger is that the costs of collection mayoutweigh the income, especially for services withlarge numbers of exempted users. Management All management arrangementsshould provide a framework in which agreed healthservice policies can be implemented. They shouldsuit the general culture and organization of thecountry and ensure that the health care system as awhole functions smoothly and always in the inter-ests of the patients rather than the providers. Thearrangements should also ensure that individualinstitutions, agencies and providers are able tofunction effectively and efficiently with the re-sources available.At the level of the health care institution, themanager's tasks are to set institutional objectives(within a framework of broader policies and objec-tives for the system as a whole), to identify thetasks that need to be carried out to harness thenecessary resources (personnel, supplies, equip-ment and information) and to monitor activity andtake corrective action when required. This impliesa number of tasks such as personnel management(including the recruitment, training, development,retention and reward of staff), inventory manage-ment, internal maintenance of the building, andexternal relations with other institutions and thepublic.Management should concentrate on outcomes andhave explicit targets for policy objectives that in-clude improving the health of the population andservice delivery to individual patients. Monitoringand evaluating services against these targets andobjectives is an important management functionthat will strengthen mechanisms for quality assur-ance. Regions, districts, institutions and individualproviders have usefully compared their perform-ance with that of their peers, for example in theUnited Kingdom (/ /). Personnel For performance to be measured fairly,tasks must be clearly defined and all staff mustknow what is expected of them. Salaries may ormay not be linked to performance measures, but allpayment systems should promote behaviour andactivity that accords with policy intentions.Effective personnel management requires an equi-table policy for the remuneration of each categoryof health worker. This can be by salary or fee or insome other form, and can encompass other termsand conditions of contract, such as the type andlevel of responsibilities exercised, the expectedhours of duty or availability, holiday entitlements,retirement benefits and opportunities for continu-ing education and professional development. Withan equitable policy, each category of worker feelsthat the rewards and other conditions of work arefair.One measure of high quality work is the cohesive-ness of the whole health care system the smooth-ness with which patients move through it and areserved. Interdisciplinary teamwork is important sothat family health physicians, nurses, social work-ers, physiotherapists, pharmacists and other pro-fessionals, each offering complementary skills,function together as a team, to provide a completeservice to an individual patient, neighbourhood orgroup.139 130Health for all targets InformationChanges in health service financingand management require the support of well devel-oped and integrated information systems. Data mustbe captured, ordered, linked, presented and inter-preted in a way that makes them useful for planning,for clinical decision-making and for management.The ideal, nowhere fully realized, is a shared infor-mation system that gives health care staff feedbackon the efficiency, effectiveness and outcomes oftheir performance. Epidemiologists and health ser-vice planners can use such a system to identify thecontinuing and changing needs of the populationserved. They can also assess the cost-effectivenessand quality of the health service system. Seniormanagers can use it to monitor the allocation ofresources among functions and client groups and toevaluate the efficiency, effectiveness and qualityof the services provided. Policy-makers can linkhealth service information with information fromother sources to make strategic decisions on thefuture of health development. The aim is not onelarge database with free access to all, but rather asystem of many databases that are linked whileguaranteeing confidentiality and selectivity. Suchsystems are technically possible, bu .. require care-ful design and development, backed up by trainingand support. Target 28-Primary health care By the year2000,primary health care in all Member States should meet the basic healthneeds of the population by providing a wide range of health-promotive, curative, rehabili-tative and supportive services and by actively supporting self-help activities of individuals,families and groups. This target can be achieved if Member States:promote and provide preventive and curative health services, including diagnosis,treatment, care and rehabilitation, through locally organized delivery systems;provide community groups with technical, financial, information and other forms ofsupport and make them active partners in the development of primary health care;remove all financial, physical and cultural barriers to the use of primary health care;strengthen active outreach to the community and cooperation with other sectors toachieve effective use of health services;ensure adequate numbers of appropriately qualified family health physicians andnurses for the primary health care services; 14 0 Appropriate care131 organize primary care in such a way as to achieve integration of services based onteamwork among health care providers;ensure effective patient referral and the mutual provision of technical support by alllevels of care.Problem statementTo meet the basic healthcare needs of the population, a wide range ofservices must be provided at a local level. Theseservices need to be backed up by active support toindividuals and community groups. The definitionof \"local\" may vary according to the community,but access to primary health care services for allwho need them is vital, as is outreach to the com-munity and intersectoral collaboration.All the countries in the European Region have thebasic elements of a local primary health care sys-tem, although significant variations emerge in therange and level of services available locally to meetbasic health needs. Even in the more prosperouscountries of the Region, resources and servicesmay be poorly distributed.In reproductive and maternal health services, vari-ations exist in quality, availability and accessibil-ity. Antenatal and perinatal services exist every-where, but their quality varies. The appropriate-ness of the technology used in the care of womenbefore, during and after birth continues to be de-bated in some countries. Likewise, family planningand contraceptive services are not uniformly avail-able. When termination of pregnancy is indicatedon health grounds and is legally sanctioned, timelyand appropriate services may not be available. Inother cases, the health and social problems arisingfrom the strict application of restrictive legislationon abortion, including the consequences of illegalabortions, may be underestimated. In addition,couples unable to conceive may not have access tofertility clinics. Genetic counselling services arestill unsatisfactory in some countries. People withsexual problems often have no access to appropri-ate counselling and treatment services.In the field of child health services, immunizatio:irates have shown a steady improvement in recentyears. Important gaps in coverage persist, withsome countries of the Region having particularproblems (12,13 ). The elimination of certain com-municable diseases from the European Region (seetarget 5) will require more sustained cooperationfrom primary care workers, parents, communityleaders and the public at large.Outreach to the community is essential. In manyareas of primary health care, the success of pro-grammes depends on the cooperation and involve-ment of community groups as active partners in thedevelopment of appropriate and accessible ser-vices. A wide range of community groups catersfor specific sectors of the population and offersopportunities to develop more effective and com-prehensive services. Yet they are often an underusedresource, operating in isolation from mainstreamprimary health care, and are not recognized andsupported as active partners and co-workers. Thispartnership is particularly important when provid-ing primary health care for groups of people withspecial needs (see target 30).Primary health care services are not always wellplaced to support people coping alone or with thehelp of informal carers. Health care is not the sole141 132Health for all targets prerogative of professionals, and many people copeon their own with a wide range of health problems.Many people find self-care attractive because itinvolves personal choice, and lets them control theirbodies and make their own decisions.Health workers have readily grasped the conceptthat primary health care is a professional service offirst contact and the point of entry or referral to otherlevels of secondary and more specialized care. Pri-mary health care includes not only family doctors,but also community-based nurses, health visitors,midwives and other health professionals such asspeech therapists, chiropodists, psychiatric nurses,occupational therapists, dietitians and physio-therapists. These health professionals need to learnhow to cooperate better with one another acrossdisciplinary boundaries. They should be aware ofeach other's professional contribution, supplementeach other's knowledge and skills, and make a broadercontribution to the solution of complex problemsfacing individuals, families and communities.In addition, health professionals need to workinterscctorally with other providers such as socialservices and housing departments. In many coun-tries, primary health care and related social servicesdo not yet provide long-term follow-up for patients,after discharge from primary health care or hospital.Opportunities are lost for solving basic health prob-lems effectively and for securing appropriate helpfrom others for patients with psychological andsocial, as well as physical, problems. These issuesbecome even more important with aging populationsexperiencing multiple difficulties.One of the problems of ensuring integrated andcontinuing care is the increasing specialization ofhealth professionals. The European Conference onNursing in 1988 found that in some countries theshortage of nurses and the lack of well organizedcommunity and domiciliary nursing services re-duce the possibility of providing a complete pri-mary health care service(14,15).In others, primaryhealth care professionals lack the knowledge, skillsand competence to coordinate care for their pa-tients or clients in an effective way.Continuity of care is essential and, while in allcountries health services are operationally integratedthrough referral mechanisms, these mechanisms are notalways well understood either by the general populationseeking care or the people working in the services. C uggested solutionsThe basic values set outin the Declaration of Alma-Ata - such as the needfor services to be available, culturally acceptable, af-fordable, accessible, and professionally and scientifi-cally sound - remain valid and should continue to under-pin the development of primary health care (16 -19).Local, well integrated, community-based pro-grammes addressing all aspects of primary healthcare need to be developed and supported. The changesand action needed to bring this about will vary fromcountry to country according to the current situation.There is ample scope for supporting self-help andbringing together representatives of the community,the health services (particularly primary health care)and other sectors.When radical change in the health service system isbeing contemplated, clear policies must be estab-lished, identifying the health objectives and contri-butions of the primary health care system. Thisprocess is by no means a simple one and no onesystem can be universally recommended. Primaryhealth care can be realigned and tailored in manyways to the specific needs of the population it serves. 142 Appropriate care133 A searching review of existing practice is an essen-tial first stage. This should clarify the nature andscale of actual and potential health problems. Itshould also estimate whether current diagnostic,therapeutic and rehabilitative care and outreach sup-port really improve health and meet the needs of thepatient. This will facilitate the development of poli-cies that clearly state the range of services andtechnology required to meet the objectives, and therequired numbers and abilities of the staff to beemployed. The overall aim is to draw up policies thatwill bring about a real shift towards primary healthcare, and will ensure that patients are seen as awhole, in the context of their family circumstancesand home and work environments.The scope of activity for primary health care systemsis broad. It includes disease prevention and controlprogrammes, the use of clinical settings, home careand varioi.s media to educate the community aboutprevailing health problems, their effective preven-tion and control, and health promotion. It ensures thecoordination and integration of care in an inter-disciplinary and multisectoral way, where appropri-ate, and offers prompt, professionally sound treat-ment locally for conditions that do not require spe-cialized attention. When necessary, the primary careworker arranges for the earliest possible referral toappropriate specialist providers and facilities.Good primary care systems also value the patient'scontributions to care. They encourage the partici-pation of individuals and of self-help groups or-ganized around specific health issues, such as thoseof diabetic patients and haemophiliacs' familyorganizations.It is particularly helpful if families can have aclose, long-term relationship with their own familyphysician and family nurse. Family physicians andnurses require a broad health for all outlook and acommitment to improving the quality of life of thepeople they serve. General practice is progressingtowards this ideal. The concept of the health for allnurse has started to take root sii v.e the EuropeanConference on Nursing in 1988. This basic healthcare worker provides, for a number of families andhouseholds, a continuous and integrated service oflifestyle counselling, home care and well-babycare.Appropriate staff training is important and shouldinclude the development of skills that facilitate inter-disciplinary teamwork, so that care can be closelycoordinated and integrated to fit the individual pa-tient's or client's needs. Changing a professionalculture is a strategic task that will need to be ad-dressed in both the basic and the continuing edu-cation of all health workers. Such education shouldencourage them to pursue excellence in their workand health for all values and objectives (see target 36).Good primary health care professionals also act asadvocates of the individual patient when in contactwith the rest of the health service system. Theycommunicate with lay people, recognize and effec-tively use the resources existing in the community,and integrate their activities with the skills and self-help efforts of individuals, families, carers and com-munities. Rules and conventions of practice on re-ferral among primary health care providers and be-tween them and secondary care providers shouldalways operate in the patient's interest rather thanfor administrative or provider convenience.Health administrators and managers must facilitateready access to primary health care. Financing poli-cies, usually set as part of a central policy, must nothinder the access of any individual or group to theservices they need.143 134Health for all targets Target 29-Hospital careBy the year 2000, hospitals in all Member States should be providing cost-effectivesecondary and tertiary care and contribute actively to improving health status and patientsatisfaction. This target can be achieved if hospitals:actively support the provision of primary health care in the areas they serve;concentrate on specialized services requiring technology and skills that can bedelivered efficiently only in institutional settings;assess their performance in terms of health status, quality of life, patient satisfactionand contribution to an improvement in community health;follow admission and discharge procedures that ensure effective links with primaryhealth care and other community services, and strengthen information systemsaccordingly;ensure adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of health care providers andmanagers;organize care in such a way as to achieve integration of services based on teamworkamong health care professionals;manage personnel, equipment, supplies and facilities cost-effectively.Problem statementThis century has seen atransformation in the role of hospitals. Theyare now placed at the very centre of medical sci-ence and technology. In recent decades, the re-sources allocated to health services have increasedenormously throughout the European Region, es-pecially those allocated to technological develop-ments in medicine. These developments have ledto more accurate diagnosis and effective treatmentfor a wide range of conditions. Some have en-hanced the health, life expectancy and quality oflife for patients, but few have greatly improved thehealth of the population as a whole (20). Technology has been increasingly emphasized, whilethe holistic nature of illness and thus the need to linkhospital care with primary health care, particularlyfor rehabilitation and follow-up, have often beenneglected. Hospitals have not usually attempted toassess their contribution to the health of the commu-nity they serve, or to monitor the effects of theiractivities on the health status, quality of life or144 Appropriate care135 satisfaction of individual patients. This has been duein part to inadequate information systems.The scientific developments in hospitals have beenaccompanied by rising costs. These are exacer-bated by public expectations of continuing medicalinnovation, by a growth in the range of servicesavailable and by a professional drive for excel-lence. Many technical innovations have been widelyadopted, at great expense, without adequate evi-dence of their effectiveness. The challenge is tocontain the consumption of costly resources whilemeeting patients' needs effectively, efficiently andappropriately, maintaining equity of treatment, re-specting the ethics of patient care, and providingintegrated services. Expensive services should nolonger be offered when they have been shown notto benefit patients, so that resources can be spentinstead on care of demonstrable value.The trend towards specialized medical practice,dependent on technology, makes patient care com-plex and difficult to manage. Greater inter-dependence between clinical units makes it in-creasingly difficult to sustain the traditional cul-ture of medical self-sufficiency and autonomy.Larger hospitals have often become difficult andstressful workplaces with high staff turnover. Theculture of health professionals tends to favour try-ing to cope, rather than recognizing stress andseeking support. Suggested solutionsHospitals vary betweencountries. Many hospitals provide both inpatientand outpatient care, while others concentrate oninpatient care supplemented by ambulatory special-ist practices. Countries in the central and easternparts of the Region have inherited a hierarchicalsystem of hospitals and polyclinics (21). Theprinciples suggested here will need to be adapted toindividual systems.New roleThe role of the hospital within thehealth service system as a whole needs to be ad-justed. The aim is for hospital resources to be used totreat and care for people who need such highlyspecialized services, which can only be providedefficiently in an institutional setting. The high qual-ity and cost-effectiveness of care are key objectives.Depending on the prevailing situation, such areorientation may require legislative, economic, edu-cational and other measures. France has adopted aninnovative approach to this process through its com-prehensive hospital law of July 1991 (22).In their new role, hospitals must put more empha-sis on the continuity of care and coordinate theiractivities with long-term care services (see tar-get 30) and with other primary health care facili-ties. They can actively support health promotionand primary health care in a number of ways. Theycan themselves provide settings for active healthpromotion. They can contribute to a healthy en-vironment through well designed and implementedsmoking, alcohol and nutrition policies and throughproper waste management. They can support pri-mary health care by sharing their diagnostic andtherapeutic services (such as radiology, pathology,physiotherapy and occupational therapy) and byensuring patients' access to primary health care ondischarge. Hospitals have a traditional role as cen-tres for research, innovation and the promotion ofgood practice. This can be extended to providecontinuing education for primary health care staff,including joint reviews of cases and support forprimary care research.An international network of health-promoting hos-pitals has recently been initiated (23).145 136Health for all targets Evaluation of careTo assess performance, thedelivery of specialized services needs to be relatedto the health status and quality of life of individualpatients. Performance can be measured only ifclearly stated and well understood objectives havebeen set. If these are defined and quantified, theycan form the basis for comparisons between insti-tutions. Suitable indicators include readmissionrates, complication rates, inappropriate admissions,waiting lists and waiting times, postoperative woundinfection rates, contact with primary health carestaff on a patient's discharge from hospital, andsurveys of patient satisfaction. Since a hospitalstay is usually only one of a number of episodes inthe patient's journey through the health care sys-tem, hospAal outcomes should ideally be related tothe health of the patient over time, though inad-equate information systems usually preclude this.The evaluation of hospital care requires the invest-ment of resources, time and effort into strengthen-ing information systems, not only within hospitalsthemselves but at all levels of health care. Staff issuesThe deployment of hospital staff inprimary health care settings allows the sharing ofexpertise and helps integration. In some places,hospital paediatric, psychiatric and geriatric staffassist primary health care staff in the assessment ofneeds and the continuing management of patients (24).Psychiatric nurses and other specialized hospitalstaff may be permanently attached to primary healthcare settings or be available to support the familyby delivering hospital care at home. Some techni-cal equipment can be used outside hospitals, allow-ing greater use to be made of outpatient and day-patient units, local and mobile clinics, and mobileteams of hospital personnel.Conversely, there are also many examples of pri-mary health care staff being based in or giving directsupport to hospitals. This may include taking respon-sibility for patients in small long-term care facilities,such as local psychogeriatric units. Primary healthcare workers have great scope to serve as consult-ants, since they are familiar with the context ofpeople's daily lives in which health problems arise.Skilled staff working together in ways that maxi-mize their effectiveness are an organization's mostvaluable asset. It is crucial to ensure that an appro-priate number of staff is involved in managementand in the direct provision of service, that all staffhave the requisite competence for their tasks, andthat a culture is fostered that promotes high qualitycare as well as cost-effectiveness. One importantdevelopment, which must be further encouraged, isthe greater readiness of staff to cooperate on aninterdisciplinary level, to learn from others' experi-ence and to be willing to compare their own workwith that of colleagues.Traditionally high-status staff, such as senior doc-tors, play a very important role in the deploymentand use of resources and are often recognized asleaders in the local community. It is particularlyimportant therefore that they acknowledge the needfor change and set an example of how to function ina new managerial culture. ManagementThe new role of hospitals requiresa new style of management and a new sense ofdirection within the overall health care system. Allhospital staff can practise innovative teamworkand show greater accountability with the help ofinformation systems that focus on groups of pa-tients and link clinical data with information onoutcomes, resource use and costs. 146 Appropriate care137 Hospitals arc not only places for diagnosis, treat-ment and care, but also complex economic organ-isms. A number of countries have recently tried totransform the business role of the hospital by creat-ing market models that separate the planning andpurchasing functions from the provision of ser-vices function (25,26). This means that services areoffered to purchasers at a specified price that re-flects cost. The system is intended to promotecompetition between institutions and make com-parison between them normal practice. Such asystem requires a new type of manager, who isprofessionally trained both in business adminis-tration and in the health and hospital fields, andwho can mobilize hospital units to cooperate toreach a common goal. In many instances, thesefunctions will be shared among several managers.An important task for these managers will be tomonitor the degree to which a more market-oriented approach (or, indeed, any managementapproach) encourages hospitals to deploy person-nel, equipment, supplies and information in waysthat enhance the quality of care and optimize theircontribution to the health of the population. Target 30-Community services to meet special needs By the year 2000, people in all Member States needing long-term care and support shouldhave access to appropriate services of a high quality.This target can be achieved if in all Member States country, regional and localauthorities:develop health care services specifically designed to meet the special needs ofpeople suffering from chronic illness or from physical, mental or social disability;coordinate health services with social and income support services and establishappropriate communication;provide self-help and similar groups with support and facilitate their active partici-pation in service planning and delivery;make arrangements to ensure access to high-quality care and support, includingeffective outreach services, and to monitor the continuity and quality of care. 147 138Health for all targetsProblem statementEvery Member State hasgroups of people with long-term health careneeds. They require services especially tailored totheir circumstances, if they are to live as full andindependent lives as possible. These groups in-clude people of all ages who suffer from chronicconditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer,diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders. They alsoinclude people with learning difficulties, thosewho have been physically disabled from birth orbecause of injuries, and those with chronic mentalillnesses. Some of these conditions are more com-mon in the less advantaged social groups. Typi-cally, the average (healthy) life span differs by fiveto six years between the highest and lowest socialclasses. Even the most affluent countries of theRegion show a three- to fourfold social class differ-ence in rates of disability and chronic pain.The \"greying\" of Europe is another important fac-tor. By the year 2000, the Region will have almost70 million people aged 70 years and over, com-pared with around 60 million in 1980. A number ofpeople this age suffer from the degenerative dis-eases of old age, as well as from social isolation,and they are often less likely, and less able, to seekprofessional assistance.Terminally ili people pose special ethical and prac-tical problems. Too often, high-technology care isused in an effort to prolong life, when in fact itreduces the quality of the life remaining to patientsand prevents them from dying with dignity in asituation of their choice.Moreover, appropriate social support for these\"Cinderella\" groupsfrail elderly, disabled andterminally ill peopleis often lacking. Homeservices are often underfunded and many elderlypeople are misplaced and unsupported in long-termhospitals or nursing homes of low quality. Elderlyand disabled people who have maintained somedegree of independence in their own homes oftenlack essential clinical and social services that couldcorrect their eyesight, assist their hearing and mo-bility, and provide them with home help and homenursing. For example, in some countries there arelong waiting lists for hip replacement operationsthat could enable elderly people to recover theirmobility and live more satisfying lives.The very success of health promotion and diseaseprevention increases the demands on nursing andother caring services for these vulnerable groups.Their needs are not automatically met by the normalroutines of primary health care or referral to second-ary and tertiary services. They may not be coveredadequately by the health insurance systems. Themedical orientation and organization of health careoften causes home care services, nursing homes andother support programmes to lack influen*.ial spon-sors and advocates. They are therefore underfundedand slow to develop. This has been especially true ofsocial work and housing adaptation, which fall out-side mainstream medical care.Special needs often call for complex solutions. Theyrequire continuity of care rather than a single profes-sional provider acting autonomously and applyingonly one narrow range of technology or treatment.A major challenge is to harness the contribution ofother sectors, notably social services, housing andtransport. The problem is not always a shortage offacilities or personnel, but a lack of communi-cation, cooperation and coordination among thevarious sectors.Self-help activities also need support. Care hasgenerally come to be seen as the prerogative of148 Appropriate care139 professionals, yet inaividuals and families copewith a wide range of health problems. Such tasksoften place heavy demands on the informal carers,but they may find it difficult or impossible toparticipate in major decision-making processes.Professionals, planners and politiciads make choiceson behalf of people with special needs and theircarers, without consulting them on what is reallyneeded, wanted, acceptable or useful.Suggested solutionsThe prevention of ill-ness and handicap is an important aspect ofcommunity services. As part of primary healthcare, it should focus on healthy elderly people andon those in poor socioeconomic circumstances,such as people who are single and homeless orlong-term unemployed, to prevent them from be-coming chronically ill.The basic approach should be to develop wellintegrated, community-based programmes. Theseshould be part of the primary health care functionbut sufficiently flexible to be specifically tailoredto the circumstances and requirements of individu-als with long-term and other special needs. Long-term disabled people Care programmesfor people with long-term needs, such as those whoare chronically ill, severely disabled or frail andelderly, should be planned, developed and organ-ized in partnership with the people needing theservices. The aim should be to maximize theircapacity to live an independent and fulfilling life.Much more could be done to help disabled peopleto function independently in the community, byrelatively simple modifications of dwellings andpublic buildings, and by specially adapted localpublic transport. New technology in the expandingfield of human performance engineering, such asthe \"stand-up\" wheelchair, can make highly sig-nificant improvements to the quality of life andfunctional ability. In addition, people with psycho-logical or emotional problems can benefit fromhousing that is conducive to social contact andcommunity cohesion. Terminally ill peopleThe care of terminallypeople has improved greatly with the developmentof the hospice movement, which has helped todefine their special needs. The quality of life ofterminally ill people reflects the quality of thesupport they are given by professional care pro-viders and family members or other informal carers.This quality can be judged by how well theirsymptoins are controlled and their mental alertnessis maintained, and by their ability to participate indaily activities and maintain social contacts, withassistance if necessary. The aim is for these pa-tients to be able to make active use of their timeduring the working day, gain personal satisfactionout of the way that time is used, retain an interest inthe world outside and maintain a sense of hope andsomething to live for. The health care and socialsupport services should ensure that everyone whoworks with terminally ill people acquires thesevalues and the skills to act on them. TrainingServing people with all types of specialneed requires a shift in attitudes and working meth-ods. Health care professionals should, through train-ing and continuing education, gain a broader under-standing both of patients' needs and of the con-tributions of other professionals. They have toacquire the ability to manage multiple and complexproblems. Senior personnel in professions such as 1 4 140Health for all targets nursing and social work should be more directlyinvolved in medical education at all levels. Thisshould include practical training in teamwork, sothat they can complement the knowledge and skillsof other team members, and make a specific con-tribution to meeting the special needs of indiv idu-als and families. ResourcesSupport services and financial assist-ance from sectors other than health can be used toallow disabled or frail people to live close to theirfamilies in their own communities. Support forself-care, self-management (particularly within thefamily) and other services outside the health sectorcan be strengthened. For example, lay people, par-ticularly those with complex problems, can betrained to handle their health problems, take pre-ventive measures, recognize symptoms that needprofessional help, and understand the availabilityof, access to and appropriate use of various ser-vices. Professionals must recognize how muchindividuals do and how effective it often is. Theyshould consciously engage the individual, the fam-ily and other carers in the management of prob-lems. Monitoring A systematic review of services canhelp to assess their effectiveness and the quality ofthe care given. It can also point to the organizationand managerial responsibility most conducive toeffective action. Programme indicators are particu-larly useful for measuring the services providedand their outcomes, the degree of teamwork amongdifferent care providers, the effectiveness of theservices for people who need long-term care andthe satisfaction of the people using them. Target 31-Quality of care and appropriate technology By the year 2000, there should be structures and processes in all Member States to ensurecontinuous improvement in the quality of health care and appropriate development anduse of health technologies. This target can be achieved through:combined strategies for the assessment and promotion of the quality of care, theselection, development and proper use of appropriate technology, and the trainingof personnel;international collaboration and information exchange on assessment procedures,care standards, training and technology development 150IlMa Appropriate care141 Maintaining the quality of care requires:systematic monitoring of outcomes of health, quality of life, patient satisfaction, costand affordability, based on appropriate information systems;use of appropriate incentive systems based on the outcomes of care, includingfeedback of comparable information or, outcomes to individual providers andmanagers and to consumers;reorientation of the training of health service personnel to strengthen the emphasison health status, quality of life, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness as perform-ance measures.Achieving the development and proper use of appropriate technologies requires:building effective procedures for assessing benefit and appropriateness into thedevelopment of equipment, pharmaceuticals and other supplies and into theirroutine use throughout the health care system;monitoring of adverse effects to avoid the continued use of harmful or inappropri-ate technology.Problem statementGood quality of caremeans that individuals, families and commu-nities receive care that is sensitive to their needs,acceptable to them and provided in the most appro-priate setting (primary health care, hospital care,long-term care or home care). Quality developmentis an important policy aim in target 26. Goodquality enhances the cost-effectiveness of care (tar-get 27), and it measures the success of care intargets 28 to 30. Thus, quality assurance and devel-opment are an overall umbrella for Chapter 6.The quality of care currently varies within andbetween countries and among service providers.This is partly because of the way health care isorganized and practised, and partly because thestructures and processes for ensuring quality con-tain weaknesses. A further problem is the verysmall share of health care resources devoted to theassessment and assurance of quality (27).More fundamentally, most of the existing mech-anisms used to ensure quality do not give healthcare providers any incentives to change practice,nor do they allow consumers to have a voice.Without a system that informs health care provid-ers about the practices and outcomes of their peers,in other institutions and geographical areas, pro-fessional interest in quality issues is difficult tostimulate.Information abounds on how health care is pro-vided, but it tends to concentrate on measures ofinput and process rather than outcome, such ashealth improvement, quality of life, patient satis-faction and cost-effectiveness. It also tends to fo-cus on individual patients, procedures and util-ization, while data linkage is often hampered forreasons of confidentiality. Many quality assuranceprojects have been undertaken in isolation by in-dividuals or individual clinical teams. In most151 142Health for all targets instances, a piecemeal approach is also perpetuatedby the lack of agreed professional strategies, in-cluding quality standards, indicators and infor-mation support.Good care incorporates quality assurance and devel-opment. This message is not sufficiently empha-sized during training, however, so many health pro-viders resist the idea of the routine, systematic moni-toring of quality, wrongly arguing that this wouldmean diverting time and resources from health care. Development and availability of technologyTechnology by the usual definition covers equip-ment, machinery, medical supplies and substances(including pharmaceuticals) and other supplies usedin patient care. In a wider sense, technology is awhole range of facilities including not only thehardware (equipment, drugs and other supplies)but also health care procedures and the organiz-ation of patient care.By either definition, technology is a means ofdelivering health care services; it is not an end initself. Assessment therefore does not mean pri-marily appraising an individual piece of equip-ment, a drug or a procedure in a laboratory settingto judge its mechanical functioning, safety andefficacy. Evaluating the contribution a given tech-nology makes to the quality of care provided ismore important. Particular procedures, users ofequipment and supplies may sometimes be so es-sential for the quality of care that they can serve as\"tracers\" of quality. More often, quality will de-pend on the interplay of a number of differenttechnologies and factors.In recent years, the development of new technolo-gies has progressed rapidly, raising questions ofaffordability. Progress has not been even through-out the Region, resulting in wide differences inaccess to equipment and devices and in the avail-ability of pharmaceuticals and supplies. It is par-ticularly worrying that, in some countries, obsoletetechnologies are still used(28).The countries of the central and eastern parts of theRegion present special problems. In many cases,health service equipment and pharmaceutical in-dustries have been dismantled as part of rapideconomic change. Several countries have majorgaps in specific types of technology, such as aidsfor people with disabilities. These countries oftenfind imported technology too expensive to pur-chase in the appropriate quantities, with the resultthat they suffer severe shortages of basic equip-ment, drugs and vaccines. Where equipment isavailable, the problem is often the incompatibilitybetween different types of technology and the lackof spare parts(29).In the European Region, pharmaceuticals tend to bemore strictly and stringently regulated than are equip-ment and other supplies. All countries have somesystem of licensing and procedures to control themarketing of drugs, but standards vary throughoutthe Region. In countries with sizeable industries thatproduce equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicalsupplies, export and employment interests also playa role in decision-making. More fundamentally,many providers as well as the general public believemistakenly that \"high-tech\" processes are them-selves direct indications of good quality of care.Producers and regulatory agencies are responsiblefor the assessment of new technologies. Little feed-back has come from health care practitioners or thepublic. Comprehensive assessment and monitoringsystems have therefore been difficult to institute.152 Appropriate care143 The assessment of pharmaceuticals and equipmenthas often been divorced from everyday practice. Ittends to concentrate on easily measured factors suchas safety, efficacy and cost and to make narrowassumptions about the use of technology. For exam-ple, testing a drug for a specific clinical purpose,within a defined protocol using randomized con-trols, becon-,es less relevant when the drug is used inthe field for quite different conditions. The expertswho assess the selection, development and dissemi-nation of technology rarely have sufficiently broadtraining and education to take account of the everydayuses, procedures and organizational arrangementsfor the drugs, equipment and supplies in question. Use of technologyIn health care delivery, theuse of technology is rarely assessed on a routinebasis. Long-established products and processes arerarely evaluated, and assessment is particularlyuncommon in primary health care. Institutionaland disciplinary barriers and lack of expertise inassessment combine to hamper progress.Health care providers need to concentrate on thecomprehensiveness and continuity of care, ratherthan on individual items of technology. They havedifficulty in recognizing how technologies com-bine to affect the quality of the care they deliver. Inaddition, a single provider may not have a suffi-cient number of cases and services to draw statisti-cally relevant conclusions about quality.Most providers of care do not collect adequate datato analyse and monitor their services. This means itis difficult to weigh objectively actual and com-mercially claimed benefits. Lack of appropriateinformation makes it difficult for providers andconsumers to learn from practice and adjust theirbehaviour accordingly.An additional danger is that the choice betweenalternative technologies is based on the preferencesof individual providers and managers, rather thanon a strategic assessment of their quality, effective-ness as treatment, patient satisfaction, and cost.For example, end-stage renal failure may be treatedby different regimens of transplantation and dialy-sis. Even where a strategic assessment leads to thechoice of transplantation, however, it may still notaddress all the issues such as the availability ofdonors, access to appropriate hospital and commu-nity services, and the resulting quality of life.All countries have systems that monitor the ad-verse effects of drugs, based on reporting by indi-vidual doctors on their own initiative. Improve-ments are needed, however, to induce a widerresponse, to spot the harmful effects of drug inter-action that affect special groups such as elderlypeople, and to provide feedback to those collectingthe data. Most of the systems in operation fail toinform users about the findings, making it difficultto induce them to change their practice. The sys-tems should not only alert practitioners about harm-ful effects but also identify shifts in indications,use, practice and health outcomes. Suggested solutionsHealth administrations,associations of providers and others involved inhealth care must have clear strategies and programmeson quality and technology development in healthcare. They should address the different responsibili-ties of each level of care. In so doing, they shouldclarify the process of assessment to be used, theresults they expect and their consequences for healthcare practice. Strategies and programmes will haveto be formulated very carefully so as to facilitate thepurposeful involvement and cooperation of providergroups, researchers, policy-makers at different153 144Health for all targets levels, public health authorities and consumers.Specific efforts, including appropriate training, willbe required to make it clear that quality develop-ment is a responsibility that all must share.An important part of the strategy is to have aninformation system that continuously focuses on theoutcomes, achievements and cost-effectiveness ofcare; identifies the best achievers; looks at theirpractice, innovations and use of technology; indi-cates the important elements and characteristics un-derlying their success; and builds on professionalpride and ethics to motivate providers to measure,discuss and constantly improve the quality of theircare. MotivationThe most powerful incentive forchange is the sharing of information on the qualityof care and the appropriateness of technology.Authorities should support meetings betweenhealth care providers, health administrations andauthorities, patients, consumer groups, industryand research institutes. At national and other lev-els, steps can be taken to disseminate examples ofgood practice and innovative information tools.Quality development is a dynamic process thatgoes beyond conventional mechanisms, such ascertification, licensing, standard setting and re-view, and compulsory medical audit, which bythemselves prov ide insufficient incentives forchange.One of the most important steps in quality develop-ment is to motivate health care providers to take acritical look at the quality of their care. At least oneapproach has been shown to improve quality: thecomparison of practice, utilization and cost in rela-tion to outcome, for specific health problems, con-ditions or diseases.Giving comparative information to individual careproviders and units about their performance is apowerful means of self-improvement. It is a basisfor both individual and collective learning, espe-cially about methods and approaches that haveproved to be helpful and have demonstrated goodquality and improved health. Development and dissemination Policies onhealth technology in Member States should in-clude the adoption and dissemination of technolo-gies. They should also include mechanisms toreview the effectiveness of particular diagnostic,therapeutic and rehabilitative technologies. Thedevelopment and dissemination of technology re-quire a mix of incentives and regulations, depend-ing on the particular circumstances of each coun-try. The most important factor is to improve theinput from health care practice. Assessment needsto be carried out in routine clinical settings ratherthan under laboratory conditions.A comprehensive policy for pharmaceuticals ad-dresses drug legislation and registration, qualityassurance, pricing, drug supply, drug information,drug utilization, education in the prescribing anduse of drugs, and drug research and development.Such a policy would ensure the adequate supply ofsafe and effective drugs of good quality at a reason-able price and their appropriate use.Policies in countries can go a long way towardsgiving strategic direction to the development oftechnology and quality. Policy-makers may, forexample, promote research priorities in relativelyneglected areas, encourage the judicious use ofeconomic instruments, strengthen safety regu-lations, formulate policies on the promotion andadvertising of technologies and promote industry's 154 Appropriate care145 cooperation with health authorities, care providers,hospital managers and research institutes. Assessment of outcome The assessment of thequality of care and the appropriateness of tech-nology share the same criteria of success: out-comes. This points to the usefulness, at all levels,of a routine assessment of outcomes such as betterpatient care, health outcomes, patient satisfactionand overall quality of life. This process requires thedevelopment and use of clear outcome indicators.Ethical issues should always be taken into con-sideration, to ensure that implementing the pro-posed strategies improves health, equity and theacceptability of care. The constraints of availableresources should always be borne in mind.When new technologies are being developed, clearassessment criteria should be applied. It may behelpful to ask such questions as: Will this newtechnology significantly improve health? Does itmake existing technology obsolete? Is it cost-effective when used throughout the system? Will itmake care less painful or more acceptable to thepatient? Monitoring of effectiveness For economic andpractical reasons not all technologies can be underscrutiny simultaneously. The first technologies tobe assessed might be those that have potentiallyhigh risks, are expensive or are most commonlyused.Itisparticularly important to monitorany adverse effects that could render the con-tinued use of a technology inappropriate. Policies,legislation, regulations and practices should indi-cate clearly what action should be taken if thetechnology is found to be inappropriate or ineffec-tive.For example, formal mechanisms are needed tomake systematic and proper evaluations of drugsbefore and after marketing, and to make accurateand complete information about drugs and theirproper use easily available to health professionalsand the public. Continuous follow-up of their usein clinical practice is also needed to assess theireffects and side effects. Feedback from practiceInformation systemsfor the development of quality and technology mustsystematically monitor actual practice and resultingchanges in health status, quality of life, patientsatisfaction with care received, and costs. As thislist indicates, different types of data need to bebrought together from many provider institutions,professional disciplines and locations, as well asfrom patients and industry, while safeguardingtheir confidentiality. Such an information systemcan help to pinpoint the procedures and technolo-gies that are most crucial for quality development.Where this has been done, as in the case of diabetes,monitoring can focus on these critical indicators,thus simplifying the process of data collection andanalysis. Professional organizations should be en-couraged to develop a consensus on quality indi-cators that they can accept and use effectively forthe practical monitoring and assessment of tech-nologies.Some countries have found it useful to obtain inputfrom the users of health care. They may be askedabout their perceived health status before, duringand after treatment, the changes in the quality oftheir lives, and the level of their satisfaction with thecontent and amenities of care and with the attentionthey receive. There is ample scope for surveys oncea period of care is over, such as on discharge fromhospital. Users may be more interested in providing155 146Health for all targets information before and during care, if they canthereby influence the process and outcome of thecare. They may, however, be inhibited if they are notconvinced that their responses will be kept confiden-tial and fear that criticism may adversely influencetheir care. Education and trainingThe training of all healthstaff, as well as staff in other sectors, should par-ticularly include quality development, as well asmethods for the assessment and use of health caretechnology. Progress has been made in some countries by dis-seminating information to the general public moreeffectively and by consulting consumer interestgroups on a continuing basis, to agree on appropri-ate expectations of quality. International collaboration International col-laboration has ample scope for sharing ideas andinformation and pooling comparative data. Inter-national work can also help develop acceptablecare standards and training programmes. Since thescope of technology assessment is already too vastfor many countries to deal with on their own, it isparticularly suited to international action. Inter-national solidarity can also help alleviate the acutedrug, vaccine and equipment shortages in the cen-tral and eastern parts of the Region and help thesecountries develop and modernize appropriate in-dustries in this field.

The principles and strategies of health forall must therefore gain wide political acceptance inthe European Region. This will also promote agreater commitment to implementation. Progresstowards the health for all goals will take place in aclimate of opportunity, but also of uncertainty.The complexity and difficulty of making wisespending choices are likely to increase. As politi-cal, business and other decision-makers gain abetter understanding of the contribution that healthprotection and promotion strategies could make tothe achievement of their own objectives, they willrealize the need to invest in health. Advances inhealth care technology and the aging of the popu-lation will boost demand for greater expenditure onmedical and nursing services. While many politi-cians see this growth in expenditure as unsus-tainable, the basic principle of equity demands thatpeople with similar or comparable needs have equalaccess to care (1). Ethically, this right cannot bejettisoned in the interests of cost containment or abalanced budget. Economists and other policyanalysts should find ways of resolving this di-lemma, and provide guidance in choosing betweenalternative ways of using resources. eadership: meeting the challenges Creativeand flexible leadership will be essential to carrythe health systems of the Region through thisperiod of transition. Such leadership will be foundin political, managerial and professional spheres. Itmust maintain the political visibility of health incountries and international bodies. It must sustainhealth workers' confidence and attract support fromthose outside the health sector who are crucial tothe achievement of better health. It must also con-tinue to promote innovation and quality in treat-ment and care. At the same time, the political,economic and social changes taking place through-out the Region, particularly in the central andeastern part, should make it possible to experimentwith and develop new policies and structures toprotect and promote public health. These changesshould also allow new forms of organization toevolve that will be more effective in meeting thehealth care needs of the population. 149158 1 50Health for all targets The achievement of health for all depends on effec-tive measures to secure greater equity in health, topromote healthy lifestyles, to create environmentsthat sustain good health and to ensure access toappropriate care. Each of these policies and relatedactions presents a number of important challenges.For example, achieving equity in health and betteraccess to the prerequisites for health may involv ere-examining the aims and priorities of overallsocial policy. Health promotion emphasizes theimportance of public policy in creating social andphysical environments conducive to healthy liv-ing. The development of settings for healthy livingtakes account of the social as well as the physicalenvironment, and also calls for new structures andprocesses to facilitate community participation.Environmental health stresses not only better con-trol of air, water and soil pollution and wastedisposal, but also living and working environmentsthat protect and maintain good health. Preventingpollution requires systems of planning and deci-sion-making that work across the departmentallines of the public sector at all levels. It alsodepends on cooperation between the public, pri-vate and voluntary sectors. The focus on appropri-ate care reflects the continuing movement towardsprimary care and the prevention of disease anddisability, coupled with efforts to improve thequality of life, particularly for those who are chroni-cally ill. Strengthening teamwork in primary careand disease prevention requires not just new formsof health care organization but a different emphasisin professional education.Health for all development means providing sup-port to ensure that these challenges can be met.Health for all broadens the definition of healthpolicy and strategy. It creates a new emphasis onpublic health that asserts the importance ofcommunity involvement and the contribution tohealth objectives that other sectors can make.The targets in this chapter address the basic needsthat must be met for sound health for all develop-ment: the development of knowledge and infor-mation support for policy and action; the creationof the requisite managerial infrastructures; the de-velopment of human resources for health; the mo-bilization of resources and broad social support;and the advocacy and practice of ethical values(Fig. 6).Formulating policyPolicy is the foundationof health for all development. Target 33 definesthe characteristics of such policies as reflecting thefundamental principles of reducing inequities, pro-moting health, preventing disease and disabilityand providing appropriate care. The challenge ofcreating opportunities for healthy patterns of livingand for healthier environments, and the task ofensuring equitable access to health services to-gether require the achievement of comprehensiveand balanced policies, as called for in target 33.The challenge for the 1990s is to translate promisesinto practice in a way that matches tne progress inpolicy adoption in the past decade.Resources for health for all developmentResearch strategies and information systemsare important sources of the knowledge required tosupport health for all development. Targets 32 and35 are concerned with the acquisition of the know-ledge needed to evaluate present policy and prac-tice, to plan for the future and to make managementdecisions. The challenge for research is to developprogrammes that will address the practical ques-tions emerging in health for all development.159 Health for all developmentstrategies151 Fig. 1Fig. 6. Health for all development strategies Public health developmentand mobilizationTarget 34 Managing health for all developmentTarget 37 Partners for healthTarget 38 Health and ethics Strategic actionsTarget 32 Health research and developmentTarget 35 Health information supportTarget 36 Developing human resources for health PolicyTarget 33 Health for all policy development Information needs are many and varied, arising insituations extending from medical practice to stra-tegic choice. Information systems must develop inways that make them relevant and accessible to theuser. Their importance reflects the fact that healthfor all development is occurring in an informationsociety. Information of all kinds, analysed andpresented in appropriate formats, can do much toestablish a foundation for effective cooperationbetween sectors.The health system, as visualized in health for all,requires properly trained, professionally com-petent workers. Health care management requiresstronger teamwork, a more effective use of person-nel and the provision of work environments thatsupport high quality care. Nevertheless, many ofthe people who can contribute to health for all workoutside the health care sector: in education, en-vironment, agriculture, architecture, urban plan-ning and elsewhere. One of the greatest challenges 160 152Health for all targets of this decade is to influence the education andtraining of workers in sectors other than health, sothat they support and reflect health for all valuesand objectives more widely in their professionalpractice. Target 36 addresses the education, train-ing and effective use of all human resources forhealth for all, with a strong emphasis on the phil-osophy and practice of primary health care and onresponse to community needs. Public health leadership and infrastruc-tureTarget 34 addresses the need for healthfor all development to be guided and coordinated.This becomes increasingly important as the needfor long-term strategies in health becomes clearer,as health care systems become more pluralistic inthe funding and ownership of institutions and ser-vices, and as health for all principles are graduallyseen as having wide application in practice. Asstrategies on lifestyles, the environment and healthservices mature, the accompanying investmentchoices become correspondingly more complexand difficult. This creates a greater need for institu-tions to have strong public health mandates thatfacilitate these choices and stimulate necessaryaction.Partnerships for health for all Communityparticipation and intersectoral action are funda-mental principles of health for all. Participation en-compasses many activities, from those of local self-help groups to the advocacy role played by voluntaryorganizations at regional and national levels. Target37 addresses the structures and organizational pro-cesses that might be adopted in and by countries tofacilitate the forging of partnerships for health forall. The underlying motive is to provide groups andpublic, private and voluntary bodies with access todecision-making on health, and to give them thesupport they need to become effective partners.Consensus on ethicsThe growing range ofmedical treatment and technology, with sig-nificant and differing resource implications, raisesan increasing number of ethical issues and chal-lenges established value systems. The issues con-cern policy, the rights of individuals and groups, andthe effects of specific health care interventions.Target 38 proposes a commitment to take ethicalconsiderations fully into account in health policyand practice. This can be done by establishing mech-anisms that facilitate open discussion and account-ability to the public. Target 32-Health research and developmentBy the year2000,health research should strengthen the acquisition and application ofknowledge in support of health for all development in all Member States. 1el Health for all development strategies 153 This target can be achieved if Member States:formulate specific health research strategies based on the guidelines for health forall research developed by the European Advisory Committee on Health Research;set priorities for the acquisition and application of knowledge in health promotion,disease prevention, environmental health, health care and health for all develop-ment;involve researchers, care providers, managers and community groups in the devel-opment of research strategies and priorities;strengthen communication and cooperation between the scientific communityand decision-makers in the application of new knowledge to health for all develop-ment. D roblem statementThe countries of the Re-gion are in a singularly advantageous positionfor producing sound and relevant khowkdge inthe health, life and social sciences that can be usedto support health for all in the Region and through-out the world. Research is supported by numerousorganizations, governmental and nongovern-mental, at national and international levels. A vastresearch potential is concentrated in universitiesand diverse public and private research institu-tions (2).The need for health research The rapid devel-opment of new knowledge in the life sciences hasdramatically affected our capacity to intervene inthe natural processes of life and increasingly raisesprofound ethical questions. It also tends to blur theboundaries between basic and applied research. Anumber of recent developments in the EuropeanRegion also highlight the gap between decision-making needs and available scientific knowledge.For example, the serious ecological problemsaffecting many countries and their people call forintensified multidisciplinary research to supportaction programmes.' The AIDS pandemic is acomplex problem requiring sustained research todevelop effective prevention and treatment. Thequestions raised about the long-term effects oflow-dose radiation in the aftermath of the Cherno-byl disaster indicate that gaps in scientific know-ledge may be costly in both economic and socialterms. Cardiovascular disorders, cancer, mentalillness and health-damaging behaviour are acontinuing burden on the countries of the Region.This is a reminder of the need for a better under-standing of the fundamental mechanisms of humanbiology and behaviour as a basis for prevention (3). The relationship between the rising costs of healthcare and equity, the further development of healthcare systems in the Region and, in particular, themajor restructuring of health services in the coun-tries in the central and eastern part of the Region,all emphasize that health research should have amuch stronger role. Research that focuses on prac-tical problems is particularly needed. It can drawon the insights and methods of different disci-plines, including epidemiology, information sci-ence and evaluation, management sciences, healtheconomics and organizational behaviour.162 154Health for aH targets Resistance to health research Despite the need,the impressive research potential in the Region hasnot so far been tapped to support major health goalsand programmes. The development and implemen-tation of policies on health for all research in coun-tries will probably continue to encounter obstaclesand constraints. Some of these can be removed orattenuated through better dialogue and cooperation.Others will require special efforts to change attitudesand behaviour and initiate institutional change.Few countries in the Region have adopted explicitpolicies to carry out health research aimed at agreedtargets and to make use of its problem-solvingcapacity. Many policy- and decision-makers do notsufficiently understand the role and potential ofhealth research, particularly in relation to health forall development. Its role in the achievement of theregional targets is not readily perceived. Even incountries with long-standing traditions of highquality scientific research, policy-makers often tendto concentrate on the costs rather than the benefitsof research. They also overlook the opportunitiesfor achieving more effective and less costly solu-tions to health problems through relevant research.One inevitable result is a low level of funding forhealth research.Resistance to evaluative research is a special prob-lem. Once launched, a health care programme isdifficult to change, because it usually involves aconsiderable investment of material and humanresources, professional prestige and high expec-tations. Research for health for all tries to find outwhy systems or programmes succeed or fail. Somepolicy- and decision-makers and programme man-agers may well see this as a potential threat.For their part, some scientists are reluctant to beinvolved in target-directed health research. Theymay also argue that any research policy infringesscientific and academic freedom. Researchers aretypically independent-minded and few are ready tobecome involved in activities directly related topolicy development. They fear that policy-makersand administrators will want instant results, whilethey are unwilling to commit themselves until theirhypotheses and theories have been adequatelytested.Problems in research coordination and manage-mentInsufficient communication and interactiontakes place between existing research organizationsand networks in the Region. One consequence ofthis is that certain types of study are seldom under-taken. These include longitudinal studies, studiesof small area variation, and collaborative studiesthat are important in developing strategic know-ledge. These are best carried out collaboratively bya number of often international research centresthat share common objectives, methodology andresearch instruments.The coordination of research within countries isalso inadequate. It is often supervised by ministriesresponsible for science or education, which are notalways aware of the value of health for all. Inaddition, the task of coordinating the work ofdifferent partnersuniversities, research councils,foundations, industry and independent researchinstitutionscan be delicate and complex. A cen-tral objective of the various partners in researchpolicy should be to achieve a proper balance be-tween medical and public health research. Somecountries have no central research policy bodies. Inothers, medical research councils tend to supportbasic and clinical, but not behavioural and publichealth research. The lack of adequate research fund-ing inhibits the creation of a career structure inpublic health research, which is essential if high 163 quality applicants are to be attraed into resemchtraining. In the viciou6 circle io created, researchcould not be carried out beca e of lack of trainedpersonnel, even if adequate ' in ding were to he-come available.Ineffective research managemert is a major hirdrance in the central and eastern part of the RegionThe new governments hav e.. inherited anovercentralized, hierarchical and bureaucratic sys-tem of research planning aml management. Thesecountries have no tradition of schools of publichealth that combine education with research orwith a service and consultancy function. Con-sequently, the link between a ivanced research andhigher education is poor. Although e research inthese countries has potential, its proouctivity andeffectiveness are low, and hitherto researchers havehad little motivation to be innovative. Many ofthese countries are trying to align their researchmanagement systems with the pattern of sciencemanagement and funding that prevails in the rest ofthe Region. But this will only partially help pro-mote and sustain research for health for all. Sugge.;'ted solutionsThe main concern in so-ciety today is change. Research policies need toanticipate change and predict its consequences.They must also create timely solutions to newproblems and adapt to new needs. Not all intellec-tually interesting research topics deserve support.Priority should be given to health for all researchthat is:scientifically sound, important and likely to besuccessfully performed;carried out on problems that have high human,social and economic cost, that are of epi-demiological significance (such as avoidableHealth for all development strategies 155 raortaliity, morbidity or disability) and that cancasily Toe solved by using the results of research;relevant to the achievement of regional or coun-try targets.In 1988, the thirty-eighth session of the RegionalCommittee endorsed two documents, on researchpolicies for health for all and on priority researchfor health for all (4,5). Together, these documentsc.ontinue to offer countries a framework in which todevelop or update their health for all researchpolicies and identify research priorities.Identifying research needs Issues for researchshould be identified in each of the clusters oftargets supporting the regional health for all strat-egy. The precise assessment of priorities shouldemerge from discussions within countries betweenthe research community and the health sector atvarious levels.This debate will confirm the need for research toachieve better health (targets 1 12) in such areas as:barriers to equity and the sources of inequity;the measurement of inequities; the evaluationof policies designed to reduce inequities;the measurement of health status and quality oflife; the identification of health needs; riskfactors for disease; the impact on health ofpolicies and activities in other sectors;the course and outcome of different illnessesand the effectiveness and efficiency of variousforms of intervention.Regarding lifestyles conducive to health (tar-gets 1317), research is required on:factors encouraging and discouraging differ-ent types of health behaviour; indicators of164 1 56Health for all targets health-related behaviour; the meaning of health-damaging behaviour for the individual and itspurpose for the individual and society;attitudes in the community towards health andhealth policies, and mechanisms for commu-nity involvement; social networks, formal andinformal community structures and the distri-bution of power;the evaluation of intervention programmes.Environmental health (targets 18 25) will requireresearch on:specific environmental agents and their effects;risk assessment and management; integratedmonitoring systems.Appropriate care (targets 26 31) will require re-search on:the organization and management of care atdifferent levels; the options determining apublic/private mix of resources and provisionof care; resource allocation models and thebalance of resources between primary and otherlevels of care;the evaluation of the education and training ofhealth care personnel, of health technology,and of health services performance; the qualityof care, the acceptability of health services topatients and the public, and the relations be-tween providers and patients;the mobilization of community participation,the role of lay care and self-help as such and inrelationship to professional care; the financialand emotional costs of illness to families andpatients.Health for all development strategies (targets 3237) will require research on:mechanisms for developing health policy;societal factors influencing the design and im-plementation of health policy, including moti-vation and incentive for policy change;the development of information systems in-cluding the definition of concepts and units ofmeasurement, and the methods and scope ofhealth reporting; the availability, reliability andinterpretation of data; the development of bet-ter indicators for evaluating progress towardshealth for all;organization and decision-making in health forall development, especially at the communitylevel, and their relation to intersectoral col-laboration.Target 38 on ethics and health will require researchon:ethical issues and trends in health policies andactions and their consequences for the treat-ment of individuals;the ethics of research involving human sub-jects. Promoting health for all research The pro-motion of health for all research requires manypartners. Ministries of health, education, researchand science, as well as universities, medical andother research councils, private foundations, inter-governmental organizations and nongovernmentalscientific societies all have a part to play. A healthfor all research policy will be successful only if theresearch community knows about it and accepts it.Several countries provide encouraging examplesof successful national meetings arranged to discussthe implications of health for all for the researchcommunity. Scientific societies can play an impor-tant role in making regional and country health for165 Health for all development strategies 1 57 all research policies known through their journals,conferences and meetings. Many international andnational journals have reviewed the documents onthe European health for all policy. The InternationalEpidemiological Association, the Association ofMedical Deans in Europe, the Association ofSchools of Public Health in the European Region,the European Healthcare Management Associationand Several national scientific societies of healthprofessionals have included sessions on researchfor health for all in their meetings (6 8).The research community needs incentives to carryout research in support of health for all. Somecountries may consider establishing research coun-cils and competitive grant application systems,while others may promote the idea of guided andtargeted research. Structures should be establishedto promote closer cooperation between researchersand the managers of health and social welfareservices. An essential requirement is that healthauthorities in each country publicly express theircommitment to health for all research. Resources and means to sustain health for allresearch New forms of cooperation are neededto promote the multidisciplinary work between thesciences that is essential to research for health forall. Scientific institutions should be organized in away that allows them to respond to society's basichealth needs and to support its policies. For in-stance, all disciplines relevant to health should berepresented in a country's medical research coun-cil, and universities should support people in dif-ferent disciplines who wish to work together.Universities are particularly important for the pro-motion and implementation of health for all re-search. They can:set up interdisciplinary research working groups;develop programmes to train personnel in newforms of research and in applying researchfindings in health care and health-related areas;andhelp individuals, other universities and relatedinstitutions, organizations and countries to ex-change information, experience, research plans,programmes and findings.Special research institutes, new professorships, peerreview of research papers and better research train-ing have often helped to promote new fields andattract talented young researchers. Training pro-grammes need to be expanded and improved inseveral disciplines related to public health, such as:community and social medicine; social sciencesrelated to health; epidemiology and statistics; sys-tems analysis, health economics and operationalresearch; and toxicology and environmental riskassessment. There is considerable scope for inter-national collaboration on training. Health servicesresearch and epidemiology training courses wouldbe particularly useful for the countries in the cen-tral and eastern part of the Region.The allocation of adequate resources is the bestincendve to research. Such an allocation shouldreflect the country's health research policies andhealth for all priorities. Training in research man-agement will increase the effectiveness with whichlarge, multidisciplinary projects are carried out.Communication and coordination Communi-cation between researchers, health policy-makersand professionals is vital if each group is to have abetter understanding of the others' needs. Oppor-tunities for each to see the others at work, as well asspecial events to bring the groups together, canhelp improve communication. It may be possible166 1 58Health for all targets to establish joint bodies to review the results ofcurrent research, to identify needs for new researchand to establish scientific advisory posts for high-level decision-makers.Finally, countries should consider how WHO,through its network of collaborating centres and itsjoint work with other international organizationsand associations, can stimulate and assist the de-velopment of research policies and coordinate in-ternational cooperative ventures. The EuropeanAdvisory Committee on Health Research is wellplaced to promote throughout the Region the ideasunderlying research for health for all. Target 33-Health for all policy development By the year 2000, all Member States should have developed, and be implementing, policiesin line with the concepts and principles of the European health for all policy, balancinglifestyle, environment and health service concerns.This target can be achieved if, after full consultation with the partners concerned:health for all policies are adopted and continuously adapted at country, regionaland local levels that are suited to the specific political and administrative structureof the country;specific targets aresetfor the achievement of health for all, reflecting the economic,social and cultural circumstances of the country concerned;those targets support greater equity in health, wider participation in decision-making, stronger emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, effectiveintersectoral action, and reorientation of health services towards pribiary care (seeChapter 1);policies and targets are accompanied by specific strategies for their implemen-tation, including legislation where appropriate;strong political commitment to such policies is affirmed at the highest level andreflected in legislation;Member States base their collaboration in international transactions, agreementsand supranational policy-making on the principles of health for all. 167 Health for all development strategies 159 problem statementAll Member States en-dorsed the principles of a common health policywhen the regional strategy for attaining health for allwas approved by the Regional Committee in 1980.Almost all countries have since begun to considerhow to apply these principles in their own situation.A number have adapted their health policies and,where necessary, their legislation in accordance withhealth for all principles. Now is the time to assessthis experience of health for all policy developmentand to identify desired future developments. Whenthe targets were proposed in 1984, a widely per-ceived impression, especially in pluralist countries,was that many targets required central governmentdirection and control. This impression has beenmodified to a considerable extent by the workinggroup of pluralist countries, in cooperation with theWHOsecretariat, which demonstrated that health forall policy development is not intrinsically centralist(9). Many countries are now undergoing politicalchange, involving either devolution or some signifi-cant degree of decentralization or regionalization.The health policy-making arena will be transformedin these countries. Policy-makers, whether reform-ing the health care system or contemplating otherpolicies and actions to improve the population'shealth, can profit from the experience to date of thepluralist countries. Country experience in health for all policy-makingOver half the countries in the Regionhave drawn up specific, countrywide policies andstrategies that relate to the subject areas covered inthe regional strategy. The policy documents thathave been prepared have had varying purposes andpolitical weight. Some make largely symbolic men-tion of health for all, while in others it is a constantreference point for policy development and re-source allocation. Others see health for all as aframework for the integration of different issue-specific policies and as guidance for more locallevels and for the private sector.Some countries adopted the regional targets whileothers defined their own quantified country-specific targets. Some preferred non-quantifiedpolicy statements better suited to their political andcultural environment. Other countries that have notyet developed an explicit, comprehensive healthfor all policy have, even so, included in theirperiodic national health status reports a section onprogress towards the regional targets.A number of countries, as part of their overall effortsto implement health for all, are developing issue-specific policies in line with its principles. Thesepolicies focus on, for example, relevant research,food and nutrition, or the environment and health. Insome countries, policies relating mainly or exclu-sively to health care have been developed, but notanalogous policies on lifestyles and the environ-ment. Conversely, in some places, policies havebeen developed for health promotion, although healthservices are not in line with health for all principles.Operationally, it has often been difficult for na-tional and subnational health for all policies tocover all the 38 targets at the same time (/ 0).Where attention at the country level has focused ona restricted number of issues, this has often beenbecause of limited capacity and not necessarily theresult of an explicit priority-setting and decision-making process. At the subnational level, eco-nomic constraints in practically all countries seemto have resulted in a more conscious effort to setexplicit priorities, and there have been good exam-ples of priorities set by defined criteria (//). Evenso, special attention needs to be given to improvingequity between subnational levels.168 160Health for all targets In summary, many countries have still to produce acomprehensive set of policies covering all facets ofthe regional strategy (lifestyles, the environmentand health care). In all cases, inequities in health,rapid developments in medical technology, andsignificant social and economic changes affect theburden of ill health and the need for care. They arecreating serious ethical and other problems withwhich health policy must contend. Policy process difficulties More often than not,small groups of interested people have initiated thehealth for all policy formulation process, but theycannot sustain their enthusiastic commitment in-definitely when this is not their main responsibil-ity. Further improvements in the process and mech-anisms for policy formulation, implementation,monitoring and evaluation are needed throughoutthe Region.Insufficient attention has been paid to the produc-tion, presentation and use of information for policy-making. Information must be presented in a formatand manner appropriate to each target audience(M. This is a crucial condition for wider partici-pation in decision-making at an early stage ofpolicy development, for the active involvement ofstakeholders, particularly those in other sectors,and for the management of possible conflicts ofinterest. Short-term, incremental steps taken inhealth care reforms and development are not al-ways checked for their consonance with long-termhealth goals. The responsibility for policy imple-mentation may not be clearly designated, nor thenecessary resources allocated. Anticipatini, policy problems The movement ofpeople, goods and services across national borders isbeing encouraged in the part of the Region coveredby the European Economic Area. The breakingdown of barriers will, however, create new chal-lenges for health policy. For example, the freemovement of people may encourage more \"medi-cal tourism\" (people travelling from one country toanother for treatment). The free circulation of healthprofessionals may add to the existing maldistri-bution of human resources in some countries. Thefree circulation of potentially health-damaginggoods and services may help sustain unhealthylifestyles.The political and economic changes occurringthroughout the Region mean that countries that hadformulated health for all policy documents mayneed to revise them. In the central and eastern part ofthe Region, this will entail wide-ranging legislativechanges, including changes in their constitutions, asthe health sector joins the general move to a neweconomic and political system. These legislativechanges will be of a scale that goes far beyond whatis usual at any one time in a country and will takemany years to complete, making heavy demands onlegal, policy and economic expertise. uggested solutionsThe regional health forall policy provides a comprehensive yet flex-ible framework, that can be adapted to suit differ-ent socioeconomic, political, cultural and adminis-trative settings. It should therefore prove particu-larly suited to the central and eastern part of theRegion where health policy changes form part of aradical review of all socioeconomic policy. Whenthey adopted the regional strategy, all the MemberStates undertook to report on their progress to theRegional Office, thus also facilitating the exchangeof experiences between countries (3,12 14). Thishas begun to create a strong base of knowledge on169 Health for all development strategies 161 how to apply health for all principles in differentpolicy-making contexts. This foundation can nowbe built on in the new climate of more free and openreporting, particularly from the central and easternpart of the Region, and of greater receptivenessthroughout the Region to fresh ideas. Elements of good practiceCountries' cumu-lative experience in health for all policy-makingoffers certain pointers to future good practice. Anessential step is the process of formulation andperiodic review of policies. These policies may becontained in one comprehensive policy statementor in a series. Policy statements emphasize politi-cal commitment to the health for all concept andprinciples, and provide the sense of strategic intentand the long-term framework within which oper-ational targets and oraer short-term measures canbe developed. They facilitate the overall coordin-ation and integration of issue-specific policies andstrategies, and focus attention on the intended out-comes of policy and action.The financial constraints expected in the decadeahead indicate a pressing need to set explicit priori-ties. Some difficult choices will have to be made,guided by the fundamental health for all values andprinciples. While policies may not cover all theregional targets at once, a schedule can be set tocover various packages of targets, building up to acomprehensive health for all policy to cover allfacets of the strategy.In a number of countries, the preparation of healthstatus reports has proved to be a valuable first step inpolicy formulation. Such information can sensitizeall partners to health issues in a wide societal con-text, to the importance of the prerequisites for health,and to the existence of continuing inequities inhealth status and in access to health services. Insome countries, such reports have been regularlyproduced and presented to parliament, which hasbeen extremely effective in sensitizing the legis-lators to health policy. Public health research andaction plans on specific issues, including healthservice reforms, can also be important entry pointsinto the process of developing a comprehensivepolicy based on health for all.Setting targets is one of the instruments for policyformulation and public health development. Tar-gets should define the outcome to be achieved, besimple an- easily understood, explain policy direc-tion and emphasis, guide work and foster targetsetting at other levels in the country, and be basedon scientific evidence rather than political expedi-ency. Target setting is one of the ways to involveand influence partners, be they ministries at thenational level or schools at the local level, and tocreate a common focus of interest and action (seealso target 37). It is an instrument that can be usedin a flexible and adaptable manner, is politicallysuited to the pluralistic societies of the Region, andenhances independent action and innovation amongthe many groups that work on projects.Target setting and the development of indicatorsfor monitoring should ensure that the initial policyformulation stage focuses on evaluation. The cycli-cal nature of policy development suggests thatmonitoring and evaluation can be assigned to aparticular person or group. Where this responsibil-ity has been given to a specific unit within a healthadministration, an active and vital focal point forhealth for all has been created. But steps must alsobe taken at political and managerial levels to ensurethat it is the focal point and not the only point ofactivity. Policy development must be a sharedrespons:bility among many interested partners.170 162Health for all targets Given the intersectoral character of much healthpolicy, the ministry or other authority responsiblefor health must take the initiative in encouragingand supporting policy development in other sectorsthat is in line with health for all principles (15). Lessons from practical experience Wide par-ticipation through a broad consultation process,with transparent mechanisms for feedback, cancounter resistance and break down sectoral bar-riers. This involves conscious outreach to opinion-formers and decision-makers in other sectors, andpatient negotiation with key ministries (particu-larly finance) to identify trade-offs between healthand other objectives and to clarify the criteria fordetermining priorities. Reported examples of ef-fective solutions include the following. 1.The head of government chairs a health policyformulation committee, thus ensuring it has statusand political significance and reflects the inter-sectoral nature of the process. 2.Consultations are instituted without specifyingthe intended outcomes beforehand. They bring to-gether participants from various interests and focuson alternative futures and scenarios rather thanprepared draft policies and strategies. They con-sider the mutual interests of health and other sec-tors and the links between health, social, economicand other policies. 3.Regional meetings are organized throughoutthe country to consider the opinions expressed bydifferent interests and to reach conclusions that canbuild up into a national policy. 4.In some countries with pluralistic systems,consensus meetings are convened of all the mainpartners in policy implementation (professionalassociations, nongovernmental organizations, in-surance organizations and health service bodies). 5.Policy statements at the national and subnationallevels are used as a rallying point to mobilizenongovernmental organizations, professional associ-ations, the academic and research communities, andindividuals in key positions as opinion-formers, allof whom can influence decision-making. 6.Local citizens' study groups are establishedand properly briefed, ensuring that their involve-ment begins with problem definition and followsthrough into implementation of solutions. 7.Health for all policy documents are summar-ized to facilitate their discussion by the legislature.Popular versions are distributed to the generalpublic at the same time. This achieves broad publicparticipation in the policy debate and strong pol-itical affirmation of health for all policies atthe highest level, which can be enacted in legis-lation. Importance of local policy-making In a numberof countries, health for all policies developed at theregional and also municipal level (often in thecontext of a local Healthy Cities project) providethe most effective mechanisms for intersectoralaction and wide participation in decision-making.These policies offer a powerful means of achievingboth countrywide health objectives and those gearedto specific regional conditions. The approachesadopted have frequently been innovative (I I).Through the exchange of experience with othersand with support from the central or federal level,they have the potential for a significant synergisticeffect. When decentralizing policy development, 171 Health for all development strategies 163 mechanisms must also be established to deal withissues of equity. The very focus on local policy andaction will inevitably bring into sharp relief exist-ing inequities in health and the plight of disadvan-taged groups. Policy implementationAs the experience in theRegion shows, the setting of specific (and, whenappropriate, quantitative) targets facilitates debate,the rallying of partners and the initiation of action. Italso shows that at all levels, a clear strategy for theimplementation of policy is necessary. Possible prob-lems and conflicts of interest should be consideredin the formulation phase, and responsibility andaccountability designated clearly (16). This can beachieved by direct discussion with the potentialpartners in implementation, through consensus meet-ings or other means.When the magnitude of the change to a policy basedon health for all is great, it requires time, patienceand perseverance. Such a policy requires an approachthat focuses in the first instance on outcomes andhealth, rather than on the provision of health ser-vices. This usually entails changes in attitudes andbehaviour not only in the health care system, but inother sectors and in community groups and individuals.These changes are not always easily achieved, andwhen achieved not easily sustained. Decisions areconstantly made both nationally and internationally,inside and outside the health sector that affect thehealth of the population. Continuous effort is essen-tial to ensure that they respect health for all values. Target 34-Managing health for all development By the year 2000, management structures and processes should exist in all Member Statesto inspire, guide and coordinate health development, in line with health for all principles. This target can be achieved in all Member States if:responsive institutions are establis'-ed with strong public mandates to act as publichealth advocates and to guide and coordinate health development at country',regional and local levels;problem and priority definition is based on assessment of population health status,the prevalence of social and environmental risks, and the evaluation of healthsystem performance;processes are put in train to strengthen intersectoral commitment to greaterinvestment in health and the attainment of priority targets; 172 164Health for all targets a long-term perspective is adepted in target setting, strategic planning and evalu-ation, together with a readiness to respond to changing circumstances;health 3ystem performance is evaluated in terms of achievement of improved healthstatus, quality of life, public sa tisfaction, cost-effectiveness and health for all targets.Droblem statement A managerial infrastruc-ture is required that will guide and supporthealth development, implement health for all poli-cies and sustain progress towards that goal. Man-agement in many countries concentrates on healthcare, i.e. medical services, rather than on the over-all health system or the set of actions needed toprevent and control disease, to promote health, toprovide care and to support health development,regardless of where that action occurs in society.More attention should be given to managing thehealth system, identifying what health develop-ment steps are required and charting the most cost-effective path towards health for all.Major health sector reforms are often aimed moreat improving the management of hospitals than atthe more complex tasks of improving the popu-lation's health. In several countries, the functionsand status of public health departments and offi-cials have declined, compared with those of theircolleagues in clinical medicine who have easyaccess to decision-makers. Yet those working inmedicine attribute less importance to populationhealth than to the health of individual patients.Until health for all policy becomes a central focusof management systems and priorities, the old,partial and segmented approaches will continue. Creating a responsive management Manycountries had begun to promote participation inconsensus development, planning and budgetingaccording to needs, and continuous adaptation tonew circumstances by means of monitoring andreprogramming. Yet this process sometimes be-came stifled by creeping centralization, bureauc-racy and rigidity. Countries are launching newinitiatives throughout the Region to make publicsector management systems more responsive toconsumers and users of services (/ 7). They areinvestigating the role of the voluntary and privatesectors with the aim of strengthening them. Interesthas been renewed in decentralization, incentives,market-like mechanisms and relationships that freelocal management to experiment with new ap-proaches. Such an approach requires simultaneouspolitical and managerial effort to maintain thefunctioning of a public health infrastructure (18).Segmented managerial infrastructures and the lackof a system, or even an organizational focal point,with a comprehensive health for all perspective havemade action outside the health services such asadvocacy directed at and partnership with industrythe exception rather than the rule. They have alsocreated a culture of reactive management. The em-phasis has been on the operational short term ratherthan the strategic long term, and on the resources andactivities of institutions rather than the outcomes ofactions. Problem- and cost-containment have beenstressed instead of the cost-effectiveness of a wholeset of initiatives in health protection and promotion,disease prevention, and environmental health im-provement. Health action is rarely designed andimplemented within an overall health for all frame-work. 17 3 Health for all development strategies 165 Suggested solutionsIt must be stressed at theoutset that management, in the sense of coordi-nation of health development, is not the same asoperational control. Many private, voluntary andpublic bodies are engaged in health-related oper-ations in different sectors and environments. Justas WHO has the constitutional mandate to coordi-nate and direct international health work so, withincountries, a managerial structure and process arerequired to inspire and coordinate comprehensivehealth efforts. Coordination, leadership and incentives Vari-ous institutions and actors with leadership rolesand public mandates have the task of inspiring andguiding health development in the implementationof health for all policies in countries. The backboneof a managerial structure at the national level is aministry with responsibility for health. At the sub-national level, the backbone is regional and/orlocal government departments of health or otherpublic agencies. Examples also exist of inter-departmental bodies of various kinds, with import-ant management or advisory functions, that operateat different levels and link different sectors of theeconomy. The Healthy Cities project, for instance,demonstrates the value of a local forum for thedebate of health issues and for the integration ofaction by public health and other interests. Localpublic health offices with health protection andother community health functions can be valuablefocal points for action.Agencies and public officials with health mandatesneed persistently to advocate health for all values,principles and policies. Health will only attract andsustain political attention as a political issue whenthese values have been readily accepted by theleaders of the public, private and voluntary sectors.Advocacycan also be delegated and institutional-ized. It is not necessarily a public sector task.Indeed, advocacy has sometimes been convertedinto commercially successful advisory services tobusiness.While no single model for management and ac-countability can be used everywhere, extreme mod-els of \"central command\" and \"pure market\" areequally unsuitable for health development. Thecentral command model has been a failure in thecentral and eastern part of the Region and is un-likely to be replicated. Nowhere in the Region, onthe other hand, does one find a pure market modeluntempered by any public intervention. Such anabrogation of all government responsibility to-wards the population would generate unacceptablesocial tensions and inequities (19). Countries haveto strive for a balance in health policy betweenguidance and autonomy, according to their legal,administrative, political and economic circumstances.Policy implementation has to be supported by regu-latory, financial and other incentives, and at thesame time has to allow autonomous action at variouslevels. If health for all advocacy has been effective,local action will be consonant with national healthpolicy. Managing for coherence and sustained actionA managerial infrastructure must be able to bringtogether and coordinate all functions, including theprevention and control of disease, health promo-tion, environmental health action, health care andhealth development support. The managerial aimin health for all is not a disaggregated, serial attackon targets one by one, but a cohesive programme ofaction in which identified problems and prioritiesattract rational responses. Each action programmeshould stimulate interest and sustain motivation174 166Health for all targets among public, private and voluntary sectors asappropriate, whether at the local, national or inter-national levels.Sound management practice, aligned to health forall principles, calls for problems, priorities andprogrammes to be defined on the basis of careful,well founded assessments of the current and antici-pated health situation of the population. Theseassessments should cover health status, the preva-lence of social and environmental health risk, andthe efficiency, cost-effectiveness and equity of pro-grammes at all levels of the health system, not justthe health services. The implementation of theresulting action programmes must be suited to thelocal realities of political will, economic circum-stances and the level of social development. Thisrequires both a constant challenge to traditionalhealth development approaches and the identifi-cation, testing and dissemination of effective inno-vations. Investment in health pays Generating inter-sectoral commitment to investing in health de-pends on structures and mechanisms that facilitatecontinuing dialogue and collaboration betweenhealth and other sectors, especially business andtrade. The dialogue should focus on the ordinarysettings of life (such as the workplace, the homeand shopping areas) and emphasize the potentialfor collaboration on priority targets. The mostpowerful argument for action for and investment inhealth by other sectors is that of mutual benefit:health pays. Collaboration and investment in healthare in the interest of all parties. For example, whenthe work environment becomes healthier, staff aremore satisfied, labour turnover and absenteeismdecrease, production uses technology less harmfulto the environment, and a product or service may be175described as healthy or health-enhancing. A firmthat demonstrates its sense of social responsibilitymay improve its standing in the community with-out losing its market share. Partners not monolithsThe emphasis on gen-erating intersectoral commitment fits well with thecurrent trend towards decentralization, pluralismand accountability. It would be inappropriate andcounterproductive to set up a monolithic infra-structure to support health for all. The managerialtasks involved require a range of knowledge, skillsand information support and must respect the cul-ture and values of all the people involved. It is goodpractice not to put all management functions intothe same hands. Citizens' groups and the voluntarysector can develop and test many approaches be-fore they become part of public practice. Businesscouncils, trade unions, associations of health careproviders and health insurance funds can be givenauthority to take up and deal with health issues intheir own sectors. The aim in such cases is topromote a process of local action by the interestedpartners, following the principle of subsidiarity(according to which government steps in only if theprocess fails). Some countries have well developedsystems for self-governance in the health services,involving physicians, insurers and health care in-stitutions. Examples of self-governance outsidethe health services include different forms of riskcommunity. These require businesses and organ-izations that create pollution and other health risksto assume joint liability for them. When theirfinancial contribution is related to risk, they havean incentive to minimize that risk and use moreappropriate technology.The health for all concept and principles can rarelybe integrated into economic and social development Health for all developmentstrategies167 policies unless mutual interests are identified andrespected. Nevertheless, some sectors are, on theirown initiative, developing policies and strategiesthat benefit health. By publicly recognizing andcommending these initiatives, the health sector canstimulate further action based on health for allprinciples. The health sector should also be willingto motivate other sectors to lead. It can achieve thisby becoming more active in assisting other sectorsand by recognizing explicitly the contribution tohealth of various public, private and voluntarybodies throughout society. The need for a long-term perspective Muchaction for health takes time to complete, especiallyprojects such as safer roads, sewage disposal andother components of the physical infrastructure forpublic health. The long-term perspective also in-cludes the periodic evaluation of projects in termsof better health, quality of life, services to vulner-able groups and better coverage and access. Simi-larly, creating conditions supportive of action forhealth, such as by building new social institutions,by seeking to move the values of various sectorscloser to health for all, and by developing suitableprofessional training for managers, all takes time.In managing action programmes, projected long-term outcomes and strategic thinking need to bereconciled with short-term objectives and day-to-day problem solving. Any initiative to reform healthservice structure or financing should, in particular,not proceed without regard for its impact on thepopulation's health and its contribution to overalllong-term health for all policies and aims. A cadre of effective managers for healthdevelopmentThe long-term view requires pro-ficient managers. They need not only to be strongin traditional functions such as personnel develop-ment, financial accounting and the timely dis-charge of business, but also to have a clear under-standing of their role in health development. Suchexecutives need to acquire health-specific manage-ment skills such as assessments of health status andquality of life, quality development and the assess-ment of health systems performance. They shouldbe familiar with the economic evaluation of policyoptions, strategic resource allocation, and efficiencyand effectiveness measures in the health sector.Their success in progressing towards the attain-ment of the health for all targets will continue to beevaluated by these criteria. Target 35-Health information support By the year 2000, health informaUon systems in all Member States should actively supportthe formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of health for all policies. 1 7 168Health for all targets This target can be achieved if there are information strategies in Member States that:use appropriate indicators to measure progress towards targets for health policyoutcome and programme performance;provide for intelligence systems to forecast future problems and needs;provide for minimum data sets based on internationally agreed standards, includingdata for measuring achievement of regional health for all targets;facilitate information exchange with other sectors and provide politicians, man-agers, interested groups and the public with relevant information;are based on appropriate use of information technology. D roblem statementSince the adoption of thehealth for all strategy, the countries of theRegion have become more aware of the need foradequate information for policy formulation,implementation and monitoring. The adoption ofthe regional targets and indicators resulted in theestablishment of a regular monitoring and evalu-ation process. The experience of three such exer-cises has helped countries to see their informationneeds more clearly(3,1214).Significant technological progress has occurred inpublishing, personal computers and telecommuni-cations. For example, laser disc databases, elec-tronic publishing and artificial intelligence facili-tate the storage, processing and transfer of infor-mation. Some progress has also been made in thestandardization of data processing and communi-cation procedures to overcome technologicalincompatibilities between different equipment andsoftware. Lack of progress in developing health infor-mation systemsDespite the progress made intechnology, and the efforts of some countries todevelop national health information policies, in-formation suppoa in a number of countries is stillfar from satisfactory: it is not geared towards sup-porting health policy and action. In these countries,the collection, analysis and publication of datareflect the priorities of the past, rather than presentand future needs. Many health information systemsrequire further development, particularly in thecentral and eastern and some of the southern part ofthe Region.Nearly all health systems suffer from informationoverload, in that few of the data collected andgenerated can be processed, transformed into infor-mation and used. There is an avalanche of data butmuch of it is of limited use for health development.Information overload is an unnecessary burden ontime and resources. Information for a purpose Too little emphasisis placed on the transformation of data into infor-mation, knowledge and intelligence, and on effec-tive presentation and feedback to the users who aresupposed to take action. Policy- and decision-makers may be said to be \"drowning in data\" and, 177 Health for all development strategies 169 at the same time, to be starved of relevant infor-mation (20). There are a number of explanations.Different components of health information sys-tems, such as registers, surveys, health servicesinformation and scientific information, have de-veloped separately. They are uncoordinated andincompatible. The needs of small areas and locallevel management are often considered secondaryto central level reporting requirements.Information in the health services is often gearedonly to the allocation of resources and the controlof spending, not to the need to evaluate servicesand patient outcomes. Population-based data onmorbidity, disability, the use of services, lifestylesand positive healthhave not received the atten-tion their importance warrants. All these factorspoint to the need for research and development in anumber of areas, such as information on healthstatus and the quality of life. Better indicatorsshould be developed for wellbeing and perceivedhealth status, morbidity, disability, the control anduse of various resources, and the quality and acces-sibility of services.Networks for the exchange and dissemination ofhealth documentation, which are important for ef-fective information support, do not always function.Some countries, particularly those in the central andeastern part of the Region, still lack reliable, rel-evant, up-to-date information for policy and otherpurposes. They must now build up the necessarycapacity both to generate and to use information. Suggested solutionsThe shift towards a moreintegrated Europe will create greater oppor-tunities for cooperation and information exchange,both within the European Community and in theRegion as a whole.Cooperating for information support Through-out th3 regional strategy and each of its 38 targets,information is identified as a key resource forsuccess. The fortieth session of the RegionalCommittee for Europe in 1990, in resolution EuR/EtC40/R6, adopted a European health for all infor-mation strategy (21 ) calling for integrated in-formation support in Member States and the Re-gional Office. Such a strategy should clearly statehow the information will be used for each of themajor components of health for all. It should mobi-lize the resources to be devoted to informationsupport, specify tile structure and management ofthe information sytem and determine the mech-anisms for data collection, analysis, quality, com-munication, access, retrieval and reporting. It shouldalso determine the most appropriate forms ofcommunication and presentation and include anevaluation of the quality, cost-effectiveness andimpact of health decisions and actions.An advisory body, with representatives from allconcerned parties, can establish effective liaisonbetween authorities and facilitate the formulationand implementation of the strategy. The strategyshould cover the collection, processing and deliv-ery of relevant information to ail potential partnersin health development. Wherever feasible, quanti-fiable targets for health action and indicators tomeasure progress should be adopted. They give thereference framework for priority-setting and anynecessary reorientation of the health system. Theymay also enable comparisons to be made betweenpopulations, geographical areas and agencies re-garding levels of health and the performance of thehealth system. The scope of information required Informationshould also be available on the social and physical178 1 70Health for all targets environment relevant to health. A multisource healthintelligence system encompassing both hard andsoft types of information should be developed foruse in forecasting or anticipating future conditions,problems and needs. Population survey informationis essential to monitor health attitudes and behav-iour and to measure the level of satisfaction withservices. This information can be incorporated intohealth reports at all levels. More emphasis couldalso be given to population-based registers forchronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovasculardiseases and mental disorders, which must safe-guard the anonymity of individual patients.The formulation of programmes and the evaluationof performance require hazards and risks (particu-larly in the living and working environments) to belinked to health. Costs and activities have to berelated to outcome, in terms of improvements inprotection achieved and in the health, attitudes andbehaviour of the population. Data must often belinked to become meaningful information. For ex-ample, the quality and appropriateness of care inthe health services can only be assessed by focus-ing on a total episode. Looking at the individualactivities or technical components is insufficient.Sometimes, existing data could be better used inmeta-analysis: by judiciously aggregating and re-analysing to generate further insights. But, equallyimportant, whatever the preceding analysis, infor-mation in support of decision-making has to bepresented effectively to the intended audience. Building the information system Perhaps themost important element of an information service isthe appropriate communication and use of the infor-mation. Communication must be improved betweenoriginators, user groups and other interested parties(22). A permanent focal point or unit can usefully beestablished to act as a r eference centre for potentialusers and providers of information. Informationshould be timely, purposeful and easily accessible.Building and using networks of institutions, agenciesand lay informants optimizes the use of existingdatabases and documentation. At the same time,confidentiality must be protected and due attentionpaid to copyright and data ownership. A bottom-upapproach is preferable. This involves local users indesigning the system and in determining what dataare to be collected and processed for decision-makingand other purposes. If the people collecting thesource data do not believe it is useful, they will haveno real commitment to reliable, accurate and timelyreporting.When information systems are reviewed, adjustedor built, minimum data sets need to be defined foreach area of health action. Countries and inter-governmental organizations need to cooperateamong themselves to standardize definitions andcoordinate data handling. It would also be valuableif they organized international consultations todevelop common methods and to conduct healthinterview surveys, such as those already carried outby wrio in cooperation with the Netherlands Cen-tral Bureau of Statistics (23). The monitoring andevaluation of progress towards health for all in theRegion will continue to contribute significantly tothis process of alignment, as will the informationand telematics research activities of the EuropeanCommunity. The role of the RegionalofficeNational andlocal agencies and institutions with health re-sponsibilities may wish to consider how they canbenefit from the activities and products of the Re-gional Office and its mandate as a European healthinformation centre. A number of databases are being 179 Health for all development strategies 171 further cloped and strengthened. Informationpackages are compiled and prepared on, for exam-ple, health promotion programmes, diabetes manage-ment and food safety. In future this work will alsoinclude knowledge development and forecasting.The network of specialized information centres inselected programme areas should be expanded andmore effectively used, and the exchange and dis-semination of health information in the Regionshould be improved through national documen-tation centres. Electronic networking, as demon-strated by the Regional Office's WHONET, iSapromising approach to increasing services, includ-ing database access, electronic mail, and bulletinboard services. Target 36-Developing human resources for health By the year 2000, education and training of health and other personnel in all Member Statesshould actively contribute to the achievement of health for all.This target can be achieved if, in the Member States:basic and continuing education programmes for health personnel emphasize theprinciples and strategies of health for all and their application in practice;the objectives and values of health for all are communicated to other sectorsrelevant to health, for incorporation in their education programmes and theirpractice;basic and continuing education programmes place special emphasis on leadershipdevelopment, encouraging participants to become health for all advocates. roblem statementIn many countries of theRegion, human resource development doesnot fully reflect the needs of the community. Thereare surpluses and shortages of people of differentprofessions and disciplines in different geographi-cal areas. Need rarely determines the number of personnelentering the training and health care delivery sys-tems. In some cases, the number of doctors isincreasing at such a pace that measures have alreadybeen taken to reduce future output from medicalschools. Most countries in the Region now haveover 200 doctors and 400 nurses per 100 000 in-habitants, but the ratio of doctors to nurses differsbetween countries. Even so, there can be grossgeographical maldistribution. Doctors tend to con-gregate in economically prosperous areas in citiesand the numbers training for specialist and primarycare practice is unbalanced (24). 1 72Health for all targets Countries also ditfer widely in the availability ofnurses, midwives, pharmacists and other health pro-fessionals. The number of nurses, for example, rangesfrom around 200 up to nearly 900 per 100 000 popu-lation. Some countries are seeing a faster increase inauxiliaries than in qualified nurses. It is increasinglydifficult to recruit and retain nursing and other staffin caring roles, for various reasons: demographictrends, better financial and other rewards in otherjobs, work-related stress and, not least, the ill-defined roles and functions in nursing. Some stud-ies on the use of qualified nurses have suggested thatno more than one fifth of their activity can beclassified as nursing (3). Present practice in education and training Alargely unchallenged belief exists that health careworkers who are trained to some maximum level ofscientific knowledge and technical skill will give auniformly high quality service to the population.Generally speaking and until quite recently, littlethought has been given to introducing a health forall perspective into the training of health workersor of their teachers (25). Little interest has beenshown in training them in aspects of public healtheither, or in emphasizing health professionals'leadership and management roles. Hospital-basedmedical education has dominated thinking on hu-man resource development, reflecting the domi-nance of the medical specialist's perception ofhealth problems and their technical management.Traditional institutions have given their students aknowledge base predominantly drawn from thebiological and medical sciences, often with in-adequate attention to the social and behaviouralsciences and their relevance to health.Both present teaching methods and the content oftraining can pose problems. Inadequacies can bequite fundamental, such as when training pro-grammes fail to introduce students to the realitiesof people's needs and interests, and fail to integratenew knowledge and approaches from fields otherthan the biomedical.Cooperation between the health care system andthe institutions that train health professionals hasoften been inadequate. Fundamental expectationsand attitudes among educators and practitionersalike have not been suited to the challenge ofreorientation towards health for all values andobjectives contained in Regional Committee resol-ution EuR/Rc37/R7 on health personnel develop-ment. Health for all requires long-term develop-ment for the benefit of the --ihole population. Itinvolves large numbers of public and private or-ganizations, and covers a wide range of issues.Most health workers have, by training and tem-perament, narrower and more immediate goals inthe care and cure of individuals.The overall result of existing training policies andmethods has been an overemphasis on producingspecialists with very specific skills and corn-petences, rather than generalists with broad visionwho are adaptable and capable of integrating theirown work with that of others, both within andoutside the health sector. Lack of contact with other sectors Little isknown in the health sector about the current statusof education on health and health-related matters inthe curricula of other professionals. Given the pre-vailing lack of contact between educators of healthprofessionals and other faculties in higher edu-cation, however, the curriculum content and learn-ing materials are unlikely to inform these pro-fessionals about the impact of their work on health, 8 1 Health for all development strategies 173 or about the health for all strategy. Much closercooperation is needed between the bodies responsi-ble for policy-making and education in the healthsector and their counterparts in other sectors. Sincemost training courses are already heavily burdenedand there is little chance of lengthening courses,innovative ways will need to be developed to in-volve the trainees of other professions in the dis-cussion of health for all principles and policies. Suggested solutionsEvery country needs aclear strategy for human resource development.It should take account of the country's particularsocioeconomic conditions, but also reflect healthfor all values and goals (26,27). To be effective, itwill need to be developed in a coordinated way thatis respected by all interests, that gives them aforum in which to negotiate and agree on the meansof implementation, and that avoids associated prob-lems such as oversupply, overspecialization andthe inefficient use of personnel. The type of ma-chinery adopted will depend on country circum-stances, such as the distribution of responsibilitywithin the health care system.The core of such a strategy would be to ensurecoordinated programmes for the training of healthcare personnel, based on scenarios or other rea-soned projections of both health needs and labourmarket conditions. The labour marketPlanning and projecting hu-man resource needs and availability is becomingboth more difficult and more important. Predic-tions have to take into account the free movementof labour, particularly between countries in theEuropean Economic Area, the international mutualrecognition of professional qualifications, and thepossibility of substituting different categories ofprofessional worker. It will be crucial to identifywhich groups of workers are ready to travel, fromwhere and to where. The situation may be furthercomplicated by countries with labour shortagesoffering attractive training and other opportunitiesto workers in countries with labour surpluses. Suchdevelopments should be pursued in a spirit ofequity and international cooperation, avoiding therisk of one country feeling that its labour is beingpoached by another more advantaged country. A training philosophyTraining, particularly thebasic training of groups such as family doctors andcommunity nurses, must be based on an under-standing of and respect for the role and abilities ofother health workers and their mutual dependencein teamwork. They should also learn to deal withthe known and anticipated health problems of thepopulation. If they are to contribute to health for allgoals they must not only acquire professional andtechnical excellence but also:understand and accept health for all values andobjectives as a framework for practical actionthat can be of continuing help in their dailywork;acquire a foundation of integrated multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills that go be-yond the biological sciences to encompass be-havioural, anthropological, social, economicand other fields as these relate to disease pre-vention, appropriate care and health protectionand promotion (for example, the study of drugabuse integrates aspects of internal and foren-sic medicine, pharmacology, psychology, soci-ology and criminology);acquire leadership and teamwork skills thatenable them to advise and collaborate with182 1 74Health for all targets various authorities, community organizationsand others in the development of health poli-cies and campaigns;acquire communication and other skills fordirect action with individuals or in the commu-nity in pursuit of health for all objectives; anddevelop the means of evaluating their ownpractice in terms of meeting the health needs ofthe community(28).Because education should be lifelong, continuingeducation underpinned by a mix of incentives andmandatory requirements must be a main thrust of ahuman resource strategy. Continuing education forfamily doctors and others should encompass healthfor all principles. It should also focus on changinghealth needs and policies and the appropriate appli-cation of new knowledge and technology. Most ofthe health professionals who will be working in theyear 2000 are studying now or have already com-pleted their studies. Given the scale of effort re-quired, much continuing education must be basedon self-learning, supplemented by some face-to-face contact with trainers. A code of practiceIn many countries professionaltraining, especially continuing education for medi-cal practitioners and other health professionals, hasenjoyed financial and other support from commer-cial enterprises that sell their products and servicesto the health sector. The relationships so establishedand the help given have normally been marked byethical conduct on all sides. They are neverthelessinherently delicate relationships, with a clear risk ofconflict of interest. Countries should consithr pro-moting a code of practice for support to educationaland other forms of information disseminated tohealth professionals. The objective of a code ofpractice, while recognizing the valuable supportgiven, would be to ensure that trainers and trainingschemes remain independent of all forms of undueor improper external influence. Ways and means in learning Learning how tolearn is important. Learning is always most effec-tive and acceptable if it is active rather than pass-ive, if it is perceived by the student to be relevant,and if it includes feedback on performance. Learn-ing strategies that place the student in a practicesetting and concentrate on problem identificationand management satisfy these criteria. This pointsto the need for greater use of community settings intraining and a shared commitment by the healthcare and other social service agencies, the pro-fessions and the training institutions. The evalu-ation of training programmes will need to focus onoutcomes such as acquired skills and competences.This thereby ensures the trainees' learning matchesthe health needs of the community (29).If groups of students who are training for differentprofessions share some learning activities, theyhave the opportunity to understand and appreciateeach other's skills and improve their teamwork.For example, if the area of concern is care of theelderly, it makes sense that general practitioners,geriatricians, nurses, physiotherapists, psychol-ogists and social workers all learn together (30). An international movement for change In re-cent years, important initiatives have supportedprofessional training based on health for all valuesand objectives. The favourable momentum needsto be sustained.The Edinburgh Declaration of the World Confer-ence on Medical Education, in 1988, pledged a 8 3 Health for all development strategies 175 \"programme to alter the character of medical edu-cation so that it truly meets the defined needs of thesociety\"(31).The Region's ministers of health andof education issued the Lisbon initiative the sameyear, proposing that a country's medical educationpolicy should reflect the regional health for all strat-egy; that educational programmes in individual uni-versities and medical schools should reflect coun-tries' health for all policies; that continuing edu-cation should become an essential feature of medicaleducation; and that all phases of medical educationshould take place in appropriate settings that reflectall aspects of health and the health services (32).The Vienna Declaration on Nursing in Support ofthe European Targets for Health for All, made at theEuropean Conference on Nursing in 1988, statedthat: Nursing can best fulfil its potential in primary healthcare when nursing education provides a sound foun-dation for nursing practice, especially work in thecommunity, and when nurses take account of thesocial aspects of health needs and have a broaderunderstanding of health development (33).In partnership with WHO, the Association of Schoolsof Public Health in the European Region is produc-ing curricula and learning materials for use inpublic health training based on health for all. Theaim is to develop postgraduate vocational studiesin a multidisciplinary field which encompass dis-ease prevention, health protection and promotionprogrammes for populations, and the organizationof cost-effective health services of high quality,with a particular stress on leadership, policy-makingand management skills.Making partners through training Health forall also presents a challenge to professionals inother sectors. As partners in intersectoral collab-oration, they must take full account of the impact oftheir activities on health and seek to attain theirown goals in ways that will also protect and pro-mote health. In view of the relative lack of effectivelinks with workers in other sectors in the past,stress should be laid on developing the strategy tomake fruitful contacts. While the definition ofsectors varies between countries, a useful first stepis to draw up an inventory of present and potentialpartners for health for all. The analysis shouldinclude the determination of which sectors wouldbe likely to have the most impact on health, wherekey partners are easiest to identify, and where anapproach is likely to be sympathetically received.One way to generate interest in health for all valuesand objectives, and to secure their place in edu-cation and training programmes in other sectors, isto give visibility to an issue widely felt to be amatter of urgency. Training modules can then bedeveloped that prompt these professionals to seethe relevance of health for all approaches, particu-larly intersectoral partnerships and joint decision-making, and that stimulate them to acquire appro-p.iate skills. The following are some examples ofwhat this may imply for different professions andsectors.Police officers and other law enforcement person-nel should have an understanding of thepsychosocial factors underlying social problemssuch as drug abuse. This will help them cooperatesympathetically with self-help groups, the commu-nity, and the health and social sectors.When designing homes or planning neighbour-hoods, architects should take account not only oftheir effect on general wellbeing, but also of theneed to improve accident prevention, social contact 184 1 76Health for all targets and other health-promoting activities. Accidentprevention can often be enhanced through rela-tively simple measures such as better lighting orthe use of non-slip surfaces. The provision oframps and handholds could also encourage elderlypeople to maintain their contacts and participate insoc ial life.Teacher training should include pedagogic tech-niques that help children develop the ability tomake sound decisions and choose healthy life-styles. Teachers themselves should understand thecrucial influence of their own behaviour and of theschool environment on their pupils.The training of economists should give more em-phasis to the cost to society of ill hea!th, disabilityand premature death, and should include the appli-cation of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analy-sis to health matters.Designers and civ il engineers should be aware ofthe safety aspects of consumer goods and roaddesign. Bioengineers should learn about the physi-cal and psychological impact of technical devicesused in health care. All of them should be aware ofthe less obvious effects of technology on lifestylesand health. The potential of the media's role With theremoval of communication barriers in the Region,the role of the press, radio and television hasacquired great importance. This is a field wheremedia professionals in western Europe need toshare their best practice and standards with theircolleagues in the central and eastern part of theRegion. Training events or briefings could usefullybe organized to inform people in the media aboutthe values and objectives of health for all. Theycould assess for themselves its rich potential innews, public information and education. Journal-ists and others, once aware of the principles andgoals of health for all, can ensure that the massmedia play an active role in giving effect to healthfor all strategies. Actors and other public entertain-ers who also have great influence on the generalpublic should equally be approached and briefedwhen opportunities arise. Many may well then feelmotivated to set a positive example by their ownhealth behaviour and to refuse publicity, sponsor-ship offers and other assignments that promote orglamorize unhealthy habits such as smoking orexcessive drinking. Collaboration, participation, education Man-agers and other leaders in the health sector increas-ingly appreciate that collaboration, like partici-pation in all its forms, is educational and treat it assuch. It generates understanding and helps buildand sustain consensus on short- and long-termobjectives. It should facilitate the elaboration ofstrategies that are both technically feasible andacceptable to the population. It can promote a senseof ownership, motivation and responsibility for thedevelopment of health for all programmes among awide range of professional groups, policy sectorsand individuals.Education and learning about health for all can occurin many settings in different formats. In its broadestform it reaches all groups, makes health everybody'sbusiness, and stimulates them to action. 9S 5 Health for all development strategies 177 Target 37 - Partners for healthBy the year 2000, in all Member States, a wide range of organizations and groupsthroughout the public, private and voluntary sectors should be actively contributing to theachievement of health for all.This target can be achieved if broadly based active participation in health for alldevelopnient is encouraged through structures and processes at the international,country, regional and local levels. This will require the involvement of a broad range ofpartners such as intergovernmental organizations, government departments, regionalagencies, municipal authorities, professional organizations, industry and labour, andcommunity groups. Partners will be gained through structures and processes that:facilitate networking and communication between potential partners;provide access to priority-setting, planning, decision-making and implementation;place appropriate emphasis on decentralizing decision-making;widely disseminate information on health issues;provide support for the work of community groups;provide incentives that facilitate intersectoral action;strengthen international solidarity for European health for all development by usingexisting and emerging European structures for intergovernmental cooperation andaction. Problem statementAn effective strategy ofhealth development is based on a sound, com-prehensive policy. Consistent with health for allprinciples, this policy must be supported by pur-poseful research and reliable, relevant information,and carried out by personnel who are properly trainedand motivated by a service ethic that is inspired byhealth for all values. They must implement thestrategy in a working environment that sensitivelycombines public, private and voluntary structures.In all these facets of health development, the path tosuccess lies in building partnerships. Partnerships as a prerequisite The implemen-tation of the health for all policy relies heavily onthe active commitment of many interests outsidethe health sector. The prerequisites for health in-clude the provision of safe water and food, thedesign of safe homes and neighbourhoods, and the 186 1 78Heakh for all targets education of children to enable them to make wisechoices about lifestyles. Specific health objectives,such as the reduction of alcohol consumption andof the prevalence of smoking, and greater socialequity in the distribution of resources for health,can only be achieved if many sectors are involved.Health for all is, as a matter of principle, a move-ment for people. They have the right to equalopportunity in health, the right to health care, theright to be informed, and the right to be involved aspartners in decision-making and action affectingtheir health. Partnership for health means the en-couragement of intersectoral collaboration andmultisectoral action and the promotion of commu-nity participation. These have been regarded asfundamental to health for all, but none was takenup in practice as extensively as expected once theregional health for all strategy was adopted. Thus,this target addresses the issue by focusing on theneed for fresh momentum in forging partnerships.Many nongovernmental organizations, includingself-help groups, and nearly all associations of healthprofessionals have embraced health for all, and poli-ticians in many municipalities have supported it.Nevertheless, few decision-makers in other sectorshave been swayed to the point of shifting resourcesto meet or at least not to jeopardize health objectives.Much better communication and exchange of infor-mation is needed about positive experiences of jointaction for health and of mechanisms for effectiveparticipation, which could have a multiplier effect inbuilding true working partnerships. Barriers to partnershipA number of barriers topartnership persist and there are several possiblecauses of failure. In any particular case, the specificcause must be identified if an appropriate solutionis to be found. In many cases, the mutual benefits tobe obtained from commitment to health for all havenot yet been presented in a sufficiently convincingway to all the main potential partners. Sometimes,the health policies of authorities at different levelsare not sufficiently explicit or persuasive in argu-ing that health is the business of all sectors, not justthe health sector. People working in sectors outsidehealth, the mass media and the general public,often do not understand the concepts and principlesof health for all, the specific problems to be ad-dressed, the objectives being pursued and the meansavailable to accomplish them, or the positive effecttheir cooperation would achieve.The traditional arrangements for developing healthpolicy and providing health care have often ac-tively discouraged partnerships for health. Policy-making has been seen not as a cooperative task butas a technical task, the proper approach to whichdepended on specialist medical expertise and ad-vice. Health care systems have often been noted fortheir tendency to exclude nonprofessional voicesand to establish a social distance between pro-fessionals and the public. As a result of the closedorganization and professionalization of health care,health workers themselves have faile,d to recognizeopportunities to make partners and facilitateintersectoral investment in health.The failure to find a common language to explainhealth issues to different groups is a serious prob-lem. In many cases, the steps needed to facilitatecommunication between sectors and with the com-munity and to develop a common knowledge basehave not been deliberately examined. While humanrights, including the protection of a patient's pri-vacy, are inviolable, the principle of confidential-ity has sometimes been used as a pretext to resistreasonable requests for information.187 Health for all development strategies 179 Partnership as an international challenge Be-yond the arena of health care services, there is afurther challenge to cement partnerships inter-nationally in the policy areas of environmentalhealth and the promotion of healthy patterns ofliving. Success in attacking major problems in bothareas will depend on international solidarity.Chernobyl and other environmental disasters havemade that crystal clear. In the lifestyles area, atten-tion must focus on the consequences of the liberal-ization of the mass media and particularly theinternationalization of television through satelliteand cable. This means that both intended and inci-dental messages can instantly reach a growingaudience Region-wide. These messages may beconveyed through both advertising and the rolemodel images of popular figures in television filmsand entertainment programmes. Their behaviourmay be health-promoting or -damaging. The poorenvironmental health record and the limited atten-tion given to health promotion policies in the cen-tral and eastern part of the Region mean that aspecial international effort will be needed to sup-port those countries. Overall, there are positivesigns of international solidarity, but it is still toofragmented and uncoordinated to be as effective asit needs to be. Encountering resistanceAt all levels, attemptsto increase participation and develop partnershipsfor health have occasionally encountered resist-ance from politicians, bureaucrats and professionalgroups. They have justified their resistance bystating that existing mandates, legislation and sys-tems of decision-making are functioning ad-equately, or that the new arrangements would betoo slow and complex and the additional partnerswould not have the requisite technical competenceand experience to make good decisions. More oftenthan not, the underlying reason has been that anymoves to share decision-making challenge the ex-isting distribution of power. Suggested solutionsThe purpose of buildingpartnerships and networks for health is to im-prove communications and ensure action outsidethe health sector. This networking may be accom-plished in many ways.Countries have found it constructive to facilitateparticipation through various political, public, pri-vate and voluntary bodies. Influential groups suchas parliamentarians are showing an interest in healthfor all. They have strong potential as leaders ofpublic opinion, and can be encouraged to advocatehealth for all, both in national and internationalparliaments and at home in their local constitu-encies. In countries with pluralistic health systems,the insurance organizations have been brought intothe discussion and, in some countries, the tradeunions are taking an interest. Religious organiz-ations have traditionally played a strong role in thehealth care sector in many countries and can beexpected to embrace a policy that emphasizes is-sues of equity, participation and involvement. Itwould be idealistic, however, to expect that partici-pation and intersectoral action could be securedthrough the force of moral or ethical argumentalone. Realistically, more attention must be givento uncovering and emphasizing the mutual benefitsand particular advantages for each sector.Ex2-nples have been reported of successful coop-erat. .n between government departments at thecountry, regional and local levels in encouragingthe production of healthy food products, reducingenvironmental pollution, and coordinating healthand social services. More recently, there has been a 1 R 8 180Heakh for all targets move to involve manufacturing and service indus-tries in action for health. In some countries, butch-ers and supermarkets have begun to offer healthierfood products, chefs have participated in trainingcourses on healthy cooking, and some hotels andrestaurants now prepare health dishes on a regularbasis. Businesses are also workplaces, and an in-creasing number treat the solution of health prob-lems as an investment in the health of the workersand the health of the business (34). Sustaining partnershipsSharing information onhealth issues and establishing regular formal andinformal communication is necessary to sustainpartnerships. Communication grows out of work-ing with partners to develop a common languageand knowledge base and accepting the contribu-tions of others drawn from their own knowledgeand experience. In some places, adult educationcentres and courses have been used to involvepeople in the discussion of health for all. Localhealth facilities can be used as meeting places forinterested individuals and groups. Many youth or-ganizations have national and international net-works that can be mobilized. A crucial role for the media A sustained effortis needed to mobilize all the resources of televisionand other modern means of communication topresent the health fur all concept and principles andthe arguments for intersectoral action and commu-nity involvement. The potential of the media andtheir role in public education have not yet beenproperly tapped, but the possibilities are clear (35).People in the media have much better communi-cation skills than most health workers. By creatingvisibility for health issues, they can help sustainthe political will to attain health for all objectives.They can raise public awareness and explain andclarify options for action. Through audience par-ticipation and public access programmes, televisionin particular can feed public reactions back topolicy-makers. People in the media aim to gain andretain the interest and sympathies of their audience.This need not conflict with the objectives of healthpolicy-makers: they too have first to gain the pub-lic's attention if they are to inform, educate andpersuade. In all circumstances, the way in whichinformation is presented can be decisive. Infor-mation can be tailored to the needs of differenttarget groups in the population and generate posi-tive responses. Implications of a partnership strategy The part-nership strategy will have different implicationsfor the lifestyles, environment and health servicestargets because different partners will be identi-fied, each with distinctive contributions to make.In each area, the strategy will need to identifywhich organizational structures and institutionscan best support participation. Resources will haveto be made available to make participation as at-tractive as possible. Winning partners for healthrequires the health sector to take conscious actionto remove barriers and create arrangements thatfacilitate cooperation based on shared decision-making. In several countries, this will also meanstrengthening the organizational and managerialcapacity of public health departments and the stra-tegic planning and evaluation function in the healthsector.One of the basic principles of networks and partner-ships is that people have the right to be involved andinformed. They ultimately decide on the value ofhealth in their lives. Although the economic, social,cultural and physical environment may severely 1 6 9 Health for all development strategies 181 restrict their real options, people are partners in thehealth for all movement and they share responsi-bilities. They should be able to play an active rolein seizing available opportunities to develop andmaintain their health potential. With the right to beinformed, they should be able to obtain infor-mation, to draw conclusions from it and to use it toexercise their influence.People have a well established means of publicparticipation in many countries: through self-helpgroups and voluntary organizations. These oftenoperate on an informal basis with limited financialresources, depending on the time and energy oftheir membership(36).If such groups are to beeffective participants, they require support in theform of information, technical assistance, networkcommunication and financial aid. For example, inthe area of health education, some national coordi-nating bodies offer research and training and lobbyon behalf of a variety of voluntary organizations. Successfulpartnerships at the local level Whereparticipation and partnership strategies have beenadopted, the motivation in part has been to makehealth systems more responsive to local needs, toallow individuals and groups to set their own priori-ties, and to enlist the knowledge and resources of thecommunity. Participation is most successful at themost local level. In some respects, the issues may beless complex than at the national level and can beclearly understood. Participation tends to operatemore effectively in decentralized settings, where thepeople who make decisions are closer to the cornmu-nity and more sensitive to its needs. Local politi-cians and professionals are ready to respond to localgroups concerned with a neighbourhood health prob-lem. In several countries, the trend is towards allow-ing communities and .neighbourhoods to decidewhat they need from the health and social services,and to carry out plans through recognized commit-tee structures. The Healthy Cities project (37,38)provides a positive example of cooperation be-tween city departments steered by intersectoralcommittees of politicians and senior officials. Anappropriate balance must be struck, however, be-tween the two needs for central coordination andfor decentralized participation. The potential of international partnerships Atthe international level, health has been moving to theforefront of the policy arena, stimulated by thecommon health policy for Europe. WHO'S experi-ence has shown the relevance, for health develop-ment in the Region, of making formal links with anumber of nongovernmental organizations, such asthrough the European Forum of Medical Associ-ations and WHO and the European Forum of Pharma-ceutical Associations and WHO. Other importantpartnerships have been forged with the InternationalCouncil of Nurses, the Association of Schools ofPublic Health in the European Region, the Associ-ation of Medical Deans in Europe and the Inter-national Diabetes Federation (European Region).Examples of WHO partnerships also include thenetworks of healthy cities, health-promoting com-panies, health-promotingschoolsandhealth-promoting hospitals.Existing and emerging European integrational or-ganizations will be striving to advance the well-being of all citizens in the Region through a pro-cess of consensus similar to that achieved by Mem-ber States in the Regional Committee. Popularpressure on international bodies is likely to extendbeyond the established issues of disease preven-tion, drug abuse and environmental health and intodemands for action to improve the quality of life. 10 182Health for all targets All the political bodies pursuing Region-wide eco- Committee and the Member States are pursuing anomic and social goals should therefore become strategy of rapprochement in their policies and pro-potential partners in health for all. The Regional grammes with such organizations. Target 38-Health and ethics By the year2000,all Member States should have mechanisms in place to strengthen ethicalconsiderations in decisions relating to the health of individuals, groups and populations. The particular approaches adopted should be in accordance with the social andcultural characteristics of each country, and include:the education and training of health professionals in ethics;measures to increase knowledge of ethical considerations among the public,politicians and other decision-makers;an ethical rode of practice for health professionals, including the relationshipbetween health care providers and patients;the strengthening of ethics bodies and other mechanisms at the appropriate levelsand in relevant sectors that:encourage widespread discussion of the interests of individual people, groupsin the community, and the public at large;specify and assess the ethical aspects of health policy, health care practice andhealth research and provide advicr- on them;are free to speak independently from government, industry and professional orother particular interests, expressing their opinion on issues of health and ethicsfalling within their mandate;facilitate open discussion and accountability to the public;take full account of the health-related ethical principles contained in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations convention onhuman rights, the working decisions of the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights and the recommendations of the Council of Europe. 191 Health for all development strategies 183 problem statementThere has been an ex-plosion of knowledge and technology in medi-cal care. Some treatment and care can greatly in-crease life expectancy and the quality of life. Yetpeople have begun to ask whether medical actionshould have limits. At the same time, people haveincreasingly come to expect that medical tech-nology will find a solution for every problem,including those that are social rather than medical.This has had a distorting effect: knowledge andtechnology have tended tp be used only for closelydefined, individual goals. For example, massiveefforts are made to save the lives of prematureinfants while preventive primary care, which wouldaddress the quality of antenatal care and the livingconditions of the mother, is ignored. This is basi-cally an ethical issue.In today's climate, ethical questions have to do notonly with who shall have access to care and par-ticular treatment and who, as a consequence, shallbe denied such care. Such questions also increas-ingly apply to who shall have the opportunity tochoose healthy lifestyles and who shall have accessto healthy environments. Health for all presup-poses that people should have maximum accessand opportunity, at least as far as available re-sources allow. Its basic principle of equity is areflection of a profound concern with ethics. Who decides?Ultimately, the question is whodecides what the health requirements of the popu-lation are and how they should be met. At the sametime, demand is growing for value for money andfor accountability to the public for decisions inhealth policy and practice. Questions of ethics thatarise in health policy and practice have hithertobeen a preoccupation normally restricted to gov-ernments, associations of health professionals andcertain other groups such as lawyers, philosophersand theologians. As the concept of health policyhas widened to include lifestyle and environmentalissues, the number of disciplines and professionsthat contribute to health policy formulation hasgrown. The complexity of many health policyissues, their ethical implications and the intenseconcern they arouse have grown to the point wherethey can no longer be effectively dealt with throughtraditional institutions or delegated by governmentand society to the professionals immediately con-cerned.This has been pointedly demonstrated by the AIDSepidemic, which has raised a combination of ethi-cal and moral issues that affect the community,people with HIV and AIDS, and health care provid-ers. Many such issues touch basic individual andcollective human rights: the right of Hiv-infectedwomen to bear children, the protection againstdiscrimination of Hiv-infected people and wholegroups perceived to be at risk of infection, manda-tory reporting and conditions of screening, meas-ures to protect health personnel and their patients,and the conditions under which AIDS research iscarried out (39,40).Issues of ethics and conflicts of value systems thatarise in deciding on health action fall into threecategories: health policy, the rights of individualsand groups of patients, and specific health careinterventions. Ethics and health policyIn broad terms, thehealth policy issues are of two sorts: those con-cerned with human rights and those involving thealkication of public funds for health. The moretraditional concerns have had to do with balancingthe rights of the individual with the protection of192 184Health for all targets the community through public order and publichealth. Examples include taking violently disturbedindividuals into custody, notifying the authoritiesabout cases of diseases of public health concern,and protecting people against infectious diseasesthrough mandatory immunization.A new set of issues has emerged as the concept ofhealth promotion has broadened to take more ac-count of more issues of lifestyle and behaviour. Forexample, debate about the appropriateness of gov-ernment regulations on the mandatory wearing ofseat-belts has been extensive. Other issues includeenvironmental restrictions on smoking, the use ofhigh taxes to discourage some forms of consump-tion, and restrictions on the production and market-ing of tobacco, alcohol and additives.Two factors have led to the increasing complexityand prominence of ethical issues in deciding howto allocate human, technical and financial resourcesfor health. One is the broadening concept of healthpolicy, and the other is the growth of extremelyexpensive technology, which can increasingly beused to save or prolong life, usually for a very smallnumber of people and for a relatively short periodof time. The major policy choices concern theapportionment of expenditure between health pro-motion and disease prevention or treatment andcare, between proven or experimental technologiesand therapies, between active treatment or support-ive care, and among various research and develop-ment priorities.The complex array of alternatives has in practicemeant more rationing of resources. The seriouspolitical and ethical consequences are evident fromdebates about human organ transplantation, thedevelopment of new medical technology, and in-vestment in pollution control and safety in theworkplace. Whatever political judgement may bemade in a given situation about the allocation ofresources, it would be ethically indefensible tofund inappropriate or ineffective, expensive tech-nologies by diverting resources away from primarycare development, from innovative strategies forhealth promotiot1 and disease prevention, or fromtreatments of proven effectiveness. Ethics and the consumer of health services Thesecond category of ethical issues involves people'srights when using the health care system. It is nowrecognized that people have the right to life-savingand life-sustaining care without financial, social orphysical barriers. It is widely accepted that thepatient and, in many cases, his or her family shouldbe full partners in treatment and care processes andbring their knowledge, values and priorities to bearon the decisions made. But this new understandingof the patient's role generates new demands. One isthe right to information about the immediate ben-efits and risks of the treatment being used and thealternative therapies that may be available. Associ-ated with this is the patient's right to give informedconsent to treatment, as well as the demand for thehealth care provider to be more accountable. On theother hand, exercising the right to be given infor-mation can place an additional emotional and intel-lectual burden on some patients that may harmtheir medical condition. Doctors need training tohelp them assess a patient's capacity to carry thatburden, support that patient in contemplating anydecision he or she should make, and decide whataction ethically to take when they conclude that apatient cannot carry the burden without harm. Ethics and intervention A third ethical concernis the potential for intervention at key points in the 193 Health for all development strategies 185 life cycle, especially reproduction, perinatal careand the prolongation of life, and the conditionsunder which research may be conducted. Theseissues become increasingly critical as technologycan save and prolong life in situations where deathwould otherwise occur. These advances are chal-lenging traditional understandings of the nature oflife and the boundaries of appropriate human inter-vention in life and death.Reproductive issues concern contraceptive tech-nology, abortion, in vitro fertilization and the ma-nipulation of gene material. Concerns about perinataltreatment focus on the applopriateness of saving thelives of premature infants who are known to havemajor birth defects, regardless of the long-term con-sequences for the quality of life of the children, forthe wellbeing of their families and for those whoprovide and will pay for their care. The concern withtechnology and treatment that prolong the lives ofolder people is that a marginal increase in longevity(adding years to life) may be achieved at the cost ofconsiderable suffering or distress and without anybenefit of adding health to life and life to years. Ethics and researchThe ethics of health researchare gaining greater prominence as decisions on healthpohcy and action are increasingly required to bebased on scientific evidence. One concern is that theacquisition of knowledge becomes a driving force intreatment decisions, and active treatment is givenhigher priority than either care or prevention. Theseare prominent concerns in cancer treatment and care.Questions are being raised about how research pri-orities are set and what capacity research institutionshave to deal with these emerging questions.Suggested solutionsThe approaches adoptedto address ethics, and associated value questions,in health action and research must be L,ased onpolitical decisions made after wide public discus-sion and political debate. The arrangements madewill depend on a country's political systems, cul-tural traditions, constitutional arrangements andorganizational structures. Some countries havefound it useful to express or support these in appro-priate laws and regulations. Whatever the arrange-ments used, quations must be dealt with in anequitable, broad, transparent and balanced manner.Any policies on health and ethics should take fullaccount of the relevant articles in the United Na-tions Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ofother internationally recognized conventions in thefield of human rights and bioethics, and of theprotection of the individual contained in the consti-tutions of Member States. Considerations of equityand of access to the prerequisites for health willalso need to be addressed. In dealing with suchquestions, the legitimate interests and rights of theindividual and of particular groups of people shouldbe balanced with the good of the community.Issues in bioethics, including the implications ofresearch involving human subjects, have been re-ceiving increasing attention. The Council of Eu-rope has reviewed a number of specific issues andhas reached consensus on respect for human dig-nity, recognition of the inviolability of the humanbody, avoidance of commercial profiteering in thefield of biomedicine, and the principle of selfdetermination of the individual. Ethics and accountabilityA great deal ofprogress can be made in ethical issues if account-ability to the public can be established as a guidingprinciple for decisions made about health action.This means that the people wh... -Jecide on policy194 186Health for all targets and practice in any area of health development mayhave their decisions publicly examined in terms oftheir health consequences, with the possibility ofcorrective action being taken. Processes for achiev-ing accountability and forms of corrective actioncan vary widely, depending on national and localcircumstances. The principle of accountability ap-plies broadly to decisions that affect health care,environmental protection, lifestyles, equity and theprerequisites for health. Ensuring open debateCountries have found ituseful to have an agreed set of structures andprocesses for obtaining advice and facilitating pub-lic discussion in a representative manner. All insti-tutions established to address ethical issues musthave mandates and working methods that are clearlystated. While these bodies will reflect the particularpolitical, cultural and other features of the country,three characteristics have been found to be ben-eficial.First, they should be independent in the sense thatthey are protected from undue influence from pol-itical, professional, commercial or religious inter-ests. This can be achieved by giving these bodies ahigh degree of autonomy when setting their agen-das, when deciding whose opinions to take intoaccount and what basis of knowledge and opinionto accept, and when publishing their investigationsand conclusions.Second, they should allow the public to participatein their activities, thus conducting their business inan open, transparent and accountable manner.Third, their membership and the manner in whichthey conduct their activities should be represen-tative. This may mean that membership includesindividuals who represent the public interest, andthat structures and processes are adopted that en-sure that particular interests are accommodated andbalanced representation is achieved. In countrieswith well established self-governing bodies of pro-viders and other health care partners that addressethical issues as part of their overall mandate, it hasbeen found useful to institute transparent mech-anisms for dialogue between the parties. In everycase, the procedures established should ensure thatall parties affected by deliberations on ethical andrelated issues have an opportunity to be heard andinvolved in those deliberations.The strategy for addressing ethical issues must beable to involve broad sections of the public, includ-ing particular interest groups, in an informed pro-cess of discussion. This is most likely to succeed ifthe strategy is based on two-way communication.The people who have an interest in any issue, suchas consumer and self-help groups, professionalassociations and health researchers, should have anopportunity to contribute what they consider to betheir legitimate points of view and knowledgeabout it. At the same time, the mass media andothers in a position to contribute to discussionsshould also be actively engaged in the communi-cations process. Leadership and responsibility of the health careprofessionalA strategy of participation and open-ness also increases knowledge and awareness amongthe public, politicians and decision-makers. Phys-icians and other health care providers have tradition-ally taken the lead in advocating what they considerto be the best courses of action for their patients andthe appropriate policies for the settings in whichthey work. They should continue to play their lead-ership role, but also recognize that they work in a1 5 Health for all development strategies 187 wide social and political framework containing many 5.other players. They should be conscious of their rolein making decisions about policy and practice, keepunder continuous review their codes of practice and 6.revise them as new circumstances demand. Innova-tive approaches to training are clearly needed toaddress ethical issues as a part of the education of all 7.health professionals. This means developing train-ing programmes that integrate moral and philo-sophical concepts with biomedical and other rel- 8.evant scientific knowledge and with the develop-ment of technical skills in ways that strengthen theprofessional competence of the practitioner. 9. Ethics and tradeFinally, goods and serviceswith both good and bad influences on health are 10.becoming increasingly standardized and freelytraded across international boundaries. This chal-lenges the international community to pay greaterattention to health and ethics associated with eco- 11.nomic trade and development.

[ 98 8Conclusions Health for all is a challenging goal for the Regionas a whole and for each of its Member States.Through their resolutions in the World HealthAssembly and the WHO Regional Committee forEurope, all Member States have accepted the dutyand responsibility of taking the action necessary toensure the attainment of health for all. This bookprovides a framework for intensifying such action.It suggests the changes and interventions needed toimprove people's health and the support that theserequire.The experience gained since the first set of re-gional targets was adopted has demonstrated thesoundness and relevance of the concepts and ap-proaches on which health for all is based. A newdirection has been set for health development inthe European Region. Major improvements interms of longer life and better health have beenaccompanied by increasing knowledge about pro-grammes and practices that work. Countries havebenefited not just in the immediate health field butin many other areas, through the adoption of poli-cies that reflect the principles and strategies ofhealth for all.Unsolved problems remain, however, that set theagenda for the rest of this decade. Progress in theacceptance of health for all policies has been greaterthan achievements in implementing them. The needfor leadership and good management has becomemore pronounced as health promotion and environ-mental protection play a stronger role and coun-tries move increasingly towards pluralistic sys-tems.The main emphasis of the updated European healthfor all policy, and the revised targets described inthis book, is on implementation. It calls for greaterefforts in health promotion, disease prevention,environmental health, appropriate care and healthdevelopment support. It is about action, partner-ship and innovation at the international, country,regional and local levels. It seeks new ways ofinvolving and mobilizing a large number of indi-viduals as well as public, private and voluntarybodies in all sectors of society. It aims to turnpolicy intentions into successful outcomes thatwill produce healthier populations, bringing notjust basic benefits but the best quality achieve-ments possible. It encourages policy-makers to 191 192Healthfor all targets employ strategies that will reduce, and where poss-ible eliminate, inequalities in health, and make thebest use of society's resources to maximize healthpotential.Action does not mean tackling the health for alltargets one by one.Rather, the challenge is tocombine components related to different targetsinto cohesive programmes of action. Each com-ponent can stimulate the interests of the public,private and voluntary sectors at the local, nationaland international levels, giving them the incentiveto make significant progress towards health for all.The most relevant components and the most import-ant interactions will differ according to each par-ticular situation, in social, cultural, economic andpolitical terms. The heart of the health for allapproach is to encourage local, regional, nationalor international action that is flexible, adaptive andresponsive.As an illustration, a programme of action on to-bacco, which is the single largest cause of prevent-able death, disability and disease in the Region,could involve components from many differenttargets, as shown in the table. Action programme on tobacco:potential components relating to different targets Programme componentWorking with groups in society most vulnerable to tobacco useIncreasing the health potential of groups, communities and individuals by reducingthe social attractiveness of tobaccoReducing cancer, cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive !ung disease causedby smokingIncreasing the quality of life of elderly people by reducing their disability fromsmoking-related diseases and by increasing their disposable income for travel,cultural events and other forms of participation in social lifeChampioring nonsmoking as an the \"in-thing\" among children and youthCombating the marketing of tobacco to women by presenting smoke-free living ashaving a positive value in the family and societyRelatedtarget(s) 1 2 4 67 8 '2o Conclusions193 Programme component Relatedtarget(s)Promoting nonsmoking in cardiovascular disease and cancer control programmes incommunity and clinical settingsPresenting smoke-free living as having a positive value in lifestyle programmes,supported by healthy public policy in other sectors; ensuring that the choice of eithertobacco or health is a key part of health education and trainingCreating healthier environments free from tobacco pollution in enclosed spacesat work, in public places and at homeProtecting people at work from the use of tobacco, which is an obstacle to health andquality of life, a fire hazard and a workplace pollutant9,10 13- 17 19- 21 25 Procuring health service resources and appropriate technology for efficientprogrammes of education about tobacco or health, and the development of theskills necessary for community health promotion 27 - 31 Ensuring smoke-free health institutions and encouraging health service staff,as important role models, to support tobacco or health programmes in their public lives 28 - 30 Promoting evaluation and research linked to the action programme on tobacco,to test and improve its effectiveness, efficiency and accessibility to the whole community 32 Developing a process of implementation and management appropriate to this highpriority issue in the Region 33,34 Ensuring the availability and efficient use of monitoring information on smokingknowledge, attitudes and behaviour, public policy provision, and the pattern andimpact of tobacco-related diseaseEstablishing a programme of recruitment, training and deployment of key humanresources in the public, private and voluntary sectors for the promotion and fulfilmentof the action programme on tobaccoSecuring the participation and cooperation of the community and key political,professional, social and cultural groups, particularly the mass media, to support theprogramme in an effective and timely way35 36 37Justifying the ethics of supporting the rights of nonsmokers 38 201 194Health for all targets Action for health for all is the responsibility of theentire community. Models of good practice havedeveloped in different target areas in many parts ofthe Region and, in the last few years, have alsobeen widely applied at the local level. The eco-nomic and political changes that are taking placethroughout the Region offer both a challenge andan opportunity to develop new structures formutual inspiration, practical cooperation and shareddecision-making.Health authorities in countries will continue to leadthe process of health for all, supported by thecommitment of a large number of professional andother groups. Collectively, they must ensure thatthe wflo Regional Committee for Europe can con-tinue to play its key role in stimulating healthfor all development, further developing the com-mon health policy, monitoring its implementation,and evaluating its effectiveness in achieving theregional targets. The Regional Committee mustalso ensure that the inspiration, guidance and coordi-nation of regional health work by the WHO Re-gional Office for Europe are maintained. The re-sources of the Regional Office should support theimplementation and development of health for allstrategies in individual countries and in the Regionas a whole.The European Region has the people, the know-ledge and the resources that are needed to attain theregional targets, and the will to bring these forcesto bear on the prevailing problems. Each step madetogether will bring countries closer to health for all.By jointly making the commitment to a regionalhealth for all policy and by setting clear targets, theMember States of the Region have created a broadmovement that fosters better understanding amongnations and will leave a legacy of value beyond ourtime. 2 2 Annex 1Revision of the targetsfor health for all This annex summarizes the nature and extent ofchanges to the targets (see table), by comparingthose in this book with those set out in the originalbook, Targets jar health for all (European Hea10,for All Series, No. 1, 1985).Within the targets on health outcome (targets 1 12)the major changes are to targets 6 8. The updatedtargets have been refocused to deal with the healthof different population groups: target 6 now fo-cuses on the elderly, target 7 on children and youngpeople, and target 8 on women, In each case theoriginal target is retained as a component of theupdated target, but the updated targets have a muchbroader scope and positively and comprehensivelyemphasize the health of the population group con-cerned. The scope of target 12 has also been wid-ened to deal with mental disorders and the qualityof life of people with such disorders, as well as withsuicide and attempted suicide.There are two major changes to the targets onlifestyles and health (1317). The first of these iszarget 14, which has a new focus on the develop-ment of opportunities for health promotion in thesettings of daily life. The second is a reorganiz-ation of the material covered in targets 16 and 17.The revised target 16 is concerned with healthypatterns of living (in contrast to its original empha-sis on individuals and behaviour). The reduction oftobacco use is now a part of target 17, which callsfor controlling the health-damaging consumptionof tobacco, alcohol and psychoactive drugs.The targets on creating healthy env ironmcnts(1825) remain largely unchanged. In two casesthe scope of the target has been widened. Target 23now includes soil pollution and the disposal ofmunicipal waste as well as hazardous waste, whiletarget 25 has been widened to include the pro-motion of health and wellbeing at work.The reorganization of subject matter among thetargets on appropriate care (26 31) has allowedthe formulation of two substantially new targets.Target 29, now entitled \"Hospital care\", deals withsecondary and tertiary care in support of primaryhealth care. Target 30 concerns the provision ofappropriate services to people requiring iong-termcare and support (developed from part of original 1952 )3 196Health for al: targets Changes in the targets TargetnumberOriginal title Revised title Extent of revision 1Reducing the differences Equity in health None2Developing health potential Health and quality of life None3Better opportunitiesfor the disabledBetter opportunitiesfor people with disabilitiesNone changes 5Elimination of specificdiseasesReducing communicablediseaseMinor changes 6Life expectancy at birth Healthy aging Substantially different; revisedto cover the elderly as apopulation group7Infant mortality Health childrenand young peopleSubstantially different; revisedto cover children and youngpeople as a population group8Maternal mortality Health of women Substantially different; revisedto cover women as apopulation group9Diseases of the circulation Reducing cardiovascular disease Minor changes10Cancer Controlling cancer Minor changes11Accidents Accidents Minor changes12Suicide Reducing mental disordersand suicideMinor changes 13Healthy public policy Healthy public policy Minor changes14Social support systems Settings for healthpromotionRefocused on the developmentof oppol for healthpromotion in and motivationfor healthy behaviourHealth competence Minor changes 16Positive health behaviour Healthy living Minor changes17Health-damaging behaviour Tobacco, alcohol andpsychoactive drugsRefocused on controlling theproduction and tobacco, 19Monitoring and healthmanagementMinor changes20Control of quality changes2 4 Annex 1197 TacgetOriginal titlenumber Revised title of preferentialdistribution resources28Content care of communityresources 31Ensuring quality of care 32Research strategies 33Policies for health for all 34Planning and resourceallocation35Health information systems36Planning, ecology people atwork Health service policy Health service resourcesand managementPrimary health care Hospital care Community services tomeet special needsQuality of care andappropriate technologyHealth research for alldevelopmentHealth healthPartners and disposalof include healthinitiatives changes Minor 30Substantially part oforiginal target 28Substantially different;widened to include technologyMinor changes Minor changes Minor changes Minor changesWidened to include othersectors as well as healthSubstantially different New 2 ) 5 198Health for all targets target 28). The original targets 29 and 30 (on thecontent and providers of primary health care, re-spectively) are now dealt with as part of up-dated target 28 on primary health care. Finally,target 31 now covers both the quality of care(original target 31) and appropriate technology(original target 38).The last seven targets (3238) deal with health forall development. Target 36, on education and train-ing, has been widened and now deals not just withhealth workers but personnel in all sectors (takingin the subjects covered by original target 37). Theupdated target 37 is completely refocused on mobil-izing partners and facilitating widespread cooper-ation and participation in health for all develop-ment. Updated target 38 on health and ethics iscompletely new, and deals with mechanisms tostrengthen ethical considerations in decisions re-lating to health. 206I Annex 2Indicators for monitoring progresstowards health for allin the WHO European Region This annex sets out the statistical indicators for usewith the revised targets. The WHORegionalCommittee for Europe approved this list of indi-cators in 1991, along with the updated regionaltargets for health for all and the revised plan ofaction and major milestones for implementation ofthe regional strategy.During the latest evaluation of progress towardshealth for all, carried out in 1990 1991, nar-rative situation assessments were introduced tobe used as a guide in reporting on the aspects ofthe targets that could not be covered adequatelyby statistical indicators. Such assessments willbe adapted to cover all the components of eachof the revised target statements in future evalu-ation and monitoring exercises. Specific formu-lations and definitions of the set of indicators andnarrative situation assessments for use in the nextmonitoring exercise are to be available for reviewat the forty-third session of the Regional Com-mittee.For a number of the proposed new or revised statisti-cal indicators, further work is required before spe-cific recommendations can be made on suitable stan-damlized measurement instruments for use in futuremonitoring and evaluation exercises. The indicatorsconcerned are those on the quality of life (targets 2, 3,6, 9, 10 and 12), healthy life expectancy (target 2),injury or disability resulting from accidents (tar-get 11), mental health (target 12), and adequate nu-trition and exercise (target 16). Specific recommen-dations in each of these areas will be put before theRegional Committee at the earliest opportunity, forincorporation in the list of indicators. Member Stateswill be welcome to report on the results of specificsurveys or studies that include the areas concerned.Data for some indicators can be collated from aninternational source or sources. In such cases, Mem-ber States will not have to supply data on theseindicators during monitoring and evaluation exer-cises. The notes in the indicator list show where suchcommon sources will be used. 1992 1,) 7 200Health for all targets List of indicators TargetNo.TitleRegional indicators 1Equity in healthNo.Description 1.1Differences in healthstatus between countries 1.2Differences in healthstatus within countriesCommentData from health status indicators listed below fortargets 2 - 12 will be used.No detailed statistical indicators can be specified,since Member States are expected to differ in thesubgroups that can be identified, and in the mostrelevant subgroups, as well as in the measures ofhealth status (apart from mortality) that are available.Subgroups could be defined by: social class, occu-pational group, educational level, income level,ethnic/cultural origin or identification,and region/district of residence. Sources could be routine orspecial surveys/studies. At the least, all countries arelikely to be able to report mortality by geographicaldivision such as district/region or urban/rural life expectancy:indices linking life tableswith functional aspectsof healthSource will be ILO publications. Although a variety of approaches and measurementinstruments have been developed for assessing thequality of life, standardized instruments cannot yetbe recommended for use throughout the Region.Clear working definitions of quality of life andreview of the instruments available are requiredbefore specific recommendations can be forrnu-lated.Standard methods of calculation cannot yet berecommended for use throughout the Region.Specific recommendations will be submitted to theRegional Committee for approval at the earliestpossible opportunity. 3Better opportunitiesfor people withdisabilities3.2Percentage of of quality oflife for people withdisabilitiesSee comments on the assessment of quality of lifeunder target 2. 4Reducing chronicdisease4.1Number of days oftemporary year, by ageand sex4.2Percentage of long-term 1, 15, 45 and65 years, by sex4.6Incidence and prevalenceof selected chronic con-ditions: all ages, by sex;people aged 65 years andover, by sex a Numbers in brackets are rubrics of ICD-9.Data for indicators 4.1, 4.2, 4.5 and 4.6 on peopleover 65 years of age, where they can be supplied, willalso be relevant to target 6. Results obtained from population surveys and fromsurveys of disabled people will also be relevant totargets 2 and 3, respectively. Data will be collated from those already reported toWHO and its collaborating centres. Data on AIDS willalso be relevant to target 5. The Sullivan method may be used: details are given inWorld health statistics quarterly, 42(3): 148 (1989).Values for disability-free life expectancy at age65 years will also be used in connection with target 6.The most suitable conditions for reporting may beneoplasms (information from registries), mental dis-orders, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases ofthe musculoskeletal system, chronic diseases of therespiratory system and diabetes.

(1)Community participationThe active involvementof people living together in some form of socialorganization and cohesion in the planning, oper-ation and control of primary health care, usinglocal, national and other resources. (I)Comprehensive health system [A health system]that includes all the elements required to meet allthe health needs of the population. (/)DisabilityIn the context of health experience . .. anyrestriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) ofability to perform an activity in the manner or withinthe range considered normal for a human being. (2)Disease preventionMeasures not only to prevent theoccurrence of disease, such as immunization ordisease vector control or anti-smoking activities,but also to arrest its progress and reduce its conse-quences once it is established. (/)Environmental healthThose aspects of human healthand disease that are determined by factors in theenvironment. It also refers to the theory and practiceof assessing and controlling factors in the environ-ment that can potentially affect health. Environmen-tal health . .. includes both the direct pathologicaleffects of chemicals, radiation and aome biologicalagents, and the effects (often indirect) on health andwellbeing of the broad physical, psychological, so-cial and aesthetic environment, which includes hous-ing, urban development, land use and transport. (3)EquityEquity in health implies that ideally everyoneshould have a fair opportunity to attain their fullhealth potential and, more pragmatically, that no oneshould be disadvantaged from achieving this po-tential, if it can be avoided. The term inequity . .. refers to differences in health which are notonly unnecessary and avoidable but, in addition, areconsidered unfair and unjust. (4)Health competenceIndividual competence to influ-ence factors determining health. (5)Health for all policyOn the occasion of the thirtiethsession of the Regional Committee for Europe atFez in 1980, representatives of Member States ofthe WHO European Region approved their first com-mon health policy, the European strategy for attain-ing health for all. The strategy called for a funda-mental change in countries' health developmentand outlined four main areas of concern: lifestylesand health; risk factors affecting health and theenvironment; reorientation of the health care sys-tem itself; and the political, management, techno-logical, manpower, research and other support nec-essary to bring about the desired changes in thosethree areas. In 1991, Member States approved theupdated health policy for Europe.221227 222Health for ali targets Health for all target A European (or national) healthfor all target is a goal towards which to strive in linewith the agreed European (or naional) health for allpolicy. It presupposes a political will to commit acountry's resources to the achievement of that goal.Health educationConsciously constructed oppor-tunities for learning which are designed to facilitatechanges in behaviour towards a pre-determined goal.(5)Health potentialThe fullest degree of health that anindividual can achieve. Health potential is deter-mined by caring for oneself and others, by beingable to make decisions and take control over one'slife, and by ensuring that the society in which onelives creates conditions that allow the attainment ofhealth by all its members.Health promotion The process of enabling individu-als and communities to increase control over thedeterminants of health and thereby improve theirhealth. (5) An evolving concept that encompassesfostering lifestyles and other social, economic, en-vironmental and personal factors conducive tohealth. (/)Healthy public policy An explicit concern for healthand equity in all areas of policy and an accountabil-ity for health impact. The main aim . .. is to createa supportive environment to enable people to leadhealthy lives. (6)Healthy sexualitySatisfying sexual relations underconditions that preclude contracting sexually trans-mitted diseases.Human ecology A holistic, integrative interpretationof those processes, products, orders and mediatingfactors that regulate natural and human ecosystemsat all scales of the earth's surface and atmosphere. Itimplies a systemic framework for the analysis andcomprehension of three logics and the interrelationsbetween their constituents using a temporal per-spective. These three logics are: a bio-logic, or organisms; an theorders inorganic constituents (e.g. water, air, soiland sun); a human-logic, or the ordering of cultural,societal and individual human factors. It i; sug-gested that this macro-system of three logics regu-lates the world. (7)ImpairmentIn the context of health experience .any loss or abnormality of psychological, physi-ological, or anatomical structure or function. (2)IndicatorsVariables that help to measure [changesin the health situation] directly or indirectly and toassess the extent to which the objectives and targetsof a programme are being attained. (1) For theregional health for all targets, both quantitative andqualitative indicators are used.Intersectoral actionAction in which the health sec-tor and other relevant sectors collaborate for theachievement of a common goal, the contributionsof the different sectors being closely coordinated.(/)Multisectoral actionFor practicalpurposesintersectoral action and multisectoral action aresynonymous terms, the former perhaps emphasiz-ing the element of coordination, the latter the con-tribution of a number of sectors. (/)ParasuicideAn act with nonfatal outcome, in whichan individual deliberately initiates a nonhabitualbehaviour that, without intervention by others, willcause self-harm, or ingests a substance in excess ofthe prescribed or generally recognized therapeuticdosage, and which is aimed at realizing changeswhich he/she desires via the actual or expectedphysical consequences. (8)Primary careThe first level of care, generally pro-vided in an ambulatory setting (as opposed to sec-ondary and tertiary care which would normally behospital-based).Primary health careEssential health care made ac-cessible at a cost the country and community canafford, with methods that are practical, scientifi-cally sound and socially acceptable. POmary healthcare is the central function and main focus of acountry's health system, the principal vehicle forthe delivery of health care, the most peripherallevel in a health system stretching from the periph-ery to the centre, and an integral part of the socialand economic development of a country. (/)Quality of careThe extent to which the care pro-vided, within a given economic framework, achievesthe most favourable outcome when balancing risksand benefits.Quaiity of lifeThe perception of individuals or groupsthat their needs are being satisfied and that they arenot being denied opportunities to achieve happinessand fulfilment. (5)2 28 Glossary223 Secondary careReferral services in the first instanceprovide secondary health care, which is of a morespecialized kind than can be offered at the mostperipheral level, for example radiographic diag-nosis, general surgery, care of women with complic-ations of pregnancy or childbirth, and diagnosis andtreatment of uncommon or severe diseases. Thiskind of care is provided by trained staff in suchinstitutions as district or provincial hospitals. (1)Social marginalizationThe process by which cer-tain vulnerable groups may be prevented from par-.ticipating fully in social, political and economiclife in a community. This occurs when the necess-ary intersectoral policies and support mechanismsare not in place to enable their full participation.Strategy A long-term considered and comprehen-sive couise of action that provides the frameworkfor individual activities and events.Supportive environmentsIn a health context ...both the physical and the social aspects of oursurroundings. It encompasses where people live,their local community, their home, where they workand play. It also embraces the framework whichdetermines access to resources for living, and op-portunities for empowerment. Thus action to createsupportive environments has many dimensions:physical, social, spiritual, economic and political.Each of these dimensions is inextricably linked tothe others in a dynamic interaction. (9)Tertiary careSpecialized care that requires highlyspecific facilities and the attention of highly spe-cialized health workers, for example, for neuro-surgery or heart surgery.
