Shionogi is trustworthy, unafraid of change and embracing of diversity, dauntless in spirit, and bold. These qualities allow the Company to meet the expectations of society and Transform itself to achieve our new Vision. As a corporate citizen, Shionogi is resolving social issues and helpingto create a more prosperous society. Shionogi will grow alongside all our stakeholders, while continuing to develop the Company's unique character through our operations based on this new Corporate Philosophy (of Heritage, Vision, and Values).Our Philosophy Our StakeholdersThe Company Policy of ShionogiShionogi's purpose Shionogi strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\u2014 Transformed Corporate Philosophy for the Group Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare For this purpose, Shionogi will need toShionogi's Purpose For this purpose, Shionogi will need to As a result, Shionogi people willShionogi strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.

We therefore gathered our next generation of leaders in 2018 to work together on the Oneness project to identify exactly what kind of company we want Shionogi to be in 2030 and beyond. After much discussion with the project members, we realized again that our corporate purpose is an eternal and unwavering philosophy. We defined our Company Policy as our Heritage, i.e. the foundationthat supports us in all our activities, and we then went on to formulate a new Vision and new Values for Shionogi. Shionogi is evolving from a conventional drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company to become a HaaS* company that provides healthcare services, aiming to provide solutions to patient problems and social issues. Based on this concept, we developed the Vision of Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare. The members of the Oneness project met multiple times over the course of more than a year to carefully consider what kind of company we want Shionogi to be. Keeping an open mind to all possibilities, we mulled over eachword through many rounds of discussion to arrive at our final resolution for the Vision and Values. After we had formulated the Vision and Values, Shionogi came together as a single global operation to communicate these concepts to all Group companies around the world. For example, at Shionogi Inc. in the US, all employees took part in a series of workshops that featured lively discussions on the topic of What Are Shionogi's Platforms? The Vision and Values are now reflected in the New Medium-Term Business Plan STS2030 as well as organizational and individual targets, showing how the Company is weaving them into our everyday work.*Healthcare as a Service: Provide a range of healthcare services in line with customer needs, rather than only providing pharmaceuticals.What we want to achieve by 2030 Our psyche that is indispensable for achieving visionVision Values HeritageThe Value System of the Shionogi Group 3 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 4 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionWe defined five Values that are key to achieving our Vision and describe how every employee needs to operate.

Shionogi is of service in the global battle against infectious diseases, from the first in-house product through to the present day After the discovery of penicillin, there were very few new treatments discovered for infectious diseases that were both ef fective and safe, and tuberculosis and pneumonia continued to top the rankings for cause of death at that time. Shionogi's management team decided that, given the importance of antibiotics, the Company should move into this field as a matter of priority. Shionogi then embarked on research and development in infectious diseases. The Company poured its energies into in-house research and was rewarded with the development of its first proprietary product, Sinomin, in 1959. Sinomin was out-licensed to the Swiss company Roche and was used around the world to treat infectious diseases.

The number of antibiotics launched on global markets peaked in the late 1980s before starting to decline. This trend was driven by many pharmaceutical companies deciding antibiotics lacked appeal as a market, due to high development risk and the lower drug prices and shorter treatment regimens compared with anticancers and other drug types. The decline was also exacerbated by the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To ensure doctors still have access to treatments ef fective against drug-resistant strains, the general consensus was that pharmaceutical companies should not pursue antibiotic sales growth. Drugmakers also found it dif ficult to formulate accurate production plans because of the significant regional variation in healthcare systems for AMR and the number of patients with drug-resistant infections.Adversity Shionogi continues to invest in R&D as part of the Company's social responsibilities The threat posed by infectious diseases and drug-resistant bacteria is an enormous social issue for mankind.

Whereas the original pipeline ratio*1 at most pharmaceutical companies is said to be 20-30%, we aspire to a ratio of 50-70%. At the end of March 2020, our original pipeline ratio was 67%. As a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we take pride in this high ratio as we think it is indicative of our strength in in-house drug discovery. If Shionogi is to grow in a sustainable manner as a member of society, the Company needs to constantly innovate to help solve social issues and deliver new value to customers and societies. Innovation involves tackling the problems faced by patients and societies head on and taking the right approach to find the best solution to these problems. At Shionogi, we will not compromise in our efforts to bring the benefits of our innovation to as many people as possible in a time-efficient manner. Shionogi's strength in research stems from our highly efficient SAR*2 engine for small-molecule drug discovery. The source of our competitiveness lies in the technological prowess of our teams in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as our experience in problem-solving via collaboration between the three teams. Through strong teamwork, we have been able to speedily and efficiently move through the SAR cycle. As a result, during the previous SGS2020 Medium-Term Business Plan, we launched five products originated in-house onto global markets, including the anti-HIV agent Tivicay (launched 2014) and the influenza drug Xofluza (launched 2018).

With our in-depth understanding of disease and of patient and societal perspectives, the value that Shionogi can offer is not limited to pharmacotherapy. Medicines are not necessarily the best solution for patients if other options can improve or remove symptoms. We also recognize the social pressure on companies to engage with disease prevention and early-stage care due to significant environmental changes, such as more health conscious societies, growing government-financed healthcare expenditure, and the global disruption from the pandemic. For these reasons, Shionogi is taking a broad view across a whole range of healthcare solutions and is working diligently to create new platforms to deliver new options, such as preventive vaccines using technology from Shionogi Group company UMN Pharma and a digital treatment app under development for ADHD.Focus on in-house drug discovery Shionogi's drug discovery capabilities lead to innovative new drugs Tackling the problems faced by patients and societies *3 CCR8: Chemokine (C-C motif) Receptor 8 *4 PDPS: Peptide Discovery Platform System*1 Proprietary compounds originated in-house as a percentage of the whole development pipeline (includes results of joint research with partners and development candidates) *2 SAR: Structure activity relationshipTheme for Fiscal 2019: Progress in peptide drug discovery Peptides do not readily pass through cell membranes because of their high molecular weight and chemical characteristics, so they can only be used to target extracellular molecules.

Drawing on compound libraries and other resources developed through many years of research, Shionogi has built a solid platform in infectious diseases drug discovery and has been able to generate a series of products and drug candidates in this field. As more and more pharmaceutical companies withdraw from R&D in the poorly profitable field of infectious disease, One of Shionogi's characteristics is its robust management that intensively pursues efficiency to achieve the targets. This robustness is developed through strong leadership training for all tiers of management. The CEO of the Company personally trains senior management candidates through the President's Management Seminar that was started in fiscal 2012. Each year, around ten candidates are selected to attend this program that runs roughly once a month for 12 months. The goal is to develop diverse human resources with a tenacious approach who can consider issues from a company-wide perspective and have good communication skills. Approximately one half of the current corporate officers and heads of the organization are graduates of this program. Shionogi also carries out a system of corporate officer rotation across the value chain. This system of experiencing management in a number of divisions was built to allow corporate officers to practice management not as the representative of one division but from a company-wide perspective. Senior management candidates take on roles as presidents, non-executive directors, and auditors of Group companies, where they gain management experience. The CEO personally confirms the content of discussions at Group companies and at the twice-yearly general meeting of shareholders and at business briefing events, the CEO and officers of Group companies engage in In fiscal 2020, Shionogi launched PJ KANAME, a new program for manager development, as part of the Company's measures to achieve the New Medium-Term Business Plan (STS2030). The new program is completely different from conventional management training and will be offered to all managers at Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and domestic Group companies. This major development program runs over a two-year period, during which trainees will continuously engage in a number of different assignments. Shionogi considers protecting people worldwide from the threat of infectious disease to be a pressing social issue. The Company is involved in a wide range of initiatives that go beyond the scope of R&D into therapeutic agents, including disease awareness programs, prevention, diagnostics, and methods to prevent conditions becoming serious. As well as progressing these initiatives to provide total care for infectious diseases, Shionogi is taking a global leadership role to manage the threat of infectious diseases, including efforts to ensure stable supplies and appropriate use of anti-infectives. Pages 17-20 and 45-50 of this report provide an overview of Shionogi's efforts in infectious diseases, including the Company's response to COVID-19.Long-term engagement in infectious diseases R&DBuilding up human resources to support highly efficient management New program for manager development Targeting total care for infectious diseasesExpertise built up over many years \u2014\u2014 Making most of strengths in pursuit of total careLeadership that supports growth \u2014\u2014 Developing human resources with problem-solving skills for the future3.

The CEO of the Company personally trains senior management candidates through the President's Management Seminar that was started in fiscal 2012. Each year, around ten candidates are selected to attend this program that runs roughly once a month for 12 months. The goal is to develop diverse human resources with a tenacious approach who can consider issues from a company-wide perspective and have good communication skills. Approximately one half of the current corporate officers and heads of the organization are graduates of this program. Shionogi also carries out a system of corporate officer rotation across the value chain. This system of experiencing management in a number of divisions was built to allow corporate officers to practice management not as the representative of one division but from a company-wide perspective. Senior management candidates take on roles as presidents, non-executive directors, and auditors of Group companies, where they gain management experience. The CEO personally confirms the content of discussions at Group companies and at the twice-yearly general meeting of shareholders and at business briefing events, the CEO and officers of Group companies engage in In fiscal 2020, Shionogi launched PJ KANAME, a new program for manager development, as part of the Company's measures to achieve the New Medium-Term Business Plan (STS2030). The new program is completely different from conventional management training and will be offered to all managers at Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and domestic Group companies. This major development program runs over a two-year period, during which trainees will continuously engage in a number of different assignments. Shionogi considers protecting people worldwide from the threat of infectious disease to be a pressing social issue. The Company is involved in a wide range of initiatives that go beyond the scope of R&D into therapeutic agents, including disease awareness programs, prevention, diagnostics, and methods to prevent conditions becoming serious. As well as progressing these initiatives to provide total care for infectious diseases, Shionogi is taking a global leadership role to manage the threat of infectious diseases, including efforts to ensure stable supplies and appropriate use of anti-infectives. Pages 17-20 and 45-50 of this report provide an overview of Shionogi's efforts in infectious diseases, including the Company's response to COVID-19.Long-term engagement in infectious diseases R&DBuilding up human resources to support highly efficient management New program for manager development Targeting total care for infectious diseasesExpertise built up over many years \u2014\u2014 Making most of strengths in pursuit of total careLeadership that supports growth \u2014\u2014 Developing human resources with problem-solving skills for the future3.

As a leading company in infectious diseases, we aim to achieve a portfolio of solutions that provide \"total care\" for various infectious diseases caused by a wide range of pathogens. A global race is underway to develop vaccines to control the novel coronavirus through immunization programs. Shionogi is working with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and Kyushu University on R&D into a recombinant protein vaccine comprising the viral S protein as the antigen, based on a technology from UMN Pharma, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Shionogi in fiscal 2019. This technology has already been used for a number of products, including vaccines against influenza, and they can be manufactured in large quantities, quickly, and at low cost. Shionogi aims to start clinical trials by end-2020 and is already building vaccine manufacturing facilities in Japan, funded by grants from various government ministries and agencies, to be able to quickly supply a large number of doses once a vaccine is successfully developed. The goal is to have built a supply system by the end of fiscal 2020 and be in a position to provide doses for 30 million people by end-2021.The pharmaceutical industry in particular is under significant pressure to develop treatments and vaccines as fast as possible to counter the spread of infections with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). While Shionogi continues to ensure the stable supply of pharmaceuticals and business continuity, as a pharmaceutical company with a major focus on infectious diseases, we are also working with public institutions, academia, and partner companies to prioritize R&D into novel therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic products for COVID-19.

The Company discovered cefiderocol, the first ever siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic, and launched this drug in the US in February 2020 (see page 47 for more details). Fetroja (cefiderocol) could be a powerful weapon in the fight to save the lives of patients with infections for which there are currently no treatment options.

To engineer a return to growth, our current business model\u2014discovering, manufacturing, and marketing (detailing) pharmaceuticals\u2014will not be enough. As advances in information infrastructure drive a diversification of needs in our customer base (patients and healthcare professionals), one of our four key stakeholder groups, we need to increase customer satisfaction by playing an active role in the full range of healthcare services, from pre-symptomatic and preventive care to diagnosis, treatment, and convalescence. We have described this concept as the creation of new \"healthcare platforms.\" The next-generation Shionogi will forge alliances with a range of partners and work to build these new platforms, with the goal of becoming an indispensable player across the healthcare field. To achieve this, we must cultivate our original strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company and develop a distinctive and unrivaled presence in the pharmaceutical industry such that companies with dif ferent capabilities and from different industries are highly motivated to collaborate with us. The transformation we are planning will be faster and greater than anything Shionogi has experienced before and will represent a qualitative evolution of our business. I believe from the bottom of my heart that transformation means continued change, in an environment that is also continually changing, and that maintaining the status quo actually represents going backwards. We are absolutely determined to continue evolving and will fight to realize our vision. As we approach the start of a new business plan, it is important to take stock of where Shionogi is today, before we embark on our transformation. In the Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020) plan, which we initiated in April 2014 and which was updated in October 2016, we had the vision to \"grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" In pursuit of this vision, we worked to address social issues and especially to help protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases, by launching a series of in-house-discovered products into global markets, including Symproic, Mulpleta, In June 2020, we formulated our New Plan\u2014S hionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 ( STS2030) strategy to achieve our 2030 Vision of \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare.\" Under the key word, \"Transformation,\" for STS2030, we are transforming our business and defining strategies to achieve further growth. Throughout its 142-year history, Shionogi has undergone innovative changes time and again to respond to shifting patterns of disease and dif fering demands in dif ferent eras. One of the major turning points in our history was the first Medium-Term Business Plan, launched in fiscal 2000, when we transformed our business focus. We implemented a major business restructuring, as a result of which sales reduced by half, temporarily. However, we succeeded in divesting businesses that were too small to have meaningful future growth prospects (animal health products, agrochemical, industrial chemicals, clinical laboratory testing, and drug wholesaling), in order to fully focus on our pharmaceutical business. For the next 20 years or so, we were able to achieve more substantial growth, driven by innovation generated from our focused ef forts on the pharmaceutical business. On the other hand, however, many people had to leave Shionogi during that transition. We must never forget that the Shionogi of today was born out of such pain. In this time of unparalleled change, both in the external environment and in the priorities of society, as a company, we and the anti-infectives Xofluza and cefiderocol. We maintained our original pipeline ratio at over 60%, as befitting a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, and proactively used alliances to acquire technologies and other resources. As a result, we were able to foster our next-generation growth drivers to overcome the patent clif f in our HIV portfolio, starting with eight core pipeline projects with the potential to achieve a paradigm shift of disease treatment. We have steadily increased our ability to compete on the world stage through our drug-discovery capabilities, including the discovery of peptide, nucleic acid, and antibody drugs, and a move into the vaccine business. Although our annual R&D budget is only around \u00a550 billion, we are leveraging our resources across multiple core projects to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics to fight the global threat posed by COVID-19. I believe that our R&D is uniquely positioned in global terms, and that we can compete on the world stage with our drug-discovery capabilities and our ability to conduct R&D with flexibility and clear prioritization. Moreover, during SGS2020, it became clearer that Shionogi's ef ficient management is another strength. During a period of solid growth in global sales of the HIV drug Tivicay (dolutegravir) and its combination products, with our licensing partner ViiV Healthcare Ltd., Shionogi prioritized management efficiency and improved our cost management capabilities. As a result, we achieved our targets for ordinary income, return on invested capital (ROIC), and return on equity (ROE) in fiscal 2020, ahead of plan. However, I regret to say that we failed our shareholders with our results in fiscal 2019, the final year of SGS2020. Not only did our run of all-time-high consolidated earnings come to an end, but we also missed net sales and other profit targets for the first time in eight years. The issues clearly arose from gaps in the growth of new products, the growth of overseas businesses, and in per-employee productivity. We recognize as valid the criticism that the Group as a whole lost its sense of urgency due to the steady progress made in profits, ROE, and other key performance indicators (KPI). After reflecting on the results in fiscal 2019, we considered whether to continue SGS2020 through to fiscal 2020 as originally planned. However, this time of dramatic change, coupled with the evolution of information technologies, has led to a dramatic increase in the critical value of time. In light of this, we felt it was vital to change our behavior as soon as possible and to implement transformation, and yield its results, in the eight short years left before the patent clif f in our HIV portfolio. We therefore made the decision to finish SGS2020 one year earlier than planned, and to formulate and announce our new STS2030.Decisive business transformation to ensure sustainable growth Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. President and CEO2030 Vision Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare As the Shionogi family we promise to: Imagine new ways to deliver innovation, and catalyze the formation of new healthcare platforms Create innovative products and deliver them worldwide compliantly with high quality at a fair price Embrace social responsibility and contribute to longer, healthier lives everywhereTargeting long-term growth: Next transformation will build the new Shionogi Shionogi's current position: Looking back at the previous Medium-Term Business PlanMessage from the President 22 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 21 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data Sectionare also facing a dif ficult period of patent expiries in our HIV portfolio around 2028 (a so-called \"patent clif f\").

To engineer a return to growth, our current business model\u2014discovering, manufacturing, and marketing (detailing) pharmaceuticals\u2014will not be enough. As advances in information infrastructure drive a diversification of needs in our customer base (patients and healthcare professionals), one of our four key stakeholder groups, we need to increase customer satisfaction by playing an active role in the full range of healthcare services, from pre-symptomatic and preventive care to diagnosis, treatment, and convalescence. We have described this concept as the creation of new \"healthcare platforms.\" The next-generation Shionogi will forge alliances with a range of partners and work to build these new platforms, with the goal of becoming an indispensable player across the healthcare field. To achieve this, we must cultivate our original strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company and develop a distinctive and unrivaled presence in the pharmaceutical industry such that companies with dif ferent capabilities and from different industries are highly motivated to collaborate with us. The transformation we are planning will be faster and greater than anything Shionogi has experienced before and will represent a qualitative evolution of our business. I believe from the bottom of my heart that transformation means continued change, in an environment that is also continually changing, and that maintaining the status quo actually represents going backwards. We are absolutely determined to continue evolving and will fight to realize our vision. As we approach the start of a new business plan, it is important to take stock of where Shionogi is today, before we embark on our transformation. In the Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020) plan, which we initiated in April 2014 and which was updated in October 2016, we had the vision to \"grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" In pursuit of this vision, we worked to address social issues and especially to help protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases, by launching a series of in-house-discovered products into global markets, including Symproic, Mulpleta, At the start of the new STS2030 growth strategy, the first priority is to immediately resolve the pending issues noted above and make strong progress towards building the new business model required to prepare for the HIV portfolio patent clif f. We have positioned the first five years of STS2030 (fiscal 2020-24) as Phase 1, during which we will execute this transformation. (See pages 27-42 for more details on STS2030.) When formulating STS2030, we recognized the critical changes in the healthcare and societal environment that we need to respond to, as well as our specific challenge to overcome our impending patent clif f, and also defined the enterprise value that is our target for the future. Based on this, we communicated with our stakeholders regarding what we needed to become (vision) and how we should ef fect this change (strategy). The pace of change in society overall has accelerated in recent years. COVID-19 has brought about enormous shifts in our lifestyles and social values in a short period of time. Beyond the obvious example of COVID-19, however, other major developments, requiring our attention and response, were already underway, such as the astonishing progress made in AI technologies and changes in the global balance of power. Looking ahead, I think that data will play an increasingly important role in society, for example, by allowing every individual ready access to all types of medical information. It is easy to imagine that this may lead to more sophisticated, personalized, and diversified healthcare needs, accompanied by the accelerated entry into this marketplace of companies from other industries. The question is whether Shionogi is capable of responding to these changes and is capable of changing itself. The basic model of the pharmaceutical business today involves generating profits from innovation over a fixed period, based on patents (broadly speaking, intellectual property) in mature markets like the US, Europe, and Japan, and then reinvesting these profits to generate further innovation. At present, Shionogi primarily engages in this current model. This is because, to make progress in healthcare, we need to maintain a continuous cycle of innovation, and the returns need to be high to compensate for the high risks involved. From the perspective of a single company, however, it is a constant and dif ficult battle to overcome the next patent clif f. In addition, from the standpoint of sustainability of the pharmaceutical business in the broader context of societal priorities, it is becoming increasingly important to balance the appropriate amounts to be paid for innovation with the need to control the total amount of healthcare spending required to maintain social welfare. Against this backdrop, Shionogi will evolve from a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company (one that mostly discovers, develops, and supplies prescription drugs) into a HaaS*4 company that provides a much wider range of healthcare products, increasingly integrated into more complete services. Our goal is to continuously supply new value to society at acceptable cost and thus to make our business more sustainable and to provide more comprehensive solutions to the needs of patients and society. As we set out in this new direction, we also need to transform our business models in order to grow. As mentioned earlier, our current business model is primarily based on patent-based royalties. One of the models we aim to expand in the future is selling pharmaceuticals through our own channels. We will ramp up our ability to generate income ourselves, particularly in Japan, the US, and China. Another business model is the provision of products/services other than prescription pharmaceuticals; this is a model that does not rely on patents. As well as expanding our OTC drug, vaccine, and contract manufacturing businesses, we also aim to launch new businesses to deliver new healthcare services. One of the most important themes in STS2030 is achieving a smooth transformation of our business model, where we will grow by balancing our own sales capabilities with sales through alliance partners, and by In June 2020, we formulated our New Medium-Term Business Plan\u2014S hionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 ( STS2030) strategy to achieve our 2030 Vision of \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare.\" Under the key word, \"Transformation,\" for STS2030, we are transforming our business and defining strategies to achieve further growth. Throughout its 142-year history, Shionogi has undergone innovative changes time and again to respond to shifting patterns of disease and dif fering demands in dif ferent eras. One of the major turning points in our history was the first Medium-Term Business Plan, launched in fiscal 2000, when we transformed our business focus. We implemented a major business restructuring, as a result of which sales reduced by half, temporarily. However, we succeeded in divesting businesses that were too small to have meaningful future growth prospects (animal health products, agrochemical, industrial chemicals, clinical laboratory testing, and drug wholesaling), in order to fully focus on our pharmaceutical business. For the next 20 years or so, we were able to achieve more substantial growth, driven by innovation generated from our focused ef forts on the pharmaceutical business. On the other hand, however, many people had to leave Shionogi during that transition. We must never forget that the Shionogi of today was born out of such pain. In this time of unparalleled change, both in the external environment and in the priorities of society, as a company, we and the anti-infectives Xofluza and cefiderocol. We maintained our original pipeline ratio at over 60%, as befitting a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, and proactively used alliances to acquire technologies and other resources. As a result, we were able to foster our next-generation growth drivers to overcome the patent clif f in our HIV portfolio, starting with eight core pipeline projects with the potential to achieve a paradigm shift of disease treatment. We have steadily increased our ability to compete on the world stage through our drug-discovery capabilities, including the discovery of peptide, nucleic acid, and antibody drugs, and a move into the vaccine business. Although our annual R&D budget is only around \u00a550 billion, we are leveraging our resources across multiple core projects to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics to fight the global threat posed by COVID-19. I believe that our R&D is uniquely positioned in global terms, and that we can compete on the world stage with our drug-discovery capabilities and our ability to conduct R&D with flexibility and clear prioritization. Moreover, during SGS2020, it became clearer that Shionogi's ef ficient management is another strength. During a period of solid growth in global sales of the HIV drug Tivicay (dolutegravir) and its combination products, with our licensing partner ViiV Healthcare Ltd., Shionogi prioritized management efficiency and improved our cost management capabilities. As a result, we achieved our targets for ordinary income, return on invested capital (ROIC), and return on equity (ROE) in fiscal 2020, ahead of plan. However, I regret to say that we failed our shareholders with our results in fiscal 2019, the final year of SGS2020. Not only did our run of all-time-high consolidated earnings come to an end, but we also missed net sales and other profit targets for the first time in eight years. The issues clearly arose from gaps in the growth of new products, the growth of overseas businesses, and in per-employee productivity. We recognize as valid the criticism that the Group as a whole lost its sense of urgency due to the steady progress made in profits, ROE, and other key performance indicators (KPI). After reflecting on the results in fiscal 2019, we considered whether to continue SGS2020 through to fiscal 2020 as originally planned. However, this time of dramatic change, coupled with the evolution of information technologies, has led to a dramatic increase in the critical value of time. In light of this, we felt it was vital to change our behavior as soon as possible and to implement transformation, and yield its results, in the eight short years left before the patent clif f in our HIV portfolio. We therefore made the decision to finish SGS2020 one year earlier than planned, and to formulate and announce our new STS2030. *4 Healthcare as a Service: Provide a range of healthcare services in line with customer needs, rather than only supplying pharmaceuticals.Text in red shows FY2020 targets already met *1 From updates to SGS2020 issued on October 31, 2016 *2 Return on invested capital = After-tax operating income \u00f7 (Interest bearing debt + Shareholders' equity + Non-controlling interests) \u00d7 100 (%) *3 Cash Conversion CycleKPI achievement in SGS2020 Collaborate with a wide range of partners to create new added value and provide solutions to the issues faced by patients and society Enhance our strengths built up through the discovery of prescription drugs and leverage those strengths to form the core of partnershipsDirection for the new ShionogiCommitment to STS2030: Providing healthcare services Continue to cultivate our original strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, develop a presence such that companies with dif ferent capabilities and from different industries hope to partner with us, build new platforms in healthcare, and deliver new value to society as a HaaS company.Target direction for ShionogiProviding value through healthcare servicesHealthcare as a ServiceHaaS companyFuture Shionogi Transform Healthcare and social needs to be more sophisticated and personalized Promotion of technology innovation and data utilization Need for more sustainable social welfare Shift to the new era where patients will make healthcare choices from a range of solutions/information availableOld Shionogi Supply prescription drugs as a discovery-based pharmaceutical billion \u00a5150.0 billion Over 13.5% Less than months Over 50% Over 15.0% Over 4.0%Shareholder returnEfficiencyGrowth potentialSales of new products*1 Ordinary CCC*3 pipeline ratio ROE DOEFY2020 target (SGS2020 update in 2016)FY2019 results (JGAAP)balancing businesses that utilize patents with businesses not dependent on patents that nevertheless utilize our strengths.

Our human resources are the key factor that will allow Shionogi to transform for our future growth and the achievement of our STS2030 plan. The only way for Shionogi to survive in this challenging world, competing with a mix of dif ferent industries, is for every single member of the Shionogi family, including executives, to maximize their talents, exhibit their individuality, and combine their expertise to enhance our strengths. As well as expanding training programs for individual employees that produce tangible results, we will also improve our management training to produce line managers who support employee growth, understand their responsibilities and the need to develop their teams, and are capable of leading the way to the best outcomes for the organization.Message from the President 23 24 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data Sectionare also facing a dif ficult period of patent expiries in our HIV portfolio around 2028 (a so-called \"patent clif f\").

Optimally balancing their needs is crucial to increasing corporate value. The ethos of our management approach is to ensure balanced relationships with our stakeholder groups while responding flexibly to any changes in their interests and needs. Over the 142 years since the founding of Shionogi, we have been through several difficult periods, as have other companies, but by maintaining balanced relationships with these four groups, we have enjoyed the support of our stakeholders even when business was bad, allowing us to grow into the company we are today. Fiscal 2020 brings the retirement of all the outside directors appointed when the outside director system was introduced (fiscal 2009), so in one sense we are entering the second generation of our system of governance. In order to enhance our management further and promote diversity, we have nominated an outside director to act as chairperson of the Board of Directors, appointed female directors to two of the five positions, and ensured the Board is made up of directors with a diverse skill set and balanced age range, from their 40s to 70s. We are working to evolve our corporate governance and management even further, welcoming a greater diversity of views and opinions from the outside directors, including globally experienced or digital native concepts, and fostering lively discussions. Our shareholder return policy is designed to maximize corporate value while balancing investment in growth and to share the benefits of medium- to long-term profit growth with shareholders. We will continue to promote this policy. Earnings may fluctuate from year to year, but we realize that Shionogi is in a period of sustained growth. We have increased our dividend for eight consecutive fiscal years, and look to continue this trend for as long as we can. We are also monitoring market conditions so we can be flexible on shareholder returns, including share buybacks, retirement of treasury stock, and unwinding of cross-shareholdings, and are working to improve capital At the start of the new STS2030 growth strategy, the first priority is to immediately resolve the pending issues noted above and make strong progress towards building the new business model required to prepare for the HIV portfolio patent clif f.

In fiscal 2019, Shionogi signed the United Nations Global Compact, that comprises ten principles relating to human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. We support and practice the concepts in the UN Global Compact and accept our responsibilities as a global citizen. In order to respond to global societal needs, we have incorporated a broader range of issues explicitly into our corporate priorities, and set new non-financial targets. One of the most pressing global issues remains freeing people from the threat of infectious diseases, and we are working on measures to address the big three infectious diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria), AMR*6, and viral infections. The advent of the new coronavirus and the subsequent social disruption and global-scale threat is an opportunity for us to re-emphasize, and to demonstrate, how Shionogi's long-term ef forts to address infectious diseases can contribute to achievement of SDGs and how much these initiatives are needed by the society. We are bringing together resources from across the Company to help address the social problems caused by COVID-19, prioritizing the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics in order to help societies restore safety and confidence by bringing this pandemic to an end as soon as possible. For the other material issues, we will responsibly address and step up our response to various environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, thereby contributing to the creation of sustainable societies and driving the company's growth. Based on that approach, Shionogi will make a concerted ef fort to be a relevant company for all stakeholder groups well into the future.efficiency. In light of the above, we added earnings per share (EPS) to the previous targets of dividend on equity (DOE) and return on equity (ROE) as our indicators for shareholder returns under STS2030. As a HaaS company, Shionogi will continue to follow our basic policy, \"striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine (healthcare solutions) to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" Through this, we aim to grow alongside a developing society. Toward the goal of our 2030 Vision: \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare,\" I would like to declare right here that no Shionogi director or employee should fear change; instead we should welcome diversity and transform Shionogi so we are not bound by preconceived ideas.

Our human resources are the key factor that will allow Shionogi to transform for our future growth and the achievement of our STS2030 plan. The only way for Shionogi to survive in this challenging world, competing with a mix of dif ferent industries, is for every single member of the Shionogi family, including executives, to maximize their talents, exhibit their individuality, and combine their expertise to enhance our strengths. As well as expanding training programs for individual employees that produce tangible results, we will also improve our management training to produce line managers who support employee growth, understand their responsibilities and the need to develop their teams, and are capable of leading the way to the best outcomes for the organization.Areas to strengthen Areas to strengthen Current identity A final word Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. President and CEOMessage from the President 25 26 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionShionogi fully understands that it relies heavily on four main stakeholder groups, namely, shareholders and investors, customers, society, and employees. Optimally balancing their needs is crucial to increasing corporate value. The ethos of our management approach is to ensure balanced relationships with our stakeholder groups while responding flexibly to any changes in their interests and needs. Over the 142 years since the founding of Shionogi, we have been through several difficult periods, as have other companies, but by maintaining balanced relationships with these four groups, we have enjoyed the support of our stakeholders even when business was bad, allowing us to grow into the company we are today. Fiscal 2020 brings the retirement of all the outside directors appointed when the outside director system was introduced (fiscal 2009), so in one sense we are entering the second generation of our system of governance. In order to enhance our management further and promote diversity, we have nominated an outside director to act as chairperson of the Board of Directors, appointed female directors to two of the five positions, and ensured the Board is made up of directors with a diverse skill set and balanced age range, from their 40s to 70s. We are working to evolve our corporate governance and management even further, welcoming a greater diversity of views and opinions from the outside directors, including globally experienced or digital native concepts, and fostering lively discussions. Our shareholder return policy is designed to maximize corporate value while balancing investment in growth and to share the benefits of medium- to long-term profit growth with shareholders. We will continue to promote this policy. Earnings may fluctuate from year to year, but we realize that Shionogi is in a period of sustained growth. We have increased our dividend for eight consecutive fiscal years, and look to continue this trend for as long as we can. We are also monitoring market conditions so we can be flexible on shareholder returns, including share buybacks, retirement of treasury stock, and unwinding of cross-shareholdings, and are working to improve capital At the start of the new STS2030 growth strategy, the first priority is to immediately resolve the pending issues noted above and make strong progress towards building the new business model required to prepare for the HIV portfolio patent clif f. We have positioned the first five years of STS2030 (fiscal 2020-24) as Phase 1, during which we will execute this transformation. (See pages 27-42 for more details on STS2030.) When formulating STS2030, we recognized the critical changes in the healthcare and societal environment that we need to respond to, as well as our specific challenge to overcome our impending patent clif f, and also defined the enterprise value that is our target for the future. Based on this, we communicated with our stakeholders regarding what we needed to become (vision) and how we should ef fect this change (strategy). The pace of change in society overall has accelerated in recent years. COVID-19 has brought about enormous shifts in our lifestyles and social values in a short period of time. Beyond the obvious example of COVID-19, however, other major developments, requiring our attention and response, were already underway, such as the astonishing progress made in AI technologies and changes in the global balance of power. Looking ahead, I think that data will play an increasingly important role in society, for example, by allowing every individual ready access to all types of medical information. It is easy to imagine that this may lead to more sophisticated, personalized, and diversified healthcare needs, accompanied by the accelerated entry into this marketplace of companies from other industries. The question is whether Shionogi is capable of responding to these changes and is capable of changing itself. The basic model of the pharmaceutical business today involves generating profits from innovation over a fixed period, based on patents (broadly speaking, intellectual property) in mature markets like the US, Europe, and Japan, and then reinvesting these profits to generate further innovation. At present, Shionogi primarily engages in this current model. This is because, to make progress in healthcare, we need to maintain a continuous cycle of innovation, and the returns need to be high to compensate for the high risks involved. From the perspective of a single company, however, it is a constant and dif ficult battle to overcome the next patent clif f. In addition, from the standpoint of sustainability of the pharmaceutical business in the broader context of societal priorities, it is becoming increasingly important to balance the appropriate amounts to be paid for innovation with the need to control the total amount of healthcare spending required to maintain social welfare. Against this backdrop, Shionogi will evolve from a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company (one that mostly discovers, develops, and supplies prescription drugs) into a HaaS*4 company that provides a much wider range of healthcare products, increasingly integrated into more complete services. Our goal is to continuously supply new value to society at acceptable cost and thus to make our business more sustainable and to provide more comprehensive solutions to the needs of patients and society. As we set out in this new direction, we also need to transform our business models in order to grow. As mentioned earlier, our current business model is primarily based on patent-based royalties. One of the models we aim to expand in the future is selling pharmaceuticals through our own channels. We will ramp up our ability to generate income ourselves, particularly in Japan, the US, and China. Another business model is the provision of products/services other than prescription pharmaceuticals; this is a model that does not rely on patents. As well as expanding our OTC drug, vaccine, and contract manufacturing businesses, we also aim to launch new businesses to deliver new healthcare services. One of the most important themes in STS2030 is achieving a smooth transformation of our business model, where we will grow by balancing our own sales capabilities with sales through alliance partners, and by Strengthen corporate governance: Entering the second generation of our system of governance Sharing the benefits of growth with shareholders *6 Antimicrobial resistance*5 CDMO: Contract Development and Manufacturing OrganizationSTS2030\u2014Changing business models to achieve growth To create a sustainable society By working to resolve social issues through our business activities, Shionogi will help society to become more sustainable and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while continuing to grow as a company. In fiscal 2019, Shionogi signed the United Nations Global Compact, that comprises ten principles relating to human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. We support and practice the concepts in the UN Global Compact and accept our responsibilities as a global citizen. In order to respond to global societal needs, we have incorporated a broader range of issues explicitly into our corporate priorities, and set new non-financial targets. One of the most pressing global issues remains freeing people from the threat of infectious diseases, and we are working on measures to address the big three infectious diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria), AMR*6, and viral infections. The advent of the new coronavirus and the subsequent social disruption and global-scale threat is an opportunity for us to re-emphasize, and to demonstrate, how Shionogi's long-term ef forts to address infectious diseases can contribute to achievement of SDGs and how much these initiatives are needed by the society. We are bringing together resources from across the Company to help address the social problems caused by COVID-19, prioritizing the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics in order to help societies restore safety and confidence by bringing this pandemic to an end as soon as possible. For the other material issues, we will responsibly address and step up our response to various environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, thereby contributing to the creation of sustainable societies and driving the company's growth. Based on that approach, Shionogi will make a concerted ef fort to be a relevant company for all stakeholder groups well into the future.efficiency. In light of the above, we added earnings per share (EPS) to the previous targets of dividend on equity (DOE) and return on equity (ROE) as our indicators for shareholder returns under STS2030. As a HaaS company, Shionogi will continue to follow our basic policy, \"striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine (healthcare solutions) to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" Through this, we aim to grow alongside a developing society. Toward the goal of our 2030 Vision: \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare,\" I would like to declare right here that no Shionogi director or employee should fear change; instead we should welcome diversity and transform Shionogi so we are not bound by preconceived ideas. In this way, we will work to address ESG issues through our operations and contribute to the development of more sustainable societies.Own sales business Sales of pharmaceuticals through our own channels (Japan, US, China)Products/services other than medicinal drugs Foundation in pharmaceutical alliances \u2014royalty business (current earnings pillar) Alliance businessPharmaceutical patent business model Diverse business models that leverage our strengthsNew platform businessOTC CDMO*5Vaccines balancing businesses that utilize patents with businesses not dependent on patents that nevertheless utilize our strengths.

We will use DOE to determine dividend levels and EPS to define shareholder returns including share buybacks, and will implement shareholder returns that are balanced with investment in growth using internal reserves.Financial policy under the New Medium-Term Business Plan (STS2030) Q: Can you describe how you set KPIs? We think that ROE is the indicator to use when making commitments on capital ef ficiency to external stakeholders. We have managed the business with a view to improving ROE since 2000. Under the previous Medium-Term Business Plan, however, we broke ROE down so the indicator was more closely coupled with individual employee work, and we used return on invested capital (ROIC) as the target at the operational level. This provided a more widespread understanding of how we should make operating profit margin and the capital turnover ratio more ef ficient. Having achieved an understanding of ROIC internally and a certain level of awareness of capital costs, we dropped ROIC as an external KPI in STS2030, but internally we are still managing the business with the aim of improving capital ef ficiency based on this ROIC concept. From fiscal 2020, management will continue to use ROIC trees to get an understanding of the overall picture, while those involved in business execution will set key goal indicators (KGIs) as numeric targets for the departments responsible and will adopt a \"KGI tree\" formula to link KGIs to action indicator KPIs. As a result, we still get an overview of the full picture and can ensure there are no omissions or duplications, as with an ROIC tree, but we also improve usability in the workplace and promote capital ef ficient management using ROIC. Management that takes capital costs into account Q: Can you detail your strategy and initiatives to improve capital ef ficiency?The first objective behind the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to develop more global internal governance systems as overseas sales start to account for a higher percentage of the whole. By unifying accounting standards across the Company, we will better align financial reporting processes and make financial analysis and actions based on this analysis faster to complete. The second objective is to promote rigorous economic decision-making and better capital ef ficiency internally. We need to have more accurate forecasts on future cash flow from assets to achieve this. Therefore, we have built an organization to ensure constantly optimized capital allocation. Under this structure, each drug candidate and product is evaluated by the Integrated Disease Care Division and Corporate Strategy Division, so the value of each candidate or product is analyzed dispassionately.Accounting standards Q: What is the purpose of changing to IFRS and what impact has this had?In terms of business investment, we have proposed investing \u00a5500 billion in overseas businesses and new business start-ups by fiscal 2024, the final year of STS Phase 1 , and are researching and analyzing a number of investment projects. We are considering investments to acquire sales networks or product portfolios and pipelines that meet more customers' needs, so that we can strengthen our sales capabilities overseas, particularly in the United States and China. In Japan, we aim to enhance our product portfolio based on the disease strategy and, at the same time, review the scale of our infrastructure, with the goal of improving productivity. For both overseas and domestic investment, we will mainly look at the core therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and CNS/pain disorders and build competitive sales structures in each region. We will also build new capabilities, particularly in digital applications, in order to grow as a HaaS company.

There is an enormous difference between improving treatment quality for the main disease symptoms versus improving treatment quality for most symptoms including peripheral ones associated with the disease. For COVID-19, convenient diagnostics and ef fective vaccines are needed, but vaccines are unlikely to prevent infections completely, so therapeutics are also needed. Antivirals may improve clinical symptoms by eliminating or reducing the viral pathogen. On top of this, when the immune cells release cytokines to attack the virus, uncontrolled cytokine release can result in a \"cytokine storm\" that causes symptoms to become more severe and prolonged. This is a huge problem from a clinical perspective. Doctors also face the issue of managing superinfections in intubated patients. To deliver value relevant to all aspects of COVID-19, we need to look at more than just ef fective antivirals. We also need pharmaceuticals that control COVID-19 severity and treat superinfections. Other elements to factor in include rapid diagnostics and preventive agents, as well as mechanisms for the provision of appropriate information. Shionogi is already working on programs against COVID-19 (see page 17 for more details), providing information and R&D into antivirals and various other products. This has been driven by discussions on delivering value that is patient-centric and addresses all aspects of the disease. We are looking to step up our ef forts to of fer total care, including solutions for the wide range of problems that accompany diseases. Creating patient-centric value To implement this disease strategy, Shionogi needs systems to ensure the delivery of consistent value from the R&D stages onwards. Furthermore, the Disease Care Strategy, Medical Affairs, CSR, and other departments, which are responsible for creating value through communication with patients and stakeholders supporting patients after product launch, need to work together, discussing the value delivered. To achieve this, Shionogi established the Integrated Disease Care Division, bringing together functions from a number of dif ferent divisions, with the goal of creating a solid organizational structure to effectively deliver the required products and information to more patients that really need them.Establishment of the Integrated Disease Care DivisionShionogi proposed a disease strategy concept in STS2030 to spell out this idea of patient-centric total care. When thinking about delivering value to patients, we need to consider the entire process along the \"patient journey,\" starting with the discovery of symptoms and disease through to treatment in hospital and the daily experience in terms of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Based on these considerations the disease strategy comprises two key elements. The first element involves bringing together a portfolio of key products and services that deliver value to the patient, with reference to how the patient behaves and what thought processes they go through, as well as what types of feelings they experience, during the journey from the presymptomatic and prevention stages to diagnosis and treatment. Examples that illustrate this point well include providing products and services for diagnosis and prevention, and programs to provide information. The second element is to enhance treatment options, as discussed before. With the example of infectious disease, the idea is for Shionogi to make a real contribution to the patient's treatment by bringing together a range of solutions to alleviate the symptoms caused by the disease and manage superinfections or secondary conditions that may emerge. A key feature with this concept is to consider an integrated strategy to deliver maximum value to patients, rather than simply maximizing sales of our own products. We aim to provide proprietary products plus supporting programs to promote proper drug use and make sure our products are prescribed to those patients that really need them, as well as enhanced follow-up through greater use of DX and other solutions. The idea is that economic growth will flow through as a natural consequence of these initiatives.

The first element involves bringing together a portfolio of key products and services that deliver value to the patient, with reference to how the patient behaves and what thought processes they go through, as well as what types of feelings they experience, during the journey from the presymptomatic and prevention stages to diagnosis and treatment. Examples that illustrate this point well include providing products and services for diagnosis and prevention, and programs to provide information. The second element is to enhance treatment options, as discussed before. With the example of infectious disease, the idea is for Shionogi to make a real contribution to the patient's treatment by bringing together a range of solutions to alleviate the symptoms caused by the disease and manage superinfections or secondary conditions that may emerge. A key feature with this concept is to consider an integrated strategy to deliver maximum value to patients, rather than simply maximizing sales of our own products. We aim to provide proprietary products plus supporting programs to promote proper drug use and make sure our products are prescribed to those patients that really need them, as well as enhanced follow-up through greater use of DX and other solutions. The idea is that economic growth will flow through as a natural consequence of these initiatives.

Shionogi is creating medicines with maximized product value, but sometimes the products delivered do not fully meet patient needs. Although Shionogi talks about customer focus, business perspectives may dictate the value delivered. To achieve Shionogi's Vision, the Global Development Division recognizes the need to better understand value from the patient's perspective. The Division aims to develop products that embody this value through agile and targeted global operations.The Pharmaceutical Research Division is being restructured to better position the Company to achieve its Vision. One of the changes involves giving consideration to a business exit strategy at the research stages, instead of researchers expecting other departments to handle the end stages of the lifecycle as long as they create good products. Under STS2030, as well as stepping up drug discovery, Shionogi also needs to create new businesses and platforms. The Company has therefore set up two new pioneering departments, the Laboratory for Advanced Medicine Research and the Laboratory for Innovative Therapy Research. This organizational restructuring and personnel reassignment merely open the door to potential change. It is the researchers themselves that will breathe new life into their work and transform the organization. As Shionogi becomes a HaaS company, our researchers are expected to think through social and patient problems even more, working proactively and with conviction to deliver solutions. The Division is therefore reshaping the organizational landscape to draw out our researchers' passion for their work as they take on new challenges.To maximize product value, as well as taking a patient-centric approach, the Pharmaceutical Research and Integrated Disease Care Divisions must be involved from the early stages in scientific discussions with specialists in Japan and overseas before any development plans are drafted. Novel compounds are increasingly difficult to develop. Rather than searching for multiple compounds, it may be better to investigate the use of one compound in multiple applications. The Global Development Division has worked out a development strategy to run parallel clinical studies (PoC trials) on multiple diseases to determine at an early stage which diseases may be a suitable target, given the profile of that particular compound. When S-600918 was originated in-house, chronic cough was the original development target. The mechanism of action showed potential effects for sleep apnea, so studies for this target indication were initiated as well. Another example is redasemtide. The compound was being developed for epidermolysis bullosa and stroke, but evidence emerged suggesting potential effects in knee osteoarthritis and chronic Shionogi's strengths still lie in drug discovery. The Company maintains an original pipeline ratio of over 60% through this focus on in-house drug discovery. Shionogi's product creation capabilities are a point of differentiation that can attract potential business partners including those from different industries. The Division is cultivating an eye for unsolved social issues and scientific thinking to develop approaches that provide real solutions. We will look at a wide range of therapeutic approaches (or modalities) to resolve diverse patient needs and make further advances in our small-molecule drug discovery engine that has been so effective in bringing innovative new products to market. Resources are limited, so we will focus on productivity even more. The Division will introduce new methodologies to improve development efficiency, such as digital studies or clinical trials using real-world data, and efficient working practices to generate results faster. A rigorous focus on the quality of data and study design will also support successful trials.It will not be possible to overcome the huge patent cliff looming around 2028 through one product alone.

To achieve this, Shionogi is executing a disease strategy and rebuilding sales structures. In our focus areas of infectious disease and CNS/pain, we think it is important to provide information relevant to the disease as a whole, rather than taking the conventional route of only providing product information. During sales activities for therapeutic agents, we need to provide information as part of a total package that spans everything from prevention to diagnosis, treatment, and convalescence. By executing this disease strategy, we aim to respond to the needs of physicians, healthcare professionals, and other customers. In order to provide a total package of services, the Pharmaceutical Commercial Division must work hand-in-hand with the newly established Integrated Disease Care Division.

We are leveraging our strengths in three areas: (1) Provide solutions for research and development with high probability of success (2) Create completely new added value through product research (3) Improve industrial productivity We aim to enhance these areas while also creating greater added value in order to improve product value as we work to deliver HaaS. As well as R&D, the CMC R&D Division needs to work closely together with other groups inside and outside the Company, such as the Integrated Disease Care Division, Shionogi Pharma, and technology licensing partners, in order to accurately identify and respond to stakeholder needs. We will improve our disease knowledge and detailing skills for all aspects of CNS/pain and infectious diseases, including COVID-19, to be able to respond to customer needs. This will allow our MRs to fully understand customer problems and be able to propose patient-focused solutions, such that customers view Shionogi MRs as trustworthy advisors.We are developing our technology capabilities and supplementing areas where we lack particular skills for process development that facilitates progress in development projects, with an eye to achieving sustainable growth from fiscal 2020 and beyond. We have been able to increase product value utilizing technologies developed through our work with small- molecule drugs. Examples include the development of a more stable formulation of cefiderocol API applying an original formulation technology. Looking ahead, we will expand the scope of our work from small-molecule to medium-sized molecule modalities and even to macromolecules, including vaccines and novel biopharmaceuticals using UMN Pharma's expertise. We will also develop devices and materials to enable new routes of administration or drug-delivery systems (DDS). In order to maximize product value through this type of creative added value, we will build platforms by taking a proactive approach to partnering. As a result, we aim to supply new solutions to a broader range of social issues.Transforming the Japan business to achieve the Company Vision Executing a disease strategyThree elements driving evolution of the CMC R&D Division Respond to customers' increasingly diverse needsWorking towards sustainable growth from fiscal 2020 Developing more channels to provide information to customersJapan CMC research Examples of completely new added value (1) Development of oral formulations for peptides and medium-sized molecules(2) Basic research on sustained-release injectables with a view to application in various modalities(3) Building frameworks for device development through partnering We are developing a technology to improve oral absorption of peptides. We have discovered a way to achieve an eight-fold increase in oral bioavailability by applying our own proprietary technology that uses interactions at the absorption site in the intestine. We are researching sustained-release formulations to reduce the medication burden for patients. We are using a type of polymer that swells due to water absorption and then gradually releases the small-molecule API held within the polymer structure. Our research is investigating the potential application of this technique in a sustained-release injectable formulation. We are moving forward with the development of devices that make possible a wide range of administration routes. We are working to build frameworks that will allow us to work with the best partners and create the best products, by sharing our experience and expertise in pharmaceutical quality and making it easier for organizations from other industries to work with us.

The Pharmaceutical Commercial Division is therefore accelerating moves to reorganize and establish IT infrastructure in order to combine real-world and digital applications and transform into a highly efficient organization. By working in closer partnership with Stream-I, our joint venture with M3, Inc., Shionogi will beef up its digital approaches to provide the right information to meet customer needs, including to those who we could not previously access with predominantly face-to-face communication. Moreover, we need to have an in-depth understanding of regional characteristics because of the slight differences in healthcare systems in different parts of the country. To respond to different customer needs in different regions, Shionogi must be able to satisfy true customer needs through information provision that combines both real-world and digital applications as described above. To achieve this, in fiscal 2020, the four regional functions in the domestic sales operations were reorganized into seven sales regions to make the sales force more mobile and improve customer access and information provision in line with regional characteristics. These changes are aimed at transforming the Company into a more efficient organization that is striving to resolve customers' issues. 39 40 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionR&D Strategy Top-Line Strategy Promoting diverse business structures and partnering Under STS2030, the Japan business aims to become an indispensable partner in infectious diseases and CNS/pain. To achieve this, Shionogi is executing a disease strategy and rebuilding sales structures. In our focus areas of infectious disease and CNS/pain, we think it is important to provide information relevant to the disease as a whole, rather than taking the conventional route of only providing product information. During sales activities for therapeutic agents, we need to provide information as part of a total package that spans everything from prevention to diagnosis, treatment, and convalescence. By executing this disease strategy, we aim to respond to the needs of physicians, healthcare professionals, and other customers.

To that end, we need to transform our business in key regions such as the US, Europe, and China. In the US and Europe, we will commercialize both drugs that we have discovered, as well as those from alliances, to build a strong sales presence focused on hospitals and specialist physicians. The seed for the expansion of our own sales presence in the US and Europe is the antibacterial agent cefiderocol. In China, we will establish both a sales and an R&D presence, as well as create entirely new healthcare platforms, in collaboration with Ping An Insurance Company of China, Ltd. We have great opportunities ahead of us to open up new prospects and new markets.In order to achieve our vision, it is essential to expand our business in China, the world's second largest market. Through our recent collaboration with Ping An Insurance Group, we will integrate the strengths of both companies to build a new business platform that further evolves and develops the drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company model. Leveraging Ping An's Good Doctor platform, we will contribute to top-line growth, utilizing first our existing generic and OTC products, and then following soon after with the registration and launch of our new global drugs in China. We expect that this joint venture can contribute to the health of all people and to shaping the future of healthcare by continuously discovering, developing, and providing new healthcare solutions, from new drugs arising from AI-driven R&D, to newly efficient manufacturing systems, through to previously unimagined healthcare products arising from the fusion of cutting-edge technologies.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has heightened social awareness of the threat by untreatable infectious diseases, and this increased awareness is driving receptivity to understanding the role and value of cefiderocol in Europe and the US. Cefiderocol's sales in the US have exceeded our initial targets, and we have made a great start. However, this is only the first step in expanding our business in the US. To achieve our goals, we need to continue to broaden the knowledge of cefiderocol. Furthermore, we will seek to expand our product portfolio to strengthen our presence in hospitals and specialty focus areas, building a synergistic portfolio and laying the groundwork for our upcoming pipeline products as we build an ever stronger and more effective commercial presence. In major EU countries, such as Italy, Spain, and France, the prevalence of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is substantially higher than in the US, and thus the medical need for cefiderocol is even greater.

The world needs new solutions to tackle these issues. Shionogi is working to deliver total care for infectious diseases through STS2030, including preventive care, treatment, and control of disease severity, in order to respond to diversifying healthcare needs. Shionogi considers protecting people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases to be an important social issue and the Company is expanding and stepping up its programs to address infectious diseases. Shionogi made UMN Pharma a wholly owned subsidiary in March 2020, marking the Company's full-scale entry into the vaccine business. The coronavirus pandemic began just as Shionogi moved into vaccines. The demand for a domestically developed vaccine is an opportunity for Shionogi to demonstrate its true worth.

The world needs new solutions to tackle these issues. Shionogi is working to deliver total care for infectious diseases through STS2030, including preventive care, treatment, and control of disease severity, in order to respond to diversifying healthcare needs. Shionogi considers protecting people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases to be an important social issue and the Company is expanding and stepping up its programs to address infectious diseases. Shionogi made UMN Pharma a wholly owned subsidiary in March 2020, marking the Company's full-scale entry into the vaccine business. The coronavirus pandemic began just as Shionogi moved into vaccines. The demand for a domestically developed vaccine is an opportunity for Shionogi to demonstrate its true worth.

The AMR Action Fund aims to bring two to four new antibiotics to market by 2030 through the initiatives outlined below. Investment in companies engaged in R&D into new antibiotics Provision of technological support by the investing pharmaceutical companies Engagement with governments around the world on the formation of a healthy market that is structured to allow the continued development of new antibioticsShionogi also actively participates in various national and international programs* to address AMR and is taking the initiative in AMR countermeasures.If nothing is done to address AMR now, estimates suggest that over 10 million lives will be lost each year by 2050. This is an urgent issue that will have huge impacts, both direct and indirect, on society. Therefore, health organizations and governments have positioned AMR as a global priority. However, the antibiotic business is not necessarily profitable, so many large pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn from R&D and smaller companies marketing antibiotics have been forced to file for bankruptcy or look for buyers for their business. As this situation drags on, expertise in antibiotic research is gradually being lost. Shionogi views infection control as part of the social infrastructure and has continued to invest in the infectious disease field. Leveraging expertise built up through many years' experience in antimicrobial drug discovery, Shionogi will continue to focus its energies on the development of new methods to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Shionogi conducts a surveillance program for drug-resistant strains in clinical isolates in Japan and overseas in order to monitor trends in drug-resistant bacteria and viruses. Long-term surveillance of the emergence of resistant bacteria and viruses and epidemiological data on their sensitivity provides important Surveillance: Implement program of surveillanceIn our sales activities, Shionogi does not remunerate sales staff based on sales volume of antibiotics, in order to promote proper use of antibiotics. We expect this to support proper use over the long term, leading to better patient outcomes and reducing the development of antibiotic resistance.Marketing: Uncouple performance assessment from sales volumeThe discharge of substances into the environment during antibiotic manufacturing has been strictly controlled for a long time. Shionogi has completed audits at all of the Company's plants and all domestic suppliers, and has also begun auditing overseas suppliers. At Shionogi antibiotics manufacturing sites, antibiotics contained in wastewater are subject to an inactivation process before being sent to an on-site wastewater treatment facility, where checks are made to ensure that any substances released into the natural environment are at a harmless level.Manufacturing: Reduce environmental burdenShionogi has a long history of anti-infective R&D, manufacture, marketing, distribution, and programs to ensure their proper use. As a manufacturer of anti-infectives, Shionogi considers it essential to take steps to curb the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, and the Company is working on programs right across the value chain. The rise of Gram-negative bacteria that have acquired resistance to existing treatments is a major issue for healthcare and mortality rates are rising due to the difficulty of treating such infections. Shionogi discovered cefiderocol, the first ever siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic, as a promising therapeutic option to tackle this issue, and launched this drug in the US in February 2020 under the brand name Fetroja. In Europe, cefiderocol was approved in April 2020 and preparations are underway for launch. Cefiderocol has a novel mechanism of action in terms of how it enters the bacterial cell, making it effective against the three carbapenem-resistant pathogens positioned by the WHO as the highest priorities. Shionogi has a policy governing the supply of unapproved drugs and has established a system that will give patients access to cefiderocol treatment, if they need it, but are in countries where the drug has not yet been launched despite already being approved (see page 57 for more details). Cefiderocol has also been approved by the US Department of Health and Human Services for coverage under the New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) program, which is aimed at promoting the introduction of new medical technologies by reimbursing hospitals for in-hospital treatment costs. This is expected to promote access to cefiderocol for patients needing treatment with this drug. We will continue to work on initiatives to hasten the delivery of products and services to the patients that need them. information to promote proper use of antibiotics. This surveillance program is a key strength that underpins Shionogi's R&D into drugs to treat infectious diseases. We have also been running a program of surveillance for our influenza drug Xofluza to promote proper use, and are assiduously conducting further analyses on mutant viral strains and drug safety and making our findings public. Shionogi is actively engaged in programs to raise awareness and educate on the right way to prevent and control infection and disease. In 2019, Shionogi collaborated with an NGO on the web-based Kodomo Kansensho Navi (information on pediatric infectious disease, in Japanese only) to raise awareness, along with a program for elementary school students to communicate the importance of hand-washing to prevent infectious diseases. We are also working on widespread awareness raising on infectious disease control at large international events and other mass gatherings, holding seminars for the general public as a collaborative initiative between industry, government, and academia (total of five meetings, 91-96% satisfaction rates, n=338) and providing an online information guide for infectious diseases at mass gatherings. Shionogi is also sponsoring the broadcast of Kansensho TODAY on Radio NIKKEI that provides up-to-date information for healthcare workers in order to raise awareness and promote a better understanding of infectious diseases.Use: Raise awareness and educate Current status of AMRSocial issues related to AMR Cefiderocol launch Mechanism by which resistant bacteria and viruses emerge and actions taken to control this Shionogi and Industry Efforts to Combat AMR* Davos Joint Declaration, AMR Industry Roadmap, AMR Industry Alliance, etc.: See online resources for more informationLike-minded companies and foundations will work together on these new initiatives to tackle the threat posed by AMR.

Shionogi's work to address infectious diseases also helps to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and Shionogi has responded to the social needs for HIV prophylaxis by developing cabotegravir as the first long-acting injectable formulation of a single agent that can be given once every two months. Clinical studies confirmed that injectable cabotegravir is more effective than current once daily oral pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) treatment. ViiV Healthcare is currently preparing to submit an approval filing for the PrEP indication. Preparing to submit approval filing for PrEP indication Shionogi has discovered S-648414 that has a novel mechanism of action and is considered the best candidate for use in a two-drug combination with Tivicay . Clinical studies were started in fiscal 2019. The Company is also investigating a functional cure for HIV using the development candidate S-540956, discovered through work in the immuno-oncology field, as this compound exhibits high nodal transferability and immune-enhancing effects. Further drug discovery: Working towards better QOL and a cure for HIV To reduce the frequency of drug administration, Shionogi invented a long-acting formulation of the HIV integrase inhibitor cabotegravir. Approval was granted in March 2020 in Canada, Further contributions through long-acting injectable cabotegravirMycobacterial diseases are caused by infection with acid-fast bacteria (such as tubercle bacillus or nontuberculous mycobacterium). Recent data suggest that patient numbers are rising in advanced economies. Shionogi is collaborating with external partners on drug discovery for both TB and NTM.As well as the world's three major infectious diseases discussed above, Shionogi is also working on fungal infections. Cryptosporidiosis is a severe infectious disease where fungus such as Aspergillus or Candida species invade the body. In some cases, the infection occurs when the patient's immune system is depressed, for example due to immunsuppressant therapy or HIV infection. Due to the limited number of effective drugs, cryptosporidiosis is often intractable with poor clinical outcomes. Shionogi is working with Nissan Chemical Industries to discover novel anti-fungal drugs.provides a source of business through which the Company can grow sustainably alongside society. We are broadening our research from a focus on HIV to encompass the three major infectious diseases, as well as collaborating with a diverse array of external partners to make progress in this area.

Tivicay has made a real contribution to both treatment of HIV infection and company growth. It is now positioned as treatment of choice for HIV in therapeutic guidelines worldwide and is top of the WHO's list of recommended treatments. Many HIV-positive people are now being treated with this drug. Until now, treatment for HIV infection involved a lifelong regimen of at least three different types of drugs. Therefore, the goal has been to improve patient QOL by reducing side effects and less frequent drug dosing, while also maintaining efficacy. Tivicay is highly efficacious and not susceptible to the emergence of resistant viral strains. Its use as the key drug in HIV therapy reduces side effects and has allowed patients to be treated with a two-drug combination. This has led to the launch of Juluca (Tivicay + rilpivirine) and Dovato (Tivicay + lamivudine). In December 2019, Dovato was added to the US guidelines on the management of HIV infection, leading to increased prescribing of this two-drug combination.New drug dolutegravir making a real contribution: Also generates sustainable growth for Shionogi and societyFurthermore, through the Medicines Patent Pool, an organization backed by the UN that increases access to pharmaceutical patents for low- and middle-income countries, Shionogi has released the dolutegravir patent at no charge to improve access to this treatment. Please refer to the Company website for more information on Shionogi's efforts in NTDs, including leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.

Shionogi has established Shionogi Infectious Disease Division as a collaborative research division in multiple fields within Nagasaki University, where Shionogi researchers will work as lead investigators, deepening the partnership with the University. Full-scale drug discovery research began in fiscal 2019. Shionogi and Nagasaki University aim to further their partnership moving forward, working together with the goal of implementing world-class research into malaria.Drug discovery in partnership with Nagasaki UniversityEvery year, over 200 million people develop malaria and over 400,000 people die. This infectious disease occurs mostly in tropical regions and mortality rates are particularly high in children under five. Malaria hampers economic development. Estimates suggest that if malaria were eradicated, some 10 million lives would be saved and economies would be boosted by around $4 trillion. Strains resistant to mainstay drugs have started to spread in recent years and there is a real need for therapeutic agents that are effective against these strains and with a good safety profile.

Clinical studies on once monthly administration demonstrated viral suppression equivalent to current treatment methods, and many of the patients participating in the studies replied that this drug formulation was better than current treatments. Development is ongoing to formulate a product that can be administered once every two months. Shionogi expects that the significant reduction in the number of days on which patients need to take treatments will help to improve patient QOL and adherence to the drug regimen.drugs with new mechanisms of action to treat mycobacterial diseases. In October 2019, Hsiri and Shionogi expanded their joint research partnership, signing a new agreement on joint research into different novel mechanisms of action. Shionogi aims to strengthen this partnership with Hsiri while focusing efforts on research into treatments for mycobacterial diseases with new mechanisms of action in order to discover a series of treatments over the medium-to-long term. 49 50 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionMaterial Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Tackling the world's three major infectious diseases The three major infectious diseases (HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis, and malaria) constitute a grave threat and massive challenge from the perspective of global health, due to the uncontrolled spread of these infections on a global scale and over a long timescale.

Tivicay has made a real contribution to both treatment of HIV infection and company growth. It is now positioned as treatment of choice for HIV in therapeutic guidelines worldwide and is top of the WHO's list of recommended treatments. Many HIV-positive people are now being treated with this drug. Until now, treatment for HIV infection involved a lifelong regimen of at least three different types of drugs. Therefore, the goal has been to improve patient QOL by reducing side effects and less frequent drug dosing, while also maintaining efficacy. Tivicay is highly efficacious and not susceptible to the emergence of resistant viral strains. Its use as the key drug in HIV therapy reduces side effects and has allowed patients to be treated with a two-drug combination. This has led to the launch of Juluca (Tivicay + rilpivirine) and Dovato (Tivicay + lamivudine). In December 2019, Dovato was added to the US guidelines on the management of HIV infection, leading to increased prescribing of this two-drug combination.New drug dolutegravir making a real contribution: Also generates sustainable growth for Shionogi and societyFurthermore, through the Medicines Patent Pool, an organization backed by the UN that increases access to pharmaceutical patents for low- and middle-income countries, Shionogi has released the dolutegravir patent at no charge to improve access to this treatment.

Shionogi has established Shionogi Infectious Disease Division as a collaborative research division in multiple fields within Nagasaki University, where Shionogi researchers will work as lead investigators, deepening the partnership with the University. Full-scale drug discovery research began in fiscal 2019. Shionogi and Nagasaki University aim to further their partnership moving forward, working together with the goal of implementing world-class research into malaria.Drug discovery in partnership with Nagasaki UniversityEvery year, over 200 million people develop malaria and over 400,000 people die. This infectious disease occurs mostly in tropical regions and mortality rates are particularly high in children under five. Malaria hampers economic development. Estimates suggest that if malaria were eradicated, some 10 million lives would be saved and economies would be boosted by around $4 trillion. Strains resistant to mainstay drugs have started to spread in recent years and there is a real need for therapeutic agents that are effective against these strains and with a good safety profile.

Clinical studies on once monthly administration demonstrated viral suppression equivalent to current treatment methods, and many of the patients participating in the studies replied that this drug formulation was better than current treatments. Development is ongoing to formulate a product that can be administered once every two months. Shionogi expects that the significant reduction in the number of days on which patients need to take treatments will help to improve patient QOL and adherence to the drug regimen.drugs with new mechanisms of action to treat mycobacterial diseases. In October 2019, Hsiri and Shionogi expanded their joint research partnership, signing a new agreement on joint research into different novel mechanisms of action. Shionogi aims to strengthen this partnership with Hsiri while focusing efforts on research into treatments for mycobacterial diseases with new mechanisms of action in order to discover a series of treatments over the medium-to-long term. 49 50 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionMaterial Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Improve Social Productivity and Extend Healthy Lifespans Addressing social issues related to developmental disordersShionogi sees much room for improvement in healthy life expectancies and social productivity, even though better public health and medical technology innovations have reduced death rates and resulted in a sharp rise in the global population.

This is an important social issue and the economic losses from this chronic pain are estimated to top \u00a51.9 trillion. Chronic pain occurs through a wide range of different mechanisms and it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint the specific cause. On top of this, individuals experience the pain itself and pain severity in different ways, making objective evaluation difficult. It is therefore important to have various different therapeutic options available so that treatment can be tailored to suit individual patients. With cancer pain, prescription narcotics can be used to control the pain, but they are not always used in sufficient quantities and many patients continue with their treatment despite still feeling pain. Shionogi is helping to improve QOL for patients experiencing pain, by disseminating appropriate information and providing the best treatment options for the various causes of pain, in order to provide pain relief for as many patients as possible. Cymbalta is a once daily treatment for diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain, and pain accompanying osteoarthritis. Cymbalta is recommended in treatment guidelines on chronic pain and it helps to improve QOL for many patients. Shionogi discovered S-600918 and S-637880, and both are expected to be effective against peripheral and CNS neuropathic pain. We are developing these compounds as next-generation analgesic candidates to follow on from Cymbalta and the OxyContin family of products. We hope to provide new treatment options that can address the complex mechanisms of pain.

Shionogi seeks to create a society in which patients suffering from cancer pain are able to use prescription narcotics with peace of mind. The problem of drug abuse has grown to become a major issue in recent years, posing serious problems for societies around the world. Shionogi has been running awareness-raising initiatives on the proper use of prescription narcotics for healthcare professionals and the general public in order to ensure that these social problems do not occur in Japan. Seminars were held in Aichi and Kyoto Prefectures in fiscal 2019, attended by around 150 participants. Educational programs were also provided online and through media seminars to help support patients suffering from cancer pain live more fulfilling and active lives.Initiatives to promote proper use of medicines Over the 30 years since the 1989 launch of controlled-release MS Contin tablets for cancer pain, Shionogi has worked to help patients manage their cancer pain with prescription narcotics (opioid analgesics). We have encouraged proper use of prescription narcotics to manage cancer pain through various initiatives, including the 2017 launch of tamper-resistant OxyContin TR tablets designed to prevent misuse and abuse. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is one issue that occurs in patients being treated with prescription narcotics. Shionogi is delivering value to patients suffering from OIC through the launch of Symproic to ease OIC.

Factoring in dementia patients plus their families and caregivers, this disease costs societies over $1 trillion each year. Dementia requires long-term care; places an enormous physical, emotional, and economic burden on the patient and their families; and is a pressing issue that society as a whole needs to tackle. Current drug therapies only improve some of the symptoms, and societies are in dire need of new agents to Current estimates suggest that one in two Japanese have cancer and one in three will die. As well as surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, over the past few years there has been growing interest in cancer immunotherapy. This new method is mostly benefiting patients with advanced cancer, but only 20-30% of patients respond to immunotherapies, so there is a need for more effective drugs that will generate a response in more patients. Shionogi has a unique line-up of cancer immunotherapy assets that are expected to enhance the immune response to slow progression and improve cognitive function. As part of our efforts to tackle these issues, Shionogi has discovered a new -secretase inhibitor S-872881 that is being developed with the goal of stopping disease progression in Alzheimer's disease. We have also acquired Tetra Therapeutics in the US as a wholly owned subsidiary, following the results from a US clinical study on Tetra's PDE4 inhibitor BPN14770. We also expect that Tetra's deep level of drug discovery know-how in the CNS area will strengthen our research and development efforts in this field.

Social security systems are likely to be completely overhauled as a result. If Shionogi is to continue growing alongside society for the next 10 or 20 years during these times of environmental change, the Company needs to keep supporting patient treatment and QOL by supplying innovative new drugs at prices commensurate with their value.We need to build systems to deliver products and services at the right time to the right patients by constantly seeking out ways in which our R&D expertise, skills, and experience can be usefully applied to various healthcare services. Shionogi aims to support longer healthy life expectancies by exploring the possibilities of therapeutic and preventative vaccines, digital treatment options such as healthcare apps, and information services, and by drilling down into the issues that people face from a total care perspective, covering pre-symptomatic and preventive care through diagnosis, treatment, and control of disease severity. Supplying products at prices commensurate with their valueProviding medical care optimized for the individual Extending healthy life expectancy through total care for diseaseThe need to balance innovation with sustainable social security has become a common issue worldwide, typified by recent problems with the affordability of high-priced regenerative medicine products and biologics. At Shionogi, we consider it our mission to provide innovative and affordable products and services that are priced commensurate with their value, in order to help create sustainable social security systems. We therefore aim to provide products at fair prices, not only for small-molecule drugs where we have drug discovery expertise, but also for medium-sized molecule drugs like peptides and nucleic acids, through the application of our fundamental skills to other modalities. In some medical fields, such as psychiatry, diagnoses based on objective and quantitative indicators are still not possible and patients are not always completely satisfied with the medical care provided. Without objective and quantitative indicators, there are no simple and accurate methods to determine one's own health status and patients are at risk of an unexpected worsening of their condition if the window of opportunity to treat is missed. This is in complete contrast to lifestyle-related diseases, where disease progression can be measured through We consider protecting people from illness as one of our important missions, and this also supports the establishment of a sustainable social security system. To this end, Shionogi aims to provide medical care optimized for the individual at socially acceptable prices. We are also educating society to better understand disease characteristics and how to prevent and manage disease, as well as delivering vaccines and other products for pre-symptomatic or preventive care. We can also support those who become ill by providing rapid, accurate diagnostics and optimized medical care to help them make a rapid recovery, improve their symptoms, or prevent their condition from worsening. We think that working to protect people from becoming sick or helping to diagnose a disease rapidly and support a quick recovery also leads to lower healthcare expenditure.Diagram of the delivery of medical care optimized for the individual (target offering from joint venture with Ping An Insurance)blood tests, for example, and doctors can act to prevent a disease or treat at the very early stages before the condition becomes serious. These issues with patient care result in higher social security expenditure. Shionogi's goal is to analyze medical and lifestyle data and use information on behavior and objective diagnostic markers to provide medical care optimized for the individual, which will also lead to greater economic efficiency in medical care. Shionogi is leading the way with these initiatives in infectious diseases (see page 17 for more details). We are working to provide total care for diseases, including for psycho-neurological diseases, one of our target disease areas. We are also helping to maintain the social security system, so that people can lead healthy lives and feel a sense of safety and security even as populations age and birth rates decline.Small-molecule drugs 500 or below Medium to high Few to moderate Targetable LowNonstandard peptide drugs 500 to 2,000 High Few Targetable LowAntibody therapeutics Around 150,000 High Few Untargetable High Innovation Develop drugs with intracellular targets, which are di fficult for antibody therapeutics to accessHealthcare Affordability Achieve balance with healthcare af fordability by reducing manufacturing costsMolecular weight Specificity Side ef fects Intracellular targets Manufacturing costsEnsuring both innovation and healthcare affordability through small-molecule and nonstandard peptide drug discovery 55 56 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data Section Lifestyle data Behavioral patterns Attribute information Sleep Genes Voice Amount of activityDiagnostic work-up and treatment data Data accumulation and associationObjective diagnostic markers Drug A ef fective Drug B ef fective Digital device C ef fective Shionogi's pipeline Drug development expertise and disease knowledge Ping An Insurance's healthcare services IT platforms (data acquisition network, data analysis technologies)Strengths at both companiesMaterial Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Contribute to Sustainable Social Security Rising social security costs are putting pressure on government finances all around the world, but particularly in industrialized nations, as birth rates decline and the average age of the population increases because people are living longer due to medical advances and better lifestyles. Social security systems are likely to be completely overhauled as a result. If Shionogi is to continue growing alongside society for the next 10 or 20 years during these times of environmental change, the Company needs to keep supporting patient treatment and QOL by supplying innovative new drugs at prices commensurate with their value.We need to build systems to deliver products and services at the right time to the right patients by constantly seeking out ways in which our R&D expertise, skills, and experience can be usefully applied to various healthcare services. Shionogi aims to support longer healthy life expectancies by exploring the possibilities of therapeutic and preventative vaccines, digital treatment options such as healthcare apps, and information services, and by drilling down into the issues that people face from a total care perspective, covering pre-symptomatic and preventive care through diagnosis, treatment, and control of disease severity. Supplying products at prices commensurate with their valueProviding medical care optimized for the individual Extending healthy life expectancy through total care for diseaseThe need to balance innovation with sustainable social security has become a common issue worldwide, typified by recent problems with the affordability of high-priced regenerative medicine products and biologics. At Shionogi, we consider it our mission to provide innovative and affordable products and services that are priced commensurate with their value, in order to help create sustainable social security systems. We therefore aim to provide products at fair prices, not only for small-molecule drugs where we have drug discovery expertise, but also for medium-sized molecule drugs like peptides and nucleic acids, through the application of our fundamental skills to other modalities. In some medical fields, such as psychiatry, diagnoses based on objective and quantitative indicators are still not possible and patients are not always completely satisfied with the medical care provided. Without objective and quantitative indicators, there are no simple and accurate methods to determine one's own health status and patients are at risk of an unexpected worsening of their condition if the window of opportunity to treat is missed. This is in complete contrast to lifestyle-related diseases, where disease progression can be measured through We consider protecting people from illness as one of our important missions, and this also supports the establishment of a sustainable social security system. To this end, Shionogi aims to provide medical care optimized for the individual at socially acceptable prices. We are also educating society to better understand disease characteristics and how to prevent and manage disease, as well as delivering vaccines and other products for pre-symptomatic or preventive care. We can also support those who become ill by providing rapid, accurate diagnostics and optimized medical care to help them make a rapid recovery, improve their symptoms, or prevent their condition from worsening. We think that working to protect people from becoming sick or helping to diagnose a disease rapidly and support a quick recovery also leads to lower healthcare expenditure.Diagram of the delivery of medical care optimized for the individual (target offering from joint venture with Ping An Insurance)blood tests, for example, and doctors can act to prevent a disease or treat at the very early stages before the condition becomes serious. These issues with patient care result in higher social security expenditure. Shionogi's goal is to analyze medical and lifestyle data and use information on behavior and objective diagnostic markers to provide medical care optimized for the individual, which will also lead to greater economic efficiency in medical care. Shionogi is leading the way with these initiatives in infectious diseases (see page 17 for more details). We are working to provide total care for diseases, including for psycho-neurological diseases, one of our target disease areas. We are also helping to maintain the social security system, so that people can lead healthy lives and feel a sense of safety and security even as populations age and birth rates decline.Small-molecule drugs 500 or below Medium to high Few to moderate Targetable LowNonstandard peptide drugs 500 to 2,000 High Few Targetable LowAntibody therapeutics Around 150,000 High Few Untargetable High Innovation Develop drugs with intracellular targets, which are di fficult for antibody therapeutics to accessHealthcare Affordability Achieve balance with healthcare af fordability by reducing manufacturing costsMolecular weight Specificity Side ef fects Intracellular targets Manufacturing costsEnsuring both innovation and healthcare affordability through small-molecule and nonstandard peptide drug discovery 55 56 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionMaterial Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth Improve Access to Healthcare Intellectual property and access to healthcareImproving access to pharmaceutical informationCompassionate use of investigational drugsImproving access to healthcare in Africa Intellectual property (IP) is an extremely important business asset for pharmaceutical companies. Although we do not subscribe to the idea that systems to protect IP necessarily pose an obstacle to accessing healthcare, we do recognize instances when a certain level of latitude is required. Consequently, until access to healthcare has been improved, Shionogi will refrain from applying for or enforcing patents in all countries classified as least developed countries (LDCs) and other low-income countries (LICs) or in most of the low middle-income countries (LMICs).Seeking to eliminate communication barriers when people with hearing, visual or other disabilities receive medication instructions, Shionogi has instigated the Communication Barrier-free Project. In fiscal 2019, we held awareness-raising seminars targeting medical professionals four times and on three occasions for people with hearing impairments and their helpers in each region. In addition, aiming for a \"drug that is easy for people with visual impairments to use,\" Shionogi Healthcare and Shionogi Pharma worked to improve the packaging of the over-the-counter (OTC) Sedes series and, based on proposals from the Communication Barrier-free Project, launched the new packaging in April 2020. For patients with life-threatening illnesses and serious illnesses that seriously affect their daily lives, but only in cases where there is no fully effective treatment available, Compassionate Use is a system established mainly in Europe and the United States whereby investigational drugs can be used from a humanitarian standpoint. Having established a Policy for the Supply of Investigational Drugs, Shionogi provides such drugs free of charge in accordance with an appropriate process when prescribed requirements are met. We also have in place a system for prompt supply, such as making a decision within five days of receiving a supply request. In addition, the anti-HIV agent Tivicay (dolutegravir) licensed to ViiV Healthcare Ltd., its co-developer with Shionogi, is registered in the Medicines Patent Pool. Opening the patent for free has enabled the supply of dolutegravir to more than 130 LICs and LMICs through generic drug manufacturers.Designed with an upper part that opens wide so that the outer box can be opened easily, the usage and dosages are shown in large letters on the underside of the lid, and an accessible code (QR code) has been added for compatibility with the multilingual reader functions on smartphones and other devices. As a result, we have realized a universal design that is easy to use not only for the visually impaired but also for the wide range of people who take this drug, including non-Japanese.In fiscal 2019, we provided drugs such as cefiderocol, a treatment for severe infections, and Eperitinib, an anticancer drug, to more than 72 cases in nine countries. Although there are some risks involved, such as not being fully recognized as effective or safe in the country concerned, by preparing options that may enable the saving of many lives or even just one person's life in the future, we will be contributing to the health of people around the world.Due to social factors, such as healthcare systems, public health, and poverty, there are still many \"restrictions to healthcare service access,\" which result in health services and medicines not reaching those who need them. Shionogi's primary mission is to provide healthcare services and medicines to as many patients as possible, and we will earnestly work to improve access to healthcare through collaboration with a wide range of partners. To improve access to healthcare, the Company established the Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statement. By promoting activities in line with this Policy, we are aiming to protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases, improve social productivity and extend healthy lifespans, and contribute to sustainable social security.With the aim of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which has been adopted under Goal 3 of the SDGs, the Company is promoting the Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project in Kenya. Lying to the south of the Sahara Desert, Sub-Saharan Africa is an area with extremely high mortality rates for pregnant women and children up to the age of five. In partnership with the international NGO World Vision, we are working on activities designed to protect the health of mothers and children by strengthening the community healthcare system. In April 2020, we started a new project in Kilifi County, which is an arid region with many poor people and where access to medical services is limited. Using the experience gained in implementing the first phase of the project, we will proceed with the establishment of three clinics in two districts for 77,500 inhabitants, in line with three key milestones.Project Second Phase (Kilifi County, Republic of Kenya, April 2020) In this region, the system for providing medical services was inadequate, and the residents lacked knowledge about health and hygiene. In fiscal 2019, the fourth year of the program, we promoted health staff education, the maintenance of water supply facilities, healthcare education among local residents, and meetings with Narok County's Department of Health. By fiscal 2019, the education program had been conducted for more than 5,100 residents, and the numbers of health center visits and the number of babies delivered at medical facilities had been steadily increasing. In fiscal 2020, the final year of the Project First Phase (Narok County, Republic of Kenya, October 2015)Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project project, we will train human resources, strengthen the inventory management functions, for example for pharmaceuticals, and complete the handing over of clinics to the county, which will lead to the establishment of a healthcare system.

By learning market analysis know-how, I became able to independently come up with new market segments and treatment delivery methods based on Real World Data. In addition, I am passing on my experience and learning to the members of the laboratory, which is leading to a change in awareness and expansion of skills. Going forward, I will continue to contribute to drug discovery that is close to the true problems of patients by combining the information obtained from Real World Data with our research and manufacturing capabilities. In 2018, I was seconded to Accenture, an IT consulting company, for one year. At the second location, I experienced an improvement in the quality and speed of work through appropriate division of labor and close communication within the team. In addition, I was able to acquire knowledge of a variety of IT technologies and experience project management by being involved in a wide range of activities, from service installation to troubleshooting with actual customers. In April 2020, following the declaration of a state of emergency due to the spread of COVID-19 infections, I undertook infrastructure building for working from home in a short period of time by drawing on the experience I gained through my secondment.Building diverse careers through in-house and side businesses Career development by secondment to another companyKeiko Takasu Laboratory for Drug Discovery and Disease Research, Pharmaceutical Research Division Maraki Nasu Shionogi Digital Science Co., Ltd.To help our employees achieve an appropriate work-life balance, we have been taking steps to offer more convenient work solutions by actively introducing a discretionary work system and a flextime system. We have been implementing a work-at-home system since fiscal 2018, but using the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity, we are considering new ways of working and conducting a review of our work-at-home system. In March 2020, we introduced a treatment-work balance support system, by which employees who would like to continue working while under treatment for an illness can now choose to work shorter hours.In March 2020, Shionogi declared its support for and joined the international initiative \"The Valuable 500\" to promote inclusion of people with disabilities. The Valuable 500 is an international initiative launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Davos Conference) held in January 2019. By creating a work environment in which all employees, regardless of their disabilities, can fully demonstrate their abilities as members of the Shionogi Group, we are bringing about improvements in employee engagement (willingness to contribute to achieve our corporate philosophy and goals). By doing so, we will contribute to the creation of a society in which each and every individual can demonstrate his or her own value.For the purpose of improving the understanding of the characteristics of diverse people among employees, we held a \"training course for people with mental and developmental disabilities and their work supporters\" and virtual reality (VR) training aimed at promoting the understanding of dementia and developmental disabilities as well as the LGBT community. Many employees who participated in each training course commented that they had deepened their understanding of developmental disabilities and that there was a new awareness and change in their way of thinking with regard to D&I. Going forward, we will continue to conduct in-house training and other initiatives with the aim of instilling D&I awareness within the Company. In its General Employer Action Plan, which is based on the Act on Promotion of Women's Advancement, Shionogi adopted the goal of increasing the percentage of women in executive positions to 10% or more by the end of fiscal 2020. As a result of our efforts so far, the ratio of female managers has steadily increased to 11.4% in the domestic group. In addition, there is no difference in average length of service between men and women, and the fact that women play an active role is firmly established in corporate activities. In the West Japan Diversity Study Group, which the Company joined in 2017, we are working with other companies to promote understanding of sexual minorities. Going forward, we will promote efforts aimed at creating an environment in which all employees can play an active role regardless of gender.Shionogi is positioning the promotion of diversity & inclusion (D&I) as an important personnel strategy for the entire group. Naturally diverse, each person has different characteristics and values. New value is created by combining these different characteristics and values toward a common purpose. As the needs of society diversify and the roles required of healthcare companies expand, this vision cannot be achieved as an extension of the past. We believe that we can continue to generate the innovations required by society by having diverse human resources who possess keenly developed strengths (for more details see page 59) interact with each other and with people outside the Company, and by fusing and sublimating their ideas. Shionogi has in place a Diversity Council, which consists of members from each organization, Group companies, and human resources departments, and is working to promote D&I.

By learning market analysis know-how, I became able to independently come up with new market segments and treatment delivery methods based on Real World Data. In addition, I am passing on my experience and learning to the members of the laboratory, which is leading to a change in awareness and expansion of skills. Going forward, I will continue to contribute to drug discovery that is close to the true problems of patients by combining the information obtained from Real World Data with our research and manufacturing capabilities. In 2018, I was seconded to Accenture, an IT consulting company, for one year. At the second location, I experienced an improvement in the quality and speed of work through appropriate division of labor and close communication within the team. In addition, I was able to acquire knowledge of a variety of IT technologies and experience project management by being involved in a wide range of activities, from service installation to troubleshooting with actual customers. In April 2020, following the declaration of a state of emergency due to the spread of COVID-19 infections, I undertook infrastructure building for working from home in a short period of time by drawing on the experience I gained through my secondment.Building diverse careers through in-house and side businesses Career development by secondment to another company Keiko Takasu Laboratory for Drug Discovery and Disease Research, Pharmaceutical Research Division Maraki Nasu Shionogi Digital Science Co., Ltd.To help our employees achieve an appropriate work-life balance, we have been taking steps to offer more convenient work solutions by actively introducing a discretionary work system and a flextime system. We have been implementing a work-at-home system since fiscal 2018, but using the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity, we are considering new ways of working and conducting a review of our work-at-home system. In March 2020, we introduced a treatment-work balance support system, by which employees who would like to continue working while under treatment for an illness can now choose to work shorter hours.In March 2020, Shionogi declared its support for and joined the international initiative \"The Valuable 500\" to promote inclusion of people with disabilities. The Valuable 500 is an international initiative launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Davos Conference) held in January 2019. By creating a work environment in which all employees, regardless of their disabilities, can fully demonstrate their abilities as members of the Shionogi Group, we are bringing about improvements in employee engagement (willingness to contribute to achieve our corporate philosophy and goals). By doing so, we will contribute to the creation of a society in which each and every individual can demonstrate his or her own value.For the purpose of improving the understanding of the characteristics of diverse people among employees, we held a \"training course for people with mental and developmental disabilities and their work supporters\" and virtual reality (VR) training aimed at promoting the understanding of dementia and developmental disabilities as well as the LGBT community. Many employees who participated in each training course commented that they had deepened their understanding of developmental disabilities and that there was a new awareness and change in their way of thinking with regard to D&I. Going forward, we will continue to conduct in-house training and other initiatives with the aim of instilling D&I awareness within the Company. In its General Employer Action Plan, which is based on the Act on Promotion of Women's Advancement, Shionogi adopted the goal of increasing the percentage of women in executive positions to 10% or more by the end of fiscal 2020. As a result of our efforts so far, the ratio of female managers has steadily increased to 11.4% in the domestic group. In addition, there is no difference in average length of service between men and women, and the fact that women play an active role is firmly established in corporate activities. In the West Japan Diversity Study Group, which the Company joined in 2017, we are working with other companies to promote understanding of sexual minorities. Going forward, we will promote efforts aimed at creating an environment in which all employees can play an active role regardless of gender.Shionogi is positioning the promotion of diversity & inclusion (D&I) as an important personnel strategy for the entire group. Naturally diverse, each person has different characteristics and values. New value is created by combining these different characteristics and values toward a common purpose. As the needs of society diversify and the roles required of healthcare companies expand, this vision cannot be achieved as an extension of the past. We believe that we can continue to generate the innovations required by society by having diverse human resources who possess keenly developed strengths (for more details see page 59) interact with each other and with people outside the Company, and by fusing and sublimating their ideas. Shionogi has in place a Diversity Council, which consists of members from each organization, Group companies, and human resources departments, and is working to promote D&I. We will continue to promote D&I with the aim of including all the diverse human resources who will contribute to the propagation of the 2030 Vision.Supporting work-life balanceParticipation in The Valuable 500, an international initiative to promote inclusion of people with disabilitiesDiversity & inclusion-related training for employees Diversity Vision (Establishment in December 2018) Gender equality initiatives 20 15 10 5 0(Years) (FY) 2015 2016 2017 2019 * 2018 Female Male17.117.5 17.117.816.1 15.012 8 2015 2016 2017 2019 20187.8%8.4% 8.0%9.9%11.4 % Average years of serviceRatio of female managersDiversity & Inclusion logo (adopted June 2020)Major initiatives related to disability Initiatives aimed at freeing people from the difficulties of living with developmental disabilities Initiatives to remove medication barriers for visually and hearing- impaired people Creating a supportive workplace for people with disabilities Understand yourself and others, and celebrate individual diversity.

Approach to Human RightsRespecting human rightsHealth management Occupational health and safetyReinforcing supply chain managementIn recent years, the severity of human rights issues and demands for responses to them have increased due to the globalization of business and the expansion of supply chains. Having clarified its stance on further expanding its business globally under the New Medium-Term Business Plan\u2014Shionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030) \u2014Shionogi is promoting initiatives while recognizing that it is important to respect human rights, not only as a responsibility that a company must fulfill but also when implementing management strategies. Thus far, along with taking into consideration the safety and human rights of participants in clinical trials, Shionogi has been participating in PSCI*1 and the United Nations Global Compact while respecting the human rights of its various stakeholders. In fiscal 2019, we announced our Approach to Human Rights, which is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and clarified Shionogi's stance. As part of its approach, Shionogi supports international human We believe that the most important requirement for us to achieve this mission, particularly in a drastically changing environment, is to support all Shionogi employees in sustaining and improving their physical, mental and social wellbeing, which in turn allows them to achieve their goals in work and in life. Therefore, in furtherance of the above, Shionogi and its employees will strive, in their respective positions, to: Improve the health literacy of employees; support the maintenance and improvement of the mental and physical condition of employees and their families; and sustain and continuously improve a supportive and productive working environment, as well as the employees' home environment. Accordingly, we established the Shionogi Health Policy in fiscal 2020. By aligning the direction of Shionogi and its employees and promoting initiatives, Shionogi will continue to ensure its employees' wellbeing and provide meaningful and valuable advances in healthcare. To ensure the safety and health of employees and create a comfortable working environment, we are continuously working to build an appropriate management system and improve the chemical substance management system, which poses a high risk for health and safety management. We are proceeding with the acquisition of management system certifications to build an appropriate management system. We are in the process of switching over from OHSAS18001, under which the Settsu Plant and Kanegasaki Plant were certified, to ISO 45001 during fiscal 2020. The Tokushima Plant is also working toward new certification acquisitions.During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have applied leave with pay (which does not correspond to paid leave) for employees who have been infected with or suspected of being infected with the virus, and for employees who take leave, for example due to the temporary closure of children's schools. We also strive to minimize the risk of infection by putting in place safety- and health-conscious work styles, such as work-at-home recommendations, staggered working hours, and private car commuting.In July 2018, a law to partially revise the Health Promotion Law was enacted (fully enforced in April 2020), and efforts to prevent unwanted second-hand smoke changed from manners to rules. The Shionogi Group Smoke-Free Declaration was issued to seize To ensure that corporations fulfill their social responsibilities, it is important for them to build relationships of trust and to cooperate not only within their own companies but also with suppliers, who are important business partners. At Shionogi, we are collaborating with our suppliers based on the Group's Procurement Policy, which sets out a basic approach designed to ensure that procurement activity is founded on honesty, fairness, equity, and transparency, and strengthening supply chain management while working to realize a sustainable society. The basic principles adopted under the PSCI cover a comprehensive range of fields, including not only environment and health and safety but also human rights and labor, ethics, and their associated management systems. In 2020, the principles were revised, and further items added. Shionogi will continue to support the revised principles and strongly urge all suppliers to endorse them.Our Suppliers' EHS/CSR Management Guidance sets out EHS risk categories and risk management procedures for suppliers and stipulates which conditions they must meet according to their assigned management level. For important investigational new drugs and pharmaceutical raw material suppliers, we carry out surveys using the PSCI's self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ)\u2014to confirm the supplier's status in areas including ethics, human rights and labor, environment, health and safety, and their management systems\u2014in conjunction with on-site audits. When conducting on-site audits, we also perform risk confirmation for each supplier, such as safety assessments of their manufacturing processes and assessments of locally applied laws and regulations. So far, we have had 35 suppliers consent to the basic principles adopted for the PSCI and undergo SAQ-based written audits. Subsequently, visits were made to 20 of the suppliers, and on-site audits completed. We will continue working to strengthen relationships while building relationships of trust with suppliers and aiming to realize a sustainable society together with them.Cooperation on PSCI PrinciplesSupplier risk management and audit performancerights standards\u2014including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up\u2014and has clarified that the Company works with all its business partners to respect human rights.

Reliably delivering the necessary drugs to patients, we work closely with Group companies around the world to ensure quality and safety while making every effort to ensure a stable supply of high-quality pharmaceutical products so that customers know they can rely on Shionogi medicines. Initiatives for stable supply Ensuring quality and safety in products and services Responding to COVID-19: To supply drugs without delayShionogi analyzes the risks in the procurement and manufacturing of raw materials and products while taking measures to ensure a stable supply. Specifically, we are multi-sourcing suppliers and product manufacturing plants that handle raw materials for high-volume products. We also secure a certain level of inventory for raw materials and products that can only be supplied by that business partner. On the other hand, we can quickly supply even in the event of an unforeseen situation, such as a pandemic or an earthquake, and we have stipulated the response procedures. To strive constantly to supply the best possible medicines to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve, businesses must act efficiently with an approach to risk that takes preventive measures in advance rather than reacting after an issue has emerged. Through the Shionogi Group Quality Policy, which is subject to continuous improvement, Shionogi confirms that all products and data in Japan and overseas, from the development to the post-marketing stage, are covered by appropriate risk-preventive action of this kind. We have also built a system that complies with the laws and regulations of each country and carry out global quality assurance so that these activities can be carried out by the entire group, including overseas. To reliably supply high-quality medicines to patients around the world, we are working to improve manufacturing quality and ensure quality through GMP* and developing activities to protect patients from counterfeit medicines. In addition to participating in industry activities related to the prevention of counterfeit medicines, we have set up a Global Anti-Counterfeit Committee centered on members from Japan, the United States, and Europe to work on product security measures.Due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the supply chain has been disrupted on a global scale, and the risk of procurement and supply disruption has become apparent. Even under these circumstances having established in visual form the amount of inventory and the periods in which supplies will run out for all its products, Shionogi is fulfilling its responsibility to supply to the market without running out of stock of all Shionogi products by constantly sharing procurement and manufacturing status information with raw material suppliers and contract manufacturers. Going forward, it will be essential to strengthen the supply chain management system in anticipation of the with/after COVID-19 periods. In addition to giving consideration to risk diversification through further multi-sourcing and promoting the automation of business processes by installing the systems, we will target the building of a more stable management system. We will also aim for a supply chain that is capable of responding swiftly to any changes in the environment, such as by shortening production lead times and securing multiple means of transportation.While expanding these efforts to various business partners in the supply chain and gaining their understanding of Shionogi's way of thinking, we are cooperating on and building a business continuity system so that the supply from each business partner will not be interrupted. We are working to improve the supply chain in collaboration with our business partners by ascertaining the procurement risk and taking preventive measures from the time a business partner is selected and, after the start of trading, by defining KPIs, which form a common language, and confirming the levels of their achievement. Supply chain management Strengthening of production systemQuality assurance and response to counterfeit drugs Efforts toward pharmacovigilance Since the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had in place a senior management-led Coronavirus Response Headquarters to ensure a stable supply system. We thoroughly prevented infections in plants by requiring all people who enter offices to wear masks, taking their temperatures, checking their physical condition, monitoring employees' health, and setting standards for their return to work. We also established countermeasure procedures to prevent secondary and tertiary infections should people be infected and worked to prevent cluster outbreaks. However, since suspending plant operational functions would be unavoidable were an infection to spread, we reduced any impact due to the halting of operations by securing more inventory than usual. By taking multiple measures while ensuring the safety of employees, we are working to further strengthen our production system, which will lead to the maintenance of a stable supply. * Good Manufacturing Practice (regulations for pharmaceutical manufacturing control and quality control)As set out in the Shionogi Group Drug Safety Policy, Shionogi gives utmost priority to the safety of patients and participants in clinical trials. Accordingly, we operate procedures for reliably gathering and evaluating safety information at all stages from development to post-marketing and have put in place a system so that the necessary safety measures can be rolled out rapidly through close coordination among safety management divisions in all Group regions, including overseas. Additionally, for drugs where it is considered particularly necessary, we have put in place a special pharmacovigilance system with specific procedures stipulated for the individual product. We believe it to be vital for senior managers and employees to understand the importance of gathering and evaluating safety information in order to take correct safety measures, and we are working to raise awareness through initiatives such as in-house education.

In addition, as a result of the chairman's retirement in June 2020, an outside director has become the chairman of the Board of Directors, a move designed to further improve the objectivity of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is advised by the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee, which are chaired by outside directors. To ensure that management decisions are equitable and well-informed, these committees carefully assess the aptitude of candidates for director positions, the impact directors have on business management, and the suitability of individuals for certain roles and their respective levels of remuneration. To ensure that the directors and each organization in the Company conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out audits of business execution and exchange opinions with the representative directors as required. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Auditors conduct business and accounting audits to verify the legality and validity of the duties carried out by the directors and corporate of ficers responsible for business execution. Shionogi has introduced an executive of ficer system to support dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to significant changes in the operating environment. The Company has also established the Corporate Executive Management Meeting as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, auditors and the corporate officers responsible for business execution and meets every week in principle. The Corporate Executive Management Meeting is a forum for discussing issues related to business execution and important management matters. The Nomination Advisory Committee holds a meeting at least once a year to discuss director, corporate auditor and corporate officer candidates proposed by the Company, and assesses each proposal individually based on comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's experience, knowledge, capabilities, and so forth, in order to verify the suitability of candidates in a fair and equitable manner.

This exchange of opinions takes place with the objective of enhancing the quality of discussions that cover items raised at the Board of Directors' meetings. Meetings to exchange opinions are convened with all of the corporate auditors, outside directors and the president in attendance, and topics for discussion include recent trends in the healthcare industry and Company business, as well as plans for executive training, and the status of that training. It is through this exchange of opinions that we gain a deeper understanding of the external environment and conditions within the Company, and ascertain a comprehensive birds-eye view, a three-dimensional perspective of the items that arise at the Board of Directors. In the limited amount of time available, this leads to high-quality advice and suggestions.Having a greater understanding of Shionogi's business as one goal, outside of ficers' information exchange and study sessions organized by standing members were held on two occasions in fiscal 2019, September 2 (Mon.) and March 16 (Mon.), 2020. Attending were outside of ficers that make up the Company's standing members of the Board of Auditors and Shionogi's executives. At September's study session, the members toured the Settsu Plant of Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd., the Group's manufacturing company, while also gaining a deeper understanding of the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, and in March's study session, members shared information on the direction that Shionogi is pursuing with regard to STS2030, our New Medium-Term Business Plan set to start in fiscal 2020. These meetings brought together outside of ficers and Shionogi's management executives.From about 2,000 companies listed with the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Shionogi was selected to receive the award of Grand Prize Company for the Corporate Governance of the Year 2019. A keen awareness of external stakeholders, such as institutional investors is one of the basics of corporate governance. Bearing this in mind, Shionogi has actively engaged in extensive, transparent, and traceable dialogues with internal and external stakeholders and operated the company with a strong sense of crisis. In so doing, we were highly evaluated in that the Company has accomplished management reforms and delivered great performance.A strong management philosophy is required to ensure that corporate governance functions properly. Dr. Teshirogi has been conducting product selection and concentration and working hard to significantly improve profitability since he was made Vice President of the Corporate Planning Department. His thoroughgoing proactiveness is quite rare. Shionogi takes the stance of being open to anything that achieves sustainable growth, which embodies the spirit of putting governance into practice. This is a company that brings to life the essence of governance with its self-discipline. What I find extraordinary is President Teshirogi's high level of self-discipline, his objective insights that inform his position as president, and his willingness to listen to the voices of investors from a healthy sense of urgency, not to mention his ef forts to facilitate the learning of employees. As governance reforms at Japanese companies step up from formality to substance, Shionogi's initiatives are an example of the importance of substance and its ef fect. Example of Deliberation Details: Resolution on Strategic Capital and Business Alliance with Ping An Insurance Company of China, Ltd. Both outside directors and outside auditors pointed out the necessity of conducting a capital alliance at this time, making comments such as \"The timing is appropriate to carry out a capital alliance as the coronavirus pandemic has made for abnormal conditions in the stock market dragging down Shionogi's share price,\" \"Contrast it with prioritizing only capital alliances,\" and \"Explain the dilution of shares to our current shareholders.\" These comments were engaged and discussed from a variety of perspectives, such as that we should quickly move to flesh out our business plans and hold discussions so that we can accelerate business transformation and the building of our overseas foundation for growth, as well as about the risks entailed with postponing contracts, such as causing negotiations to breakdown and delays to business growth, and the appropriateness of a capital alliance in consideration of our business in three years and the balance sheet. In addition, they also provided their advice that we should take care to explain to our current shareholders that this is a strategy that will lead to higher corporate value over the medium- to long-term. The result has been a keen awareness among Board of Directors' members of the appropriateness of our strategy and the significance of engaging in a capital and business alliance at this time, and on March 31, 2020, we reached a basic agreement with regard to a capital and business alliance with Ping An Insurance Company of China, Ltd.(Times) and our shareholders. As one example of the lively debates that occur at the Company's Board of Directors' meetings, here we will introduce a portion of the intense discussions engaged upon with regard to deciding to move ahead with a strategic capital and business alliance with Ping An Insurance Company of China, Ltd.Material Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth 69 70 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionAt the Company's Board of Directors' meetings, we receive valuable opinions and advice, proactively, from not only outside directors but from outside auditors as well.

These indicators were determined after a comprehensive evaluation of factors, such as quantitative targets in the medium-term business plan and operational issues, and are premised on the Company achieving the vision laid out in its medium-term business plan, which is to \"grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" * Included in remuneration amounts and personnel numbers are an outside director and an outside auditor who retired on June 18, 2019Total amount of remuneration for directors and corporate auditors * (FY2019)Structure of directors' remuneration CategoryPersons remuneratedAmount of remuneration paid Base remuneration BonusesRestricted stock compensation Total Medium-term performance-linkedLong-term Millions of yen Millions of yen Millions of yen Millions of yen Millions of yen Directors (outside directors among directors)7 (4)256 (51)51 (\u2014)47 (\u2014)57 (51)\u2014 (\u2014)\u2014 (\u2014)\u2014 (\u2014)117 (51) Total 13 374 51 47 57 529 75 76 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 SHIONOGI INTEGRATED REPORT 2020Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategy Addressing Material Issues Data SectionMaterial Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth Stakeholder engagement Shionogi aims to realize a sustainable society by creating corporate and social value through engagement with four stakeholders: shareholders and investors, customers, society, and employees.Creating corporate and social value through engagement Shionogi strives to ascertain the level of understanding of the other parties in discussions and the needs of investors through continuous dialogue with shareholders and investors.

Under such circumstances, I am very excited that the new business with Ping An in China will be a very important business for Shionogi in its transformation from a drug discovery-oriented company to a Healthcare As A Service (HaaS) company in the future. Up to now, I have been focusing on international corporate legal affairs and dispute resolution in Greater China, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan but mainly in China as well as in Southeast Asia. I have also been providing support for the various legal issues and problems Japanese companies encounter when expanding globally and gaining experience in supporting the management of overseas subsidiaries. As Shionogi rapidly expands its overseas business, it is expected that there will be more opportunities to work on business alliances with local business partners, the building of local business frameworks, and managing overseas group companies by the head offices. For the very reason that I was based in Beijing and have been gaining experience in business related to China, I fully understand the possibilities for major advances and potential for risks in Chinese business from various standpoints. I also believe that I can utilize my knowledge of managing Chinese business with Ping An. In addition, based on industry-specific risks and cases recognized from my experience thus far in supporting pharmaceutical companies, I would like to frankly give opinions and advice that make use of my knowledge as a lawyer, for example on social norms and legal compliance from a global perspective. I have been investing in many startup companies as a venture capitalist. Also I have been managing an investment committee as a president of NVCC since April of 2009. Meeting up with thousands of startup companies made me aware of one simple principle of success. That is to understand what they should NOT do. All startup companies think about what they should do but what distinguishes successful companies from other companies is how clearly they think about what they should NOT do. Detecting and avoiding the risks could lead to high possibility of success, especially when they make a big decision for new challenges. Shionogi is now transforming its business model from traditional pharmaceutical company to \"HaaS\" company. In that situation, it is necessary to focus on what hidden risks are and what we should NOT do. Engaging internal discussion or looking around competitors' cases are always helpful to find them. From what I have experienced, I could contribute not only on maintaining financial soundness but also on assessing partnerships with other institutions. Just as most of successful startup employees are energetic and have a management perspective, I would like to support Shionogi's successful transformation and business expansion by having its employees realize their connection with company's business with high motivation.

Our goal is to be a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company for which infectious diseases are a core therapeutic area, and which, while confronting infectious diseases, is resilient to all threats, including pandemics. In response to COVID-19, we are taking measures to tackle various issues that became clear in the course of continuing the business, and we have established robust systems for business continuity ready for a second and third wave of the spread of the virus. In doing so, we are determined to fulfill our responsibilities to our stakeholders while balancing the sustainability of social and economic activities. Specifically, by taking a detailed look back at our response, we will be reviewing our BCPs so that we can flexibly respond to the re-expansion of COVID-19 or the occurrence of a new pandemic. Furthermore, we are building more-effective BCP systems through repeated BCP-based simulation training. In parallel, we are continuing to build a more robust IT system.Establishing a stronger system in light of COVID-19Shionogi established its \"Coronavirus Response Headquarter\" before the Japanese government's declaration of a state of emergency and is working to ensure prompt decisions in line with Business Continuity Plans (BCPs). Moreover, all organizations, including Group companies, took steps to completely revise the content of existing BCPs adding measures to address pandemics as well as earthquakes during fiscal 2019. We also reviewed plans during the fiscal year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to prompt and appropriate responses in line with the BCPs, this did not affect the continuity of the company-wide business. Under the state of emergency, we created a telecommuting environment that is supported by enhanced IT infrastructure, and many employees have smoothly transitioned to telecommuting. For employees who need to go to work in person, we have taken measures to reduce the risk of infection through private car commuting, staggering working hours, and implementing a temperature measurement system. By such means, we continued to fulfill our social responsibility as a pharmaceutical company, maintaining stable supplies of pharmaceuticals and undertaking research and development related to COVID-19. In addition, we worked closely with important manufacturers and suppliers in Japan and overseas to ensure a stable supply of pharmaceuticals.Response to COVID-19Beginning in fiscal 2020, under Shionogi's New Medium-Term Business Plan, Shionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030), we are aiming to transform the business model and build new healthcare platforms. Business uncertainty is expected to increase in the process of this transformation. If we cannot respond to sudden changes in the environment within and outside the company, we may fail to achieve the goals of STS2030. That would also affect business continuity, so we are focusing on identifying related risks. In addition, we are working to build systems and to foster a culture in which various information is reported to management promptly by departments and other business units. As part of this, within the Corporate Strategy Committee, which is headed by a Senior Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy Division, we have established the Risk Management Subcommittee as a specialist meeting body to oversee the risk management of the Shionogi Group. In addition to the steps taken to consolidate and identify risks, efforts were also made to ensure that analysis and assessment was more transparent in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, we will continue to identify risks, refine countermeasures, and strengthen the monitoring and review cycle for risks by management. Moreover, since there are many risks that may impede the attainment of STS2030, we will review the Shionogi Group Risk Management Policy to make it appropriate for dealing with these risks.Risk Management Aiming to Achieve the Business Plan Risk management structureBusiness and other risks Risk category Response Systemic and Regulatory Risk There could be an impact from trends with government regulations including revisions to Japan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system, including the NHI drug price system Tougher Japanese and overseas regulations in areas such as the development and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals could present us with additional expenses or make it difficult for our products to comply with regulations Provide innovative new drugs at an acceptable price to society Build evidence to show the value of the innovations created Promote the value of innovation through industry group activities Obtain the latest information and make appropriate changes to prevent delays in R&D and business opportunity loss due to non-compliance with regulations, etc. Risk of Adverse Drug Reactions Pharmaceuticals entail the risk of unanticipated adverse drug reactions that could lead to the termination of sales, product recalls, and other outcomes Construct systems to appropriately convey side effect and other information Educate all employees to limit the spread of side effects and control damage Obtain insurance for medical damage compensation based on side effects, etc. Pharmaceutical R&D Risk Pharmaceutical R&D requires substantial commitment of resources and time.

Compliance in Shionogi means compliance not only with laws, rules and regulations, but also with social standards, and it also includes ethical behavior. This approach underpins every aspect of our business. We have published the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy, under which all directors and employees are required to comply with laws and regulations as well as practice ethical behavior. Our intention is for all employees to consistently hold themselves to the highest ethical standards in order to support sustained growth for Shionogi. Shionogi promotes compliance in all departments and units through a structure centered on the Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the President and Representative Director and includes among its participants members of the Corporate Executive Management Meeting. The Compliance Unit sits within the General Administration Department and provides support for compliance initiatives proposed by the Compliance Committee as well as undertaking a variety of activities including compliance training and surveys. In cooperation with the Compliance Unit, compliance managers (head of each organization) work together with compliance promoters (at least one appointed from each department) on devising compliance initiatives specific to each department or unit.Serving to once again remind all executives and employees of the importance of compliance and to increase their awareness, the Shionogi Compliance Handbook was produced to help them put compliance into practice. We are working to instill awareness of compliance by posting \"check\" items related to initiatives and ideas that should be practiced on a daily basis in conjunction with the setting of \"discussion points\" for each item to encourage discussion in the workplace. In recent years, the importance of CRM has grown due to the increase in the number of Group companies. In fiscal 2019, we visited all Group companies as a committee to work toward identifying issues and thoroughly managing them. Shionogi holds annual training sessions for compliance managers and promoters, and the attendance rate in fiscal 2019 was 100%. The Chairman of the Compliance Committee himself talks about its importance and strives to foster awareness and promote understanding of compliance. Having established compliance reporting desks that can be used by employees and third parties, we are making every effort to detect at an early stage and thus prevent violations or prevent any recurrence.

Compliance in Shionogi means compliance not only with laws, rules and regulations, but also with social standards, and it also includes ethical behavior. This approach underpins every aspect of our business. We have published the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy, under which all directors and employees are required to comply with laws and regulations as well as practice ethical behavior. Our intention is for all employees to consistently hold themselves to the highest ethical standards in order to support sustained growth for Shionogi. Shionogi promotes compliance in all departments and units through a structure centered on the Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the President and Representative Director and includes among its participants members of the Corporate Executive Management Meeting. The Compliance Unit sits within the General Administration Department and provides support for compliance initiatives proposed by the Compliance Committee as well as undertaking a variety of activities including compliance training and surveys. In cooperation with the Compliance Unit, compliance managers (head of each organization) work together with compliance promoters (at least one appointed from each department) on devising compliance initiatives specific to each department or unit.Serving to once again remind all executives and employees of the importance of compliance and to increase their awareness, the Shionogi Compliance Handbook was produced to help them put compliance into practice. We are working to instill awareness of compliance by posting \"check\" items related to initiatives and ideas that should be practiced on a daily basis in conjunction with the setting of \"discussion points\" for each item to encourage discussion in the workplace. In recent years, the importance of CRM has grown due to the increase in the number of Group companies. In fiscal 2019, we visited all Group companies as a committee to work toward identifying issues and thoroughly managing them. Shionogi holds annual training sessions for compliance managers and promoters, and the attendance rate in fiscal 2019 was 100%. The Chairman of the Compliance Committee himself talks about its importance and strives to foster awareness and promote understanding of compliance. Having established compliance reporting desks that can be used by employees and third parties, we are making every effort to detect at an early stage and thus prevent violations or prevent any recurrence. Users of the reporting system are increasing as a result of thorough training for all directors and employees as well as the distribution of emergency and helpline desk contact cards.In addition to the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA)'s Code of Practice Understanding Promotion Month every November, having agreed with the purpose of the Corporate Compliance & Ethics Week established by the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE), we decided on In addition to complying with laws and industry voluntary norms, Shionogi strives to earn the trust of society by establishing its own compliance policy based on higher ethical standards.Concept Chart Compliance Promotion Structure (As of April 2020)Shionogi Group Compliance Policy Compliance promotion structure and activitiesShionogi Compliance Handbook Ensuring high ethical standards and transparency in business activities Initiatives to improve transparency Anti-corruption/anti-bribery initiatives Responsible promotional activities R&D ethics Operation and management of public research expenses and initiatives against research improprietiesStrict compliance Ensuring high ethical standards and transparency in business activitiesCompliance promotion structureCompany-wide instilling of compliance Compliance Risk Management (CRM) Internal reporting system Shionogi Global Compliance WeekNovember 1, 2019 to implement this as an initiative to instill compliance not only in Japan but also globally.

Against this backdrop, Shionogi is working to evaluate and reduce business risks with an awareness that water shortages and worsening water quality are issues that impact all business activities, including pharmaceutical manufacturing. In addition, resource conservation and resource circulation have become global environmental issues due to the environmental pollution caused by marine plastics and other factors. For its part, Shionogi is striving to suppress waste generation and promote the reuse and recycling of resources, as the Group uses and disposes of numerous resources as raw materials for pharmaceutical products and research materials. With regard to plastics, Shionogi is promoting appropriate disposal and reduction in the amount of plastics used for its products.There are concerns that climate change could have a catastrophic impact on economic and social systems on a global scale, and a rapid transition to a non-carbon society has become an urgent social issue worldwide. Climate-related risks and the transition to a non-carbon society are issues that impact almost every industry, and Shionogi evaluates its risks and works to reduce them. In addition to assessing and responding to the impact of climate change, to meet the social demands for the disclosure of the relevant information, we are expanding the disclosure of climate change-related information with reference to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.At Shionogi, we have built up a company-wide management system based on the Shionogi Group EHS Policy, the environmental activities of which embrace not only the Group but also its supplier partners.*1 Contributing to society is essential for achieving our 2030 Vision, and we recognize global environmental protection is a material issue for the Shionogi Group.
