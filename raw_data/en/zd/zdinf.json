SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY 21 In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development ofwholeness in those served. Individuals, created by God to reflect the wholeness of His character, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is therestoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through human agen-cies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a body of knowledge and arepertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems. The School of Nursingprovides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competenceand Christian grace. PHILOSOPHY OF NURSING EDUCATION In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the phi-losophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the followingbeliefs: Learning is an interactive process which involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes the maturing of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spir-it of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nurs- ing competence. Students \u2014 influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, devel- opmental, and spiritual variables on their lives \u2014 learn in different ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience.Philosophy22 SCHOOL OF NURSING SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION The dean of the School is the chief administra- tive officer and is assisted by the associate deans for the undergraduate and graduate pro-grams and the assistant dean for financial affairs.The administration and faculty are responsible fordetermining curriculum requirements, admittingstudents, instructing and evaluating students,encouraging activities and programs pertinent tothe welfare and interest of students, assessing fit-ness for promotion and graduation, and carryingout other functions essential to the overall opera-tion of the School.

Notations WWithdrawal, given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar daysbefore the final examination week.Withdrawals during the first fourteen calen-dar days of a quarter or the first seven calen-dar days of a summer session are notrecorded if the student files with the Officeof University Records the appropriate formprior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outsidethis time frame upon recommendation ofthe dean may be removed at the discretionof the vice president for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal froma course prior to completion of 80 percent ofthe course, excluding the final examinationperiod. Withdrawals during the first 20 per-cent of a course, excluding the final exami-nation period, are not recorded if the stu-dent files with the Office of UniversityRecords the appropriate form prior to thedate when this 20 percent of the course iscompleted. A student may withdraw only once from anursing or named cognate course that s/he isfailing at the time of withdrawal . UW Unofficial Withdrawal, indicates that the student discontinued class attendanceafter the close of registration but failed towithdraw officially. I Incomplete, given when the majority of the course work has been completed, andcircumstances beyond a student's controlresult in the student being unable to com-plete the quarter. An I notation may bechanged to a grade only by the instructorbefore the end of the following term(excluding the summer sessions for thosenot in attendance during that term).Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By the use of the petition form, the student requests an I notation from the instructor,stating the reason for the request andobtaining the signatures of the instructor,the department chair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor.The instructor will then report the I nota-tion on the grade-report form, as well asthe grade that the student will receive if thedeficiency is not removed within the timelimit. The petition form is then filed withthe Office of University Records along withthe grade-report form. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination,absence from final examination for otherthan an emergency situation, or a lowgrade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress, indicating that the course has a duration of more than a single term andwill be completed by the student no laterthan the final term of the course, not toexceed five quarters for independent studyand research courses (original quarter ofregistration plus four additional quarters).The student's final grade will be reportedon the instructor's grade report at the endof the term in which the course is complet-ed. If the course work is not completedwithin the five-quarter time limit, a gradeof U will be given. AU Audit, ind icating registration for atten- dance only, with 80 percent class atten-dance considered a requirement. Arequest to change a credit course toaudit or an audit course to credit may bemade no later than the fourteenth calen-dar day after the beginning of a quarteror the seventh calendar day after thebeginning of the summer session. (Thisdoes not address short summer courseslasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal, given for withdrawing from the course or to indicate that the 80percent class attendance requirementwas not observed. Course numbers Courses numbered 001-099 are remedial and carry clinical; 901-999, continu-ing education without academic credit. A limited amount of 500-level course work may apply toward a baccalaureate degree, provid-ed the instructor and the associate dean give per-mission. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s,or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. Unit of credit Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents ten class hours in lecture or thirtyhours in laboratory practice (a ratio of 1:3).NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equalcomponents of theory and clinical laboratorypractice. A grade for a nursing course represents acombination of the theory and the clinical labora-tory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, astudent must receive a grade equivalent to a C orabove in both the theory and clinical laboratorysections of the course. A grade of C- or belowplaces the student on provisional status and thecourse must be repeated. Class preparation Assignments are planned to require approxi- mately two to three hours of preparation by thestudent for each hour of class. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the studenthas supervised experience in the care of patients.Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Absences due toextenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illnessor death in the family) may be made up at the dis-cretion of the instructor.When a clinical laborato-ry is made up during nonclinical time, there is a$50 make-up fee. Attendance Attendance at class, clinical laboratory, and chapel is expected. Chapel attendance records arepart of the student's permanent record. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for com-puting grades: 94 -100% A 62% F Repeating a course Any nursing course or named cognate course taken at Loma Linda University School of Nursingin which the earned grade is C- or lower must berepeated before the student can progress to anothercourse. Named cognates are: developmental psy-chology, epidemiology, nutrition, sociology, and sta-tistics. When a student repeats a course, both theoriginal and repeat grades are entered on the stu-dent's permanent record; but only the repeat gradeand credit are computed in the grade point averageand included in the total units earned.ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 3738 SCHOOL OF NURSING Change of grade A grade may not be changed by the instructor except when an error has been made in comput-ing or recording the grade. Such changes areacceptable up to the end of the following term. SPECIAL COURSE WORK The following special course work is subject toapproval by the appropriate offices in the School of Nursing. Directed study With the approval of the teacher and the adviser, directed study courses may be available. Continuing education Continuing education does not carry academ- ic credit. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Challenge/equivalency examinations An undergraduate student may meet academ- ic requirements by passing an examination atleast equal in scope and difficulty to examinationsin the course. Undergraduate students with prioreducation in nursing or in another health careprofession are eligible to challenge nursing cours-es required for California state licensure. Theapplicant's background in health care theory andclinical experience must be commensurate withthe theory and skills required for the course.Challenge examinations in nursing coursesinclude both a written examination covering theo-ry and an examination of clinical competence. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion ofthe challenge examination. A grade of S is record-ed for challenge credit earned by examinationonly after the student has successfully completeda minimum of 12 units of credit at this Universitywith a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. A fee is charged for achallenge examination. For further information,see the \"Schedule of Charges\" (page 27). CLEP examinations Scores at or above the 50th percentile on the subject examinations are required for collegecredit from College Level Examination Program(CLEP) examinations. Advanced Placement Program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the School for an entering student who has passedone or more examinations of the AdvancedPlacement (AP) Program with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Waiver of a required course A student may request the waiver of a requirement by either taking an examination ordemonstrating competence when prior coursework or experience fulfills the requirement butdoes not qualify for transfer of credit. Forms towaive a requirement are available at the Office of the Associate Dean. A waiver does not reduce thecredit-hour or residency requirements, does notcarry academic credit, and may not be repeated. TRANSFER CREDIT Only academic course work with a minimumgrade of C (2.0) will be accepted for transfer credit. Course descriptions or outlines will berequired to determine the acceptability of acourse or the amount of transfer credit to begranted for clinical nursing courses. Lower-division credit A maximum of 105 quarter units of lower- division credit will be accepted toward a Bachelorof Science degree. Accredited schools and colleges Credit is accepted from accredited schools of nursing. Unaccredited colleges and international schools Credit transferred from an unaccredited col- lege is evaluated and accepted only after a studenthas earned 12 units of credit with a grade pointaverage of C (2.0) or better at Loma LindaUniversity. See further transcript informationunder \"International Students.\" Credit from foreign schools Credit from foreign schools is given only for work that has been evaluated by the NationalAssociation of Credential Evaluation Services, Inc. Armed forces schools Credit for studies taken at a military service school is granted according to recommendationsin the Guide of the American Council on Education.

The studentwill be returned to the regular schedule the quarterimmediately after the G.P.A. falls below 3.0. Probation status and dismissal A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Requiredcognates include: developmental psychology, epi-demiology, nutrition, sociology, and statistics. Eachnursing course and/or required cognate in which astudent receives a C- or below must be repeated. Anursing course or required cognate may be repeatedonly once. A student with a C- or below in a nursingor required cognate is placed on probation. A student on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 under the supervision of theLearning Assistance Program (LAP), have anassessment done at the Teaching Learning Center (TLC), and meet regularly scheduled appoint-ments with an academic adviser. Students on pro-bation status may take only one clinical nursingcourse at a time. When the course work has beenrepeated successfully, the probation status isremoved and the student is returned to regularstatus. Enrollment in clinical nursing courses willbe terminated if a student receives two provisionalgrades in nursing or required cognates. Reinstatement A student terminated from clinical nursing courses for receiving a second provisional grademay be considered for reinstatement by theAcademic Review Committee after successfullycompleting the course work outlined by them. Athird provisional grade will result in the student'stermination from LLUSN. School records All official documents related to student progress in the curriculum are a part of the stu-dent record.

Permission for the conferral of a degreeACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 39in absentia is granted by the University upon rec- ommendation of the dean of the School. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, Autumn, orWinter Quarter is invited, but not required, to par-ticipate in the subsequent conferring of degrees.Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by acandidate who has not satisfactorily compliedwith all requirements. STUDENT POLICIES School of Nursing students are expected toadhere to the policies of the University as pre- sented in the Student Handbook under the head- ing \"Standards of Academic Conduct Policy.\" ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE APPEAL PROCESS Appealing a grade If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor,where appropriate; then with the lead teacher;and finally with the associate dean. If the studentis not satisfied, s/he may then appeal in writing tothe Academic Review Committee, whose decisionis binding. Dismissal from school for academic reasons The Academic Review Committee may vote that a student be dismissed from the School onthe basis of his/her overall academic performance.Specific deficiencies in academic performancewhich may result in the Academic ReviewCommittee recommending that a student be dis-missed from the School include: a. receiving more than two provisional grades in nursing and/or cognate courses taken whileenrolled as a student on this campus, b. unsafe practice(s) in the clinical setting, and/or c. academic dishonesty. Academic due process Actions recommended by the Academic Review Committee other than dismissal from theSchool are not subject to appeal beyond the com-mittee. Actions that are not subject to appealinclude, but are not limited to, requiring a studentto do remedial work (including repeating acourse) in a course in which the student receiveda failing grade in either the theory or clinical por-tion. Grievance If the student feels s/he has a grievance, i.e., believes s/he can show that the decision to drophim/her from the School is unfair, the studentmay file a grievance, as follows: 1. The student must file a grievance within one quarter from the date on which the appeal was denied by the Academic ReviewCommittee. A grievance will not be reviewed if it is not filed within this time frame. The grievance process is not available to indi- viduals-- who fail to achieve admission or readmis- sion to the School, or who take exception to the terms and condi- tions of admission or readmission. 2. The student requests that the dean appoint a grievance committee to evaluate the situationand to make a recommendation to the dean.This request must be presented in writingand must include pertinent informationregarding the situation. 3. The dean, upon receipt of a written petition for grievance, appoints a committee of threefaculty members selected from faculty of theSchool who were not previously parties to thereview of this case. The fourth, nonvoting fac-ulty member, from the Academic ReviewComittee, is also selected by the dean to meetwith the Grievance Committee. TheGrievance Committee may interview the stu-dent, faculty, clinical faculty, or other individ-uals who may be knowledgeable about the sit-uation. 4. The committee renders a written recommen- dation to the dean upon completion of theirreview. 5. After reviewing the findings and recommenda- tions of the Grievance Committee, the deanmakes a decision, which is final and binding.The student is notified of this decision inwriting. NONACADEMIC DISCIPLINE APPEAL PROCESS Discipline It is inevitable that a student's conduct will come under question if the student: neglects nonacademic obligations or other stu- dent duties; displays social conduct that is unbecoming; demonstrates immaturity or deficiencies in judgment; and/or violates policies or regulations of the Univerity and/or the School.An illustrative list of the expectations regarding student conduct can be found in Section Two of theLoma Linda University Student Handbook . Alleged student misconduct is subject to review by theSchool of Nursing to determine whether discipline isappropriate. Discipline may include dismissal. When a student fails to observe the University or School of Nursing policies or regulations which gov-ern nonacademic and nonclinical general conduct,the following discipline procedures are instituted: 1. Upon receipt by the associate dean or dean of a serious allegation of misconduct, a studentmay be suspended from the School, pendingand during the immediate investigation of the40 SCHOOL OF NURSINGACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 41 allegations. Suspension shall mean that the student may not attend class, meet clinicalappointments, attend campus events, or bepresent on campus without permission fromthe dean or designee. The process for evaluating alleged miscon- duct follows: 2. The individual alleging the misconduct files a written allegation with the dean or the associ-ate dean. 3. The dean or the associate dean then conducts an informal investigation. At the conclusionof this informal investigation, the dean or theassociate dean (or designee): decides that the allegations lack a substan- tive basis for further investigation; or decides that there is a substantive basis to jus- tify continuing the investigation, and refersthe matter to the Student Conduct Committee(which is made up of faculty who are mem-bers of the Student Affairs Committee). Student Conduct Committee If the case is referred to the Student Conduct Committee, the committee takes the following steps: 1. The associate dean or the dean provides the committee with the allegations of misconductand any other information pertaining to thealleged misconduct. 2. The Student Conduct Committee notifies the stu- dent in writing of the allegations and of the sup-porting information provided to the committee. 3. The Student Conduct Committee interviews the student, as well as those bringing the alle-gations. The student may appear before thecommittee in the meeting room with a repre-sentative from the faculty of the School ofNursing but may not be accompanied by fam-ily, friends, or legal counsel. In addition, the committee may interview anyone else whom it determines can helpclarify the merits of the allegations. The stu-dent may request that specific witnesses beallowed to appear before the committee insupport of the student.The student may present new information not previously submitted to the dean, the associatedean, or the Student Conduct Comittee, if rel-evant to the allegations. It is the responsibilityof the student to provide any new informationor witnesses to the committee at the time theStudent Conduct Committee meets; failure todo so will constitute grounds for the commit-tee to discontinue its investigation. 4. The Student Conduct Committee deliberates on its findings. Neither the student norhis/her representative may be present duringthe deliberations. 5. The Student Conduct Committee may con- clude either that: there is no substantive evidence of the alleged misconduct, and then recommendto the associate dean that the allegationsbe dismissed; or the allegations are supported by substantive evidence of general (nonacademic and/ornonclinical) misconduct, and then recom-mend to the associate dean that the originaldiscipline be upheld or that further discipli-nary measures be instituted, up to andincluding dismissal. 6. The associate dean gives the student written notification of his/her decision. Grievance If the student feels that the appeals process has not resulted in a satisfactory or fair resolution,s/he may proceed to grievance by following thesteps outlined for \"Grievance,\" discussed underthe heading ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE APPEAL PROCESS, with the following exception: The stu- dent must file the petition regarding the griev- ance no later than one month after the date thediscipline was to take effect. Following a review by the Grievance Committee and the dean's consideration of theirrecommendation, the action of the dean is finaland binding.42 SCHOOL OF NURSING III THE PROGRAMS Curricula Undergraduate Program Bachelor of Science Degree Associate in Science Degree Option Graduate Program in Nursing CLINICAL OPTIONS Master of Science DegreePost-Master's Certificates COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS Master of Science / Master of Public Health Master of Science / Master of Arts NURSING ADMINISTRATION OPTIONS Postbaccalaureate CertificateMaster of Science Degree DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREETHE PROGRAMS 4344 SCHOOL OF NURSING Curricula The sections that follow describe the undergraduate curricula offered by the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science degree and Associate in Science degree option)and the graduate curriculum offered by the Graduate School, and list the courses for each. School of Nursing students are expected to operate under the general policies ofthe University and School and the specific policies of the program in which they areenrolled. The School reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep cur-rent with trends in health care. Undergraduate Program BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE ASSOCIATE IN SCIENCE DEGREE OPTION The primary aim of the School of Nursing undergraduate nursing program is to pre- pare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and toChristian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. However, in response to both societal and students'needs, an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree option is provided for students after theyhave completed all nursing and general education content necessary to prepare for licen-sure as a registered nurse in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. Thefocus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills fromthe humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary,secondary, and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups andsocioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, whichaddresses stressors to the client system. The undergraduate program begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed atany accredited college or university. Following six quarters of clinical instruction and addi-tional general education and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing,the student is eligible to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state boardexamination. After completion of another two quarters, the student is eligible to receive theB.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. Theclinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progres-sive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning,implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division,where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components ofupper-division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, andactivities which foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all mem-bers of the health care team.UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 4546 SCHOOL OF NURSINGLOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSING Graduation Requirements Bachelor of Science degree: Undergraduate Program 193 quarter units Associate in Science degree: 138 quarter units PREREQUISITES: Intermediate Algebra (or H.S.

In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and schooldepartments on campus. Central library The Del E. Webb Memorial Library is the central library of Loma Linda University. Its historical rootsgo back to 1907, when a small library collection wasstarted in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium.In 1953 the growing collection was moved to its ownbuilding on the Loma Linda campus. Then in 1981, anew library building was built from a grant by the DelE. Webb Foundation, giving the library a total floorspace of 87,670 square feet. This structure nowhouses the main library, while the old structure isnow shared between the Department of Archives andSpecial Collections and the bound retrospective jour-nals. As of June 2001, the library has a total collec-tion of 410,807 books, bound and currentjournals/periodicals, and media items (197,303books; 125,577 bound journals, 1,420 current peri-odical subscriptions, 349 nonsubscription periodi-cals; and 84,158 media items). Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of the University'sinstructional, research, and service programs.
