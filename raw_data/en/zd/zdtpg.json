What is the purpose of Alternative Link's testimony? Alternative Link seeks designation of the ABCcodes as an additional national adm inistrative code set under HIPAA. Alternative Link offers answers to likely concerns of the NCVHS: Has Alternative Link f ollowed the directives of the DSMOs? Does a gap exist in coding? Why does a gap exist? How should the gap be filled? How m uch overlap exists between ABCcodes and existing standard code sets? What guidelines are in place for use of the codes? What experience did Alternative Link have with the DSMOs? How could the DSMO process be im proved? What else should the DSMOs and NCVHS understand? 2. Has Alternative Link follow ed the directives of the Designated Standards Maintenance Organiz ations (DSMOs) specified in Change Request Numbers 137 (dated 1/31/01) and 493 (dated 9/20/01)? Yes, Alternative Link has followed the directives of the DSMOs specified in Change Request Num bers 137 (dated 1/31/01) and 493 (dated 9/20/01). In the following sections, Alternative Link reviews past actions and sum marizes m ore recent actions not yet reported to the DSMOs. The DSMOs gave Alternative Link four (4) directives. 1. Indicate why HCPCS, CPT and NDC are not m eeting business needs. 2. Approach HCPCS coding authorities to see if ABCcodes could be incorporated into HCPCS. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building Inc.

Approach CPT coding authorities to see if ABCcodes could be incorporated into CPT. 4. Dem onstrate health plan [and other user] support for \"these categories\" (i.e., alternative medicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions). Directives #1, 2 and 3. In relation to DSMO Directives #1, 2 and 3, Alternative Link has communicated to the DSMOs both verbally and in writing why existing HCPCS and CPT codes and coding system s are not m eeting all of the healthcare industry's critical business needs. Alternative Link notes below why existing NDCs and the NDC coding system are not meeting these sam e business needs. HCPCS. To sum marize, HCPCS1 \"contains codes orthotics; injectable and other services not found in CPT.\"2 HCFA/CMS does not develop procedure codes. This fact was supported verbally on 09/07/01 and in writing on 03/13/ 02 by C. Kaye Riley, HCPCS Coordinator.3 4 CPT. \"CPT: Physicians' Current Procedural Term inology is used by physicians and other healthcare professionals to code their services for adm inistrative transactions.

These difficu lties are n oted in docum ent is avai lable upon request . In an em ail com munication, dated 03/20/02--copi ed to the HIPAA experts -the Director expressed support for a collaborative relationship but did not answer five direct questions posed by Alternative Link in a telephone conversation on 03/19/02. These questions were as follows: 1. How can we [the AMA and Alternative Link] jointly ensure code review is tim ely, so that coding is quickly available for health services research, tracking and paym ent of services currently being rendered, and actuarial analyses by payers and others? 2. How can we efficiently categorize, assess a nd incorporate the 4000 service and supply codes Alternative Link has already researched and validated? 3. How can we address the variability in state licensing requirem ents and scope of practice laws that affect non-physician interventions? (In developing the ABCcodes, Alternative Link captured code and practitioner specif ic data on this variability. Allopathic care does not f ace such state-by-state variability and, consequently, the CPT application process does not account for interventions that have state endorsem ent but m ay or m ay not have national acceptance. If the answer is to this challenge is to use Category II or III codes, how could we do so without prom pting insurers to deny claim s because the interventions are coded as measurem ent tools or as investigational or experim ental care? ) 4. How can we ensure that the code review process does not subject non-physician practitioners and coding to allopathic physician biases when the CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel is made up solely of physicians and the coding application instructions include wording such as, \"The inclusion of...(Category I)...codes is generally based upon the procedure being consistent with contemporary medical practice and being performed by many physicians in clinical practice in multiple locations.\" 5. How can we ensure Alternative Link's intellectual property is protected when the code application requires us to prospectively \"assign to the AMA all rights including copyrights\" when the ABCcodes are already copyright protected? The CPT Director's email stated that AMA was interested in cooperating with Alternative Link, but since it did not address the direct questions the Director verbally had agreed to answer in writing, a collaborative relationship was not established.8 On 3/20/02, Alternative Link made a second attempt to establish a collaborative relationship by sending the Director an email and letter to reiterate Alternative Link's need for writte n answers to the direct questions. Alternative Link received no response. On 04/02/02, Alternative Link left a voicemail message for the Director to ask if any communications were forthcoming and to reiterate Alternative Link's desire to collaborate. Alternative Link remains open to a collaborative relationship with the AMA. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc. Conf ident ial and propriet ary. All rights reserved.

National Drug Codes \"are used in reporting prescription drugs in pharmacy transactions and some claims by healthcare professionals.\"9 NDCs do not address procedures and therefore will not support procedures delivered by non-conventional and non-physician practitioners. NDCs cannot be used effectively for botanicals, nutritional supplements and homeopathic remedies because many of these are delivered in bulk form and most are regulated as food substances and not drugs. Therefore, NDCs cannot accommodate supplies associated with non- conventional and non-physician care. Further, NDCs are no longer required in X12N claims transactions because NDCs are not widely used by the health insurance industry on claims transactions between healthcare practitioners and insurance payers. For these reasons, NDCs will not support HIPAA code set objectives related to alternative medicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions. Directive #4 . In relation to DSMO Directive #4, Alternative Link has already demonstrated \"support for health plans supporting/paying for these categories.\"10 Alternative Link's demonstration of this support was confirmed wh en the DSMOs wrote that the only outstanding item in relation to their four directives was the request that Alternative Link once again approach CPT, as described above.11 A copy of the DSMOs' communication is available upon request. To demonstrate this and other industry support, Alternative Link submitted letters from industry thought- and practice-leaders, including the following: American Bar Association's Com mittee on Com plementary and Alternative Medicine American Massage Therapy Association American Nurses Association American Preventive Medical Association Association of Bodywork & Massage Professionals Midwives Alliance of North Am erica State Associations of Acupuncture and Chiropractic Additional evidence of the demand for ABCcodes and the ABCcoding system's value to health plans can be found in \"Comments on Proposed Rule, Health Insurance Reform Standards for Electronic Transactions (Refer to File Code HCFA-0149-P\" prepared by Alternative Link and submitted to HCFA/CMS on 06/30/98.

Finally, growing market interest in the ABCc odes and ABCcoding system is demonstrated by Alternative Link's pilot programs and/or working relationships with the following organizations: An HMO/PPO/IDN/TPA that Serves Boeing, Ce ssna, Leer, Raytheon and Other Large, Medium and Small Employers (Preferred Health Systems) A National PPO Network (American Healthcare Alliance) Two National Clearinghouses (Mitchell Medical and NaviMedix) Two Medical Publishers (Delmar/Thomson Learning and Relative Value Studies, Inc.) Several Industry-Leading Consulting Firms (e.g., PricewaterhouseCoopers) Numerous Integrative Medicine Centers and Academic Research Institutions (e.g., University of North Carolina) To ensure the ABCcodes would provide ongoing value in accordance with the objectives of HIPAA, Alternative Link has been active in the following Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) and standard-influencing organizations: American National Standards Institute/Accredited Standards Committee (ANSI X12N) Health Level 7 (HL7) Data Interchange Standard Association (DISA) Computer-based Patient Record Institute (CPRI) American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) American Holistic Health Association (AHHA) Supplemental information supporting this section and the value of the code set is provided in a document entitled, \"Testimony to the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics by the American Nurses Association and Alternative Link Regarding the ABCcodes for Alternative Medicine and Nursing,\" dated 02/06/02, prepared for testimony that was originally scheduled for 02/06/02. This document is available upon request. To fully understand the value of ABCcodes and the limitations of using existing standard code sets, the Committee is encouraged to review three directly related publications available from Alternative Link, upon request: The CAM and Nursing Coding Manual, \u00a92001, Alternative Link and Delm ar/Thom son Learning The State Legal Guide to Com plementary and Alternative Medicine and Nursing, \u00a92001, Alternative Link and Delm ar/Thom son Learning Relative Values for CAM and Nursing, \u00a9 2001, Relative Value Studies, Inc. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

File Code: 00005-NCVHS Code Set Test imony--2002 .04.02-3. doc 5/ 14/02 13: 57 Page 5 of 21 These publications show that the code set 1) contains heretofore unavailable and gravely needed inform ation, 2) is widely distributed, 3) is affordable, and 4) is ready to be im plem ented on a national basis. To sum marize, the above notes and referenced docum ents dem onstrate that Alternative Link has: 1. why HCPCS, CPT and NDC are not m eeting business needs. 2. Approached HCPCS coding authorities to see if ABCcodes could be incorporated into HCPCS. 3. Approached CPT coding authorities to see if ABCcodes could be incorporated into CPT. 4. Shown health plan support for \"these categor ies\" (i.e., provided evidence of widespread industry support for ABCcodes to facilitate transactions and capture data related to alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions). 3. Does a gap exist in coding? Yes, a gap exists. This is evident because adding ABCcodes as a HIPAA-nam ed code set would accom plish each of the ten (10) guiding principles for standards noted in the Federal Register.12 If the existing standard code sets were sufficient, the ABCcode set would provide no increm ental benefit in relation to these principles. However, ABCcodes would add considerable increm ental value. ABCcodes will: Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by leading to cost reductions for and im provem ents in benefits from electronic healthcare transactions.13 The nam ed code sets do not deliver all of the efficiency and effectiveness needed by the healthcare system . ABCcodes supplem ent these code sets to im prove the way the industry transacts business in relation to alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions. For exam ple, while CPT theoretically could develop num eric codes for these interventions, CPT is m issing a critical design and data elem ent that is essential for supporting regulatory compliance, provider contracting, utilization m anagem ent, claim s managem ent, actuarial analyses and outcom es research. 12 Federal Register/Vol.63, No. 88/ Thursday , May 7, 1998/ Proposed R ules. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Inc.

That is, if CPT codes were developed for alternative m edicine, nursing and other non- physician interventions using existing CPT num eric structures, the CPT codes would not generate the functionality and value that the industry needs.14 15 The needed design and data elem ent\u2014an alphanum eric m odifier that identif ref lect state-specif ic licensing/term inology\u2014is included in ABCcodes. Th is modifier is paired with a state field on a standard claim form or transaction to ensure the claim is within the provider's legal scope of practice. It offers the added value of supporting outcom es research by practitioner type without com promising HIPAA privacy standards. Thus, increm ental code set efficiency and effectiveness are assured by ABCcodes because these codes not only fit into CPT data fields and work with existing healthcare inform ation system s, but also provide unique claim edit/scrub f unctionality required to assure com pliance with state scope of practice laws. This unique f unctionality has been broadly tested and is urgently needed by the industry 1) to ensure com pliance with HIPAA fraud and abuse regulations and 2) to support m eaningful actuari al analyses in support of benefit plan design and cost-effective, evidence-based and integrative healthcare. Meet the needs of the health data standards user com munity, particularly healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses.16 Alternative Link's ABCcodes m eet the needs of the health data standards user com munity, particularly healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. Alternative Link received verification from healthcare provide rs, health plans and clearinghouses that the ABCcodes deliver m issing inform ation; add significant value in m anaging access, quality and cost; and would be readily adopted if nam ed a code set under HIPAA. Further, Alternative Link has com piled m arket data and trade journal articles that point to the need f or the f unctionality delivered by ABCcodes. Evidence of this support is available upon request. Be consistent and uniform with other HIPAA standards\u2014their data elem ent definitions and codes and their privacy and security requirem ents\u2014and, secondarily, with other private and public health data standards.17 14 See \"C omments on Proposed R ule, Heal th Insurance R eform Standards for El ectronic Transact ions (R efer t o File Code HCFA-0149-P),\" prepared by Alternative Link, 06/ 30/98. 15 See an em ail from C.

ABCcodes were designed for this specific purpose. Alternative Link has been involved with healthcare standard-setting organizations since the Com pany's inception. These organizations include: American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) American Holistic Health Association (AHHA) American National Standards Institute/Accredited Standards Committee (ANSI X12N) Computer-based Patient Record Institute (CPRI) Data Interchange Standard Association (DISA) Health Level 7 (HL7) The design, functionality and use of ABCcodes supports the goals of these organizations. Evidence of consistency and uniformity with industry standards is available upon request. Have low additional developm ent and im plem entation costs relative to the benefits of using the standard.18 ABCcodes have low additional developm ent and im plem entation costs relative to the benefits of their use as a standard. ABCcodes have the sam e num ber of data elem ents as CPT/HCPCS codes, fit into CPT/HCPCS data fields, and can be easily downloaded into existing healthcare inform ation system s. However, ABCcodes support even greater functionality than CPT/HCPCS codes. Because of this, the benefits of using ABCcodes as a standard code set far exceed developm ent and im plem entation costs. The ABCcodes require virtually no alterations to healthcare stakeholders' software applications, healthcare inform ation system s, or standard operating procedures. Yet, ABCcodes allow healthcare stakeholders to address the care delivered by alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician providers in a m anner that supports state law\u2014a capability heretofore unattainable. NCVHS m ay wish to note that the population of alternative m edicine, nursing and other non- physician practitioners is m ore than triple the population of allopathic physicians. Public demand for com plementary and alternative m edicine (not including nursing and other non- physician interventions) is significantly higher than public dem and for prim ary care delivered by allopathic physicians, and the dem and for CAM is growing m ore quickly than that of allopathic care. Further, by using ABCcodes in com bination with standard code sets, healthcare stakeholders will begin to capture evidence of the relative safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of non- conventional, conventional and integrative healthcare. 18 Federal Register/Vol.63, No. 88/ Thursday 1998/ 25274.

Evidence of this is available upon request. Be supported by an ANSI-accredited standards de veloping organization or other private or public organization that will ensure continuity and efficient updating of the standard over time.19 ABCcodes are supported by an ANSI-accredited st andards developing organization, as well as other private and public organizations. This f act will ensure continuity and ef ficient updating of the code set over tim e. ABCcodes were voted into ANSI X12N 004022 and are included the guides for ANSI X12N 004050. Additional ABCcodes m ay be requested by anyone and are system atically developed in coordination with academ ic institutions, centers of excellence and specialty associations representing alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician practitioners. Updating of ABCcodes is assured by a publicly available coding application and a fully developed coding process described in Alternative Link's publications and website (www.alternativelink.com ). The coding process is inclusive and supports over a dozen licensed non-conventional and/or non-physician care providers. Evidence of appropriate organizational support and a copy of the coding process are available upon request. Have tim ely developm ent, testing, im plem entation and updating procedures to achieve administrative sim plification benef its faster.20 As noted above, the developm ent, testing, im plem entation and updating procedures for ABCcodes have been verified by the Nationa l Library of Medicine, Unified Medical Language System . Further, users have installed and are using the ABCcode database. Thus, the code set is fully functional and m arket-ready, and it will rapidly deliver administrative sim plification benef its. 19 Federal Register/Vol.63, No. 88/ 1998/ 25274. Sout h Main St Inc.

Evidence of this is available upon request. Be technologically independent of the com puter platform s and transm ission protocols used in electronic health transactions, except when they are explicitly part of the standard.21 ABCcodes are published in a coding m anual and are technologically independent of the computer platform s and transm ission protocols us ed in electronic health transactions. The codes can be used electronically or on standard paper claim form s. Evidence of this is available upon request. Be precise and unam biguous, but as sim ple as possible.22 ABCcodes are precise. For exam ple, CPT offers 4 codes that describe chiropractic manipulation, based on body regions only. In com parison, ABCcodes offers 5 additional codes that describe chiropractic m anipulation, based on body regions and types of tissue, as well as 16 codes that describe joint adjustm ents, 3 that describe strapping techniques, and 17 m obility treatm ents. ABCcodes are unam biguous. Each alpha sym bol has a specific m eaning and each m eaning is echoed in the procedure description. For exam ple, CCAAJ refers to soft tissue manipulation (AJ, in fourth and fifth positions, representing the specifics of the intervention), Chiropractic m anipulation (A, in the third position, representing the general type of intervention), Chiropractic services (C, in the second position, representing the care subcategory), Practice specialties (C in the first position, representing the care category). The expanded definition for CCAAJ is \"The app lication of force by hand or device to soft tissue structure to restore norm al anatom ical and/or physiological structure and function.\"23 ABCcodes are sim ple. They include five alphabetic characters that identify the service or supply. ABCcodes are m odified by two alphanum eric characters that serve to identify the practitioner type. CCAAJ indicates a chiropractic intervention. The m odifier \"1A\" indicates the service was delivered by a licensed chiropractor. The 5-character alpha, 2-character modifier, when paired with the state code on a claim form, can be read by a claim edit/scrub application to determ ine whether that intervention is legal in the noted state when delivered by a particular practitioner type. For exam ple, if the code was \"CCAAJ-1A\" and the state was \"MI\" for Michigan, the claim would be denied because chiropractors in Michigan m ay only work on the spine. However, if the sam e code was used in New Mexico, the claim would pass because chiropractors are considered prim ary care practitioners in New Mexico and m ay use \"all natural agencies to assist in the healing act.\" 21 Federal Register/Vol.63, No. 88/ Thursday , May 7, Proposed 25274.

Further evidence of code set precision, lack of am biguity and sim plicity is available upon request. Keep data collection and paperwork burdens as low as feasible.24 The ABCcodes keeps data collection and paperwork burdens as low as feasible\u2014and signif icantly lower than the burden still associated with current code set standards. The ABCcodes are sufficiently granular to avoid the need for generic CPT codes that m ust be supplem ented by written docum entation. For exam ple, without ABCcodes, claim s adjusters (reviewing claim s with generic CPT codes) m ust intervene in an otherwise autom ated processes to identify the intervention, estab lish acceptance of the intervention as valid medical practice, and research the legality of the delivery of the coded intervention by that practitioner type in that state. If the adjuster f ails to do this, the insurance organization risks processing fraudulent claim s and m ay incur substantial fines and, potentially, crim inal indictm ent. ABCcodes allow for autom ated perform ance of these critical claim review and verification steps. Further, expanded def initions associated with ABCcodes greatly reduce the need f or written docum entation. Finally, autom ated data warehousing, querying and analytical capabilities associated with ABCcodes reduce the need for m anual data collection and paper record review to perform actuarial analyses needed for benefit plan design and developm ent of cost-effective, evidence-based and integrative healthcare. Further evidence of the data collection and paperwork reduction associated with ABCcodes is available upon request. Incorporate f lexibility to adapt m ore easily to changes in the healthcare inf rastructure (such as new services, organizations and pr ovider types) and inform ation technology.25 ABCcodes are flexible and accom modate changes in the healthcare infrastructure, especially the em ergence of new services and provider types. In fact, the ABCcode application and developm ent process captures data on em erging technologies, practitioners and delivery system s far m ore quickly than the processes associated with existing standard code sets (CPT/HCPCS). 24 Federal Register/Vol.63, No. 88/ Thursday , May 7, Proposed 25274.

Further, ongoing review of state law ensures practitioner-identifying m odifiers are added as states grant licensure to new categories of healthcare practitioners. If new healthcare organizations em erge, relevant codes can be assigned on an as needed basis. If new inform ation technology em erges, the codes can be readily incorporated since they consist of m achine-readable alphabetic and num eric characters. Because of its alphabetic structure, the ABCcoding system can accom modate over 11 m illion new services and supplies. Further evidence of ABCcoding flexibility and adaptability is available upon request. To sum marize, then, the gap in code set standards exists because current code sets (CPT, HCPCS, NDC, CDT) do not sufficiently descri be alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions delivered by licensed healthcare professionals. Further, current code sets cannot incorporate the im bedded intelligence needed to facilitate claim s edits/scrubs required for non-conventional and non-physician claim s. Finally, CPT, HCPCS and NDC processes are not designed to accom modate developm ents in alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician practices. Thus, current code sets are inadequate to serve the industry's needs. Without the detailed and structured coding offered by ABCcodes, the industry is forced to: 1. Manually adjudicate claim s\u2014even if those claim s are subm itted electronically. 2. Overlook interventions perform ed by non-conventional and non-physician practitioners; 3. Use relatively \"generic\" codes that do not adequately describe their interventions; and 4. Refer to inaccurate codes that are only gross approxim ations of services or supplies. The first circum stance\u2014intervening m anually to adjudicate claim s\u2014underm ines the very purpose of standardized transactions and code sets and m ay com promise patient privacy. The second circum stance\u2014overlooking non-physician practitioners\u2014com prises the disenfranchise s non-conventional and non-physician practitioners from the benefits of adm inistrative sim plification, b) creates patient privacy challenges by placing patient data outside the protections afforded to electronic inform ation, and c) compromises efficiencies that could be achieved if the healthcare system could capture 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

The point of codes and code sets is to describe interventions in a m anner that supports adm inistrative simplification, claim s paym ent and public health. Generic codes lum p different interventions into a relatively useless pool of data and therefore do not accom plish this. The fourth circum stance\u2014use of inaccurate codes that describe only rem otely related interventions\u2014results in erroneous data that underm ines the reliability of healthcare inform ation, com promises actuarial analyses and\u2014perhaps worse\u2014prom ulgates fraud and abuse (i.e., illegal use of codes).26 Just as som e 8,000 CPT codes are needed to adequately describe the interventions perform ed by allopathic physicians, thousands of ABCcodes are needed to adequately describe the interventions perform ed by dozens of categories of alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician practitioners. Allopathic physicians receive broad and specialized training in their fields, which are reflected in CPT code s. Licensed alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician practitioners also receive broa d and specialized training in their fields. This non-physician training is reflected in ABCcode s, but is not reflected in CPT codes. ABCcodes currently address som e 4,000 non-conventional and non-physician services and supplies delivered by over a dozen practitioner types. The developers of ABCcodes already have relationships with thought- and practice-leaders representing other categories of non- conventional and non-physician practitioners and have begun categorizing their patterns of care for the purposes of expanding the ABCcodes to address their needs. Thus ABCcodes describe interventions that CPT codes do not describe, serve practitioners that CPT codes do not serve and support developm ents that CPT codes cannot yet support. 4. Why does the gap exist? Of all the code set standards, CPT is the closest to ABCcodes. That notwithstanding, CPT does not adequately serve m arket needs related to alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions. This fact appears to be a result of two things: 1) the AMA's focus on allopathic physician care and 2) CPT code design. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building Inc. Conf ident ial and propriet ary.

File Code: 00005-NCVHS Code Set Test imony--2002 .04.02-3. doc 5/ 14/02 13: 57 Page 13 of 21 26 Note, for exam ple, codi ng gui dance offered i n \"AC A's Offi cial Chiropract ice Coding Sol utions 2001,\" (AC A Press, 2001). The AMA focuses on physician m embership and allopathic m edicine. Alternative Link believes this is evident in the AMA's patterns of litigation27 as well as their corporate communications.28 The AMA's CPT code design and application process do not lend them selves to tim ely or effective developm ent of non-conventional and non-physician codes. First, as noted above, the CPT codes them selves are structurally incapable of including coded \"intelligence\" required by the industry to m anage care, claim s and outcom es associated with non- conventional and non-physician interventions. Second, the CPT application process supports subm ission of one to several codes at a tim e and the m arket needs thousands of codes to support current healthcare insurance benefit plans and transactions. The few non- conventional and non-physician codes that have been developed under CPT are so \"generic\" that they do not adequately describe the interventions they are purported to code. These codes are therefore ineffective in achieving the goals of HIPAA, let alone of industry stakeholders. This fact is evident in the benefit plan \"carve outs\" that healthcare insurance organizations have had to use for non-conventional and non-physician benefits. That is, insurers have had to put caps on num bers of non-conventional and non-physician visits and dollars spent for visits because the insurers cannot tell what is being delivered and whether the delivered services or supplies have any m eaningful outcom es. All of this suggests that considerable strategic repositioning would be required by the AMA and considerable reengineering would be requi red of its CPT coding process to accom modate healthcare industry needs related to alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions. This situation creates a public health challenge on several levels. First, codes docum ent care. The absence of a com prehensive code set for non-conventional and non-physician services forces caregivers to deliver care without reliable evidence of what works and what does not. Second, perceiving allopathic physician biases against non-conventional and non-physician care, patients seldom tell their physicians about non-allopathic healthcare interventions the patients are receiving. W hen physicians are unaware of non-conventional and non-physician interventions, physicians m ay make less appropriate care decisions. Care decisions m ade without full knowledge of patient circum stances can com promise the quality of care patients receive and can affect public health. 27 Note, fo r example, the lawsu it between the Am erican Chiropractic Association and the Am erican Medical Association, implying restrain t of trade by the latter ag ainst the former. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building Inc.

Also , note that articles p ublished from the perspectiv e of physician practitio ners dominate th e AMA's journal (JAM A). Despite these circum stances, public spending suggests that dem and for com plementary and alternative m edicine (not including nursing and other non-physician interventions) is increasing at a com pounded annual growth rate of 38%. This m eans the gap in code sets is becom ing m ore significant and dangerous with tim e. 5. How should the gap be filled in a w ay that would support administrative simplification and public health? For the reasons noted above, a separate code set is needed for alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions. Alternative Link believes the ABCcodes should be nam ed the standard code set for non-conventional and non-physician interventions. The ABCcodes provide functionality that is necessary to support the objectives of HIPAA. 6. How much overlap exists betw een ABCcodes and existing standard code sets? In 1998, Alternative Link licensed a crosswalk to AMA's CPT codes to allow healthcare stakeholders to capture data on both ABCcodes and CPT codes used by alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician practitioners. Subsequently, in response to AMA pressure, Alternative Link discontinued the crosswalk, retired m ost billable ABCcodes linked to CPT codes and added non-billable reference codes for X-rays, m inor surgeries and diagnostic tests, that direct coders to use CPT codes. These reference codes are needed to allow for appropriate claim s edits/scrubs, as described above. As of 02/28/00, the overlap with AMA's CPT codes was less than 10%. Alternative Link believes this overlap is even lower today, since additional codes have been developed by Alternative Link in areas not addressed by CPT. 7. What guidelines are in place for use of the codes? The ABCcodes are support by guidelines endorsed by ANSI X12N. ANSI X12N 004022 assigned a code s that ABCcodes 004050 included an im plem entation guide that describes how to use ABCcodes. Further, three publications include com plete guidelines on developm ent, use, valuation and obsolescence of ABCcodes and related inform ation. These include: CAM and Nursing Coding Manual published in 2001 by Delm ar/Thom son Learning State Legal Guide to CAM and Nursing published in 2001 by Delm ar/Thom son Learning Relative Values for CAM and Nursing published in 2001 by Relative Value Studies Incorporated. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

What experience did Alternative Link have with the Designated Standards Maintenance Organiz ations? Alternative Link found the DSMOs to be difficult to educate about 1) the unique aspects of coding for alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician services and 2) allopathic physician biases of the AMA that could com promise public health and, potentially, represent restraint of trade. For exam ple, the DSMOs had difficulty understanding that the ABCcodes could fulfill federal mandates under HIPAA and also ensure industry com pliance with state laws--and that this was essential to effective functioning of the healthcare system and to public health. Further, the DSMOs repeatedly asked Alternative Link to approach the AMA, despite Alternative Link's repeated com munications that, in past encounters initiated by Alternative Link in the interest of collaborating, the AMA had exhibited uncooperative and even predatory behavior. Finally, despite Alternative Link's repeated offers over the last year to attend m eetings and be \"officially heard\" about these m atters, the NUCC and NUBC did not schedule tim e to hear Alternative Link's testim ony. (Interestingly, NUCC is perm anently chaired by the AMA.) Without allowing for this testim ony, a m ember of the DSMOs suggested in a public forum that Alternative Link had been som ehow inappropriate in its interactions with the DSMOs and code set authorities. That f orum\u2014a national HIPAA conf erence\u2014included dozens of Alternative Link's prospective custom ers. The public statem ent by the DSMO m ember resulted in the loss of a viable lead with a leading insurance organization that was already offering a healthcare insurance benefit related to alternative m edicine, nursing and other non-physician interventions\u2014and that had expressed interest in the f unctionality provided by the ABCcodes. 9. How could the DSMO process be improved? The DSMO process appears to be designed for organizations with \"deep pockets.\" Smaller organizations, such as Alternative Link, are hard-pressed to m obilize resources toward educating DSMO m embership about the benefits of HIPAA related solutions. Addressing a sim ilar challenge faced by organizations developing technologies for the public good, the Food and Drug Adm inistration set up a \"Division of Sm all Manufacturers Assistance.\" This division provides guidance and resources to help sm aller organizations com ply with federal mandates. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

What else should the DSMOs and NCVHS understand? Alternative Link rem ains willing to cooperate and collaborate with other code set authorities and asks only that DSMO and NCVHS leadership work with these authorities to preem pt any predatory behavior. Alternative Link is providing the f ollowing editorial (written f or an international healthcare technology journal that targets chief inform ation, technology and operating officers at provider and payer organizations) to help com mittee m embers understand the unique value of the ABCcodes and the im portance of nam ing this code set a standard. Improving Clinical and Financial Outcomes in Healthcare Background A new set of alphanumeric codes for nursing and al ternative medicine and three global trends are improving healthcare accessibility, quality and cost management w orldw ide. Alternative Billing Codes, known as ABCcodes, offe r healthcare leaders one of the m ost powerful tools available to m anage healthcare access, quality and costs. ABCcodes reflect three trends in healthcare leadership behavior that generate im provem ents in the health of populations: 1) use of non-conventional and integrative m edical practices, 2) use of electronic standards, and 3) reliance on evidence-based m edicine. ABCcodes are 5-characters in length and consist of letters that represent thousands of services and supplies used for nursing and non-conventional m edicine\u2014also known as com plementary and alternative m edicine (CAM). These codes are supplem ented by 2-digit identifiers, called code modifiers , that describe the practitioners involved in a particular intervention. For exam ple, ABCcode \"AEBAD-1E\" represents 15 m inutes of holistic nutrition provided by a naturopathic physician. The codes and code m odifiers are us eful in understanding, evaluating and guiding the financing and delivery of CAM interventions. ABCcoding can be expanded to identify practices and products delivered by m ore than 1,200 different types of healthcare practitioners. The code set offers m ore than 11.8 m illion code com binations\u2014enough to describe current and em erging m odes of care for centuries to com e. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

CAM services and supplies represented by ABCcodes include acupuncture and Oriental m edicine; Ayurveda; botanical m edicine; chiropractic, clinical nutrition; conventional and holistic nur sing; holistic m edicine; hom eopathy; indigenous medical traditions; m and and nutrition; osteopathy; and physical, occupational and vocational therapy. Related CAM supplies include herbal m edicine, dietary supplem ents, hom eopathic rem edies, and other products. ABCcodes prom ote evidence-based m edicine to ensure that patients receive the m ost prom ising healthcare available. Evidence-based m edicine optim izes patient health, reduces costs, and allows healthcare system s to better m anage constrained resources. The codes help integrate clinical, operational and adm inistrative processes both within and across organizations. This increases system -wide efficiency; im proves clinical, opera tional and financial decision-m aking by providing timely insight into the delivery of healthcare services; and results in m ore favorable outcom es. ABCcodes fit into the healthcare inform ation system s used by governm ents, insurance com panies, healthcare delivery organizations and healthcare pr actitioners. W arehoused within those inform ation system s, ABCcodes can be m ined and analyzed to achieve a variety of desirable endpoints. Am ong these are 1) understanding how CAM is currently used, 2) determ ining how non-conventional medicine com pares in m edicine, and 3) developing integrative and evidence-based approaches to im proving outcom es. Using ABCcodes, practitioners and adm inistrators gain valuable insight on m anaging resources and improving efficiency. ABCcodes help com pile info rmation on each clinical encounter; convert that information into a patient m edical record, bill or insurance claim ; and autom ate financial transactions (such as insurance claim s processing and paym ent). ABCcodes and CAM interventions provide new ways for healthcare financing and delivery systems to meet patient demand, improve care and save money. The m ajority of the world's population uses CAM as the prim ary form of healthcare. Dem and for CAM is well entrenched in m any countries and is rapidly growing in countries that used to rely largely on western m edicine. In India, an estim ated one-third of the population uses hom eopathic medicine, another third uses Ayurvedic m edicine and the final third uses western or integrative medicine.29 In the United States, where western m edicine has predom inated healthcare for over 100 years, CAM is growing at a com pounded annual rate of 38%. In fact, dem and for CAM is so great in the US that, in 1997, about 63% m ore visits were m ade to CAM practitioners than to prim ary care physicians (PCPs).30 29 Davi d Riley, MD, in correspondence dat ed January 3, 2002. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc.

Adoption of uniform code sets varies worldwide. Most countries and organizations code diseases and healthcare conditions using International Classifi cation of Disease codes (ICD-9/-10). W ith this approach, healthcare leaders can track costs on a per disease/condition basis. Although codes are available for conventional and non-conventional healthcare products and services, som e healthcare leaders have not yet begun to use these codes to link clinical interventions to ICD codes.31 Without linking ICD diagnoses codes to interventions, and then linking interventions to paym ents, healthcare outcom es cannot be traced back to the services and supplies from which they resulted. Healthcare leaders who rely only on ICD coding cannot determ ine what drives or prevents healthcare inefficiencies. In contrast, leaders in countries and organizations that adopt uniform codes not only for diagnoses, but also for services and supplies, can m ore easily control the financing and delivery of healthcare. Clearly, ABCcodes provide a way to better control the outcom es of CAM interventions and m anage healthcare access, quality and cost. Reliance on ABCcodes and other electronic standard s allow s healthcare payers, hospitals, clinics and practitioners to save money, to improve clinical decision-making, and to generate more favorable outcomes of care. Whether for m anual or electronic processes, uniform ity of standards is essential to healthcare system and organizational efficiency. Chief inform ation and technology officers and their internal custom ers need ABCcodes to stream line data entry, to determ ine the costs of different approaches to medicine, and to identify those practices that result in the m ost favorable outcom es. These codes, used in conjunction with ICD diagnostic codes, provide a way for governm ents, healthcare insurance com panies, provider organizations and practitioners to control escalating healthcare costs and effectively address growing dem and for integrative m edicine. Accom panied by RVUs (relative value units), ABCcodes also allow for legal and appropriate pricing of healthcare services and supplies. By attaching a value indicator or RVU to each ABCcode, healthcare leaders can establish and m onitor pricing by diagnosis, service and supply. RVUs establish rational com parative values f or CAM interventions. RVUs can be m ultiplied by euros, yen, pounds, dollars or other international currencies to create a legal and rational price for any CAM intervention in the region where the intervention is provided. That is, the price of any ABCcoded service or supply can be set by m ultiply ing the RVU by a conversion factor (CF) that represents a currency am ount (e.g., a CF of $5US). To calculate regional CFs, decision-m akers and analysts can divide the regional cost of a known CAM intervention by its relative value. The result will be an estim ated CF for the region, useful in establishing a CF for all ABCcodes. Using this approach, healthcare financing and delivery organizations can create legal and logical fees for each CAM service or supply. Because rates vary by location, the CF for RVUs m ay vary but the RVU itself rem ains fixed. As a result, this pricing system for ABCcodes and CAM interventions can be quickly adapted to any region of the world. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building C Inc. Conf ident ial and propriet ary.

By providing uniform standards for clinical com munication, value determ ination and financial transactions, ABC codes and RVUs help healthcare decision-m akers m ake better clinical and administrative decisions, help healthcare organizations and system s save m oney, and help patients gain access to appropriate care. ABCcodes support evidence-based medicine, w hich facilitates the natural evolution of healthcare and, ultimately, results in increased health for greater numbers of individuals. Ideally, healthcare leaders learn continuously, from the practice of m edicine, about which healthcare interventions work best. ABCcodes and RVUs help governm ents, insurance com panies, provider organizations and practitioners alike warehouse , mine and analyze encounter, diagnosis, treatm ent and cost data using internal inform ation system s or Internet-based application service providers (ASPs). By m anaging data in this way, these entities can evaluate which interventions generate more favorable outcom es under which circum stances. They can also m ore effectively m anage the financial and clinical resources at their disposal. ABCcodes provide institutional and national soluti ons to the challenges of improving healthcare accessibility, quality and cost management. Organizations and nations have long needed a global code set to capture data, develop statistics, and guide decisions about non-conventional healthcare interventions. Now, with ABCcodes, healthcare entities around the world can share inform ation on nursing and CAM services and supplies to help improve access, quality and cost m anagem ent. In addition, by relying on the ABCcode developers' scope of practice (SOP) data m anagem ent capabilities, healthcare leaders can effectively respond to SOP and licensure differences across regions, specialties and interventions. Nearly every country and organization stands to gain efficiencies and effectiveness from the use of these codes. For exam ple, in the US, an estim ated 30% of the $1.2 trillion US annually spent on healthcare results from clinical and adm inistrative inefficiencies,32 and $30 billion US of this is thought to be a direct result of healthcare transaction inefficiencies. Precedents for e-com merce enabled savings are well established, for exam ple, in the banking industry (with unified m essage form ats and codes to process bank transactions) and in retail (with universal product codes [UPCs] to facilitate supply ch ain m anagem ent). Just as banks save on labor costs for tellers and data entry personnel, and retailers save on labor costs for checkout clerks and inventory m anagers, healthcare organizations that use uniform code sets for e-com merce save labor on data entry personnel, claim s processors, case m anagers and m any other positions. Moreover, these organizations are able to provide ever-increasing quality, supported by outcom es data. 1065 Sout h Main St reet Building Inc. Conf ident ial and propriet ary. All rights reserved.

Developers work closely with payers, providers and academ ic organizations to ensure CAM interventions com ply with healthcare licensing requirem ents and help reduce the risk of providing or paying for services and supplies that fall outside a practitioner's training or legal SOP. Three readily available publications offer international thought- and practice-leaders a baseline understanding of ABCcodes, RVUs and SOPs: The CAM and Nursing Coding Manual Relative Values for CAM and Nursing The State Legal Guide to Complementary and A lternative Medicine and Nursing (United States) One thought- and practice-leader in integrative m edicine currently relies on these m anuals and has already em erged as an innovator in the academ ic and clinical application of ABCcodes, RVUs and SOPs. Dr. David Riley is board certified in internal m edicine, experienced in a variety of CAM modalities, actively involved in clinical research, and the editor of the largest peer reviewed and indexed m edical journal of alternative m edicine in the world.33 He has been the principal investigator on a variety of international research projects, conducted random ized placebo controlled clinical trials, m anaged outcom e studies and data co llection networks and participated in a variety of regulatory research projects. Dr. Riley pairs ABCcodes with outcome measurement tools to evaluate the most efficient use and mix of western medicine and CAM interventions. This pairing allows for the documentation of details about CAM services and supplies used in treating patients. In turn, this provides him with insight on the care delivered, as well as the resulting economic, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction outcomes.34 Dr. Riley suggests that healthcare leaders can best m ake use of the results of his and other CAM outcom es studies and random ized controlled trials when these research initiatives accurately docum ent the services delivered. He thinks this is best done using a globally applicable procedure code set accom panied by relative values and legal data. He believes that the CAM code developers' ABCcodes, RVUs and SOP data will allow healthcare leaders to im prove clinical and f inancial outcom es, and also f acilitate benef it plan developm ent and contracting by linking CAM interventions to practitioner licensure and legal scope of practice. W ith these unif orm standards, he foresees cost-effective integration of nursing and alternative m edicine into m ainstream healthcare. 33 Alternative Therapi es in Heal th and Inc.
