Confidentiality _____________________________________________________________________ 1. B ACK GROUND AND PURPOSE Background. The National Park Service (NPS) can achieve its public trust responsibility to provide effective and efficient arduous duty services only by fielding a well -trained, fully capable workforce. A healthy workforce is the key to avoiding lost work time due to injury and illness. In 1993, the NPS officially determined that its designated law enforcement and firefighter positions would be managed under the provisions of enhanced annuity retir ement (as authorized by 5 USC 8336(c)). The purpose of enhanced annuity retirement is to enable agencies to field a workforce capable of performing the arduous positions of law enforcement and firefighting. Under the authority of 5 CFR part 339, \"Medical Qualification Determinations,\" the NPS may establish medical standards when the duties of a position are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status or fitness because the nature of the positions involves a high degree of responsibility toward the public. Accordingly, the NPS has approved standards for 2 commissioned park rangers, criminal investigators, and those park ranger positions that have been designated for enhanced law enforcement cov erage, as well as other arduous duty personnel. The standards and this Order (as supplemented by RM -57A) are consistent with and implement Department of the Interior requirements for designated positions performing arduous duties. [*See text box at the b ottom of this page.] Policy and other guidance for other arduous duty medical standards programs is limited and, to a limited extent, articulated in other documents. The ultimate goal of the arduous duty Medical Standards Program is to include all NPS pos itions involving arduous duties requiring medical qualification approval. In addition to meeting legal requirements, the intent of the Medical Standards Program is to improve the safety and professionalism of all employees who perform arduous duties. The Medical Standards Program is used to determine whether a disease process, physical impairment or limitation, and/or medication necessary for treatment has the potential to adversely affect reliable performance of the essential NPS arduous duty job functio ns, and thereby pose unacceptable risks to Government interests and to public and employee safety. Arduous duty personnel must be ready, willing, and able to safely and efficiently perform the full range of essential duties and responsibilities of their position, under sometimes harsh, unforgiving, unpredictable and, at times, life -threatening conditions. These are bona fide occupational qualifications for such positions. The requirement to perform the full range of essential duties and responsibilities e xtends to: (a) Service- wide availability; (b) 24 -hour availability or after -hours call back; and (c) the ability to perform full, unrestricted arduous duties. Even if some of the essential, critical duties are rarely, or never, required to be performed, N PS arduous duty personnel must at any given moment be ready, willing, and able to perform them. Purpose. The purpose of this Director's Order (as supplemented by RM -57A) is to establish policies and operational procedures for the arduous duty Medical Standards Program covering arduous duty law enforcement positions. Some of these law enforcement positions may also include wildland firefighting or structural fire fighting as a collateral duty. This Director's Order aims to help fulfill the goal of having a workforce of arduous duty employees capable of performing their duties safely and effectively, with a high degree of responsibility toward themselves, their co- workers, the public, and national security concerns. *Note: \"Arduous\" is the operable word in t he regulation that governs appointments , whereas \"rigorous\" is the operable word in the regulation that governs retirements . \"Arduous position,\" as defined in 5 CFR 339.104 (governing appointments ), mean s a position that is dangerous or physically demanding to such a degree that an incumbent's medical condition is necessarily an important consideration in determining ability to perform safely and efficiently. \"Rigorous position,\" as defined in 5 CFR 842.802 (governing retirement eligibility ), means a position the duties of which are so rigorous that employment opportunities should, as soon as reasonably possible, be limited (through establishment of a maximum entry age and physical qualifications) to young and physically vi gorous individuals. To avoid confusion, this Order uses the word \"arduous \" in place of \" rigorous. \" 3 Guidance on other NPS arduous duty medical standards programs - including dive, search and rescue, wildland fire, and structural fire - can be found in their respective Director's Orders or reference manuals. With further regard to structural fire, primary duty law enforcement or wildland fire employees who have structural firefighting as a collateral duty will be compliant if they meet the medical requirements of their primary duty position; employees in any primary duty position other than law enforcement or wildland fire must meet NFPA -1582 standards. 2.

E MPLOYEE APPEALS Failure to meet a properly established medical standard or physical requirement means that the employee is not qualified for the position unless a waiver or reasonable accommodation is requested and approved, as outlined in 373 D M 15 (Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities). The two Service levels of appeal for these requests are the WRP and the Board . A. Waiver Review Panel The WRP will be a first level of appeal for employees with specific waiver requests, with or without reasonable accommodation, and will be composed of three voting members and one non-voting member. Repr esentation will be as follows: 8 MSPM or designee (serves as chair; non -voting), Human Resource s representative (voting), Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Service s representative (voting), and Visitor and Resource Protection or Park Official (voting) . The MRO may be present for the WRP as an advisor, but not as a voting member. If the waiver is granted by t he WRP, then the employee is considered medically qualified. If the request is denied by the WRP, then the employee may appeal to a second and final Service level of appeal, to the Board. B. Medical Review Board The Board will be composed of five voting members (or their designees) and three non - voting members. Representation will be as follows: Chief, Division of Employee and Labor Relations (chairperson); Chief, Risk Management Division (voting member); Chief, of the arduous duty discipline of the employee (voting member); Two senior field representatives (voting members appointed by the chairperson); MRO (non- voting); and MSPM (non- voting); and A representative from the Office of the Solicitor (non- voting). If the Board grants the waiver request, the employee is considered medically qualified. If the Board denies the request, then the employee remains not medically qualified and this is the final Service determination. In accordance with 370 DM 771.1.7R (Administrative Grievance Procedures), this disqualification determination is not subject to the administrative grievance procedure. Also in accordance with 370 DM 771.1.7R (Administrative Grievance Procedures), an applicant cannot appeal the medical standard s disqualification determinations, and cannot avail him/herself of the administrative grievance procedure. No Authority for Attorneys' Fees. There is no right to have an attorney or other representative present at these proceedings. In the event, however , that the employee requests and is granted the ability to have an attorney present, there is no authority for reimbursement of attorneys' fees. 5. C ONFIDENTIALITY It is Department of the Interior policy to protect its deliberative process in order to ass ure the free flow of ideas and candid discussion of alternatives, which are essential to its efficient operation. Therefore, all deliberations and any documents produced from the deliberations of the Board, with the exception of any final decision issued by the Board, are to be kept confidential and may not be disclosed without an order from a Federal court of competent jurisdiction. Attorneys in the Office of the Solicitor may assert the deliberative process privilege without obtaining prior permission from the NPS. "}
