CDPH Sanitarians conduct inspections for new businesses, existing businesses and in response to a complaint. There Are Different Types Of Health Inspections Business License Health Inspections New food establishments, or a transfer of ownership, that are applying for a business license must pass a health inspection by CDPH before the license will be issued. After an application for a license has been filed with the [Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection,](/content/city/en/depts/bacp/provdrs/bus.html) a health inspector from the CDPH will contact the applicant to arrange for an inspection. The applicant can schedule an appointment with the Health representative at the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection at [312.744.5430](tel:312.744.5430), [312.74.GOBIZ](tel:312.744.6249) (744.6249). During the inspection, the health inspector will assess the types of food that will be prepared and the methods used for preparing and serving the food. This information will be used to assign a 'risk-level' - risk 1, 2 or 3 - to the food establishment. This risk level will be used to determine how frequent a food establishment needs to be inspected. Routine Health Inspections Once a food establishment is licensed and operating, a health inspector will periodically conduct unannounced inspections. The frequency of these inspections is based on the risk level assigned to the establishment. In general, risk 1 establishments are inspected twice per year, risk 2 establishments once per year, and risk 3 establishments every other year. If problems are identified, the establishment may face fines or possible closure, depending on the severity of the problems. Complaint-Based Health Inspections CDPH receives around 4,000 complaints against food establishments each year. In response, CDPH health inspectors conduct unannounced inspections at the establishment. Ways to Prepare for a Health Inspection You should know what to expect, here are some ways to prepare: - Download the Chicago Municipal Code that outlines all of the requirements that food establishments must meet: [City of Chicago Municipal Code (chapters 4-8, 7-38, 7-40, and 7-42)](/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/general/Food_Protection/2019_COC_FoodCodeOrdinance_Apr232019.pdf)and the [Chicago Board of Health Rules and Regulations.](/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/general/Food_Protection/FoodCodeRules_Effective_Feb12019.pdf) - Attend a free Inspection workshop geared towards new businesses, offered once a month by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection: [monthly workshop offered by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.](/content/city/en/depts/bacp/sbc/business_educationworkshopcalendar.html) Health Code Violations During routine inspections, or in response to a complaint a health inspector may issue one or more citations to the food establishment. These citations are based on the following violations: Priority Violations This category includes such occurrences as: - Inadequate storage temperatures - Improper food handling practices - Improper personal hygiene - Rodent and/or insect infestation - Lack of hot running water Priority violations create an immediate health hazard that carry a high-risk of causing food-borne illness. Priority violations must be corrected immediately; if they cannot be corrected immediately, the license will be suspended, and the food establishment must close. Once the violations are corrected, the food establishment operator must sign an affidavit stating the violations have been corrected, and schedule a follow-up inspection All violations must be corrected in order for the establishment to reopen. Priority Foundation Violations This category includes such occurrences as: - No certified food manager - No written employee health policy - Food not properly protected from contamination during storage, preparation, display, service, or transportation - Inadequate pest control Priority Foundation violations create a potential health hazard if not corrected in the timeframe specified by the health inspector. If serious violations are identified, an unannounced follow-up inspection will be conducted by the health inspector at a later date. Core Violations Core violations include such occurrences as: - Poorly constructed or maintained walls, ceilings or floors - Improper storage of soiled and clean linens, coats, and aprons Core violations do not pose an immediate threat to the public's health. A follow-up inspection is not performed if there are only Core violations. No citations are issued for Core violations.
