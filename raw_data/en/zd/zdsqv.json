One of the most powerful and versatile of these modalities is massage therapy. Far from being simply an enjoyable health-spa activity, massage can help the body repair itself, feel better, and function more normally -- especially when it's included as part of a holistic treatment program at our clinic. The Benefits and Uses of Massage Massage is a type of manipulative therapy that focuses on treating the soft tissues of the body, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia (a type of connective tissues that surrounds other tissues). Rubbing, kneading, or stroking these tissues with the right technique can relax tight muscles and muscle knots, reducing pent-up stress while eliminating aches and pains. This makes it a useful tool for treating back pain, neck pain, headaches, chronic strain conditions, fibromyalgia, insomnia, and prenatal discomfort. Massage can also speed the healing of tissues by making more blood available to them and carrying away fluid. Chiropractic and Massage Therapy for West Broward County Chiropractic and massage therapy offers a powerful one-two punch against a wide range of conditions. Simply combining massage therapy treatments with chiropractic adjustments can help you get more out of those adjustments. That's because the muscles, once relaxed by a massage treatment, don't fight against the adjustments, thus allowing those adjustments to have a greater effect. Massage also makes a smart complement to other healthy strategies such as lifestyle changes to take stress off of your musculoskeletal system and corrective exercises to help your muscles and connective tissues function as they should. Care Chiropractic Center offers a variety of massage therapy techniques for West Broward County residents. You may benefit from: - Swedish massage, a gentle massage technique that improves circulation, reducing inflammation and swelling, and promotes relaxation - Deep tissue massage, a firm massage technique that frees muscles and releases scar tissue deep within the body - Trigger point therapy, a technique for releasing the trigger points that cause many kinds of referred pain - Sports massage, which both relaxes the body in preparation for athletic competition and helps to rehabilitate sports injuries Ready to Put Massage to Work for Your Health?
