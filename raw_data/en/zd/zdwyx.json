But vaccination rates have slowed and are below target levels in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. While there are many causes of vaccine hesitancy, several studies have found that fear of side effects is the one of the most important. Although COVID-19 vaccine side-effects are rare, how the media presents these risks may amplify concerns. Addressing public concerns over vaccine side effects is key to improving the uptake of vaccines and booster doses, which has been even lower than primary vaccine series uptake. Studies show that how risk is presented affects people's risk perceptions and behavior. To learn more about how COVID-19 vaccine risk framing affects risk perception, Sudharsanan et al. enrolled 8,998 people from the United States and the United Kingdom in an online randomized controlled trial. Participants received information about a hypothetical new COVID-19 vaccine, including its side effect rate, and reported their perception of safety and whether they would take the vaccine. The experiments showed that adding the label \"very low risk\" when describing vaccine side effect rates increased the number of people who said they would take the vaccine by three percentage points. Comparing the risks of the hypothetical vaccine to the much higher chances of motor vehicle deaths increased an individual's willingness to take the vaccine by 2.4 percentage points. Combining both framing strategies increased people's desire to get vaccinated by 6.1 percentage points. Deploying these two strategies in vaccine risk communications may help increase primary and booster vaccinations against COVID-19. A next step would be to measure both vaccination intentions and vaccination rates to confirm these strategies. "}
