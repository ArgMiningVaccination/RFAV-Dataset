J Janet T Relaxing and Delicious Used this tea in addition to Stomach Soother to get me through cancer treatments. I feel it was very helpful in gently detoxing and also providing relaxation. I'll continue to drink it and have just sent some to a friend who is just starting cancer treatments. A Adriana A cup of yum! I just had a warm and delicious cup of this detox tea! So calming and relaxing. Highly recommend. Taste is mild and heavenly. L Lorena H. Pretty good tea I really enjoyed this tea. I may purchase more, but the shipping costs are pretty high, so I haven't decided yet. Hi Lorena, Gosh, I know, shipping rates keep increasing. Fortunately, we offer FREE shipping on all orders over $50, so I hope this helps! Yes! In fact, we encourage steeping your tea leaves more than once to explore how our teas change each time you brew them. However, we do recommend adding another minute or two to your total steep time with every new brew. HOW LONG DOES LOOSE LEAF TEA STAY FRESH? From the date of purchase, your loose leaf tea will be at peak freshness for a year. We are obsessed with freshness and potency, which is why we make each blend in small batches in our tea store in Phoenix, Arizona. "}
