What is Anthroposophic Medicine? Working with Nature for Your Health Anthroposophic medicine is a form of medical practice developed by Rudolf Steiner that combines spiritual insight with practical diagnosis and healing to address the body as a whole. Conventional and complementary practices are integrated with homeopathics, plant medicines, and natural remedies to create holistic treatments. Over time, other therapeutic disciplines such as art, music, massage, and movement therapy have developed within the broader anthroposophic practice. "}
