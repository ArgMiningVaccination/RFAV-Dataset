Objectives: To investigate the effects of a protein-reduced, Nordic complementary diet on body composition, growth, biomarkers, and dietary intake, compared with current Swedish dietary recommendations for infants at 12 and 18 mo. Methods: Healthy, term infants (n = 250) were randomly allocated to either a Nordic group (NG) or a conventional group (CG). From 4 to 6 mo, NG participants received repeated exposures of Nordic taste portions. From 6 to 18 mo, NG was supplied with Nordic homemade baby food recipes, protein-reduced baby food products, and parental support. CG followed the current Swedish dietary recommendations. Measurements of body composition, anthropometry, biomarkers, and dietary intake were collected from baseline and at 12 and 18 mo. Results: Of the 250 infants, 82% (n = 206) completed the study. There were no group differences in body composition or growth. In NG, protein intake, blood urea nitrogen and plasma IGF-1 were lower compared to CG at 12 and 18 mo. Infants in NG consumed 42% to 45% more fruits and vegetables compared to CG at 12 and 18 mo, which was reflected in a higher plasma folate at 12 and 18 mo. There were no between-group differences in EI or iron status. Conclusions: Introduction of a predominantly plant-based, protein-reduced diet as part of complementary feeding is feasible and can increase fruit and vegetable intake. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02634749. The bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL) was as a lipolytic enzyme expressed by the exocrine pancreas and in some species, notably humans, the lactating mammary gland, being secreted into the duodenum and with the mother's milk, respectively. However, BSSL is also present in the blood and has been assigned additional functions, even beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Conventional BSSL knockout mice are protected from developing disease in animal models of arthritis, and antibodies directed towards BSSL prevent or mitigate disease in similar models. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BSSL as a newly discovered player in inflammation and specifically in inflammatory joint disorders. As part of mechanism of action, we here show that BSSL is secreted by neutrophils, interacts with monocytes and stimulates their migration in vitro. An anti-BSSL antibody that blocks the human BSSL-monocyte interaction was shown to simultaneously prevent the signaling pathway by which BSSL induce cell migration. Moreover, in this cohort study we show that BSSL levels are significantly higher in blood samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis compared to healthy controls. The BSSL levels in patients' blood also correlated with disease activity scores and established inflammatory markers. Hence, although the mode of action is not yet fully clarified, we conclude that BSSL could be considered a proinflammatory component in the innate immune system and thus a possible novel target for treatment of chronic inflammation. Protein intake is higher in formula-fed than in breast-fed infants during infancy, which may lead to an increased risk of being overweight. Applying alpha-lactalbumin (-lac)-enriched whey or casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP)-reduced whey to infant formula may enable further reduction of formula protein by improving the amino acid profile. Growth, nutrient intake, and protein metabolites were evaluated in a randomized, prospective, double-blinded intervention trial where term infants received standard formula (SF:2.2 g protein/100 kcal; n = 83) -lac-enriched (CGMP-RW;1.76 g protein/100 kcal; n = 80) from 2 to 6 months. Breast-fed infants (BF; n = 83) served as reference. Except between 4 and 6 months, when weight gain did not differ between -lac-EW and BF (p = 0.16), weight gain was higher in all formula groups compared to BF. Blood urea nitrogen did not differ between low-protein formula groups and BF during intervention, but was lower than in SF. Essential amino acids were similar or higher in -lac-EW and CGMP-RW compared to BF. Conclusion: Low-protein formulas enriched with -lac-enriched or CGMP-reduced whey supports adequate growth, with more similar weight gain in -lac-enriched formula group and BF, and with metabolic profiles closer to that of BF infants. BACKGROUND: Formula-fed infants are at increased risk of infections. Due to the cross-talk between the mucosal systems of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, adding synbiotics (prebiotics and probiotics) to infant formula may prevent infections even at distant sites. Infants that were born full term and weaned from breast milk were randomized to prebiotic formula (fructo- and galactooligosaccharides) or Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F19 (synbiotics) from 1 to 6 months of age. The objective was to examine the synbiotic effects on gut microbiota development. RESULTS: Fecal samples collected at ages 1, 4, 6, and 12 months were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a combination of untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These analyses revealed that the synbiotic group had a lower abundance of Klebsiella, a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium breve compared to the prebiotic group, and increases in the anti-microbial metabolite d-3-phenyllactic acid. We also analyzed the fecal metagenome and antibiotic resistome in the 11 infants that had been diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (cases) and 11 matched controls using deep metagenomic sequencing. Cases with lower respiratory tract infection had a higher abundance of Klebsiella species and antimicrobial resistance genes related to Klebsiella pneumoniae, compared to controls. The results obtained using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing were confirmed in silico by successful recovery of the metagenome-assembled genomes of the bacteria of interest. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the additional benefit of feeding specific synbiotics to formula-fed infants over prebiotics only. Synbiotic feeding led to the underrepresentation of Klebsiella, enrichment of bifidobacteria, and increases in microbial degradation metabolites implicated in immune signaling and in the gut-lung and gut-skin axes. Our findings support future clinical evaluation of synbiotic formula in the prevention of infections and associated antibiotic treatment as a primary outcome when breastfeeding is not feasible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01625273. Retrospectively registered on 21 June 2012. Bioactive ingredients for infant formula have been sought to reduce disparities in health outcomes between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Traditional food safety methodologies have limited ability to assess some bioactive ingredients. It is difficult to assess the effects of nutrition on the infant immune system because of coincident developmental adaptations to birth, establishment of the microbiome and introduction to solid foods, and perinatal environmental factors. An expert panel was convened to review information on immune system development published since the 2004 Institute of Medicine report on evaluating the safety of new infant formula ingredients and to recommend measurements that demonstrate the safety of bioactive ingredients intended for that use. Panel members participated in a 2-d virtual symposium in November 2020 and in follow-up discussions throughout early 2021. Key topics included identification of immune system endpoints from nutritional intervention studies, effects of human milk feeding and human milk substances on infant health outcomes, ontologic development of the infant immune system, and microbial influences on tolerance. The panel explored how \"nonnormal\" conditions such as preterm birth, allergy, and genetic disorders could help define developmental immune markers for healthy term infants. With consideration of breastfed infants as a reference, ensuring proper control groups, and attention to numerous potential confounders, the panel recommended a set of standard clinical endpoints including growth, response to vaccination, infection and other adverse effects related to inflammation, and allergy and atopic diseases. It compiled a set of candidate markers to characterize stereotypical patterns of immune system development during infancy, but absence of reference ranges, variability in methods and populations, and unreliability of individual markers to predict disease prevented the panel from including many markers as safety endpoints. The panel's findings and recommendations are applicable for industry, regulatory, and academic settings, and will inform safety assessments for immunomodulatory ingredients in foods besides infant formula. OBJECTIVES: Compared to formula-fed infants, breastfed infants have a lower risk of infections. Two possible reasons for this are the presence of the anti-infective and anti-inflammatory protein lactoferrin and the lower level of iron in breast milk. We explored how adding bovine lactoferrin and reducing the iron concentration in infant formula affect immunology and risk of infections in healthy infants. METHODS: In a double-blind controlled trial, term formula-fed (FF) Swedish infants (n = 180) were randomized to receive, from 6 weeks to 6 months of age, a low-iron formula (2 mg/L) with added bovine lactoferrin (1.0 g/L) (Lf+; n = 72); low-iron formula with no added lactoferrin (Lf-; n = 72); and standard formula at 8 mg/L iron and no added lactoferrin (control formula [CF]; n = 36). Cytokines, infections, and infection related treatments were assessed until 12 months of age. RESULTS: No adverse effects were observed. There were no apparent effects on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-)1, TGF-2, tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-) or interleukin2 (IL-2) at 4, 6, or 12 months, except of higher TGF-2 at 6 months in the CF group in comparison to the low iron groups combined (P = 0.033). No significant differences in otitis, respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, or other monitored infections and treatments were detected for any of the study feeding groups during the first 6 months and only a few and diverging effects were observed between 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Adding bovine lactoferrin and reducing iron from 8 to 2 mg/L in infant formula was safe. No clinically relevant effects on cytokines or infection related morbidity were observed in this well-nourished and healthy population. Early childhood nutrition drives the development of the gut microbiota. In contrast to breastfeeding, feeding infant formula has been shown to impact both the gut microbiota and the serum metabolome toward a more unfavorable state. It is thought that probiotics may alter the gut microbiota and hence create a more favorable metabolic outcome. To investigate the impact of supplementation with Lactobacillus paracasei spp. paracasei strain F-19 on the intestinal microbiota and the serum metabolome, infants were fed a formula containing L. paracasei F19 (F19) and compared to a cohort of infants fed the same standard formula without the probiotic (SF) and a breast-fed reference group (BF). The microbiome, as well as serum metabolome, were compared amongst groups. Consumption of L. paracasei F19 resulted in lower community diversity of the gut microbiome relative to the SF group that made it more similar to the BF group at the end of the intervention (4 months). It also significantly increased lactobacilli and tended to increase bifidobacteria, also making it more similar to the BF group. The dominant genus in the microbiome of all infants was Bifidobacterium throughout the intervention, which was maintained at 12 months. Although the serum metabolome of the F19 group was more similar to the group receiving the SF than the BF group, increases in serum TCA cycle intermediates and decreases in several amino acids in the metabolome of the F19 group were observed, which resulted in a metabolome that trended toward the BF group. Overall, L. paracasei F19 supplementation did not override the impact of formula-feeding but did impact the microbiome and the serum metabolome in a way that may mitigate some unfavorable metabolic impacts of formula-feeding. Early life is critical for developing healthy eating patterns. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a Nordic, protein-reduced complementary diet (ND) compared to a diet following the current Swedish dietary guidelines on eating patterns and food acceptance. At 4-6 months (mo) of age infants were randomized to a Nordic group (NG, n = 41) or a Conventional group (CG, n = 40), and followed until 18 mo of age. Daily intake of fruits and vegetables (mean \u00b1 sd) at 12 mo was significantly higher in the NG compared to the CG: 341 \u00b1 108 g/day vs. 220 \u00b1 76 g/day (p < 0.001), respectively. From 12 to 18 mo, fruit and vegetable intake decreased, but the NG still consumed 32% more compared to the CG: 254 \u00b1 99 g/day vs. 193 \u00b1 67 g/day (p = 0.004). To assess food acceptance, both groups were tested with home exposure meals at 12 and 18 mo. No group differences in acceptance were found. We find that a ND with parental education initiates healthy eating patterns during infancy, but that the exposure meal used in the present study was insufficient to detect major differences in food acceptance. This is most likely explained by the preparation of the meal. Nordic produce offers high environmental sustainability and favorable taste composition to establish healthy food preferences during this sensitive period of early life. Scope Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is an important component of milk that has previously been removed in the manufacture of infant formulas, but has recently gained attention owing to its potential to improve immunological, cognitive, and metabolic health. The goal of this study is to determine whether supplementing MFGM in infant formula would drive desirable changes in metabolism and gut microbiota to elicit benefits observed in prior studies. Methods and Results The serum metabolome and fecal microbiota are analyzed using H-1 NMR spectroscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing respectively in a cohort of Chinese infants given a standard formula or a formula supplemented with an MFGM-enriched whey protein fraction. Supplementing MFGM suppressed protein degradation pathways and the levels of insulinogenic amino acids that are typically enhanced in formula-fed infants while facilitating fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, a feature that may favor brain development. MFGM supplementation did not induce significant compositional changes in the fecal microbiota but suppressed microbial diversity and altered microbiota-associated metabolites. Conclusion Supplementing MFGM in a formula reduced some metabolic gaps between formula-fed and breastfed infants. BACKGROUND: We previously reported results from a randomized controlled trial in which we found that Swedish infants consuming an experimental low-energy, low-protein formula (EF) supplemented with bovine milk fat globule membranes (MFGMs) until 6 mo of age had several positive outcomes, including better performance in the cognitive domain of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Edition at 12 mo of age, and higher plasma cholesterol concentrations during the intervention, than infants consuming standard formula (SF). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate neurodevelopment, growth, and plasma cholesterol status at 6 and 6.5 y of age in the same study population. METHODS: We assessed cognitive and executive functions using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th Edition (WISC-IV), Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales for Children and Adolescents (Brown-ADD), and Quantified Behavior (Qb) tests, and behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), at 6.5 y of age. Anthropometrics and plasma lipids were assessed at 6 y of age. RESULTS: There were no differences between the EF and SF groups in any of the subscales in WISC-IV or Brown-ADD at 6.5 y of age, in the proportion of children with scores outside the normal range in the Qb test, nor in clinical or borderline indications of problems in adaptive functioning from parental and teacher's scoring using the CBCL and TRF. There were no differences between the EF and SF groups in weight, length, or head or abdominal circumferences, nor in plasma concentrations of homocysteine, lipids, insulin, or glucose. CONCLUSIONS: Among children who as infants consumed a low-energy, low-protein formula supplemented with bovine MFGMs, there were no effects on neurodevelopment, growth, or plasma cholesterol status 6-6.5 y later.
