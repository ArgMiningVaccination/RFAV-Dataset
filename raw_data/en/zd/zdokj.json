Dr Anna Clarke National Immunisation Office www.immunisation.ie Premature Babies More at risk from vaccine preventable diseases Should have vaccinations carried out according to chronological age May start their vaccinations in hospital Interrupted Immunisation Courses If interrupted, resume ASAP Not necessary to repeat course regardless of time interval from previous incomplete course Hib/Men C course should be completed with the same brand (If not possible another brand may be used) Hib not normally recommended in those >10 years DTaP not normally recommended in those >10 years Men C not normally recommended in those > 23 years Why interva ls between vaccines? To allow immune response to develop e.g. primary immunisation (1 month) -This allows next response to be a true secondary response (faster, bigger and with higher affinity IgG) To avoid immune interference -If another live vaccine is given while immune system is making primary response, activation of innate immune system may neutralise the second live vaccine. -Wait at least 4 weeks to allow the immune system to recover. Generation of immune response 4-7 days to generate immune response 7 days get primary immune response After ~3/52 primary immune response turned off Antibody producing cells - memory B cells - formed Memory B cells secrete antibody when same agent encountered again This is secondary immune response Memory lasts weeks / years Immune Response Late entrants Unless reliable documentation Assume to be unimmunised Catch -up programme Catch up schedule Review documented evidence of previous vaccinations Observe minimal intervals and age Give age appropriate schedule -The number of doses may reduce with age (e.g. PCV) -Recommended vaccines change or may be omitted Never restart schedule, regardless of interval (except cholera) May give all vaccines at one visit Use optimal intervals when child is back on course Children living in Ireland require Irish schedule Immunisation requirements Number of doses Age (years) DTP/IPV/Hib* MMR Men C PCV 1 - <2 3 1 1 1 2- <5 3 1 1 0 5- <10 4 2 1 0 10 and older Low dose vaccine 4 IPV 5 Tdap 2 1 (up to 23) 0 * Hib required up to 10 years of age Immunisation requirements Interval between doses Interval between doses (months) Vaccine 1/2 2/3 3/4 4/5 DTaP/IPV/Hib 2 2 6 5 years Tdap/IPV (low dose vaccine) 1 1 6 5 years MMR 1 Catch -up schedule for children and adults - January 2016 Vaccine 4 months to <12 months 12 months to < 4 years 4 to <10 years 10 to <18 years 18 years and older BCG 1 dose 1 dose 1 dose 1 dose (up to15 years of age if in low risk group or up to 35 years of age if in specified high risk group) 1 dose (up to 35 years of age if in specified high risk group) 6 in 11 3 doses 2 months apart 3 doses 2 months apart 3 doses 2 months apart Men C 1 dose 1 dose 1 dose 1 dose (if given after 10 years of age, adolescent MenC booster not required 1 dose (up to 23 years of age) PCV 2 doses 2 months apart 1 dose (omit if 2 years of age 2) MMR3 1 dose 2 doses 1 month apart 2 doses 1 month apart 2 doses4 1 month apart Tdap/IPV 3 doses 1 month apart 1 dose 4 Td/IPV 1.doses 1 month apart (1 month after Tdap/IPV) NOTE Continue with routine childhood immunisation schedule from 12 months. Continue with routine school immunisations [4 in 1 (DTaP/IPV) at least 6 months and preferably 3 years after primary course, MMR at least 1 month after previous dose] Continue with routine school immunisations [4 in 1 ( DTaP /IPV) at least 6 months and preferably 3 years after primary course] Boosters of Tdap/IPV 5 years after primary course and Tdap 10 years later http://vaccine -schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Pages/Scheduler.aspx http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/schedules General Issues Accelerated Primary Schedule recommended for children not immunised in 1st year of life 6in1, Men C, MMR can be given at the same visit - minimum 2.5cms apart Always give completed parent record If serious local AEFI, assess before additional doses of that vaccine are given Adverse reactions should be notified to HPRA Summary No need to restart incomplete course Access information about schedules in other countries via websites Vaccinate late entrants according to new schedule Summary If in doubt, give them all www.immunisation.ie http://www.immunisation.ie/en/HealthcareProfessionals/ImmunisationGuidelines/ More information online only More information Catch up vaccinations http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/frequentlyaskedquestions/ca tchupvacc/catchupvacc.html Chapter "}
