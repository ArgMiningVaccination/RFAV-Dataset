We tend to think of ritual as something formal, established, and religious. We accept that it can mean (1) a system of rites, (2) a ceremonial action, or (3) a series of acts repeated regularly. We assume that the most important and accurate definition is the first one as it is the most commonly accepted definitions. Now, try defining ritual as first a series of acts repeated regularly, which can become a ceremonial action, and then a system of rites. This is a more accurate way to understand the meaning of ritual. It starts with a series of acts regularly repeated. The acts are relevant to the situation and the person performing them. The small acts become an action (breakfast, Breaking- fast). This action becomes a ritual observance, and eventually an established form of ceremony. Ritual is a simple way to maintain connection and focus while we are immersed in life. The connection is forged by our attention. We all perform dozens of rituals every day, every season, and every year. When we focus on our actions and infuse them with our attention, we establish a connection between our hearts and our bodies. This is ritual, an action performed by our bodies in connection with our heart. This connection allows us to glean greater meaning and purpose from our actions. Meaning and purpose make our rituals relevant and valuable to our specific lives. When we encounter ritual in modern culture it is often in the established form and prescribed for us. Established rituals hold great power- and that power can be healing or harming. When we don't connect with the actions being performed, we are missing the heart piece. We cannot absorb the meaning of a ritual if it is not relevant to us. Instead of filling us with a sense of purpose and connection, we feel lost and disconnected. Disconnection is lonely, and loneliness is scary. Culturally, we have been trained to remove the heart from our actions on a regular basis. It is sort of like a ritual reversal. We regularly disconnect from our actions, but still repeat them every day, every season, every year. One of the fundamental aspects of my work and research is spiritual healing and wellbeing. Spirituality is about connection and rituals help us feel connected to whatever is important to us, that is why they must be relevant. Crafting relevant rituals requires understanding our values and goals. Cultivating rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations with intention and relevance is a valuable aspect in fostering the world in which we want to live. I serve individuals, families, and communities in identifying how to connect their spirit with the larger world through embodiment. Together, we can cultivate greater wellbeing by activating your personal rituals, or crafting meaningful ceremonies and celebrations that are authentic to you. When we attend to our actions with attention, our heart has to come along. Our hearts gravitate toward meaning and making connections.
