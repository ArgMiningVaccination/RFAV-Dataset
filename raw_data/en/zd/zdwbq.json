CRITERIA USED IN QUA LITY ASSESSMENT This appendix documents the individual risk of bias criteria used to assess included studies. In addition, it documents the criteria used to rate the quality of evidence across studies. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSM ENT OF KQ1 AND KQ2 STUDIES A large number of diverse studies contributed to the review. We broadly categorized risk factor studies into concurrent, retrospective, and prospective studies. Concurrent and retrospective studies can provide only limited information on questions of progression, regardless of their methodological quality, and these studies were not further differentiated. The identified prospective studies r elevant to KQ1 and KQ2 were assessed with QUIPS (Q Uality In Prognosis Studies), a critical appraisal tool for prognostic studies . QUIPS assesses the domains study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and repor ting. 15 For each domain we determine d whether the study indicates high risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, or low risk of bias.

Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non -random approach, for example: Sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; Sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; Sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number ; Allocation by judgment of the clinician; Allocation by preference of the participant; Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; Allocation by availability of the intervention. Unclear: Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. Allocation concealment : Low risk: Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: Central allocation (including telephone, web -based and pharmacy -controlled randomization); Sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. High risk: Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: Using an open random allocation schedule ( eg, a list of random numbers); Assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards ( eg, if envelopes were unsealed or non -opaque or not sequentially numbered); Alternation or rotation; Date of birth; Case record number; Any other explicitly unconce aled procedure. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgment - for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed. Blinding of participants and personnel : Low risk: No blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. High risk: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgmen t of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. Blinding of outcome assessment : Low risk: No blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blindin g; Blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. High risk: No blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. Incomple te outcome data: Low risk: No missing outcome data; Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. High risk: Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 130 Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event ris k enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in ob served effect size; 'As -treated' analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization; Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation. Unclear: Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to , no reasons for missing data provided); The study did not address this outcome. Selective reporting : Low risk: The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way; The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those tha t were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). High risk: Not all of the study's pre -specified primary outcomes have been reported; One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (eg, subscales) that were not pre-specified; One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre -specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta- analysis; The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'L ow risk' or 'High risk'. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. Other bias: Low risk: The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. High risk: There is at least one important risk of bias. For example the study h ad a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or h ad some other problem. Unclear: There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: Insufficient information to assess whether an important r isk of bias exists; or i nsufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias. CRITERIA TO RATE THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR KQ1 AND KQ2 The GRADE framework for prognostic factor research18 differentiates 8 criteria that are used to evaluate the quality of the evidence across all identified studies: The phase of investigation differentiates whether the risk factor evidence is primari ly based on a study that aimed to identify potential prognostic factors (moderate quality) rather than based on studies aiming to confirm identified associations or explanatory research aiming to understand prognostic pathways (high quality). Study limita tions took the assessment frame into account by differentiating whether the risk factor status and the outcome variable were assessed at the same time (concurrent ly), retrospectively, or prospectively. Prospective studies were further differentiated by the risk of bias based on the QUIPS scores. Inconsistency assessed whether the identified association was consistently present across studies and across study designs ( eg, present in concurrent and prospective studies) . Indirectness took into account whether the available research studies do es not accurately reflect the review question . Examples are cases where the only available research studies reported on vitamin D status, rather than a directly patient -modifiable risk factor such as vitamin D intake. Evid ence w as downgraded for imprecision if the sample size wa s insufficient, the confidence interval was wide and overlap ped the value of no effect, there were less than 10 outcome events for each prognostic variable, or there were less than 100 cases reaching endpoints. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 131 Evidence w as downgraded for publication bias unless the value of the risk or protective factor in predicting the outcome has been repetitively investigated. Evidence for individual risk factors may be upgraded if e ffects are moderate or large or there is evidence of e xposure -gradient response for factors measured at different doses. CRITERIA TO RATE THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR KQ3 For KQ3 we took the criteria r isk of bias , inconsistency , indirectness , imprecision , publication bias, large effect , dose response , and all plausible residual confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect and/or would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed into account. The starting point was high evidence because the data are based on RCTs. Risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias can lower the quality . Large effect, d ose response, and a ll plausible residual confounding can upgrade the quality of the body of evidence. 17 Risk of bias evaluations were based on the above documented Cochrane Risk of Bias tool assessments. Inconsistency took the direction and the size of effects across studies into account. Indirectness may assess whether comparative effects are based on head -to-head trial evidence or was obtained from meta- regressions and subgroup analyses. Imprecision takes the confidence interval around the point estimate i nto account. Publication bias was assessed to determine whether there is evidence that pertinent studies, in this case negative effect studies are missing. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 132 APPENDIX D. PEER REVIEW COMMENTS/AUTHOR RESPONSES Comment Response Studies missing - Yes - Studies evaluating geography itself as a risk factor, studies prior to 1973, studies involving co- morbidity The identified studies on associations between geography and progression are shown in the \"other\" and the \"multiple\" risk factor section. Studies publ ished prior to 1973 were eligible for inclusion in the review and all databases were searched without date restriction. We have added the eligibility criteria after the description of the included studies in the result section to avoid ambiguity. In addition, we have emphasized that databases were searched from inception. Co-morbidities were outside the scope of this review but we have ex panded the future research section to indicate that sufficient literature exists for systematic reviews on several individual co- morbidities. It would have been useful to add obesity related studies in the review as it appears to be an important co- morbid condition and related information would have been of great research as well as clinical significance. See above. In particular there is a growing literature on weight and MS progression; we have expanded on this issue in the future research section. Several typographical errors are present in the draft, that I assume will be reviewed carefully towards the final dra ft. Typographical errors will be correct before publication Pg 1/Line 8: Traumatic brain injury is more common than MS in younger adults but is not progressive. I'd reword this sentence as follows: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive disease of the central nervous system in young adults and the cause of serious physical disability in adults of working age. Revised as suggested Pg 1/Line 21: Use \"MS\" throughout the manuscript after it's defined. We have revised the text accordingly bu t left the key questions as is to avoid ambiguity Pg 1/Line 49: Is this a preliminary report vs. final? The draft report is subjected to peer review Pg 3/Line 16: \"Concurrent\" is not commonly used and is confusing. It should be replaced with retrospectiv e. To address this point, we have added a definition to avoid confusion (measuring the exposure status and the outcome at the same time point, eg, current alcohol intake) Pg 5/Line 5: Change \"Out\" to Our. Changed Pg 5/Line 25: There are several redunda nt and inaccurate statements in the conclusion. The association between MS progression and vitamin D supplementation is not significant but the conclusions imply it is related. The conclusion should be modified to something like the following: Our systema t ic review documents the available evidence on modifiable risk factors for MS progression. Associations with MS progression are strongest for smoking. None of the intervention studies examining exercise, dietary, and vitamin D supplementation reported a statistically significant effect on MS disability. Other than smoking cessation, there are no other modifiable risk factors that can be given support from this review as an intervention worthy of slowing MS progression. To address the perceived redundancy w e have divided the conclusions into multiple paragraphs: one characterizes the overall evidence base, one summarizes the risk factor studies, one summarizes the intervention RCTs, and the last one describes the evidence for factors that were addressed in both, risk factor and in intervention studies. The correlation between EDSS scores and vitamin D level was statistically significant. We have revised the sentence to avoid the perceived inaccuracy. Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 133 Pg 8/Line 3: There are several reviews of MS risk factors published in the literature. Some are comprehensive in scope. The statement below is confusing in implying there are multiple reviews of risk factors translated into treatment options. Is this referring to dietary or exercise treatments? There is an emerging body of research that evaluates risk factors translated into tr eatment options but no systematic review has to date comprehensively synthesized the available evidence. We have deleted the sentence Pg 18/Line 8: Why was 1973 used as the starting y ear (vs. 1970)? See above Pg 51/Line 5: There is no figure in the box. Unfortunately the conversion to PDF in the online editorial manager system did not display the figure; this will be corrected in the final report. Forest plots: There is no confide nce interval represented on the summary measure of risk in the diagram. This should be included. We were not sure how this perception came about, confidence intervals are shown for individual studies and the pooled effect in all forest plots Please see ed itorial suggestions and comments in the uploaded document. Thank you for your careful review; we have accepted all editorial changes p. 10: So if I understand correctly, a study on solely Relapsing Remitting MS (RR MS), the most common disease type, would have been excluded - even though patients with RR MS often progress over time? We have revised the sentence to avoid confusion p. 24: Sentence is unclear. Which of the studies does this phrase refer to? Author name added to avoid ambiguity p. 50: awkward wording Revised to clarify that the individually assessed risk factors as well as predicted outcomes were very specific p. 51: Figure missing from draft See above p. 51: I assume you mean since the Vit D values were dichotomized, rather than reported as a continuous variable? The statement is unclear as written, since the study did in fact use the EDSS. The studies did not report on a correlation, hence they could not be added to the meta-analysis; we have clarified this in the text p. 52: G raphs have a diagonal line, which should be deleted. Formatting changes are due to converting to PDF and will be corrected in the final report p. 54: Which - any alcohol consumption, or heavy drinking, or both? Clarified p. 56: Explain the \"downgrades\" ( or refer to the text in the legend) Added p. 69: Unclear in this context We have added more explanation regarding the waitlist condition p. 78: Would this be better expressed as \"pregnancy\" rather than \"children\"? See above p. 82: Unclear. Do you mean \"for which the published evidence demonstrates their amenability...\". Need a clear statement to conclude the review! We have revised the draft conclusions Did any study examine the impact of moving to a different region/climate/latitude during childhood or early adulthood? We did not identify such a study I have a general concern that there may be confusion in discussion of studies between change from Relapsing-Remitting MS (RR MS) to Secondary Progressive MS (SP MS), and progression of disability caused by MS, which can occur both in RR MS and SP MS. Yes, several studies did not restrict to RR MS and studies used a variety of outcome measures. To address this concern, we have highlighted those studies in the summary of findings section that specifically reported on the change from RR to SP MS and those t hat only included patients with RR MS at baseline Modifiable Risk Factors in the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Evidence-based Synthesis Program 134 Was the post -partum period also analyzed separate from pregnancy itself? It is commonly held that MS is likely to be quiescent during pregnancy, but the risk for relapses or progression is increased from baseline during the immediate post -partum interval. Given the complexity of the topic and the diversity across the large number of studies that should be addressed in a separate systematic review we have added this topic to the list of suggested future research studies. Page 5, line 5: Change \"Out\" to \"Our\" See above Page 7, line 16: Change \"described\" to \"characterized pathologically\" and add \"focal areas of\" before \"inflammation...\" Changed as suggested Page 7, lines 35 to 37: Change \"Progressive relapsing MS\" to \"Active progressive MS\" The classification system for MS subtypes was revised in 2014 to remove the classification of \"progressive relapsing\" and replace it with the classification of \"active progressive\" This is given in Reference 8. Changed as suggested Page 10, line 60: Azathioprine is listed as a medication specifically designed for MS, which . Azathioprine was originally developed as an antineoplastic agent it is now used for immunosuppression in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. Other drugs in this class that were omitted from the list include methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Cladribine, listed later, probably belongs in the same list. We have removed the specific examples and reduced the text to one example per medication type to address this point Page 13, line 54: Move \"presented\" to after \"statistics\" We have revised the sen tence Page 15, line 14: After \"East\" add \", Professor, Departments of Neurology, Pharmacology and Physical Therapy, University of Maryland School of Medicine\" Added Page 15, line 14: After \"MPH\" add \", Director, MS Center of Excellence - West\" Added Page 15, line 26: Change,\"PHD\" to \"PhD\" Changed Tables 1 to 7: I may not be reading the tables correctly but I did not see a column indicating the rating of the quality of the evidence in each study. I believe that Appendix C deals with that issue in detail but should some summary indication be included on these tables? The studies were assessed with a number of individual risk of bias criteria which exceeded the available space in the evidence tables. To address this point we have systematically added information on the risk of bias to the result sections following the evidence tables Tables 1 to 7, case definition: I may not be understanding what is being reported here. I am used to this column being used to report whether an acceptable case definition was used by the study in question. In most cases this would involve a diagnosis of MS based on published criteria such as the Poser, McDonald or modified McDonald criteria. Cases might be further restricted based on disability range using a scale like the EDSS score. The entries in this column don't seem to fit this so I am unclear on what is being displayed here. I am also not clear on whether publications were reviewed to ensure that accepted case definitions were used. We have revised the term to \"predicted variable\" to avoid confusion with MS diagnostic criteria. In addition, we have added the diagnostic criteria for prospective studies to the evidence tables. "}
