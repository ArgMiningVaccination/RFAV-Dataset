Believe it or not, there is a right way to use essential oils. The safest way to use and get the benefits of essential oils is through aromatherapy. With aromatherapy, essential oils are released into the air and enter through the nasal passages. The effectiveness of aromatherapy depends primarily on the type of diffuser you use. The [nebulizing diffuser](https://organicaromas.com/collections/nebulizing-diffusers-for-aromatherapy) is the most efficient diffuser on the market at the moment.
