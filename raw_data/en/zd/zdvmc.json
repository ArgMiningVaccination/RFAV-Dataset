For acupuncturists, that paradigm is control of the body's putative \"energy\" (or, \"qi\"), which allegedly flows via \"meridians\", to treat disease by sticking patients with needles at specified ( [but elusive](http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-acupuncture-points-exist-can-acupuncturists-find-them/)) \"acupuncture points\". Having legalized this magical system of human functioning, the legislatures include a cornucopia of quackery in the practitioner's toolkit via the authority, for example, to prescribe dietary supplements, Chinese herbs, and homeopathic remedies and to perform [gua sha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gua_sha), [moxibustion](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/moxibustion/), and [cupping](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/hickey/). Acupuncturists are licensed or registered in 47 states and D.C. In some jurisdictions they can also practice what is variously called Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Oriental Medicine, and East Asian Medicine. Their scope of practice can approach that of a medical doctor. While the methods allowed are different (e.g., surgery vs. cupping), the scope - treating any patient of any age with any disease or condition - is similar. [New Mexico](https://codes.findlaw.com/nm/chapter-61-professional-and-occupational-licenses/nm-st-sect-61-14a-3.html), for example, defines acupuncture as the surgical use of needles inserted into and removed from the body and the use of other devices, modalities and procedures at specific locations on the body for the prevention, cure or correction of any disease, illness, injury, pain or other condition by controlling and regulating the flow and balance of energy and function to restore and maintain health. [Emphasis added.] \"Oriental medicine\" is the use of all allied techniques of oriental medicine, both traditional and modern, to diagnose, treat and prescribe for the prevention, cure or correction of disease, illness, injury, pain or other physical or mental condition by controlling and regulating the flow and balance of energy, form and function to restore and maintain health. [Emphasis added.] \"Doctors of Oriental Medicine\" in New Mexico are allowed to call themselves physicians and practice primary care. Acupuncture regulatory boards add even more pseudoscience (and additional income streams) to the mix via their rules and regulations. The [Florida Board of Acupuncture](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=64B1-3) allows acupuncturists to use [Kirlian photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography) as a diagnostic method. The [Arkansas Board of Acupuncture](http://www.asbart.org/documents/ASBART%20Rules%20%28OFFICIAL%20COPY_FILED%2012.07.06%29.pdf) permits the use of bleeding. But wait, there's more! Perhaps underappreciated in its perniciousness, these regulatory boards (operating under the fiction that they are protecting the public's health by requiring practitioners to remain up-to-date in their field) approve continuing education courses that pump a steady stream of fresh pseudoscience into the system. Freed from the strictures of actual science, courses can offer their own permutations of pseudoscience for practitioners to foist on their patients. (Unfortunately, [\"integrative medicine\" practitioners do the same thing](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/learning-quackery-for-continuing-medical-education-credit/).) Today, we'll take a look at some of these courses and see how, once again, the states are serving as handmaidens to the quackery industry. The [National Certification Commission on Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine](https://www.nccaom.org/advocacy-regulatory/state-relations/) (NCCAOM), a private agency organized and run by acupuncturists and TCM practitioners, creates and administers exams required in 46 jurisdictions to become licensed. It also approves courses [accepted for continuing education credit](https://www.healthcmi.com/acupuncture-license-renewal) by many states. Some merely fleece the gullible; others are downright dangerous. (Actual course names [with link] are followed by a brief description of the course.)
