Kennel Cough is the dog version of a cold. Most dogs will recover on its own without the need of any antibiotics. It often sounds like a harsh, hacking cough ... a bit like a cat coughing up a hairball. Your dog may only cough occasionally, or when he's excited. These aren't the only signs, though. Other possible symptoms include: Sounding like something's stuck in his throat Less interest in his food Runny nose Low energy or less interested in his usual activities And in more severe cases, a fever How does my dog contract Kennel Cough? It is not uncommon for dogs to contract Kennel Cough from other dogs who have recently been vaccinated with the Bordetella vaccine. The truth is, this vaccine is not only ineffective but is not without side-effects. Yet, it is routinely given to combat a self-limiting disease that amounts to as much danger to your dog as the common cold does to you. The lack of efficacy is well summarized by noted immunologist Dr. Ronald Schultz: \"Canine respiratory disease complex (kennel cough) is not a vaccine-preventable disease because of the complex factors associated with this disease. Furthermore, this is often a mild to moderate self limiting disease.\" Vaccination is a serious medical procedure with significant risks. If that weren't bad enough, the \"kennel cough\" vaccine is unlikely to prevent kennel cough! It can even produce kennel-cough like symptoms. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association Vaccine Guidelines say, \"Transient (3-10 days) coughing, sneezing, or nasal discharge may occur in a small percentage of vaccinates. It can also cause a serious anaphylactoid reaction.\" According to the British medical safety data sheet for Nobivac KC vaccine states: \"Contraindications, warnings: Particularly in very young susceptible puppies, mild discharges from the eyes and nose can occur from the day after vaccination, sometimes accompanied by sneezing and coughing. Signs are generally transient, but in occasional cases may persist for up to four weeks. In animals, which show more severe signs, appropriate antibiotic treatment may be indicated.\" The above warning suggests that dogs can contract the virus after the vaccine has been administered. Therefore, if your dog has recently been vaccinated against Kennel Cough and continues to socialize with other pups, your dog could be actively shedding the virus and impacting other dogs around. According to Dr. Peter Dobias DVM, \"Avoid the kennel cough vaccination if possible no matter what age your dog is.\" What Can Dog Owners Do As An Alternative to Receiving the Kennel Cough Vaccine? Instead, this is what you should do as a dog owner: Remember that kennel cough is a mild and self-limiting disease that does NOT require vaccination, according to Merck Veterinary Manual. Avoid the kennel cough vaccination, if possible, no matter what age your dog is. If a service provider you use requests a kennel cough vaccine, share this information with them and be willing to sign a waiver instead. Make sure that your dog's immune system is in top-notch condition. The best way to achieve this is to feed a high-quality, all-natural diet, and ensuring your dog has the essential nutrients for a strong immune system. Avoid carbohydrate-based and processed foods, milk products and wheat that can compromise the immune system. Look for well-aired, clean facilities that are not overcrowded that your dog likes to visit. If your dog gets Kennel Cough, make sure that your dog remains home to rest in comfort until at least 48 hours after the last visible symptoms have subsided. If your dog gets Kennel Cough, consider homeopathic and natural herbal products that are available at Woofur that can help to minimize symptoms by detoxifying and supporting the respiratory system, boosting of the immune system, and reducing any possible inflammation within the system to expedite recovery.
