Please see calendar on the back page for our s p e c ia l j&Holiday Hours VOLUME 2 NUMBER 6 DECEMBER/JANUARY NOTES & NEWS Now Mama Bears is entering its third year of life, after 2 full years of steady, day-by^day growth. Looking around in.the New Books section is pure joy... so many wonderful books, both those that have become \"stan\u00ad dards\" over the past 10 years, and the new arrivals, instead of putting out the traditional gift- . buying season list of \"new and exciting\" titles, we invite you to come and se^ for yourself. Come in, \\ooJk. aroJTTd. One benefit of/Having a smail but pertinent,Vather than \"general\" selection is that it is possible to absorb what's here without get\u00ad ting a headache. And of course, its easy to spend a whole day comfortably, here at Mama Bears...reading, eating, drjrtking, going to the bathroom (we have 2!) By now our selection of new books is big enough to contain just about most of what you want (and still growing). This past year has seen an amazing proliferation of books on women'^ spirituality and les\u00ad bian novels, especially. As well as booksthat deal with the dif\u00ad ferent aspects of our health, physically and emotionally. This year Our Bodies Oar Selves was republished as an enormou's :600 plus page: oversize paper\u00ad back; remember when it cost 35 cents and was less'tfran 100 pages? One of many books>every home should have. We invite y^O u . to come browse,, and fa\u00ad miliarize yourself. Our feminism section is a-b.laze with thinking women, thinking away ..rethink\u00ad ing us out of patriarchy and into matriarchy. Walk their paths with them\u2014it's an exciting jour\u00ad ney. Absorb our history under- patriarchy through reading the autobiographies and biograph\u00ad ies we carry\u2014few reads .are .quite as satisfying as following with her, a woman's true life ad: ventures.

(Continued on page 2)PAULA'S HAGGLE ^Vulnerability Good Morning... Pm not Jovletta-Alice, who was going to haggle today, but got sick, and so, I'm standing in fqr her^ And I want to talk about vulnerability. A workable ethics must be based on an accurate assessment o f connectioris, which is yvhat we've been talking'about and doing, for almost a year now, here at the Gvnosophic Gathering. The question of vulner\u00ad ability came to my attention fairly recently. I'm in a writer^ group with Sandy Boucher and she hadwritten' a story, an article really, \u2014 I think she was 48 when she wrote it, she's 50 now, \u2014 about suddenly realizing that she wasn't young. And realizing that everyone in the room with her one particular day was a lot younger. She noticed their resilient skin, their wonderful muscle tone, and their bright eyes and shiny hair, and she noticed her own, what doVou call those things, cellulose...(I always think that means Wonder Bread, you know...I like Wonder Bread, don't get me wrong)...and her own, you know, beginning lines,.here and there, and her white hair, and her...cancer, at the time she was beginning to have symptoms. Later she wound up having a lump in her breast and had a bi\u00ad opsy, and it turned out she was fine. But o f course you don't know that when you begin to think these things, you think you're not fine. And then, she talked to some elder women, women in their 60's, 70's and 80's and she was with some at one of the anti-nuclear sit-in's at > Livermore Labs and a bunch of women got arrested: among them were Some elder women, and she realized the amount of pain these women experienced, all the time. Having to sjeep on the ground, not having enough?blankets, being a litde decrepit and a little arthritic, with stiff bones and stiff joints\u2014at' best, at best. At worst, with some serious physical disabilities that caused them extraordinary chronic pain the whole time, it's just what they Iwedwhh. And she also noticed their ability to bring the-women together when the wo\u00ad men got in a fight, their ability to mediate the discus\u00ad sion so that a satisfactory agreement was come to, their ability to keep on and keep on, their abilitv to think in terms of 60, 70, 80 years of history, much of which wasJ^heir personal history,- so that they could (Continued on page 1 .6 ) NEPTUNE IN CAPRICORN: SHE IS RETURNING From beyond time, bevond oak trees and bright clear water flow. she was given the work of weaving the strands * of her body, her pain, her vision into creation, and the gift of having created, to disappear. Paula Gunn Allen * \"Grandmother\" Coyote's Daylight Tnp, 1918 In most creation myths, the Primordial Mother births the universe^ including the gods, from her infinite fluid self, often described as her. ocean o f menstrual blood. She sacrifices her \" identity,\" her self, her nothingness by dividing herself into heaven and earth, with the horizon dividing what was a circle of wholeness. She sacrifices darkpess to. make light, . nothingness to make'something. Periodically, however, she devours everything she has created, and all returns to wholeness, darkness, nothingness, the womb-only to be reborn, and the cycle continues. While many cultures, particularly ancient/tribal ones, remember the w.hole o f this story, here in Westernized America we are.trained to Reinforce/re\u00ad create the horizon, the divisions. We have forgotten the Origin, the Source, the wholeness of the Mother. About two years ago her warnings got louder: I am * returning; the present order will be transcended. Kali,Tiamat, Great Primordial Mother Chaos whom w\u00abii adequately name Neptune, the Sea-god planet, spent about 5 months fore-shadowing her entrance into the earth sign-Capricorn. Like the tide, she came in waves until rhis fall she made us fully aware: our castles of sand will wash away; the Mother Ocean is all- powerful. Soon there will be Nothing. Nothing. Chaos. Limitless fluid ocean movement. The Feminine Creative Principle. The Deep. The darkness of the Womb. Formlessness. All. One. This is the domain of Neptune. The Illusion of Reality Capricorn, on the other hand, is the sign of form, substance, structure, foundation, stability, order,.in\u00ad stitutions,' limits, roles, rules, categories, hierarchies, authority, control, management, perfection. (More on the purpose of this life p'ath-in the Capricorn talk at Mama Bears Jan. 8). When these qualities become too Crystallized, when we become blinded by them, we see only the circle divided against itself: fear/guilt, \" shoulds,\" \u00a9ver-coiitrol, resistance, repression, stasis, inertia. Lifeiessness. Patriarchy. Bui the Mother is never truly absent.

(They supply us with the jane Sipe Jewelry and' Fishburn cards.) Take advantage of their knowledge as yOu choose. (Also note Suzanne Sunstone's list of gems and uses . elsewhere in this issue.) Mama Bears is not a money\u00ad making proposition (we're still . putting $ into expansion & things like a new tile floor...)\u2014its (our) goal is to create energy. And each tim e we sell a woman , a meaningful book, a book she w ill be energized by, we get energy from it too, and it is part of the woman-to-woman energy chain that is ever expanding. Ten years ago, we could not even have imagined, some of the books we have: such as Judy Grahn's Another M other Ton\u00ad gue ($9.95), a ground breaking book, or Lesbian Nuns ($9.95) to name only two. W hile looking through the new releases to buy gifts, don't forget the older titles: if your friends, co-workers, lovers, & family-h-aven't read them, it's /- still news to them, and they can C_.be exchanged. (We do gift cer\u00ad tificates; also.) You can also useour mail order form to order any of the books that we carry or that we ,can special order for you! And don't forget our Capital Investment Donor opportunity. It costs $20.00 for one year, and helps us raise money for capital improvements while giving yoli a 10 percent discount on all purchases (including crafts and jewelry) except food. This paper, Mama Bears News and Notes is also thriving (thanks to Susan's visionary drive)\u2014 '. many o f our advertisers are quite pleased with results they inform us, and we're building a very interested readership. Arid more and more,.when women call Mama Bears forreferrals (an unpaid part o f what we do here at Mama Bears) it's Mcfma Bears News and Notes advertisers we turn to, tp fm d the name they need. To make this easier, we've added an advertisers' directory (see back page). And remember, when you buy at Mama Bears, you're sup\u00ad porting, keeping going, an enterprise which I can now say, after watching for 2'year 5, is truly a woman's center, filling a long\u00ad standing need. Getting backto our New Book section: as the books show, we are indeed reclaim ing our bodies, ourselves...the major goal of the women's movement. Reclaiming our history, our minds, our bodies, our future. These are heady thoughts; and they rest on very concrete things: the abirity to have an abortion, the ability to vvalk away from a spouse who abuses, the ability to com pete in the job market, the ability to practice our spiri\u00ad tuality as women, the ability to pursue women's studies(ourr^- searchersxire invaluable). BeaV ing ini m ind that the legal right to do these things can be chal\u00ad lenged\u2014as abortion rights are. Do you remember when the Supreme Court made abortion legal in 1973? I do. I was quite surprised, as were many Qther women. Surprised that it'came so early, or at all. As Karen Ryer's article in this issue reminds us, it ...A P P E A R IN G A T YOUR N E X T G A T H E R IN G ! 547-1479 (for booking Jrffo.) * Tapes available at Mama Bears $6.00.can be taken away, one way or another. And as she points out, it's the women's clinics that are being attacked, not the hospi\u00ad tals performing abortions. And as Lenore J. Weitzman makes clear in her just-released book, The Divorce Revolution ($19.95) the right to walk away from an abusing spouse is made mockery of by the no-fault divorce laws, which leave women poorer than ever. W e are the poverty class in America. Catch 22. Mama Bears welcomes new staff members Joy, Jen, and Oya. Their energy is wonderful.

We, as do other groups, de\u00ad fine ourselves by what we per\u00ad ceive (often subconsciously) to be the ideas/symbols, and arti\u00ad facts o f our culture. It is there\u00ad fore incumbent on us as feminist artists to create that culture which we want to have w ithin f the wom en's-cor^m unity-to create our own imagry-and ratherthan simply sucking at the patriarchal teat (cock?)-to crefte our own imagery and i.deals.

Insurance companies are also pulling the rug but from under women's Health Clinics-as Karen Ryer re\u00ad ports elsewhere in this issue. What's happening to the pot growers in Northern California isn't even subtle. .The issue isn't really pro or con marijuana, of course, or whether the-herb should be illegal in the first place. It's about power and wealth getting into the hands of a segment o f the population that is, by definition, outside the sys\u00ad tem's bookkeeping and control. Ins.uJt to injury, they live on al\u00ad ternative energy and develop strong communities full of de: viant persons. Various State and Federal . Agencies marshalled what be\u00ad came the largest police'force marshalled against civilian' s ifi our^nation's history. They raided gardens and homes in great . numbers and it didn't work-.The civil rights issues rn their pro\u00ad cedures were so ^questionable they didn't prosecute on crimin\u00ad al charges, so their procedures didn't get tested in court. Injunc-. tions from Federal judges sorrie- -how don't c<\u00a3iplfetely bind them. (How is a judge to stop them, threat of arrest?) And it w isn't working, peo\u00ad ple were,n't intimidated by threat o f mere wipeout because thesestruggle for some right means we get to keep it, as though.we had special rules of fair play- here. Did you. know that lovely old Thurgood Marshall who re\u00ad fuses to die to facilitate Meese's long awaited ascendency to the Supreme Court is probably our sole protector o f abortion rights? Then there's the weird things being done through extra-legal agencies such as insurance com\u00ad panies. It's certainly a high-tech concept when local government is 'driven out of business' by the so-called^deep pocket' rule which calls for a town to have enough cash on hand to cover the deductible amounts of its lia\u00ad bility insurance. Sorry folks, your town,can't be anymore because .you don't have enough money to meet insurance requirements. Or, how about the way Cali\u00ad fornia axed homebirths without resorting to the legal system or public forum? Changes Were made to the malpractice in\u00ad surance for doctors and nurses. Now, unless they pay some\u00ad thing like 580,000 for a special option, they're no longer cover\u00ad ed for a homebirth. A licensed medical practitioner who isn't exorbitantly wealthy w o u ld now put his or her-profession on the line attending \u00a3 homebirth. Sud\u00ad denly articles appear in the ^ media denouncing h o m e b irth ^ Subtle moves and media man\u00ad ipulations. W ho'd notice ex- cept.a mother who has to go to a. hospital to give birth, now. Is itThe founding fathers of these here United States were a rather paranoid bunch of dudes. They assumed that governments were bound to grow corrupt, if given half a chance, so they designed our system w ith a bunch of fail\u00ad safe devices to protect the rights o f all (white) (male) citizens for as long as possible. If you man\u00ad aged to stay awake in school you were probably told about the system of checks and balances, where the Executive Branch (read Pres.) is answerable to the Legis\u00ad lative (Congress) which can be overruled by the Judicial which, is appointed by the FYesident. And, no sooner did they finish the Constitution they im m edi\u00ad ately went back and amended it, adding to it what is known as the 'Bill of Rights' to protect the citizens' most basic civil rights and freedoms. Later amend\u00ad ments made women and non\u00ad whites citizens, too. Our civil rights are protected by law, of course, but law is no protection unless it's respected and law isn't doing too well these.days. About the only place you can be sure people aren't either above the law or outside it is in a courtroom, if you're Wealthy enough to pursue your rights that far. For most of us there's no guarantee. So; what with one thing or another, the legal system just isn't what it used to be. Most of us^are still pretty complacent, however.

As I read the book, I was in\u00ad spired by Lorde's abilityand wil- ' lingness to go beyond the sur\u00ad face, that is, to dig a little deep\u00ad er. For example, in \"Poetry Is Not A Luxury\" , she invites the reader to share her vision o f' poetry as...\"illumination, for it is through poetry that we give name to those ideas which are- until the poem-nameless and formless, about to be birthed, but already felt.\" And with that vision, she speaks of the neces\u00ad sity of traveling into the dark, each o f us, artd finding our pas- / sion, our power and our cre- (_ _ativity there. It has been a strug\u00ad gle for me to continue my work- my poetry, to nourish the dark ' places and to fio t view poetry (both my own and the work of pther women) as movement to \u00ad ward 'real' writing. The essay affirms both the need to con\u00ad tinue and the possibilities creat\u00ad ed by continuing. \"Transformation of Silence into Language and Action''was another piece pertinent to my life. It brought tc mind Lorde's poem, \"A Litany For Survival\" . (The Black Unicorn). Both are confrontations with the ways ! have chosen silence a re- . . sponse to fear-as if silence and knowledge are the same. How many of us, as frightened child\u00ad ren do, close our eyes tightly, . believing that our doing so would save us from some real or imagined monster? I did. And when the monster came, in spite of my not watching'its ap\u00ad proach' I opted for. silence-re\u00ad fusing to speak the reality- accepting the illusion of con\u00ad trol as power. Lorde speaks of her confrontation 'u lti\u00ad mate' monster-death, her own -mortality: \"I was going to die, if not sopner then later, whether or not I had ever spoken my self. My silence had not protected me. Your silence w ill not pro\u00ad tect you:\" And fear. what of fear? Lorde puts it in perspective. We can, she says, learn to do wh\u00a3n we are afraid. After reading \"Transforma-, tio n.I read it again, then turned to her speech entitled, \"The Uses of Anger: Women.Re\u00adsponding to Racism.\" The con\u00ad nection between the two seem\u00ad ed obvious and in need of at\u00ad tention in my life. This was not an easy piece to read, I.felt circled by the ways.we discount anger, by the costs involved in doing so. And it was a gentle circle, one of strength and hope and outrage. As I read this speech, I wept, I. shouted, I re\u00ad membered in spite of the fear, and then I phoned a frjend and told her to read it. \"W om en of Color in America have grown up within a sym\u00ad phony of anger, at being silenc\u00ad ed, at being unchosen, at know\u00ad ing that when we survive, it is in spite of a world that takes for * granted our lack-of humanness, . and which hates our very exis\u00ad tence outside of its service'- And I say 'symphony' rather than cacophony because we have had to learn to orchestrate those furies so that they do not tear us apart. We have had to learn to move through them and use them for strength and force and insight, within our daily'lives. Those of us who did not leaVn this ^difficult lesson did not sur\u00ad vive. And part of my anger is al\u00ad ways libation for my fallen sis\u00ad ters.\" f Constant throughout this book is Lorde's presence. Such a simple thing, yet again and again I have read essays and listened to speeches laced with the infamous \"them \" yntil, of course, the speaker begins to speak of her idea of solution. Then come the 'us' and the 'we'. In SISTER OUTSIDER, io t^e has heid herself beneath the glass of introspection, and from that point offers wisdom and ways to change. The book is radical, reading it leaves me feeling both exhausted and hopeful. SISTER OUTSIDER comes irv a blue cover, the color blue that commands your attention, the color blue that is said to be the color associated with creativity; SISTER OUTSIDER comes in gold letters, the color gold is said to be a healing color; SISTER OUT\u00ad SIDER comes like night, with\u00ad out the distractions o f day-time business; SISTER OUTSIDER cpmes as clarity for those o f us who have grown weary of living inside of our wounds. \"Andw h^n I speak of change, I do not mean a simple switch of positions or a temporary lessen\u00ad ing of tensions, nor the ability tosmile or feel good. I am speak\u00ad ing of a basic and radical altera\u00ad tion in those assumptions un- 'derlining our lives.\". -by Joyletta A.

JEMPOWERING ART Sometimes when you walk out alone (or arm in arm with a beloved other) urvder the full moon, you sense something that makes all you/ life click into a whole: For a moment you understand the meaning be\u00ad hind it all. I had that experience in the m iddle of the night of a very_violent mid-winter storm. In the eye of the storm, the clouds drew back for a while arid the full moon shone down brighter than I'd ever seen her and it was very still. I walked out ' onto the beach artd saw running across the rafn-drenched, smooth, dark sand, one long line o f deeply bitten horseprints. Now, I'm not trying to tell you that Heme or some other mythic being had been out riding the w ild storm winds. (The neigh\u00ad bor had probably had the same urge as I shortly before me, only she had come to the beach on her horse.) But what.l sensed in\u00ad side myself was the same as if the prints had come from t\"fie last amazon centaur: I felt the presence of Sometfiing. All around,'the world was etched with amazing clarity. I.se\u00abfifed to feel the balance o f the TOrld (and how it w ould be if the hu\u00ad man world ,was in balance) for a moment or two that night. The moments when the as\u00ad sumed realities of the world ' seem to shift and something . changes deep inside are rare anc(vastly important to our de\u00ad veloping strength and inner power. A moment like this might come when you're watch\u00ad ing a movie like \"O ne fine Day\" , which shows a beauti\u00ad ful layout and design many of our heras. It might come to you .while Watching a slide show by Max Dashu; seeing the faces and dances of women shamans around the world. Or it might happen when you stand in front . of a paintingor a sculpture or an illustration. It might come at a ' Xonc.ert or poetry reading, from a fine in a book, the w^y the .clouds form, a dream.

W e/continually view energy draining images, dis-empowering images. It is difficult not to take them irito ourselves, our lives and work. The images and words that mass media continually supplies us with are meant to keep us.from deepening and gaining indivi- ' dual strength and self-autonomy. They are meant to keep us tied . to a mass pattern of buy at any ..cost to ourselves or nature. They keep us tied to a very narrow - perception of reality-theirs (the perception of reality held by those who hold the material 'power.) We all desperately need the feeding that can come only from . our women imagemakers. These images have been so lost to us over the past few thousand years. It's very exciting to me that women are increasingly choosing to spend what they can, with our tight budgets and small incomes, on women- made images o f empowerment. W hether it be the tiny sculp\u00ad tures of jewelry, or paintings ano weavings and larger sculptures to have around us in our homes and workspaces, wc* are.realiz\u00ad ing the miportance of such daily reminders to our taking control of o iir lives. Women are realizing that our artists can continue to create so we can all be fed withimages, songs and words that give us dignity, strength and hope.

Why are we being misin\u00ad formed? As a professional in the health care field, a great deal of information has come my way regarding AIDS. I have had'the opportunity to reflect on this in\u00ad formation and have come to some conclusions. First, let me begin by explor\u00ad ing female, to male sexual trans\u00ad mission of AIDS. I can find nothing to suggest that this has ever occurred. Yes, it is true that . the AIDS virus has been isolated in teacs, saliva and vaginal secre\u00ad tions. It has never, however, been demonstrated that an in\u00ad dividual has contracted AIDS via these bodily fluids. If it is true that female to male transmis\u00ad sion of AIDS has not occurred, then it is clear that women pros\u00ad titutes are not a source of the sexual spread of this disease. Scapegoats? You bet they are! What, then is meant by the statement th\u00a3t \"ALBS is no longer a homosexual disease, but a heterosexual one as well?\" Why are we being told that it can be passed on by hetero\u00ad sexual women? What does \"in- ' timate*sexual- rubbing noses? Kissing? Why aren't we being told? I believe that the implying of a heterosexual connection to AIDS is designed to create an anxiety state in all of us-and it has! At the same time we are told that AIDS is very difficult to contract. Confusing? Yes. But that, thank goodness appears to be triie. It looks as if the AIDS virus must be directly injected into .a person's circulatory sys\u00ad tem..Yes, that does mean it is POSSIBLE to contract AIDS dur\u00ad ing vaginal intercourse, alfhough it rs highly unlikely that this would occur. For a male to con\u00ad tract AIDS from a-woman during intercourse, he would n^ed to have an open lesion on his penis -*nd his partner would need to . be an AIDS carrier'with a bleed\u00ad ing vaginal lesion. Since very few women have AIDS it is highly unlikely for the above scenario to take .place. For a woman to . contract AIDS during vaginal in \u00adtercourse,^ similar situation is necessary. She w ouldfneed to have a Weeding lesion, so'that the semen would have access to her circulatory system. This makes the reference to hetero\u00ad sexual transmission of this dis\u00ad ease even more obscure. AIDS is not related to either the lietero or homo aspects o f-, sexuality any more than hepati\u00ad tis is. It appears to be an activity related disease, i.e. the sharing of contaminated needles or be\u00ad ing the passive recipient of anal intercourse. Because the mucous membranes of the colon are quite fragile and easily damag: ed, there is a high. liklihOod of contamination during anal in: tercourse. These membranes . are designed for absorption of fluids and, therefore, have many small.blood vessels close to the Surface. The vagina on the other hand, is a tough muscular organ not readily injured. Secondly, did you know Haitianswere removed from the high risk group? This, move cer\u00ad tainly came with little fan fare. They were removed, of course, because the 'CDC (Center for Disease Control) finally acknow\u00ad ledged that Haitians get AIDS the same way everyone else does. Why were they singled out to begin with? It appears we need a people of color upon which to place the blame. Since removing Haitians from the high risk group, effort^ are being made to blame AtDS on Afri\u00ad cans. W ith regards to the \"Afri\u00ad can\" connection, you m4y have heard that heterosexual disease\" . It is im\u00ad portant to state once more that AIDS has no way of knowing ' your sexual preference. It is a disease that is spread blood to blood (as in transfusions) or x semen to blood (as in anal inter\u00ad course). In other words we ail get it the same way-military per\u00ad sonnel, Haitians, Danes, Africans, etc. So let's stop scapegoating prostitutes (women). They may be at risk themselves, but so far it doe^not appear that these women have ever given this disease to any\u00ad one...not sexually that is. Like everyone else, they can spread it by sharing infected needles.So, why the misinformation? Well, if it is true that AIDS cari only be spread by sharing in\u00ad fected needles arid through anal intercourse (there is now a test to screen blood, so trans\u00ad fusions are no longer a source of infection), then who is going to vote to fund research? Remem\u00ad ber how little money was made available when this disease was seen as the \"gay plague\" ? Theresearch community then, has a vested interest in convinc\u00ad ing the public and public of- ficals that it can be transmitted \"heterosexually\". So does the military. If,as has been reported, all military personnel are to be tested for AIDS, then it is ob- * vious why those making the de\u00ad cisions are attempting to imply a \"heterosexual\" basis for infec- , tion even if one does not exist. , As for the gay community, it seems to me that some mem\u00ad bers have been sadly quick to try to make this'connection, in eagerness to remove the focus from themselves. Energies which could have bken better spent making clear the dangers of anal intercourse. Shall I point the finger at the patriarchy just becausfe it point\u00ad ed Its finger at me (as a woman) and others not clearly .implicat\u00ad ed by the facts? Let it point where it belongs. The bottom line is that AIDS is passe\u00ab^re- dominately during anal i^ p r- course and cannot be passed that way by women. Further, it is im plicit that anal intercourse is clearly a widespread practice not limited by sexual preference. Pointing a finger at the homo\u00ad sexual community and prosti: tutes has simply been a mechan\u00ad ism td avoid the truth. The truth is simple: if we avoid anal inter\u00ad course and contaminated ne\u00ad edles our chance of contracting AIDS are slim. Dr. Arburua has been working in the health care field for 25 years.

The decision to so do was deemed her private business, to be de\u00ad termined by her and her doctor. The legal, economic and social ramifications of the Roe v. Wade decision were, and are, m onu\u00ad mental. Women were able first, to plan children, hot just react to them and as a result, were able to. plan other things in their lives, such as a caVeer, or a single life-style. Think about that-how many of us would not now be single, having to have \"le t a man make an hopest wom an\" out of us through \"matrimony\"? A second development is just as important. Because the wo- ' men who worked toward the Su\u00ad preme Court decision contin\u00ad ued to work in the feminist movement, some women be\u00ad gan to enter the women's health care industry th e m -'' selves, and ultimately developed the women's healtlj clinics we all have come to appreciate and rely upon for inexpensi\\tore- sponsible, woman-to-vyoman health care. Mo longer did we have to go into impersonal hos\u00ad pitals for \"fem ale problems\"; no longer were all the persons around us men; no longer did the doctor's office seem like a .prison. W e had ourow n clinics, our.t^wn friends worked there, and health care for women be\u00ad came humane and healing. We women gave ourselves dignity by removing the male preroga\u00ad tive from our health care de\u00ad cisions. In fact, many of these clinics are still in operation, and have been for 10-12 years. And most of them are owned and/or operated by women. The health care industry has had to deal with women taking charge of medical technology, and with women making an independent Hving at it. In other words, al\u00ad though I do not personally know a single woman, either, ad\u00ad ministrative or medical, who has become rich working at a clinic, most have survived, raised chil- ' dren, and helped others do the same. (Many women's first jobs have been as clerks or recep\u00ad tionists at women's clinics.) And they have done this without much help from men.' (There are always good men, and in the t history of women'S'health in the past 12 years, there have been some very good ones. The Supreme Court in 1973 was made up of nine of them.) The point,js that women's health care became her concern, her legal right, and, now, her liveli\u00ad hood. Another important ramifica\u00ad tion of the Roe v. Wade decision was that many wom en began tounderstand medical technology and learned a good deal about reproductive health themselves. An excellent local example of women taking over medical technology and using it for themselves is the Sperm Bank of Northern California, located here in Oakland, where any woman may choose sperm of her choice, be artificiajly insem\u00ad inated, and have a child w ithout a man involved. The freedom NOT to bear a child has evolved into the freedom-*to HAVE one, without^male intervention in - either decision. - W e ^re, however, not doing these things unnoticed. A.grow- ing number o f individuals call\u00ad ing themselves by various re\u00ad ligious-sounding names have set out to systematically, legally, and thoroughly disable, dis\u00ad m e m be r, and distroy the gains women have made since the Roe v. Wade decision. And-it is not just happening in conservative places, but cig^t here in Ala\u00ad meda and Contra Costa Coun\u00ad ties. A clear pattern is developing before our eyes, and we had better not ignore it. W om enAave been targeted. For the last eight years, I have represented the Oakland Fem\u00ad inist W omen's Health Center (four dlihics-Pleasant Hill, Oak\u00ad land, Santa Rosa, and Rich\u00ad mond). In the course of my legal work for the clinics, I have had . occasion to seek relief from the courts from harassment by so- called \"right to life\" pickets*, w ho have taken it upon them\u00ad selves to exercise their freedom o f speech and speak out against abortion at cliltic sites,, especial\u00ad ly when abortion procedures are done. These groups have been made up o f an assort\u00ad ment of Christian church groups and stray individuals. I have had a lot of success keep\u00ad ing these kinds of people at bay, working w ithin the legal system to structure .their activities so that there is a m inimum of dis\u00ad turbance to the clinic and client, and so that their oDinions are constitutionally protected. Un\u00ad til recently, this has worked in the Bay Area. However, there is a serious problem, and his name is Joseph Scheidler, a Catholic and direc\u00ad tor o f the Pro-Life Action League of Chicago. He has just released his book, CLOSED: 99 WAYS TO STOP ABORTION, 1985, Regnery Bo.oks, Lake Bluff, Illinois. I h^ve just finished reading it. It is ex\u00ad tremism at its worst-he makes fanaticism sound almost reason\u00ad able. And m ostofw hat he advo\u00ad cates is legal. His tactics began surfacing in the Bay Area with a vengeance injanuary o f this year. I was caMed upon to seek an injunc\u00ad tion for Planned Parenthood of Ccpntra Costa County because of a priest who had, in the past,been arrested at Planned Parent\u00ad hood for assault and trespass. He began systematic picketing of Planned Parenthood's clinics in Concord. He brought friends, and they brought friends. It has taken all year to get these peo\u00ad ple under control, and it has cost Planned Parenthood much time and money to do it. And for the longest tim e we did not really realize what these pickets were up to. They are NOT up to expressing their views. They are not merely, exercising their free\u00ad dom of speech. They are dedi\u00ad cated' to closing the clinics down, first Planned Parenthood, then the Oakland Feminist W o\u00ad men's Health Center clinics. They are com m itted to Scheid-' lei's plan-abortion must be stopped, and the easiest way to stop it is to break the clinics financially. W hy clinics? Why not Kaiser? First, they couldn't break.Kaiser financially. Second; Kaiser has great security systems. Third, Kaiser is staffed mostly by male doctors and staff. These people want to shut down wom en-operated, women- owned clinics, and if they stop the abortions there, fine too. They do not care that only 20% of the fema|e health problems treated at women's clinics are abortions, and 80% are family planning and health care. They only care that wom en are'work\u00ad ing for themselves; and if abor\u00ad tions are done oh the premises, there is a good excuse, under the guise o f free speech, to go after them. do not do the TAB (theraputic abortion) procedure are also targeted. Some o f the tactics include: general picketing, in large num \u00ad bers so as to block entrance and exit from the clinics; so-called \"sidewalk counseling\" of w o \u00ad men going into the clinics, which consists of comments like \"why are you killing your baby?\", or, \"w e'll find a home for your baby, let us have it\", and some not so nice comments such as, \"baby killer\", \"m urderer\"; sur\u00ad rounding cars as they try to. park and handing out lurid literature showing full color photos of \" fetal parts; using bullhorns to shout the names of clinic staff and doctors while TAB proce\u00ad dures are being done; phoning the clinics to leave messages on tapes; sending postcards with pictures o f Jesus, to the clinic staff; making fake appointments in order to get into the clinics to supposedly convince legitimate clients to 'Leave before the pro\u00ad cedure; repeatedly making phone calls to the clinic, trying . to talk to staff, tying up valuable time; picketing the homes of doctors and landlords o f clinics, leaving large signs on their lawns which say things like \"abortionist\", \"m urderer\", or worse, and then leaving before police arrive. These are but a few o f the tactics suggested by Joseph Scheidler which are be\u00ad ing systematically used here in our \"liberal\" Bay Area. The ef\u00ad fects of these tactics are yet to be (Continued dn page 9) (Continued from page 8) determined, but the cost to combat them has already be\u00ad come almost prohibitive for the clinics. For example, Planned Parent\u00ad hood filed a suit for injunctive relief in Contra Costa County in February 1985. It is now Octo\u00ad ber, and court appearances are still reqi/ired to modify the in- junctipns granted because of new picket tactics which circum\u00ad vent old injunctions. The same group of pickets have begun to harass Oakland Feminist's Con\u00ad tra Costa clinics now, requiring new suits and injunctions, with filing fees; process service fees and court appearances. This group has now moved to Fremont to harass another Plan\u00ad ned Parenthood clinic there. The legal costs to both Oakland and Planned Parenthood are escalating, even when much of the work is done at reduced cost. (It might be noted that 40% of my time is spent, on picket-related work for both or\u00ad ganizations. If the amount of legal work increases too much. I cannot afford to d < ? it unless I give up my other clients.) The point is clear-the anti-choice forces are geared up for battle, and have the money to do if. If that is not enough, look at the insurance industry. 41 Clinics have been fire-bombed, torch\u00ad ed, or otherwise disabled or destroyed in the last four years. Insurance K3? been available to coy^r these losses in some cases. However, today, rates for clinics have quadrupled, if the clinic can even get an insurer to cover 4. If an uninsured cfinic is torched, it is gone forever. In \u00ad surance companies, if they in\u00ad sure clinics, are not only requiring huge premiums (as much as $30,000 per year for fire alone), but they are requir- jngclinics to post 24-hoursecur- jty, install.alarms, and bond -.Mama Bears Naw i 4 Nota\u00bb/Dacamb\u00abr-Januarv \u00ab ployees (insure them). Again in the insurance area, the anti-choice forces have managed to convince women to sue clinice for malpractice. . Many clinic physicians have no personal coverage, relying upon the clinic's policy and their hos\u00ad pital malpractice coverage. W hena woman sues aclinic, the malpractice insurer settles with the client, eveq if the claim is tenuous, and drops malpractice coverage. That causes physicians to refuse to do TAB procedures, not only because of nuisance lawsuits (which they, too, have to become involved with as w it\u00ad nesses), but because they can- . not always afford huge malprac\u00ad tice premiums for themselves alone, assuming the clinic v doesn't have any. The result: uninsured clinics= no clients=no clinics. It js as simple as that. And Joseph Scheidler knows this. So do the anti-choice forces . in this country. And so does Ronald Reagan, arid the U.S. Su\u00ad preme Court, once the' protec\u00ad tor, now a very real threat. So what do we do? What can we do? I have some ideas, none of them easy to implement, and none of them cheap. But we either pay now the cost of de\u00ad fending the clinics, or we will pay later when they are closed. The first thing an individual can do is utilize the facilities of the clinics. Give them business, instead of going to a hospital clinic. Most^nsurance policies cover out-patient treatment that clinics provide. At the clinic, pick up pro-choice literature and distribute that literature to the pickets as you come out. Don't be afraid of them, but don't get into arguments with them. Yoy w ill never win, and your blood pressure w on't benefit from it. Take their litera.- ttrre and sead it. Be informed.

Feeling vulnerable and alone. Straight out of the hectic city-into the world. I remember the trees. At night, lying in my cot (I was peeping in an area of ten beds, alone. I chose that. Sometimes I was lonely but I chbose to give myself the experience of being alone. Of course I wasn't alone). I locked up-the trees were looking down at me. Giant pines. They made circles wherever I look up. And there were the birds. 1 slept in the area called Ma Mere. She was there. And there were squirrels, woodpeckers,-jays, and birds I couldn't identify (and mosquitos I could). I knew almost-no dne, and it took a while to make friends. First in my small group. The groups were made up of about nine people each, with a facilitor. There were types o f women there that I'm not used to relating to, so open and vulnerable. Jhey were lesbian, straight, young, elder, middle class, working class, re\u00ad volutionaries, housewives, mostly white, nuns, minis\u00ad ters, pagans. So the small group was a focus, a support group, a smalf wheel o f the machine, a^iictocosm whdfrein I could expl%B^my feelings, thoughts and what was in my body. I^ldn't know what to expea at first. I felt scared that I would go deep into myself. Encounter fears and old boundaries I'd (set. And my fear was also 1 that I wouldn't do that, \\youldn't grow. 1 don't know which was the greater fear. I was expecting a lot from camp and more from myself in the first few days, and it didn't seem to be happening. So I felt disappointed, and Wretched. All my worst characteristics came out, and / hid! My group later surprised me with the feed\u00ad back that when they first looked at me they were scared o f me-me! I didn't show them how sad, scared and lonely I was feeling until the middle of the week. My group leader, Apthea Francintydid a wonderful job of giving us safe space to go into our fear*. In- deed-our group did a \" fire walk\" . Not with real fire but by tackling heavy personal issues; our worst fears. For myself, a big one was vulnerability. Trying to open; to love, to accept new things* to create bridges, to the possibility of rejection and pain. Part of the leSson was to be'myself right there and then, to be \" radically authentic'', Anthea called it. And . I, in mv calm healer/wise woman guise could hardly speak for fear o f sounding foolish next to her (ah: self importance strikes again, along with competition, that patriarchal) stinger). And I was kicking myself for my inability to speak, feeling judged for being stupid and weak and passive (self-judgment hurts the most). And so it went for the first half o f the week. Jean Bolen, author of G oddesses in Every Woman, set the mood Sunday for the entire camp, speaking about the myth of Psyche; about becoming independent women, doing for ourselves, without any help and without having to help someone else (especially the nuclear family). She said we need to acknowledge our dark sides, our terror, loneliness, feelings4 of helpless\u00ad ness and self hate. To let ourselves be in these times. The times when we ace pulled in, are like the rhythm bf the heart. Blood must be taken in so it can be cleansed and pumped back into the body. When Psyche listened to her subconscious she learned how to get out of her bind, and pan of the lesson was in waiting . for her body, to move-to tell her when the right time for action was. I saw it is important to be comfortable being alone,.being receptive, listening to my heart. The camp experience helped me to understand this more deeply. The heartbeat became a motif: we walked tons beat.in rituals, in movement, songs and dance, in the night. I also realized thai t havr a tendency^ feel bad, depressed durmg'thr dark phaies of\\he moon, andokay or even great near the full moon and sometimes after the turning to the waxing moon-especially when I have support to get through difficult times. The camp reminded me that that's what happens, and I don't , have to feel defeated or powerless at the dark, but remember that it is an \" inner\" time and as at the winter solstice, the dormant time of the year, the dark of the. moon.is time to rest and reflect and take in. I got that. It began to dawn on.us around Tuesday, the dark of the moon, that the entire camp was going through their own personal hells, thei.rdark sides. The topics o f discussion were excruciatingly real and balanced, meaning as mucji about darkness and pain as about love and connections. Also, for most o f us, it was new and'scarv to be in an environment which demanded, however gendv, complete honesty with ourselves and each other. We made the descent over and over, in rituals, groups, at informal gatherings, daring to face our fears and 'ugliness', not always bidden, and being support\u00ad ed to do whatever came-t^ars, craziness, despair, awe. I saw many hit their big ones, conquer and rise with beauty in spite of the scars and blotches left by their culturally ingrained feelings o f self hatred, abuse and worthlessness. One woman in my group re-enacted a fire walk by putting her worst fear out to Us. We symbolically placed it as the coals in front of her, which she then walked across with us on either side. When she. had crossed, her face was full of wonder and shone with recognition of herself. All week women were finding their power in similar ways. We were finding the goddess through each other's willingness to be real, and to work. The speaker on Wednesday and the one'who made the most impact on me was Joanna Macv, author o f Despair and Personal Power in the Nuclear Age. \" As we allow ourselves to feel our pain for the world, we find our connection with each other\" - Joanna Macv. She spoke to us about our killing ourselves-and the animals and the plant life. Her poem was read-a moratorium for the extinct and soon-to-be extinct animals, which began our tears. Then she addressed our nuclear destructiveness and fears of nuclear caused death. And we cried aloud. Finally she had us all keening with our, feelings o f death and devastation, with the dark mother. Then, as we held our partners hands, she led us through a meditation. We felt each other's hands, what they had done in this life, how much love and- how much work and caring and creativity and healing was there. And the possibility o f those hands beipg stopped by nuclear war. The possibility o f those hands living, doing something to help create a-way to work against the total destruction of die world-of our minds-of life* She pointed out that each activity-a peace march, ecology work, counseling-however big or small is an important act within the whole picture o f transforming the destruction and repression to freedom and peace. Her meditations were most powerful and moving. I realized I had to take my power and do all I could to make a difference to my life and the world. . Later the same day I went to the song-writing workshop by an incredibly talented and beautiful singer, Sandy tterschman. Fraught. With emotion from Joanna's meditations, the group Wrote the start of a song together. Sandy also gave us the opportunity to write our own songs in the workshop, beating.out the heartbeat on her drum* What I wrote became my most ^powerful song: \" Love is on the Other Side of Pain.\" It's about (Continued oh page 1 3) Mama Bears News & N o tW lS w e m h s ^ Jin W rlf '13 1 (Continued from page 12y fearing pain and not being able to get past it, and realizing that yes, I'm afraid but I need to feel it and go through it because I have women to support me. And in realizing that, I came up with the line which is the title. It reflects Joanna's words, and further lerrrte love again, because iri holding back the tears and the fears (for so many years) I also blocked a lot o f love-self love. My firewalk was composing, rehearsing, accompany\u00ad ing and memorizing my song to perform in front of the camp-by the next night, which J did. It was quite an act of power. I'll tjell- you I certainly wks shaking. So at camp I learned about love. (I fell in love with many o f the women there-gay and straight). The opening I did with my heart was the most important thing that I needed to do right then for myself. In doing \" soul^work\" with Anthea and tracing back the most important things that I had ever experienced in my life, I discovered that they were ail related to love and spirituality. The spirituality I have always wrap\u00ad ped around me has love at its heart, and I am finding ways to let it show more... O f the many leaders and women I met, Barbara Marks Hubbard was the most inspiring when she spoke to us and grabbed ail 'our hearts in the first minute. She spoke about how we can gather our wo\u00ad man power and knowledge in a very tangible.way and commit to working for peace and quality living with integrity in a network o f support.

Visioning a world that reflects who We are. Energy rose, excitement; connec\u00ad tions happened, the singing and dancing and a n . accelerated. We moved into the summer solstice day prepared to reveal our power, our real selves, and smash our fears, which we had manifested in masks that everyone had made during the week. Summer solstice. The day of celebrating action, power, creativity, doing our thing out in the world. I was honored to be imtited to drum with the musicians for the daylong ritual, and I participated in the ritual with everyone when there was no drumming. The day was powerful for me in a completely different way than 1 expected. I felt like 1 had grasped my power-gotten hold of myself; my purpose was reinstated, and I was loving, everything was okay. Crying, laughing, watch\u00ad ing dancing, being scared., acting foolish, losing m^ mask of cucumber cook and losing myself in cirum- ming-I wanted it not to end. I remember, then that she comes in cycles. I find myself, let her go to find her again in a new perspective. . V Before we left the next day, Saturday, in the closing circle I renamed myself and charged mysplf with learning to be compassionate. Quan Yin (who'se card I \"accidentally\" got two o f in my Daughters o f the Moon tarot deck) has something to teach us all, and the first thing must be compassion for ourselves. That for me is the key to unlocking, my joyfulness for living.

Allow yourself the compas\u00ad sion, the care, of self-forgive\u00ad ness. Let yourself float gently in the open heart of understand\u00ad ing, of forgiveness and peace.

Belle Burden is an eccentric, regal matriarch \"w ho always looked more dressed up than dressed,\" who describes hers^f as the \"w idow o f the richest bas\u00ad tard in Kansas.\" Belle controls the purse strings and thus the movements of her tomboy daughter, Charley. And Belle has never forgiven Charley for surviving when her brother, Clay, died. Charley knows that both sl)e and her brother were born want\u00ad ing what they weren't supposed to wan): for Clay it was fast cars, theap'wpmen, and too much liquor; for Charley it was the horses, spring calving, tending the cattle, flying the plane, driv\u00ad ing the combine. Now Charley lives at home and runs a ranch \"half the size o f a township\"-and all she gets is room and board. If it weren't for Lady, the spunky, wise black woman who cooks and keeps the peace, Belle and l Charley would never survive under the same roof. In her inimitable meddling manner, Belle decides to take in a border to provide \"some lively, intelligent conversation.\" Enter Juna, the hew second-grade schoolteacher. She is earnest, intelligent, and sharp, with a \"face o f high color, like a,par\u00ad ticularly appealing peach.\" She has come to Kansas in search of something, she's rrot si#re wJiat-adventure? romance? a life that satisfies? But Belle's bid to shake Charley up backfires when Charley and Juna form a relationship fa/ be\u00ad yond Belle's scope and standings relationship not control.

THE LAND OF LOOK BEHIND by Michelle Cliff Firebrand Books, $6.95 Michelle Cliff dedicates her new work, \"The Land O f Look Behind\" to sister \"Carib\" Audre Lorde, who shares the same background in the Caribbean Islands, a background that set them apart from black and white culture when they came to'this country. Audre Lorde, Paula Marshall, Ntosake Shange, and up with ences. As>Cliff writes, \"the sea is soitiething we.live with. It's around us, beneath us too.\"The sheer beauty of the landscapes of her beloved island of Jamacia permeates her thinking. She is deft in her boqk in describing this physical geography and her connection to it. She completes these scenes by bringing in the people who've inhabited her memories, combining all this with history lessons. A powerfully written mosaic of her deepest thought, emo\u00ad tions and understandings On \"origins, and the significance of these origins,\" Cliff states \"when I began finally, partly through participation in the feminist movement, to approach myself as a subject, my writing was jagged, non-linear, almost short\u00ad hand.\" This, plus the added constraint of a forty-hour-a-week job, compelled her to evolve a '.'noteform\" which.she has di\u00ad vided into chapters and sub\u00ad headings! The effect o f \" The Land O f Look Behind\" is to take ' u s on a transformative journey, \"a.journey into speech,\" illu\u00ad minating for us the culture trance we inherit and the ab- solute need, as she has done* to study ourselves.

From the opening line, \"I am not mad, only old,\" \" until the chilling resolution, Sarton'sclean prose reflects.the thoughts of her narrator: sharp, aware, tender, and unarticulated. Forced by medical problems * into a convalescent home, Caro fights for control over her life, her thoughts, her person. As her ex\u00ad periences lead her to muse, \"I wonder whether a person who has complete power over others does not always become wicked,\" we are led into a consideration of the. nature and effects of power. The development of the second\u00ad ary characters affirms the axiom ttiat relates power to corruption . Other \"patients\" (\"inmates\" is perhaps the more appropriate Word), well-meaning ministers, neglectful families and friends add to the.conflict which is gradually delineated for Us: to be or not to be. The presence of asubstitute attendant who is warm, friendly and uncorrupted by control over others fills Caro's life, briefly, with hope. There appears to be a chance for the future that, while still restricted as to space and mobility, w ill contain a positive relationship, conversation, and human understanding. After-Anna leaves, Caro writes her: \"I want to tell you that you have brought me back...from... hatred and despair to love.\" When Jthe letter is found, the respqnse is immediate and total: \"Well have you in the State Hospital if you dare send such a 'filthy letter.\" Confined and cut off from al\u00ad most all outside contact, Caro moves 'and we move with her) through levels o f depression and grief to a resolution that literally burns the house down. The final indignity o f having her journal read arouses Caro to'an intense assertion of self, and she flares to life for a last glorious action. Her rage and our empathy with her join forces to create a statement about the resiliency and inde\u00ad pendence of the spirit of a free,' strong woman that surpasses any\u00ad thing else around. And all in 128 pages! Read it if you haven 't alredy done so! If you have,'re-read it when you need an affirmation of the dignity and strength of your\u00ad self and your sistrrs.! ' - Barbara Class Mama Bears News & Notes/December-January 15 (Continued from page 1) Simultaneously, Neptune has taken up her position as the outermost (known) planet in our solar si stem-a 20-vear term o f office that repeats only every 250' years, (This is due to the erratic orbit of Pluto, who normally occupies this position and who moved in\u00ad side the orbit of Neptune in 197.9, remaining there until 1999). This means that currently our universe is being de\u00ad fined, circumscribed, limited by the symbol, o f non\u00ad definition and limitlessnessrNeptune! Confused? The point.is, there are no boundaries'. Neptune is a bridge between ordinary reality (our known universe) and nonordinary reality, which we have ascribed to \" beyond our universe.\" Neptune, Oneness, says we have something in common with whatever is \" out there. \" Popular sci-fi books and films currently show extra-terrestrials as friendly, helpful folks who we can relate to, and who often come to us with crucial,earth-saving information, rather than as the threats they were to us a couple o f decades ago. As Paula Gunn Allen points out in her recent haggle on vulnerability, we children o f the patriarchy go to great lengths to protect ourselves, our reality, from whatever we define as outside ourselves. We develop defense systems for our nations, our culture, our bodies: missiles, racism, inoculation, hair coloring- barriers erected against all those evils out there that are threats to our political and personal security, our immortality. Neptune's message is: 1 9 protect ourselves against what we imagine will give us only imagined protec\u00ad tion. \" The dreadful has already happened:\" we can imagine only what is in us already; there is no escape. As Pogo discovered: \"We have met the enemy and it is us.\" Neptune as the Mother is all-creative, all-inclusive. She is teaching us the power o f nonresistance, vulner\u00ad ability, compassion, balance. To our patriarchallv trained ears, this sounds contradictory, impossible. But she says, the more we reinforce and identify with divisions .betweerT seH and other, between, physical and spiritual, the more we have to lose when she c omesSo-dissolve and devour. In other words, the wav to iinmortalitv is the wav o f the Limitless Ocean: to sacrifice.the individual limited to our commonality, our oneness, our whole\u00ad ness. \" I\" exists beyond my physical bodv; \" we\" exist beyond our cultural, racial, national divisions, etc. The Feminine Principle is unconditional acceptance, compassion, ^aruna, honoring o f everything in the universe, for it is all Kali, Kwaii Yin, Tiamat, Great( Primordial Mother. There is norhing else. Th<* Reality o f Illusion When a planet enters a sign, the synthesis works iti both directions: the planet affects the sign, and the sign alfects the planet. So, not only is Neptune dis\u00ad solving the current form and structure, but she must also take form herself. ' Dreams, illusion, fantasy, intuition, imagination, vision, mysticism, all belong to Neptune-. We who fan see her through these vehicles must l>egin to give lior lormr paint her, write her, sing her, dance her. live her, be her. We can stat't in small wavs with small re\u00adminders o f her presence, to notice her, include her consciously in our lives (yes, even sushi bars can be meaningful). On a larger scale, women in positions of power will bring in the Feminist Principle: our roles, must gradually embody the whole, be inclusive, not exclusive. We must begin to give her form-our form. Die to her. Surrender. Be vulnerable. (Start women's spiritual services). The patriarchy (and the patriarchy in us) will resist, is resisting. As she becomes visible, it is trving to maintain control. Closing womert'-s abortion/family planning clinics, the visible representation freedom; legislating against 'witchcraft' (A3 705) up old laws against 'fortune-telling,' etc. Feminine sexuality/spirituality in all its forms will be its target. We must notice our personal resistance: the fears and hatreds we use to maintain divisions in our community and in our selves. ^ Neptune in Capricorn gives us an experience of the primordial state between death and birth, the twi\u00ad light/dawn /.one of one reality dissolving and another taking form. There are no divisions even here: it is beyond time. It is like the tide. However, in about 3 years, the planets Saturn and Uranus will-join Neptune in Capricorn. At this point of greatest resistance, c urrent structures will have cry\u00ad stallized to the shattering point. We'll see a changing ol the guard, a coup d'etat, as the Mother sends her envoys to carry out her directives more overtly: destroy the old, establish the new. Yes* it is the end of the world-as we know it. We are going beyond the limits we know. now. The new \" order\" will .be fresh from the womb; it will embody her. At least one myth describes her first\u00ad born child as a clone: we will live in Chaps; we will live Chaos. She is becoming manifest. The theme of this era is Close EncountersT'The message: We Are Not Immune. We arc 1 1 0 1 safe or divided from each other.*AIDS has become an inti\u00ad mate and a global symbol.' sharing the waters of Life also brings Death. .To us it is a horror; to the Wither, it is the essence of her eternal being. % It mav be hard for us to believe now in the revitaliz- ' .ing power o f the womb. We have forgotten the Mot her; we are Femembering her now. Those who are sacrificed in her memory are the teachers, the re\u00ad memberers, who reveal to us. the reality of the inner dimensions and the fantasy we have subscribed to. There are no separations; there areonfv our illusions. They *av >he^is veiled- and a mystery. That is one wav ol looking. Another . is that she is where 1 she- always has been, exactly in place-, and it is we, we who are linvstified, we who .are veiled id without faces.

I don't really understand how they managed to keep, on trucking, with that degree of shock to the system-but they do quite well, because, o f course, they do what we all do, they put one-foot in front o f the other, and pretty soon you're 70, and...all this stuff happened, and so what. But if v q u think about it, it's simply terrifying , the shocks, because they were born in rural New Mexico. They didn't have running w ater, even. They were bom into a state that was largely Mexican and Indian. The big\u00ad gest city was Albuquerque and there\"must have been 20,000, maybe 15,000 people at the time. It took them hours to get from where they were living as children into the city-they didn't go there very often. And then, they watched the space thing all happen, they went through the Second World War. They were bom in a world that never ever thought of nuclear bombs. I'm 46, but I don't remember a world without nuclear bombs. They didn't have electricity. Ydon't remember a . world without electricity. I don't remember a world without radio. I am an entirely different order of being from my parents, probably closer to children than my parents are to their children in terms of our shared experience, in terms o f what we can mutually understand. And I should think that that kind of shock makes one feel extraordinarily vul\u00ad nerable. \u00ae , As I was preparing this V&gle, I went to my handy- dandy dictionary, and. I was utterly amazed at the dearth o f information about vulnerability [laughs.] I'm convinced that 'vulnerability' and 'vulta' are connect\u00ad ed. [Laughter..] The dictionary is not so convinced. We'll have to do something about that. Vulnerability is said to mean liable to injury, and it comes from a Sanskrit word which of course 1 can't pronounce, but it means wound. But it might also be connected to thevsame root that \" vulgar\" comes from, and that means folk, volk, people. The Random House Un\u00ad abridged gives three definitions o f vulnerability: 1) capable of or susceptible to being wounded or hurt, as by a weapon, 2) open to moral attack, criticism, *rr temptation, 3) (of a place) open to attack or assault, difficult to defend. People who are aging, or aged, people who are very sick, who have life-threatening illnesses) or vyho don't have life-threatening illnesses but whose vulner\u00ad ability is apparent to us-they can't see, or they move about in wheelchairs, or they're missing a digit, or they have to be on special diets, or they can't go in a room with a microwave because their pacemaker will go crazy, or they have cancer, or they have AIDS- people who are vulnerable, are people that we are utterly terrified of. Why? Wpy are we so afraid that we'll catch their dying? The moment we were bom we . caught dying. That's how it is. Vulnerability is what life is. There's no way around being susceptible to wounding. And yet, we live in a culture, in a world, that insists, as its bottom-line right, on m-vul-nerability, on being impervious, forever, to any kind o f wpund ' or harm attacking it. For most Americans, that's true. Certainly for all o f those who are in the great middle classes, from the very lowest middle class rung to the very highest middle class rung, we believe that we have a right to invulnerability. Thus, a hundred million tortured Animals\u2014more\u2014 billions o f tor\u00ad tured animals, so that uxwon't die. Thus, enslaved Black South Africans, tortured 'Palestinians, des\u00ad troyed Indians, ruined lakes, ruined rivers, ruined forests, ruined wildland, and ruined air. We need to understand that life ;s death in another form. That vulnerability comes along as pan o f the territory. V/ejieed io understand that vulnerability is our Goddess-given right, or we will not stop the destruction o f life itself, in our mad, our psychotic pursuit o f invulnerability.There are many fomis of this game called invulner\u00ad ability. One of them, one of my favorite ones, is the Karpman triarigle:,'victim -persecutor-rescuer, and of course v o j j get into that stupid triangle because a) you believe in invulnerability arid b) you are vulner- . able, and given both of those things you can play end\u00ad lessly, one part of the game or another. \"War and Peace\" is one-of the games that we play around the dichotomy vulnerability/invulnerability. Nobody goes to war unless they feel vulnerable and they be\u00ad lieve' that they must not feel vulnerable. That's what they're fighting about. Security: Americans polled nationwide put \"security\" on the top of their lists of values; \" beauty\" is 17th. National security, personal security, economic secur\u00ad ity... medical security, security, security, security, security-I just recendy.subscribed to some home\u00ad owners'. magazines, and. it's amazing how many security devices they're trying to sell me, you know, and of course I want to buy them! I want to be secure! . [Laughter.] It's insane! ' Law and order-that's social security. Fundamental- ism-that's a form o f the impulse towards security, toward invulnerability. Radicalism is another form of the same dichotomy, the same equation. Capitalism and Communism are both systems human beings have devised hoping that they can therefore be se\u00ad cure. The welfare state is another form based on this belief in invulnerability. The pomographv/anti- pomography war is about the same thing. Alcoholism and drug addiction-I must be .impervious to pain, to emotion, to feeling; so I'll drink myself or dope myself into a stupor, so I will feel nothing but wonderful. And when you think about these things they always wind you up in exactly the opposite place. That's what's interesting about'this relationship. Thus, consumer- ism-you know Americans are the greatest plague of locust ever seen, even since Biblical times-we eat everything. Homophobia-\" Ech, get those faggots off of nje!\" ; misogyny-\"Women are fragile, delicate, v/eak-get them away from me\\\" How many o f us will claim our feminine right to fragility?, flow many o f us will do that? Not many. What / read in the feminist press is about our strength, our power, our invulner\u00ad ability. Our right to never, ever be attacked, or hurt, or harmed, and our utier, utter determination to prevent hami from ever occuring to us. Some of us are so determined that no harm will ever come to us as females, that they are willing to sacrifice the life of every male on the planet Every male. That's murder. That's what that is. There's no other way to think about it. And i{'s no different from the race wars that go on, as the white people decide that they must be in\u00ad vulnerable, therefore they will kill every human being of color in order to maintain their invulnerability. It's the safrie thing. Or the bully-bovs thinking they must kill everyting feminine and soft otherwise they can't be invulnerable. It's all the same kind o f thing. We have nuclear power. We have nuclear,power... because we wish to be invulnerable. Russia has nuclear power because she wishes tp be invulnerable. France has nuclear power because she wishes to be in\u00ad vulnerable. Israel has nuclear power because she wishes to be invulnerable. Libya has nuclear power because she wishes to be invulnerable. Iran has nuclear power because she wishes to be invulnerable. The net effect o f all this invulnerability is that we are all, at last, equally vulnerable. To death. Which we were all equally vulnerable to before the whole thing began. Nothing has changed. Only the stakes have increased, so it's not only our vulnerability, butthat of every living being on the planet that we have called to question. We have ritual spiritUalitv-that's very trendy this year. And what we're doing this year with our spiritual ability is making shields! To protect,us from our 'vulnerability. That's what we're doing. We're doing protection rituals so that no harm can befall us. We have medicine, in the established world. Do you know what the medical establishment does? Well, it saves billions o f lives, and it creates billions of diseases while it's at it. And it loses billions of lives, because if . we take our animal brothers and sisters into account as being pan of us, then just as many are dying as are living. Just as many are suffering, as are being freed from suffering. Maybe more. We have bureaucratic institutionalization of life .functions: health, education, welfare, law, govern\u00ad ment, to provide for the common defense, to pro- (Continued on page 17) (Continued from page 16) mote the general welfare, and to secure to ourselves and our posterity, life, liberty, and the pursuit o f hap\u00ad piness. Governments are instituted among men to insure that we can live without insecurity. Without invulnerability. Without anxiety. Without fear. With\u00ad out pain. Without death. We believe that we should be psychologically invulnerable. We believe we shouldn't weep, we shouldn't grieve, we shouldn't be.angrv, we shouldn't hurt. We believe that. We spend billions and billions of dollars on tranquilizers, and onjisvchiatricservices-to keep us from experiencing the pain o f human life. To make everything okay. To wipe our tears so we can smile forever, and heaven forbid that another tear should ever fall. We develop social systems that are founded on the notion that human beings.have a right to never suffer. We believe that deeply. As I listen to myself; I think, \"What are you saying?1 \" I'm horrified at what's coming out o f my mouth, even though I know ' that what I'm saying is true. Even so, I'm deeply con\u00ad ditioned, deeply infected by this invulnerability plague. O f course, the assumption that we could .be in\u00ad vulnerable implies its opposite. All of our systems, all of our Western world, all o f our death culture depends on the assumption that we should never die. Think about it. It's crazy. It's crazy. But the middle classes of America believe that they should never die. They, believe that. They chlorinate the water-you know what I heard on T.V. yesterday? (Hah, hah, I love it...) Chlorinated water gives you liver cancer. So there. (Laughter.) Pretty soon the Surgeon General is going to have warnings on all our taps. Next time you ask for a glass of water, ask for a glass o f cancer. Why do they put chlorine in the water? Right-to kill the little bug\u00ad gies. (Hah, hah, isn't that great?) We believe that vulnerability is to be shunned at every level, in every aspect o f our existence. How\" many of you will willingly go out in the street in the morning looking ugly? [Laughter.] Not me! How much . money is spent c| n cosmetics, face lifts, all those sorts of things, girdles,} trendy, clothes...my trendy clothes here...This ipriv menopause suit, I would like laughter help. Matronly ladies' beads, oh help. What on earth is going to happen to me now? I'm vulnerable. There's no wav around it. And what being menopausal has been for me is growing more and more aware of how incredibly fragile and mortal I am, and how little control I have over that. I have no power to prevent anything happening to me. There's nothing I can do. I am helpless in the face o f life herself, who has said, \" You will die. You will get sick. You will not feel good. Your hands will get arthritic, and when -vou trv to pull the stupid piece o f wire out o f the stupid turkey so that you can stuff the stupid thing, it won't coine out because your hands won't'close, they won't grip.\" Who says, \" You can't go climb the mesas anymore. You can't. Oh, you think you can in your head, so you go to the mesas and Vou start to climb, and guess what? You can't.\" And there's no sense in going iq the gym and working out so that I can climb the mesas-all I'm doing is forestalling the inevitable. You know what alcoholics do, that I think is the most instructive thing that alcoholics do, is they h id e. their bottles. (Isn't that weird?) So that you won't know that / know how drtmk.I am. Not so that you won't . know I'm drunk-l'in staggering around, falling all over vou-you know perfectly well I'nt drunk. But to p*S*vent the shame that i would experience if I know vou know that I kno\\\u00a3 what I'm doing, I will hide my bottles. Foodaholics will hide their chocolate cake, in the hamper, and then eat it-ech. AND THEN N O \u00ad BODY CAN SEE W H ATTH EY LOOK LIKE. [Open ing her jacket.) Oh, oh, but I know how to fix it so that you won't see what I look like. I'll eat and I'll eat and I'll eat, and then I'll go vomit and vomit and vomit. And I'll take diuretics and I'll take laxatives, right, so HI pee and I'll pee and I'll.shit and I'll shit, an d you'll never know I know. But I will also know, that you don't know, and therefore; I' m fine. Invulnerability is really at that level. It's not so much at the external level, as it is that We're taught to believe that we must not ex\u00ad perience our weakness,- our powerlessness, our de\u00ad loathsomeness. But we 'all experience it! We-all.have to sit down with ourselves. 1 I'm a writer. And-what I know about being a writer \u00bbs that I canlt write unless I am completely vulnerable.Goi tpletely. It's terrifying. I'll do anything rather than writt Anything-because I can't bear to be here all alone- - > stupid, so powerless, so weak...so clicked, so tri^e, S i ungrammatical. You know,- why can't I be elegant.- Well, if I could be famous, everybody would think I w % elegant and that would work just as well, wouldn't i a [Laughter.] We have tine million wavs o f Avoiding, for our\u00ad selves, our \\ dnerability. I, have children, and they watch a lot o cartoons. And it's interesting, you should check ut Saturday morning, in you adult\u00ad hood. There isi t a show that isn't about invulner\u00ad ability. The big 0 1 *s are the Super Hero ones. Those ale the big ones, l it there are other ones-Tom and Jerry, you know? Ti V re all about invulnerability. So that our children art 'earning that the good guys are invulnerable and thel \\d gUys are vulnerable. That's what they learn. And th < v'U go to great lengths to avoid being vulnerable, whic! to tljem means bad. The United States jut did the most horrifying thing, does them all the tin e, but this one was recent, so it's on my mind. We hija ked an Egyptian airliner and we kidnapped a bunch c '' people. We didn't say, \" Hah, hah, hah, we hijacked y\u00bb u back\" , which at least would have been honest, and could have enjoyed that. [Laughter.] No, we said, \"W. 're hefoes!\" Heroes?! \"We're proud o f America.\" One nt vscaster said, \" The mighty giant reached out its gre\u00abx hand [laughter, groans] and with a flick o f its little,finger...''...and there's no sense that this is not okay, there's no sense that there's something dreadful going on. We invaded Grenada, and the United States, the,people of the United States were ecstauc-\" Oh bov, we showed them. We're powerful, we're- invulnerable.\" We showed them that we're bullies, and we also showed them that we're incredibly stupid. I was raised on a Mexican land grant in New Mexico that's about the size of Grenada, and.it has about the same population. I can just imagine the United States invading Cubero... and it being in the headlines, and the good citizens be\u00ad ing proud o f the strength o f the United States. I hope that that son of strength is not the kind tl^Mt you will accept for yourselves. I hope that the kind d l strength that you will accept is acknowledgement of your'weakness, of-your fragility, of vour mortalitv, of .you disease, of your horror, of your pain. We have an epidemic called AIDS. AIDS is a failure o f the immune system. Everybodys' immunesystems under the assaults o f the past thirty years are failing. AIDS is just one way it's showing, that's all. But Americans, I hear, are saying ^he most ^mazing things. 1 heard, some women talking one day and thev said that they were leaving San Francisco because it was dangerous to live there.- They were in the theatre and they were leaving the theatre because so many faggots are in the theatre. This is terrifying. Todav,.a number of arts groups are raising a lot o f money for AIDS, and one o f the men who was talking about the opera's contribution said that the opera has been devastated by this epidemic because so many, many people in opera are gay. And the opera community is playing with the AIDS victims among them and loving them, and raising money for them, for their people who are dying o f a \u00bb terrible disease. But you know w'hat's the most terrible thing about AIDS? It looks awful! Do you know how'many people dte in automobile accidents? Is anybody running around talking about the Auto-i mobile Accident Plague?. Are we raising billions of dollars to prev ent it? A re wt refusing to allow children in . jchools who drive automobiles? Are we doing any of those things? Heavens no! No. But the AIDS victims look:.. they age so rapidly, they weaken so quickly, they go through a full life cycle in fojir or five years. That's .the dreadful thing about AIDS. It tells us that we can't live...that's all. We can't live. I'm not sure who ever said we could, but we seem to believe that we could, regardless. And so we're all going to move to'New England,'where they don't have AIDS, I suppose. So, suppose we didn't fear death. Suppose we were able to acknowledge oUr vulnerability. Then maybe our aging, our fat, our diabetes, our arthritis, our loss o f sight, h'eanng-our coloredness, our lower class status, our lack of college degree-all o f those things... jf we accepted vulnerability as our birthright, how would we treat those who are poof? Who are insane? Who are addicted? I.think that, probably we. wo'uld treat everyi>ody, and ourselves, very differently, if we could accept that,our right is vulnerability, and our destruction is invulnerability.
