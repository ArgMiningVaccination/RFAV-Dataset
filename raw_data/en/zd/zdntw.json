As enshrined in public health principles, vaccination and Naturopathy are comparable, and Naturopathic students study public health as a discipline.Many persons in Ghana call themselves Naturopathic Doctors, however they do not believe in Naturopathy's embrace of public health fundamentals like vaccination. Are vaccinations also naturopathic? Objectives: The knowledge and awareness of vaccinations in Naturopathic practise among Ghanaian Naturopathic Medical Students is examined in this case study. Methods: The study used a qualitative approach to collect primary data from respondents via a drafted questionnaire. The survey consisted of a series of questions that were given to ten (10) people.Naturopathic Medical Students from Ghana's Nyarkotey College of Holistic Medicine were chosen as respondents for this study. Results: Vaccines, according to the Naturopathic medical students, are a part of the Naturopathic profession and are consistent with Naturopathic principles. Surprisingly, only one of the ten respondents received the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The remainder, on the other hand, have expressed an interest in receiving the vaccine but are waiting to see how the side effects play out before making a final decision. Conclusion: Naturopathic Medical students have adequate knowledge and understanding of vaccines in the practise of Naturopathy. Vaccines are part of the practise of Naturopathy and public health in general, so they are not against public health protocols in a global pandemic, according to the respondents. 2004 New Frontiers in Medicine and Medical Research V Background: When combining Naturopathy with Public Health, there is a natural temptation to discover parallels between the two medical systems.Public health, for example, is concerned with disease prevention, promotion, and education. These, too, are intertwined with naturopathic ideas. Using a qualitative analysis, this research examines whether there is a link between Naturopathy and Public Health practises from the perspective of Naturopathic Medical Students, as well as their knowledge and understanding of both fields. Methods: A qualitative descriptive questionnaire was distributed via WhatsApp to ten (10) Second Year Diploma in Naturopathic Medical Students at the SSM - Qualitative Research in Health Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medical Research Background: Naturopathic medicine is at its embryonic stage of development in Ghana and West Africa in entirety. In jurisdictions where Naturopathic medicine is well regulated, Naturopathic practitioners are well integrated into the primary healthcare delivery team. In Ghana, the case is quite different due to a myriad of issues. Objectives: This study examines the role of Naturopathic medicine in Public Health in Ghana and potential policy direction for adoption of Naturopathic protocols in global pandemic management, the challenges faced by Naturopathic Physicians in primary healthcare delivery, and the challenges of Naturopathic Medical Students on their clerkship at one of the designated government Hospitals. Methods: The study adopted a mixed questionnaires study engaged in integrated data analysis. The respondents in this study were selected Naturopathic Medical Students of the Nyarkotey College of Holistic Medicine, Ghana. Vaccine 2001 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become a popular form of healthcare and the predictions are that, it will increase further. The reasons for this level of popularity are highly diverse, and much of the motivation to turn to CAM pertains to a deeply felt criticism of mainstream medicine - many people (are led to) believe that conventional interventions, including immunisation, are associated with the potential to do more harm than good. Thus, it is hardly surprising that CAM also lends support to the \"anti-vaccination movement\". In particular, sections of the chiropractors, the (non-medically trained) homoeopaths and naturopaths tend to advise their clients against immunisation. The reasons for this attitude are complex and lie, at least in part in the early philosophies which form the basis of these professions. The negative attitude of some providers of CAM towards immunisation constitutes an important example of indirect risks associated with this form of... IP Indian Journal of Library Science and Information Technology Background: This study explores the opinion on legislative and regulatory effects on the practice of Naturopathy from the perspectives of Naturopathic Medical Students in Training. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research approach using a Case Study design was employed. An unstructured questionnaire was sent to 50 Naturopathic Medical Students in Ghana's first Naturopathic Medical School. A question-by-question analysis was then carried out. Results: We found unanimous agreement among respondents in support of legislation to regulate Naturopathic Practitioners in Ghana. Conclusion: We found that regulation, legislation, or standardization affects every profession globally. Recommendations: We advocate for strict legislation and regulation to streamline Naturopathy in Ghana.

Background: This long essay explores the legal authority of Ministerial directives by the Minister of Health to the Traditional Medicine Practice Council to regulate the Practitioners of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Ghana. Additionally, the long essay explores the effect of legislation on the treatment practices and role of naturopaths in the Ghanaian Healthcare space. Methodology: A qualitative research approach using a case Study design was employed. Data was collected using an unstructured questionnaire to conduct interviews among 22 respondents who are Naturopathic Doctors in training at Nyarkotey University College of Holistic Medicine & Technology(NUCHMT). A question-by-question analysis was then carried out. Results: This study found that, though there exists a Ministerial directive on CAM practices to the Traditional Medicine Practice Council to regulate CAM Practitioners, this Ministerial directive can be challenged in Court. Additionally, there is unanimous agreement from respondents in support of legislation to regulate CAM Practitioners in Ghana. Conclusion: Though, some respondents expressed some discomfort on the proposed standardization in CAM especially in Naturopathy. It must be stated that, no profession can succeed without regulation as it provides the framework for the industry. Indeed, regulation, legislation or standardization affects every profession globally. Original Research Article Naturopathy Medicine is a new system of Medical practice gaining popularity in Ghana. Naturopathy uses science to bridge the gap between Conventional Medicine and Traditional Medicine through the Four Learning Areas of Science, which includes all the Basic and Medical Sciences like Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology as well as Pharmacology, Pathology, Medicine, Pharmacognosy, etc. This notwithstanding, the practice of Naturopathic Medicine has many challenges in Ghana as a new emerging medical practice. This paper investigates the challenges in the practice of Naturopathy and other alternative medicines in Ghana. Twenty (20) Naturopathic Medical Students were asked to write three challenges they faced in their Naturopathy and other alternative medicines during a class lecture on Naturopathy. In their result, the predominant issues raised by the students were regulatory issues in Ghana and limited Universities or training institutions to teach Naturopathic students. Other pressing challenges were insufficient government support to push alternative remedies, efficacy of natural products coupled with manufacturing compliance, cost of usage of natural products by patients, unhealthy challenges with medical fraternity and uniformity in Naturopathic association. In conclusion, practitioners of naturopathic medicines faced many challenges in Ghana and there is the need for the regulatory body, The Traditional and Alternative Medicine of the Ministry of Health to help raised the standards in the practice of Naturopathy Medicine. This can be achieved with government support to have the new Traditional and Alternative Medicine bill pending passed. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies Background This descriptive study provides the first examination of global naturopathic education, regulation and practice frameworks that have potential to constrain or assist professional formation and integration in global health systems. Despite increasing public use, a significant workforce, and World Health Organization calls for national policy development to support integration of services, existent frameworks as potential barriers to integration have not been examined. Methods This cross-sectional survey utilized purposive sampling of 65 naturopathic organisations (educational institutions, professional associations, and regulatory bodies) from 29 countries. Organizational representatives completed an on-line survey, conducted between Nov 2016 - Aug 2019. Frequencies and cross-tabulation statistics were analyzed using SPSSv.25. Qualitative responses were hand-coded and thematically analysed where appropriate. Results Sixty-five of 228 naturopathic organizations completed th... ADRRI JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH We examine the history and development of Naturopathic practice in Ghana. We adopted a two-stage qualitative research design, which includes a semi-structured key informant interview accompanied by a document search with the primary stakeholder who is the President of the Ghana Alternative Medicine Practitioners (GAMPA) association at the Ministry of Health who was identified through a process of the Key Informant Technique. Information collected from the key informant was triangulated with documentation under his purview in the archives from his office and other literature searches. A narrative analysis was then carried out. Early and the majority of current Naturopaths received their education through a correspondence system of education. The first Naturopathic Medical School which had developed the first-ever higher National Diploma (HND) and Bachelors in Technology Naturopathy under the Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and Trainings (CTVET) is yet to receive program accreditation. Also, the lack of standardized education in Ghana has averted the development of the industry to enable the achievement of the full potential of the Ghanaian healthcare system. Conclusion: Naturopathy has gained huge momentum in Ghana. Our result demonstrates the history of proceedings that occurred in the Naturopathic profession space in Ghana from the 1960s to the modern era.
