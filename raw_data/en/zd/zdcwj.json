Explore the Valmet Advantage AirCap. Optimizes drying and energy efficiency Improves the work environment in terms of safety and maintenance Choice of solutions to decrease emission levels When investments are strongly driven by the need to be more competitive, improve product quality, while being environmentally responsible, Valmet Advantage AirCap (AAC) is the answer. We offer you our 50-year experience with more than 500 Yankee hoods successfully delivered worldwide, as well as our continuous research and product development. The construction of the Advantage AirCap is well proven to optimize the distance between the hood and cylinder on the AirCap wrap at all operating temperatures. A controlled thermal expansion also ensures a long life cycle of the equipment, one of the longest in the industry. You can also choose a special construction that allows for operating temperatures up to 700\u00b0C. The graph shows the correlation between gas consumption trend and hood/cylinder distance. The Advantage AirCap Air system is dimensioned and designed to optimize energy efficiency and reduce emissions to the atmosphere. On the Advantage Aircap you have a full profiling on the Wet End and additional profiling zones on the Dry End edges to control over- drying. You also have a manual or actuator-remote controlled profiling zones. The Advantage AirCap has an automatic washing system to remove dust from the hood roof, thus preventing the risk of fires. Not only does it provides you with a healthier and safer working environment, it also reduces downtime needed for cleaning and maintenance. This can also be integrated with the Dry End Dust Cap washable roof of the Advantage WetDust system Valmet has developed a new Yankee hood which allows a perfectly even drying profile on one side and the possibility to correct a non-optimal moisture profile on the other. As a result, a better final product quality, with less converting problems and a higher profitability are achieved. The arrangement of the crescent headers is normally oriented in Machine Direction. In the patented Advantage AirCap Heli the headers are tilted in Cross Direction. Therefore, the average drying intensity transferred to the paper is perfectly uniform in Cross Direction, thus eliminating the hood footprint in any working condition. The new helical design determines a gradual average impingement speed variation with which the drying paper travels below the hood, as the crescent headers are at an angle and the paper always travels below two adjacent crescent headers. The Advantage BalanceControl system allows the mill to maintain - in an automatic and continuous manner - the optimal settings of the air system, such as balance and exhaust humidity level, as well as to select the best drying parameters in the choice between temperature and impingement speed. The system constantly detects and adjusts the parameters, and the air system flows characteristics (air temperature, pressure, volume flow and humidity values) to fix and always maintain the lowest specific consumption costs required for the drying. The automatic control can be accessed both locally and remotely and the settings are continuously adjusted to comply with the machine balance and the individual drying strategy. Real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting enhance an optimum machine operation and data are collected for further benchmarking activities. The energy saving in turn leads to lower emissions and improves the environmental footprint of tissue production. Saving potentials Advantage BalanceControl, burners for alternative fuels, the waste heat steam generator and air to water heat recovery can help you save water, energy and reducing CO2. And therefore lower the environmental footprint in your tissue production. Get in touch with us and we can discuss more in depth what it could mean for your mill. | | Energy | | Water | | CO2 + 500 "}
