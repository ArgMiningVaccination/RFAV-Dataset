This book is NOT intended to answer every question about every statute and court case impa cting this population, but offers instead a thorough first look into this fascinating area of law. The laws in this book are annotated to assist the reader in understanding the legal interpretations of these statutes. Court Cases and General Counsel Opini ons ar e binding on the implementation and scope of the law within their jurisdiction. Where applicable, we have added the legislative intent to help the reader understand the purposes and goals of the Legislature in the construction of the law. This type o f information can be very valuable in advocating for your client. The book uses [brackets] to enclose words added by other than the original drafters to help clarify the meaning or to clearly identify the topic of the law. Please take notice of the effect ive da te of this publication. The law changes as often as the tides, and is relevant and binding only in its most recent incarnation. If there is a question regarding any law referenced in this book, please contact the General Counsel of the New York Stat e Division of Veterans' Services . 2 Empire State Plaza 17th floor Albany, NY 12223 p. 518.474.6114 www.veterans.ny.gov 10 EXECUTIVE LAW Executive Law Article 17, Section 350 \u00a7350. Definitions When used in this article: 1. The term \"division\" means the division of veterans' services . 2. The term \"state director\" means the New York st ate director of veterans' services . 3. The term \"veteran\" means a person, male or female, resident of this state, who has served in the active milit ary or naval service of the United States during a war in which the United States engaged and who has been rel eased from such service otherwise than by dishonorable discharge, or who has been furloughed to the reserve. 4. The term \"armed forces\" means the mi litary and naval forces of the United States. 5. The term \"local director\" means the director of a county or cit y veterans' service agency. 6. The term \"county director\" means a local director of a county veterans' service agency. 7. The term \"city director\" means a local director of a city veterans' service agency. 8. The term \"qualifying condition\" means a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury made by, or an, experience of military sexual trauma, as described in 38 U.S .C. 1720D, disclosed to an individual licensed to provide health care services at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility or an individual licensed to provide health care services within the state of new york . The division shall develop a standardized fo rm to confirm that the veteran has a qualifying condition under this subdivision. 9. The term \"discharged LGBT veteran\" mean s a veteran who was discharged less than honorably from military or naval service due to their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, as those terms are defined in section two hundred ninety -two of this chapter, or statements, consensual sex ual conduct, or consensual acts relating to sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or the disclosure of such statements, conduct, or acts, that were prohibited by the military or naval service at the time of discharge.

Practice Notes, Cases, and General Counsel Opinions The term \"Veteran \" lacks a standardized definition in New York State. While this statute limits the term \"Veteran\" to New York State residents who served dur ing a war in which the United States engaged, the Division of Veterans' Services proudly represents all individuals who served in the military, whether during \"wartime\" or \"peacetime.\" 2 Empire State Plaza 17th floor Albany, NY 12223 p. 518.474.6114 www.veterans.ny.gov 11 Executive Law Article 17, Section 351 \u00a7 351.

Notes: Acceptable Military Records: The New York State Departm ent of Taxation & Finance maintains an online listing of \"Acceptable Military Records for Veterans' Property Tax Exemptions.\" This listing shows all of the military documents that a local assessor may accept as valid proof of an applicant's active duty military service: https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/exemption/vetexemptproof.htm Individual Unemployability: A Veteran with an Individual Unemployability rating from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs is recognized as receiving a disability compensation ra ting of 100% for Alternative Veterans Exemption calculation purposes , regardless of the Veteran's actual numerical rating. Significant Full -Time Active Duty Military Service: The term \"significant, full -time active duty military se rvice during wartime\" ( 11 Op. Counsel SBRPS No. 58) is vague, and is often ambiguously applied. Local assessors hold discretion to determine whether an applicant's military service qualifies as \"significant.\" For instance, most assessors have held that members of the National Gu ard and the Reserves who were activated by President Richard Nixon during Operation Graphic Hand, a military action to counter the effects of a strike of postal workers throughout the United States, did not perform \"significant\" mili tary service. This is p articularly important in New York State, given that post offices in New York City were arguably the focal point of Operation Graphic Hand, with Servicemembers ensuring that essential mail was delivered while the postal workers were o n strike. However, local assessors hold the authority to declare that this service was not \"significant\" enough for exemption eligibility purposes. See also City of New York v. Civ. Serv. Comm., 60 N.Y.2d 436 (N.Y. 1983) (\"It is not enough that an applicant's service fall with in the literal definitions of 'member of the armed forces' and 'time of war' if that service did not significantly interfere with the applicant's normal employment and way of life.\"). 2 Empire State Plaza 17th floor Albany, NY 12223 p. 518.474.6114 www.veterans.ny.gov 73 Surviving Spouse: If a Veteran passes away from a service -connected disability, then the surviving spouse of that Veteran is eligible to receive the Alternative Veterans Exemption at a level as if the Veteran rec eived a 100% rating from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs during the Veteran's lifetime. This rule applies even if th e Veteran received a service -connected rating lower than 100% -- or even no service -connected rating at all -- during the V eteran's life.

Findings and declaration of emergency [Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act] It has been nationally recognized that because of the emergent conditions which are threatening the peace and imperiling the se curity of the nation, there is imperative need to augment and strengthen the national defense. It is further recognized that the emergent conditions which endanger the national well -being likewise constitute an imminent threat and hazard to the peace and s ecurity of the people of the st ate. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the exigencies of national defense require that the people of the state, in large numbers, be called into military service, and as a consequence, the health, prosperity and welfare of al l of the people of the state is inevitably affected. In these circumstances, and in order to promote and to assist the national defense, and thereby to protect the peace, prosperity and health of the people of the state, it is necessary that citizens and residents of the state in the m ilitary service as well as those who are members of the organized militia or of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States should be free to devote their entire energy and effort to the defense needs of the nation and of the state. To ass ist in this end, it is essential to provide in certain cases for the temporary suspension of legal proceedings and transactions which may prejudice the civil rights of persons in the military service. It is further essential in the interests of the prosper ity and well -being of the people of the state, that such persons, upon completion of military service, be restored to their former employment. The legislature finds, further, that citizens and residents of the state, not in military service, who are members of the organized militia or of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States are being discriminated against by certain employers who either refuse to employ them because of such membership or, if employed, discharge or otherwise dis criminate against them because of such membership and that such acts of discrimination jeopardize the recruiting of citizens and residents of the state into the organized militia and the reserve components of the armed forces of t he United States and other wise affect the security of the state.

Notes: The New York State Division of Veterans' Services (DVS) disagrees with the Appellate Division, Third Department, in Canzoneri v. Hevesi . This opinion fails to recognize the true nature of military service academy service, creating the wrongful impression that a service academy's students are no different regarding their military obligations than students in a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at a traditional college.
