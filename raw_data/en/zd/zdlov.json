Several different conditions can cause pain in the hip or pain in the buttocks that radiates down the leg. It could be hip pain due to bursitis or [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or related to [sciatic nerve pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435) or piriformis syndrome. TCM and acupuncture treatment can help relieve pain in the hip, buttocks, and [lower back](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). The hip joint is very complex; it's made up of a ball-and-socket bone structure with almost 30 different muscles and tendons surrounding it. Hip pain is common, especially among older adults, although people of any age can be affected by pain in the hip, buttocks, or lower back. It can be difficult to pinpoint the causes of hip pain, as there are many different possible reasons for hip pain, and the aching sensation can move from place to place, or suddenly become more intense. The hip pain location, the quality of the pain, and when it happens can tell us a lot about what is causing pain in the buttock or hip area, so it is important to pay close attention to the type of hip pain. For example, is it sudden hip pain? Hip pain gets worse at night? Is the hip pain worse after sitting for long periods? What does arthritis in the hip pain feel like? Hip pain that develops slowly over a period of time may be due to osteoarthritis. Other signs of osteoarthritis of the hip include: - Hip pain worse in the morning, feel better after moving around. - Grinding sensation, ache, stiffness, soreness, sometimes, hip feels locked up. - Hip pain that gets worse when start to exercise, but usually gets better once warm up, and worse again after excessive exercise. - Pain that goes from the hip down to the knee or across the back This is the type of arthritic hip pain that comes on with age and many years of use, as the cartilage that cushions the hip joint wears down over time. [Osteoarthritis of the hip](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/osteoarthritis-of-the-hip/) can be more painful when it rains. Left untreated, hip osteoarthritis can cause people to lose mobility and even walk with a limp. Sharp hip pain or tenderness when you lie on your side or sit down may be due to hip bursitis. - Hip pain worse at night - Hip pain stiff when getting up - Difficulty walking, hard to squat or sit - General ache all over the back, groin, hip area Bursitis is inflammation of the small, fluid-filled sacs that provide cushioning around large joints like the hip. The outer part of the hip bone is topped by the [trochanteric bursa](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4964-trochanteric-bursitis); when this bursa becomes inflamed, due to a bump or fall, overuse, or some other injury, it can cause pain on the outside of the hip or buttock area. Gradually worsening hip pain, or feeling stiff and sore in the morning can be a sign of hip flexor tendonitis or [tendinitis of the hip](https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/hip-tendonitis). This is caused by inflammation of the tendons and connective tissues in the hip, usually due to high intensity sports activities. A shooting pain that seems to radiate down from the hip to the leg and even the foot is often a sign of sciatica, a kind of nerve pain. The sciatic nerves extend from the lower spine and branch out into the buttocks and down the legs. When the sciatic nerve is compressed, it can cause numbness, tingling, pins and needles, or radiating pain to shoot from the buttock down one leg. Other [sciatica symptoms](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/sciatica/sciatica-symptoms) can include: - intermittent pain that comes and goes - weakness in one leg - sharp pain that feels like a jolt - burning pain in buttock, burning pain in one leg - pain that is worse when bending or standing Sciatic pain can happen due to impingement or a pinched nerve from a [herniated disk](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/) in the lower spine (lumbar herniated disk), or other spinal problems like spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine that compresses nerves) or spondylolisthesis (slipped disc). Radiating pain in the buttock that is similar to sciatic pain can also be caused by problems with the soft tissues of the buttock, especially the piriformis muscle. Inflammation, spasms, or tightness in the piriformis muscle can cause compression of the sciatic nerve, which runs just underneath, or in some cases, through the piriformis. This condition is known as [piriformis syndrome](https://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/sciatica/how-tell-if-your-sciatica-actually-piriformis-syndrome). Moderate hip pain is usually treated with medications and/or injections to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, along with perhaps a referral to physical therapy (PT) to help strengthen the muscles of the hip. Severe hip pain that persists beyond treatment with PT and medication may lead to surgery as a last resort. In many cases, [TCM methods including](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32442) acupuncture can help relieve the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis, sciatica, bursitis, tendonitis, and other causes of hip pain, without the [side effects of medications](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or complications of hip surgery. Top 10 Hip Pain Causes Pain in the hip and buttock on one side, pain in the butt, or hip pain can be related to one or more of a variety of conditions affecting the hip joint, the lumbar spine, or the soft tissues of the hip and buttock area. Causes of hip pain can include: - Arthritis hip pain or Osteoarthritis of the hip - arthritis is a general term for joint pain. Pain in the hip joint can occur due to constant wear-and-tear over the course of many years, leading to inflammation in the hip joint and the breakdown of cartilage. - Bursitis outer hip pain - swelling and inflammation of the hip bursae - Sciatica in hip - nerve pain due to compression of the sciatic nerve - Piriformis syndrome - inflamed or tight muscles in the buttocks compress the sciatic nerve, causing pain or numbness in the buttock, hip, and leg - Hip Tendonitis - trauma or use injury to the connective tissues of the hip joint - Sacroiliac joint pain or SI joint pain - the sacroiliac joints connect the hip bones to the lower spine and tailbone. This joint is designed to move subtly; too much or too little movement can cause dysfunction and pain across the low back and hips. It is fairly common for women to experience some SI joint pain (and also sciatica) during pregnancy. - Muscle strain - if one of the large muscles that makes up the hip joint is stretched past its usual range of motion, [hip strain](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/hip-strains/)can cause pain and swelling. This can happen during normal daily activities, but most often happens during sports or exercise, possibly if someone has not warmed up adequately. [Hip dysplasia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-dysplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350209)or Dislocated hip - some people are born with anatomical abnormalities of the hip joint, when the socket part of the joint doesn't fully fit around the ball part. This can lead to instability in the hip, dislocation of the hip, damage to cartilage, pain in the groin and hip, and higher risk of osteoarthritis. - Hip fracture - fractures in the hip are common among older people, women especially. A hairline [hip fracture](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/what-happens-when-you-have-a-hip-fracture)or broken hip may cause a vague pain in the lower back, pain in groin, or pain down the leg or knee pain. Hip fractures can lead to other serious problems, like blood clots, infections like UTIs, or pneumonia. - Hip Labral Tear - a labrum is a piece of cartilage that absorbs shock and helps the functioning of the major joints of the body in various ways. You may have heard of a labral tear in the shoulder that causes [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/); [hip labral tear](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/bones-joints-and-muscles/hip-labral-tear.html)is similar. This could mean overall degeneration of the cartilage, or the labrum becoming detached from the bone, or the formation of a cyst around the area. Injury to the labrum of the hip can cause pain deep in the groin. How Is Hip Pain Treated? Hip pain is usually treated initially with anti-inflammatory pain relief medications like NSAIDs. Cortisone injections may also be recommended for conditions like bursitis or hip tendonitis. While cortisone shots for hip pain may help relieve pain in the short-term, repeated injections can cause damage to the area. Cortisone can also raise blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous for people who have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Arthroscopic surgical techniques allow orthopedic surgeons to operate on the hip joint in a minimally-invasive way. This may be done to repair a torn labrum or remove loose cartilage. More complex surgery may be indicated to repair hip dysplasia or serious degeneration due to osteoarthritis. [Hip replacement surgery](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement/) is becoming more common, with over 450,000 total hip replacements currently being performed each year in the U.S. While many people are able to get relief from chronic hip pain through hip replacement, it is a major decision, and there are significant risks involved, including: infections, fractures that occur during the surgery, nerve damage, etc. The risk of blood clots after a hip replacement necessitates taking blood thinners. Even under the best circumstances, the prosthetics that are implanted during a hip replacement do not last forever, and some people may have to have a second operation to replace the replacement. Acupuncture treatment can help to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain in the hip due to osteoarthritis and other complaints, without the risks of long-term pain medication use. Can Acupuncture Help Hip Pain? According to TCM theory, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) of the hip is considered a Bi Syndrome, a condition in which stagnation of blood and Qi (life force energy) causes pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints. Cold, wind, and heat are pathogenic factors that cause the blockage of energy moving freely through parts of the body. Imbalances in the organs, such as the kidneys, gallbladder, spleen, and stomach can also contribute to Bi Syndrome hip pain. Standard approaches that seek to alleviate pain do not help treat the problem at the source. A TCM practitioner can address the root source of the blockage and pain with acupuncture and herbal supplementation. Sciatica nerve pain that affects the buttock, hip, and leg is also considered to be a Bi Syndrome condition, and is due to obstructions in the flow of Qi through the gallbladder and bladder meridians. Acupuncture treatment helps [relieve nerve pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575738/) by acting as an analgesic, reducing pain signals and increasing the production of endorphins in the body, while reducing inflammation in the surrounding tissues and helping the nerves to heal. [One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1535-acupuncture-relieves-sciatica-reduces-inflammation) of patients suffering sciatic pain who were treated with TCM found that acupuncture alone had an 81.6% efficacy rate for reducing pain symptoms, while acupuncture combined with herbs was 95% effective. A [follow-up](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1003525719300777) with patients who had been treated with acupuncture for sciatica related to herniated disc showed that people had experienced long-term positive results. Tendonitis of the hip and hip bursitis are inflammatory conditions that can also be helped with acupuncture and herbs. A [review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2016-011332) of acupuncture treatment for pain related to herniated disc concluded that TCM methods worked better than pain medication or traction therapy. An experienced TCM practitioner will also be able to help you with making changes in your diet and exercise programs that will reduce inflammation while strengthening both your Qi and the muscles of your lower back and hip joints. Top 5 Tips for Hip Pain Here are some steps you can take to get rid of hip pain and prevent it from coming back, in addition to getting acupuncture treatment and taking Chinese herbs: - If lower back pain and hip pain is due to sciatic nerve pain, pinched nerves, or disc problems/herniated disk, it is still important to keep moving your body. Too much time in bed can actually do more harm than good. When exercising, be sure to warm up adequately. Take things slowly, and listen to your body. Vary your exercise to include gentle movement modalities like Tai Qi, which emphasize rotation of the joints. Strength training, working out with weights, is also great to strengthen the major muscle groups that support the back and hips. - Some conditions, such as a hip labral tear, muscle strain in the hip, or fractured hip, may require rest to heal. It can be difficult to take time out for healing in our modern fast-paced culture, but do your best to use this time to rest well, work on a meditation practice, and make your health your top priority. - Don't keep your phone or wallet in your back pocket. This creates imbalance and puts pressure on one side of the hip and pelvis. - Be sure that your sleeping position helps to reduce stress on the lower back. Using a bolster under your knees may help. Mattresses should be medium-firm. - Weight management, or losing weight, can help to take a lot of stress off of the joints. An anti-inflammatory diet (avoid spicy foods, and nightshade vegetables: tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant) will also help. Acupuncture Near Me for Hip Pain Hip pain is not something to ignore. Healthy hip joints are vital to continued mobility and quality of life. Sadly, it is well-known that a fractured hip often means the end of an active life for an older person. It doesn't have to be this way. If you or someone you love is noticing hip pain interfering with life, it may be the time to treat hip pain with acupuncture and herbs. Adding an acupuncturist to your healthcare team for integrative care can make all the difference. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Irregular Heartbeat With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Does if feel like your heart \"skips a beat,\" or your heart is \"fluttering?\" Maybe you feel your heart beat is fast or slow, compared to your normal heart rate. Lots of things can cause your resting heart rate to be uneven. [Acupuncture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28642714/) and TCM can be beneficial as both an adjunct or alternative to drug therapy for [paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312232/), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and other types of arrhythmia that cause heart palpitations or a fast heart rate. The pulse rate is controlled by electrical impulses that originate in the sinus node, which is located in the right atrium, or upper chamber, of the heart. The feeling that your heart rhythm is off, or different from your normal pulse rate is called [Arrhythmia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668). The average resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. A fast heart rate-more than 100 beats per minute-is called [tachycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/tachycardia--fast-heart-rate). A slow heart rate-less than 60 beats per minute- is called bradycardia. It is natural to have a slightly high heart rate during or just after exercise, or or a slow heart rate during sleep or times of relaxation, as when meditating. In some cases, a rapid heartbeat is related to [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Sometimes a rapid or irregular heart rate may be related to caffeine consumption or a side effect of some medication. Other times, it may be a sign of heart disease or other chronic condition that needs to be addressed. Other symptoms related to irregular heartbeat include: shortness of breath, chest pain, sweating, and [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The heart is composed of four chambers; the top two chambers are called the atria, into which blood is received, and the two bottom chambers, the ventricles, from which blood is pumped out to the lungs and the rest of the body. Medical science classifies deviations from a normal resting heart rate both according to their rapidity and the chamber of the heart that seems to be problematic. There are different medications available to help restore the regular rhythm of the heart, as well as [therapies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16751-arrhythmia-treatments) that deliver electrical impulses to the heart through a catheter, and devices, such as pacemakers or defibrillators. In many cases, arrhythmia is not a serious problem. But in other cases, it can increase the risk of blood clots, [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other life-threatening conditions. It is advisable to consult a medical professional if you are having an irregular heartbeat often enough to be concerned. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural way to help restore heart function and a good resting heart rate without the unwanted side effects of medications or invasive procedures. Top 10 Types of Irregular Heartbeat There are many different terms that describe deviations from a regular, healthy heart rate. Some irregular heartbeat issues are due to congenital conditions, while others may occur due to trauma, disease, or aging. - Atrial flutter - an accelerated heart rate that occurs in an organized and rhythmic way due to rapid electric impulses in the atria. [Atrial fibrillation](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af)(AFib or AF) - a rapid heart rate, also caused by increased electrical impulses in the atria that happen in a chaotic, arrhythmic way. Fibrillation refers to the rapid and irregular movement of muscles. In the case of AFib, the upper chambers of the heart quiver quickly. This condition is associated with stroke. [AFib with RVR (rapid ventricular response)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603354/)is a condition that occurs when patients are critically ill, often in the ICU, when the atrial fibrillation causes the ventricles to beat faster. - Ventricular fibrillation - rapid impulses in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) cause ineffective pumping of blood out to the body. - Supraventricular tachycardia - this refers to types of arrhythmia that originate in the atria (above the ventricles) and cause brief episodes of accelerated heart rate. - Ventricular tachycardia - a fast but regular heart rate that does not allow the ventricles to fill with as much blood as usual. - Sick sinus syndrome - more common among older people, this is when the sinus node is malfunctioning and may sometimes cause a fast heart rate, and other times, a slow heart rate. - Long QT Syndrome - a heart disorder found in people with a particular genetic mutation that causes rapid heartbeat and fainting spells. - Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome - some people are born with an extra electrical pathway that can cause extra or irregular signalling to occur. - Conduction Block - a block of the electrical pathways that sometimes results in a slower heart rate. [Premature ventricular contractions](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/p/premature-ventricular-contractions.html)- this is when an extra heartbeat beat originates from the ventricles, rather than the atria. It can feel like a \"skipped\" beat, or your heart pounding or jumping in your chest, but it is actually a kind of extra beat. This can happen occasionally due to drug stimulants like caffeine or nicotine, or other medications like decongestants or antihistamines. It can also be due to heart disease creating scarring in the ventricles or in the structural parts of the heart that hold the pathways for electrical impulses. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots and strokes because blood is not being effectively pushed from the atria into the ventricles, so blood pools or collects in the atria. What Causes Irregular Heartbeat? In general, most types of arrhythmia are caused by some disorder of the electrical conduction system that controls the beating of the heart valves, or weakness of the heart itself, which is known as [cardiomyopathy](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults). Causes of tachycardia include: - Not enough blood nourishing the muscles of the heart. - Dilation or one or more valves of the heart, meaning that the muscle tissue becomes thinner and the chamber becomes enlarged. - Thickening of the walls of the heart chamber makes them stiff; this is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. - Scar tissue makes the heart tissue more rigid (restrictive cardiomyopathy or dysplasia). This can happen due to inflammation, high levels of iron or protein in the tissues, sometimes as a side effect of cancer treatments (radiation and/or chemotherapy). Arrhythmic right ventricular dysplasia may be an inherited condition. Causes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter include: - High blood pressure - damage to the heart from a heart attack or heart surgery - Coronary artery disease - Congenital heart defects - Hyperthyroidism - Lung disease, infections, or [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Sleep apnea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or overuse of other chemical stimulants Chronic conditions like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), obesity, metabolic syndrome, kidney problems, alcoholism, [Parkinson's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or a family history of heart problems increase a person's risk for developing an arrhythmia. Treatment for Irregular Heartbeat There are several different types of medications to treat irregular heartbeat. Tachycardia may be treated with [antiarrhythmic](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/medications-for-arrhythmia) drugs, which work by suppressing or depressing the electrical impulses that are misfiring or transmitting signals too quickly. Beta blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce blood pressure by reducing the production of adrenaline. AFib treatment often involves anticoagulants or blood thinners, which prevent the formation of blood clots. In some cases, these medications can work to help people maintain a steady heart rate and prevent serious events like strokes. The downside is that they must be taken daily on an ongoing basis, and in some cases, they can actually cause the heartbeat to become even more erratic. Medical [procedures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/arrhythmia-treatment) that are designed to help irregular heartbeat include: electrical cardioversion, in which an electric shock is used to help \"reset\" the heart rate, and ablation, in which the tissues that contain the electric impulse pathways are intentionally scarred in order to reduce their output. Implantable devices such as defibrillators or pacemaker monitor the heart rate and deliver small \"shocks\" to alter the rhythm of the heartbeat. For some people, these methods work to keep the heart functioning. In some cases, though, the surgery to implant the device causes complications or damage to critical tissues around the heart or lungs. Can Acupuncture Help Irregular Heartbeat? In conventional medicine, and indeed, in Western culture, the heart is seen as one of the most important, if not the most important, organ in the body. Not only does it supply the whole body with oxygenated blood, but it also is associated with our deepest emotions. [TCM also views](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/466695) the heart as a central organ that governs the blood and vessels, and also the mind and spirit. The traditional diagnostic methods employed by TCM practitioners can tell us a lot about the health of the heart. The feeling of the pulse gives us detailed information about the strength, quality, and speed of the heart rate. According to TCM theory, the heart \"opens\" out into the face, and so observing the pallor or color of the face, the brightness of the eyes, and the appearance, especially, of the tongue, also gives the acupuncturist vital information about the heart. TCM providers [classify different causes](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/737-palpitationsinsomnia) of irregular heartbeat by looking at the whole concert of presenting symptoms: - Heart Qi deficiency or Blood deficiency: may happen after a long illness or loss of blood and be marked by heart palpitations, dizziness, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and/or [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/). The pulse will be weak, and the tongue pale pink. - Kidney yin deficiency with Heart Fire: chronic illness can deplete the kidneys so that they can no longer manage the balance of fluids and heat, so heat rises and disturbs the Heart. With this presentation, a person may be experiencing strong feelings of fear or anger, [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [ringing in the ears (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), and stomach problems. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the acupuncturist will choose acupuncture points and [ herbs](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2017/1381732/) to clear heat and dampness, nourish the blood, and calm and strengthen the heart. [Specific herbal formulae](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5282678/) work to activate and maintain blood flow, removing stasis, while also helping to protect the spleen and stomach. A controlled [study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1723-acupuncture-plus-herbs-regulate-heart-arrhythmias) that compared patients with arrhythmias and tachycardias who were treated with medication (Lopressor) versus patients treated with both the medication and acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulations. The patients who received integrative care showed statistically very significant improvement over the patients using medication only. A [systematic review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00358/full) of randomized trials that compared acupuncture treatment versus typical medication treatment found that both types of treatment were equally effective for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, that acupuncture in addition to medication was effective for ventricular premature beat, and that acupuncture was beneficial over no treatment at all for sinus tachycardia. Acupuncture Near Me for Irregular Heartbeat Unfortunately, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Americans. [Over five million](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2019/02/15/14/39/aha-2019-heart-disease-and-stroke-statistics) people in the U.S. experience atrial fibrillation, or heart flutter. The conventional methods of treating heart problems such as AFib and other types of arrhythmia can work, but they require people to become completely dependent upon medications or devices. These methods of treatment are also very expensive. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct approach that can help improve heart function and restore a healthy heart rate without side effects. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Hemorrhoids With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hemorrhoids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Bleeding and discomfort when you go to the bathroom? Burning or itching around the anus? [Hemorrhoid pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268) is caused by swollen blood vessels around the rectum. Acupuncture and TCM reduce inflammation and can bring swift hemorrhoid relief. Sometimes called \"piles,\" (from the Latin \"pila,\" meaning \"balls\"), hemorrhoids often do resemble little balls or clusters of grapes. The word \"hemorrhoid\" actually refers to the specific formation of blood vessels and cushioning tissues that surround the anus. Colloquially, though, the term is usually used to describe the [condition of inflammation and irritation](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/hemorrhoids) that can occur in this area. [Hemorrhoids](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoids_and_what_to_do_about_them) are very common; probably more than half the population experiences them at some point in their life. However, the discomfort of talking to a doctor about hemorrhoids can be almost as miserable as the physical discomfort of having them, so many people avoid getting hemorrhoid help. How do you know if you have a hemorrhoid? Sometimes people have a lot of itching, burning and discomfort after a bowel movement, or throughout the day. Sometimes there is no pain, but you may see a little bit of blood in the toilet bowl, or when you wipe with toilet paper. When you touch the area, you may feel a lump, or swollen tissue. Hemorrhoids are generally classified into two categories based on their location: internal hemorrhoid and external hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids form inside the anus and lower rectum and can cause bleeding, usually without pain. In some cases, though, the swollen veins can protrude out from the anal sphincter during or after a bowel movement and then need to be pushed back in. This is called a \"prolapsed internal hemorrhoid.\" The situation can become more serious if the internal hemorrhoid can't be pushed back in, or if a blood clot develops in the vessel (thrombosis); then, it becomes painful to go to the bathroom, or even sit. In some cases, a prolapsed hemorrhoid becomes \"strangulated,\" meaning the blood supply is cut off, which can cause severe pain. [Hemorrhoids](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hemorrhoids) become [prolapsed](https://www.healthline.com/health/prolapsed-hemorrhoid#causes) because the connective tissues in the area weaken due to intense pressure, usually due to straining during a bowel movement, or because of the extra weight of pregnancy or obesity. [External hemorrhoids](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0415/p1629.html) develop outside the anus, under the skin. These are the kind of hemorrhoids that tend to cause itching and a little bit of bright red bleeding. Again, they are aggravating, but not too serious unless a blood clot forms; then, it is called a \"thrombosed external hemorrhoid.\" This type of hemorrhoid can turn blue or purple in color and become acutely painful. In some cases, surgery will be performed to drain blood from the clot, or remove the hemorrhoid. Most of the time, people suffer quietly with hemorrhoids, waiting for them to go away on their own. Only when they cause severe pain and bleeding are medical treatments considered. However, TCM and acupuncture offer a way to deal with hemorrhoids so that they heal more quickly and reduce the chance to return. Top 10 Hemorrhoid Causes What causes hemorrhoids? The tissues and blood vessels around the anal area can become weak, irritated, and inflamed. The upright posture of our human bodies naturally puts pressure on the elimination organs. Many women get hemorrhoids during [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/) and/or birth because of intense pressure on the perineal area.The major reasons for hemorrhoids include: - Pregnancy [Constipation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sedentary lifestyle - Straining while on the toilet - Sitting too long on the toilet without progress - Lack of dietary fiber - Obesity - Family history of hemorrhoids - Aging Overall, focusing on eating a diet that includes plenty of fiber, drinking enough water, maintaining good bathroom habits (going when you feel the urge and not waiting) and a healthy weight will go a long way towards preventing hemorrhoids. But what can you do when you already have hemorrhoids? Treatment for Hemorrhoids Often, people will just deal with hemorrhoid itching and pain on their own by using over-the-counter products like creams that contain phenylephrine, which constricts blood vessels (Preparation H), or disposable wipes impregnated with witch hazel and other soothing ingredients (Tucks medicated pads). These treatments may help reduce pain and swelling temporarily, but they do not get rid of hemorrhoids at their root. When people do talk to their [doctor about hemorrhoids](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment), they may be prescribed something stronger, like a steroid cream, or hydrocortisone rectal suppositories. If the situation persists or becomes more severe, there are several types of outpatient procedure to treat hemorrhoids, including rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared photocoagulation, and electrocoagulation. All of these procedures cut off blood supply to the hemorrhoid, so that it will form scar tissue and fall off. Hemorrhoid stapling and hemorrhoidectomy are outpatient procedures in which the hemorrhoids are surgically removed, and/or prolapsed tissues are affixed back inside the anus. While these surgeries may be helpful in some cases, recovery can be painful, and there can be problems with the way things work afterwards, potentially leading to more surgery later on. When hemorrhoids are severe, it is a good idea to consult your doctor, as there are more serious conditions that may produce similar symptoms of pain, itching, or bleeding, including [anal fissure](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/anal-fissure) (torn tissue or open sore in the anus due to trauma or [Crohn's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) complications), [anal abcess (infected cavity in the anus) or anal fistula](https://fascrs.org/patients/diseases-and-conditions/a-z/abscess-and-fistula-expanded-information) (an opening from the anal or rectal area that drains pus and/or fecal matter). Sometimes skin tags develop around the area where a hemorrhoid has healed. These can be irritating and difficult to keep clean, so they may need to be surgically removed. For the treatment of hemorrhoids, TCM methods can provide relief from symptoms and help to reduce the inflammation that caused them. Can Acupuncture Help Hemorrhoids? According to TCM philosophy, hemorrhoids can often be related to a build-up of heat and/or dampness in the lower abdominal area; it's the heat and dampness that cause the blood vessels to swell. You might be concerned by the idea that acupuncture treatment for hemorrhoids would involve needles being placed in a highly sensitive, private area. Let us reassure you this is not the case. The [Du Mai meridian](https://acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32524), also known as the \"Sea of Yang,\" is the channel which runs from the rectum area up along the spine to the top of head and then down to the mouth, controlling Yang energy throughout the body. We use points along this meridian, on the top of the head, and in other parts of the body to draw excess heat and dampness away from the area where the hemorrhoids are. Other presentations of hemorrhoids include: Top 5 Types of Hemorrhoids Presentation in TCM - Spleen Qi Deficiency - This is when people tend to have poor digestion, bloating, gas, and diarrhea, going to the bathroom very often; the hemorrhoids feel swollen, but not as red. We use moxibustion to work on stomach point 36 meridian point, CV points 6 and 4, and spleen 6 in the middle of the abdomen to help digestion. - Spleen Qi Sinking- This presentation tends to happen to people who are thinner, not only having hemorrhoids, but all the organs tend to be lower than usual; may also have prolapsed bladder or uterus, and poor digestion. Moxibustion applied to the middle of the top of the head will head the Qi rise up. For both types, doing Kegel type exercises regularly can help to strengthen the rectal area, also the uterus and bladder. Do three sets, increasing a bit every time: for example squeeze 30 times, release, do again 35, rest, next 40, then rest. Do this exercise every morning and evening. - Blood Stasis - This type is more and more common because of our modern lifestyle, due to sitting a lot for work, which causes blood circulation to be compromised. In Chinese, we have a proverb: \"for 10 people who sit too long, 9 will have hemorrhoids.\" These manifest more as red, swollen, maybe bleeding. Kegels will also be helpful here, too. - Lower Jiao Fire/Heat - This is when the lower part of the body has too much fire. For this type of hemorrhoids, people tend to have more bleeding, especially triggered by having alcohol, spicy food, crunchy food. These are the kind that may feel very sore with a burning sensation and tend to bleed, especially when wiping. - Intestinal Dryness - especially here in California, where we have hot, dry weather, without a good habit of drinking water, people can tend to constipation, even going only once or twice a week. These types of hemorrhoids are due to dry, uncomfortable bowel movements, and may have itching and bleeding. Adding more water (warm is better) and more moisturizing foods (sesame oil and lots of ripe bananas, flax seeds, chia, sweet potato/yam, prunes) will be helpful. Kegel type exercise is helpful for all of these types, to strengthen the sphincter muscle and bring more circulation to the area. Add more movement overall. At bedtime, leg lifts, bicycle movements in the air, upside down, are a good way to exercise without putting pressure on the lower body. Ideally, when there is good digestion, between 5:00 - 7:00 a.m. is when people should naturally want to go, quickly, without too much need to push. Sitting on the toilet for too long creates the pressure that leads to hemorrhoids. [Moxibustion treatment](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/11/01/soothing-natural-cures-hemorrhoids)-the burning of the herb mugwort near an area-can be very effective for reducing pain quickly. [Chinese herbal formulations](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Hemorrhoids+(Piles)+and+Traditional+Chinese+Medicine+), used both internally and externally, can help relieve inflammation and pain. An herbal tea formula may include herbs to help strengthen the energy of the spleen, and to lubricate the digestive tract. We also recommend sitz baths as a home remedy for hemorrhoids: short, 15-minute baths in warm water, to help soothe the area and keep it clean. Your acupuncturist may give you an herbal bath sachet to use to help reduce inflammation and soother the tissues. [One study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1003525718300333) of acupuncture treatment for internal hemorrhoids showed that, after 24 days, 86% of patients were \"cured,\" while another 8% showed significant improvement. Your acupuncture practitioner will also talk with you about changes you can make in your diet and bathroom habits that will help you get things moving more easily. Acupuncture Near Me for Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are not only irritating; they are a sign that you may need to pay more attention to what you're eating, and that you need to give yourself a little more time for relaxation, in and out of the bathroom. A combination of acupuncture, herbs, and other TCM treatment for hemorrhoids can help get the pain and swelling behind you. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How To Treat Dizziness With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Feeling light-headed and dizzy? Maybe you feel like your head is spinning, or that the world is spinning around you? Headache, nausea, [dizziness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dizziness/symptoms-causes/syc-20371787), and vertigo are symptoms that can be caused by a variety of health problems. [Acupuncture and TCM offer](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+for+Vertigo) vertigo treatment that can help relieve that sense of dizziness and nausea, or feeling light-headed and tired all the time. Feeling dizzy is one the [most common](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/6422-dizziness) reasons that people go in for a doctor's visit, or even visit the emergency room. Dizziness is a fairly general term that can mean anything from feeling light-headed, woozy, faint, off-balance, or unsteady to feeling nauseated or like you're about to pass out. Vertigo is a specific type of dizziness that refers to a sensation of spinning, as if the room around you is moving. You might feel like you're leaning to one side, or about to fall over. It can make you feel sick to your stomach, similar to motion sickness. In popular culture, the word \"vertigo\" is sometimes used to mean a \"fear of heights,\" but that is actually called \"acrophobia.\" The sensation of vertigo can be triggered by looking down from above, or looking up at something very tall, but this is not the cause of most episodes of vertigo. Vertigo causes include migraines and problems with the inner ear. The inner ear and eyes both relay information to the brain about a person's spatial relation to the environment, so when the functioning of the eyes or ears is disrupted, it can cause a sense of imbalance, and even nausea. [Migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), particularly a specific type called a [vestibular migraine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vestibular-migraine), can cause pressure in the head and dizziness and nausea. [Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertigo/symptoms-causes/syc-20370055) (BPPV) is one type of vertigo that causes short-term bouts of sudden dizziness. Benign positional [vertigo](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/vertigo) is caused by the shifting of calcium crystals (canaliths) in the inner ear. This can happen due to a head injury or simply aging. Other inner ear problems that can cause signs of vertigo include Meniere's disease and Labyrinthitis. [Meniere's disease](https://vestibular.org/article/diagnosis-treatment/types-of-vestibular-disorders/menieres-disease/) is a chronic disorder related to abnormal amounts of fluid (endolymph) collecting in the inner ear. The exact cause of Meniere's is unknown, but it develops more frequently later in life. [ Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) causes attacks of vertigo that can last from a few hours up to 24 hours. Like migraines with an aura, there is often a period of time during which a set of \"warning symptoms\" begin to occur, such as: a feeling of uneasiness, being off-balance, headache and dizziness, queasiness, hearing loss or ringing in the ears, or extra sensitivity to sound. Once an attack of vertigo hits, it can be quite severe, causing intense pressure in the ear, blurred vision, vomiting or diarrhea, cold sweats, [rapid heart rate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and feelings of fear and panic. There is currently no cure for Meniere's. [Labyrinthitis](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/l/labyrinthitis.html) refers to inflammation of the small parts of the inner ear, or around the nerves of the inner ear that can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, such as: a flu, measles, herpes, hepatitis, [Epstein-Barr](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mononucleosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chicken pox, or childhood ear infections. Symptoms of labyrinthitis can include: dizziness, nausea, [tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), and [difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Lightheadedness is a similar sensation to [dizziness](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/dizzi) in some ways, but is usually caused by a sudden change in [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/) or the flow of blood to the head. You have probably experienced feeling light headed and dizzy when you get up too fast from sitting or lying down. Other causes of lightheadedness include: allergies, anxiety, [anemia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hyperventilating, [arrhythmia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [heavy bleeding (as during menstruation)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Dizzy spells happen to everyone once in a while. But recurrent [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and dizziness should be addressed. Acupuncture and TCM have been used to help dizziness for thousands of years and offer natural solutions to the underlying causes of vertigo. Top 10 Causes of Dizziness Feeling light headed and dizzy, or having headache, nausea, dizziness, can occur as symptoms of a variety of imbalances. Reasons for dizziness may include: - Inner ear imbalance, or labyrinthitis - apnea, snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) migraine - Dehydration - alcohol, diuretics - Sinus issues - Ear infection - Low Blood Sugar - [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hypoglycemia - Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - Prescription Medication side effects Dizzy spells that occur first thing in the [morning](https://www.healthline.com/health/waking-up-dizzy-causes#causes) are common for some people. This can be simply due to the change in pressure in the ear when you get out of bed. Waking up dizzy due to sleep apnea occurs because this condition obstructs your breathing during the night, and you may have lower oxygen levels when you wake up. Being dehydrated is another common cause of dizziness, which is exacerbated by drinking alcohol before bed. In general, drinking too much caffeine, too much alcohol, and not enough water, or taking diuretics can all lead to dizzy spells. Low blood sugar, whether due to diabetes, or simply not eating regularly enough, can also be a cause of light-headedness. [Hepatitis, HBV, or HCV](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also cause dizziness. [Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pots-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) causes dizziness when moving from a seated or position or lying down to standing up. Cervical vertigo, or [cervicogenic dizziness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759906/), is another type of vertigo caused by the positioning of the neck or cervical spine; in this case, the feelings of imbalance and spinning may be accompanied by [neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). This type of vertigo may happen, for instance, after a whiplash injury. Treatment for Vertigo The medical treatment for dizziness and [vertigo](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/vertigo-treatment) depends wholly on the underlying causes for the symptoms. If a bacterial infection in the ear is confirmed, then antibiotics may be used. In cases of BPPV, a canalith repositioning [procedure (CRP)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17930-canalith-repositioning-procedure-crp) is a non-invasive technique that can help the crystals within the inner ear move back into their proper place. Migraine-related vertigo may be treated with the medications typically prescribed for migraines. Anti-nausea drugs like Dramamine may be suggested. Patients suffering from cervical vertigo may be referred to physical therapy to help improve the positioning and strength of their neck/cervical spine. Can Acupuncture Help Dizziness? One of the central concepts of TCM is that of the root and the branches. The branches are the visible, outward signs or symptoms of a problem, while the root refers to what is going on deeper in the organ systems of the body. In the cases of dizziness and [vertigo](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32770), there is deficiency in the root and excess in the branches. Pathogenic factors involved in dizziness and vertigo are phlegm, wind, fire, and deficient Qi. When there is weakness in organs like the spleen, stomach, kidney, or heart, pathogens like wind, heat, and phlegm can take hold. The San Jiao, also known as the \"triple burner,\" is another important concept in TCM; one of its primary functions is to control the movements of fluids in the body so that they don't collect and build up inappropriately. In case of vertigo, phlegm and heat develop to the point of causing stagnation and malfunctioning of the Jiao, pushing phlegm upwards in the body. An acupuncture practitioner will carefully listen and observe to discover which organ systems are out of balance, and work to strengthen those areas. For example, dizziness combined with emotional disturbances like anger and depression is a sign of too much wind or heat in the Liver. Weakness in the heart or spleen may follow a long illness or period of [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Too much phlegm, heat, and dampness in the stomach and spleen can result from an improper diet and too much stress. Acupuncture and herbs to tonify these organs and clear heat and phlegm will take care of the root of the dizziness. Meanwhile, [specific acupuncture points](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) can have an almost immediate effect at relieving immediate discomfort, facilitating a natural vertigo cure. A study conducted at a hospital in Taiwan used acupuncture to treat patients with dizziness and vertigo. The [findings](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1496-acupuncture-relieves-dizziness-and-vertigo) conclusively showed immediate improvement in symptoms. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4459064/) of 60 patients who were admitted to an emergency room suffering from vertigo from a variety of causes, including Meniere's and BPPV, showed that acupuncture treatment provided immediate relief of symptoms and is therefore a good alternative for dizziness due to various causes. Top 5 Tips to Get Rid of Dizziness Depending on the cause of the vertigo, there are different ways to manage with TCM techniques, including vertigo exercises, acupressure for dizziness, moxibustion, and foods to avoid. Major 4 types of Vertigo/Dizziness presentation: - Hypertension type - When a person has high blood pressure, too much liver yang, and is overheated, it can cause dizziness. For this, we use acupressure Liver points 2 and 3 on the toes. - Qi and Blood deficiency - if a person shows signs of anemia, or has heavy periods, hemoglobin is low, or if a person has chronic conditions, or has suffered a major injury, or recently given birth, experienced major blood loss. For this we want to ensure a good diet with plenty of soups and easy to digest foods. Moxa on the back can help to strengthen the body's Qi and produce enough blood. Qi Gong exercise of squeezing the earlobes and outer ear up and down is helpful. - Kidney essence deficiency - this could be due to some constitutional weakness, or due to old age, or someone who tends to have chronic illness, diarrhea. The kidney essence can't support rising essence to the head. For this, acupressure for Kidney 1 - on the bottom of the foot. - Phlegm stagnation - when the middle jiao is not working due to stagnation of phlegm creating blockage so Qi cannot ascend. This happens when people are overweight, or have poor digestion, diarrhea. Avoid dairy and fried foods, which encourage phlegm. Moxibustion treatment to the back is helpful, and applying pressure to Stomach-36 acupressure point can help the middle jiao open up. - Neck Pain - if a neck problem is causing a blockage, due to a neck disease or [bulging disc](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/), unhealthy cervical disks, compression, tension, and muscle spasms can block upwards energy. Exercises to encourage the health of the neck discs, loosen up the muscles and allow flow of Qi and blood up to the head. Your acupuncture practitioner will recommend neck exercises to help with this. Acupuncture Near Me for Dizziness Vertigo and dizziness may not be life-threatening symptoms, but they can have a big impact on your daily life. Frequently being blindsided by unexpected dizziness, spinning sensations, nausea, and headaches is unsettling and debilitating. Medications can be helpful in some cases, but they can also cause unwanted side effects. Getting to the root cause of vertigo with acupuncture and TCM will help get rid of dizzy spells so they don't keep coming back. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat ADHD With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) child have ADHD? Do I have ADHD? [ADD/ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889) is a mental health disorder that causes children and adults to have problems with concentration, hyperactivity, or both. Trouble in school, problems at work, physical restlessness, mood swings, and frequent feelings of frustration can all be signs of ADHD in children and adult ADHD. Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help symptoms of ADHD holistically, without the side effects caused by ADHD medications. ADD stands for Attention-Deficit Disorder, referring to the poor concentration and problems staying on task that are often experienced by people with this neurodevelopmental disorder. Children and adults with ADD are easily distracted; they may appear to be \"daydreaming\" a lot of the time. ADHD stands for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, in reference to cases in which a person also exhibits impulsiveness, or difficulty sitting still. ADHD usually starts in childhood; often, ADHD symptoms carry over into adulthood and continue to cause problems if not addressed. While ADHD in adolescents and children has been studied widely in recent years, the causes are still unknown. It is generally believed to be due to disordered biological processes occurring in the brain, and considered to be possibly genetic in origin. [ADHD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/adhdadd) may be related to atypically low levels of chemical neurotransmitters like dopamine. Metabolism in the part of the brain that controls attention, movement, and social interaction appears to be different in brain imaging tests of children with ADHD. For children with ADHD, this may lead to problems in school, even learning disabilities. Interrupting, not being able to wait their turn, fidgeting, and being forgetful or seeming \"careless\" are the obvious outward signs of ADHD that can make school challenging for children, and cause them to be considered disruptive in the classroom. Adult attention disorder may show up as reckless behavior (traffic tickets, accidents, etc.), problems in relationships, trouble organizing things like paying bills or missing appointments, losing belongings, not being a \"good listener,\" or anger management issues. According to current conventional medical thought, ADHD is considered a psychiatric condition: a product of chemical imbalance in the brain. ADHD in children is associated with behavioral problems that make it difficult to excel in school. Adults with ADD may have trouble finding success in their daily work and lives. For these reasons, people will consider getting medical treatment for ADHD. As with most psychiatric issues, treatment tends to focus on a combination of behavioral counseling and pharmacological intervention. Medications used to treat ADHD in both children and adults are stimulants that are thought to help boost attention span and a person's ability to focus. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can be used as an adjunct therapy or an alternative to medical treatment with drugs for ADHD in both children and adults. Top 3 Types of ADHD: ADD or [ADHD symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html) manifest in a unique combination in each individual. Presentations of ADHD are divided into three categories: - Inattentive/easily distracted type - Hyperactive, impulsive behavior type - Combined type, exhibits both inattention and hyperactivity While boys are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, this may have something to do with the fact that [ADHD symptoms show up differently in girls](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-in-girls-symptoms-of-adhd-in-girls-20547) than they do in boys. Parents and teachers may have a stronger tendency to explain girls' behavior as being personality-based (\"talkative\" or \"tomboy-ish\") rather than a serious problem worthy of attention. Girls may also be more likely to compensate for their ADHD, finding coping mechanisms that help them get along with teachers and appear to be OK, even if they are struggling with schoolwork or social problems. [ADHD and ASD](https://chadd.org/about-adhd/adhd-and-autism-spectrum-disorder/) (autism spectrum disorder) can often present in similar ways, and can coexist in some cases. Over half of people who have been diagnosed as autistic also show signs of ADHD, while about a quarter of people with ADHD are also considered to be on the autism spectrum. Some of the key differences between these two neurodevelopmental disorders are that children with ADHD are much more likely to show improvement in their behaviors as they grow up, and that people with ASD are more likely to exhibit \"hyperfocus\" rather than distraction. When symptoms of ADHD are found in children, it is not unusual for parents to recognize that they, too, have faced similar struggles in their lives. [ Research suggests](https://exceptionalindividuals.com/neurodiversity/what-is-adhd/) that about half of the time that a child is diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, at least one of their parents shows signs of the disorder, as well. Top 10 Symptoms of Adult ADHD Because ADD/ADHD is a mental health issue, it can be difficult to clearly identify. Many of the symptoms associated with ADHD are similar to those of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). It is not uncommon for people with adult ADHD to also have anxiety or [depression,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) so the conditions overlap. - Trouble focusing on tasks or multitasking, poor concentration - Impulsive behavior, recklessness - Disorganization - Poor time management skills, difficulty prioritizing or staying on topic - Restlessness, [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Easily frustrated - Frequent mood swings - Lose temper easily - Difficulty articulating thoughts to others - Difficulty coping with [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) Of course, everyone experiences some or all of these behaviors and emotions at some point in their lives. But if these problems began in childhood and continue to cause problems in daily life on an ongoing basis, then it may be due to [adult ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878). Test for ADHD Evaluation for ADHD is usually performed by a mental health professional, pediatrician, or family physician. There is no one specific test to determine if a child or adult has ADHD. [Diagnosis](https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/) is usually based on a comprehensive discussion with the patient and family members to determine whether a person displays 5-6 or more commonly recognized symptoms of ADD or ADHD, according to guidelines set by the American Psychiatric Association. Brain imaging methods such as MRIs are used to conduct research about ADHD, but they are not part of a typical diagnostic process for the average person. Medications for ADHD [Doctors commonly treat](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Determining-ADHD-Medication-Treatments.aspx) ADD or ADHD with stimulant medications that increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine and are meant to help them focus better. These medications are based in amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, etc.) or methylphenidate (Ritalin, etc.). Some are short-acting and need to be taken in 4-hour intervals; others are longer-acting, or designed to last all day. While these [medications](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-medication-20882) are considered safe for children, they do not work in every case, and they carry a variety of side effects, including: changes in appetite, stomach problems, and sleep problems. These types of drugs constrict the blood vessels and can cause heart problems like arrhythmia, [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), and even heart attacks in some patients. They can also have a negative impact on mood and mental health, causing a child or adult to become even more irritable and/or anxious. In some cases, stimulant medications have been [linked](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/news/20060323/adhd-drugs-reports-aggressive-behavior) to suicidal ideation and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Acupuncture for ADHD TCM philosophy acknowledges the interconnectedness of the mind, spirit, and body. In the TCM view, problems like ADHD are concerned with imbalances of the Heart, the Mind, and the Shen (spirit or emotions). Pathogens like fire, wind, and dampness can invade the head, affecting the mind as well as the physical organs of the body. Problems with concentration and restlessness stem from wind and excess heat in the head. Feelings of anger and frustration are often rooted in Liver Qi stagnation. Troubles with the appetite and digestion are often connected to deficiency in the Kidneys and Spleen. Thus, acupuncture treatment and herbal preparations will be designed to clear heat, get Liver Qi moving freely, and strengthen the Spleen and Kidneys. The [medications often prescribed to treat ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041317/) can actually have further negative effects on the heart and kidneys, causing deficiencies of Liver Qi and Kidney Qi. A [research study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1647-acupuncture-improves-outcomes-for-children-with-adhd) conducted with almost 600 children showed that acupuncture had an 84% efficacy rate. [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229910000944) to test the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture on preschoolers with ADHD found not only that the majority of children showed improvement of symptoms, but that the improvement was still evident at a six-month follow-up. Auricular acupuncture, in which points on the outer ear are stimulated with very tiny, thin needles or seeds that can be stuck to the ear and gently massaged daily, can be [particularly effective for children](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/07/28/treating-adhd-with-acupuncture), as it is very minimally invasive. Certain herbs used in formulations to address attention deficits [have been shown](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/3052058/) to help improve learning and [memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Acupuncture Near Me for ADHD If you or your child is struggling with attention deficits or impulsiveness, it can be stressful and scary to decide what to do about it. Poor concentration and hyperactivity can get in the way of doing well in school or work, and make it difficult to have positive social interactions and form relationships. It is certainly important to address these issues rather than ignoring them and hoping they'll go away. However, many people are concerned that medications may have negative side effects, or be habit-forming. You may want to consider acupuncture as a natural way to address ADHD. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science. Because science focuses on testing ideas about the natural world with evidence obtained through observation, these aspects of acupuncture can't be studied by science. Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. "}
