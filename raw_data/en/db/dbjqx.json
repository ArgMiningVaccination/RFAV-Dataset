I mean think about it - what did people do before they had access to all the technology and medicines we have today? While I'm all for utilizing these medical advancements when it's the right choice for you, a lot of healing is available to us when we get back to the basics. That's why a big part of my mission is sharing how the earth provides exactly what we need to heal. Harnessing the healing properties of the very best nature has to offer, homeopathy does exactly that. So, I was thrilled to get the chance to sit down with Guillaume, homeopathy expert and founder of Ollo\u00efs. As one of the few homeopathy brands in the world to be fully vertically integrated, from seed to shelf, Ollo\u00efs is truly a trailblazer in a practice that's been around for the past 200 years. Homeopathy on the Podcast So, what exactly is homeopathy? What symptoms does it treat and how does it work? And what does it mean to be \"fully vertically integrated, from seed to shelf\"? I cover all this and more in my interview with Guillaume in Just Ingredients Podcast Episode #56: Why Homeopathics are Beneficial for Our Health, available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. In this post, I'll be focusing on what homeopathy is, the common symptoms homeopathics can help treat, and how you can incorporate them into yours and your family's daily life. As always, I recommend discussing with your doctor when introducing new health practices into your life. What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a natural medicine that utilizes mostly plants and minerals based on the principle of \"likes cure likes.\" What does that mean? We know that our body has its own ability to heal, right? So, essentially, homeopathy speeds up our body's natural healing process to alleviate symptoms faster. It's not like conventional medicine that's designed to fight against the symptoms that present with illness. Instead, homeopathy works with your body to accelerate its ability to heal naturally. How Does Homeopathy Work? So, to understand how homeopathy works, let's revisit the idea that \"likes cure likes.\" If a high dose of a substance is capable of causing harmful symptoms, taking a microdose of that substance will stimulate your body to react against those same symptoms. So, homeopathy works by using plants or minerals found in nature that could cause harm in large doses, but after diluting them and introducing a microdose to the body, they stimulate the body's natural healing process to overcome those symptoms. To illustrate that principle in action, Guillaume shared an example that really stuck with me: Caffeine is a stimulant that many Americans use to stay awake, but did you know it can also be used to help you fall asleep? If you drink coffee every morning, it likely serves as your daily energy boost to help wake you up and start your day. Applying that same principle of likes cure likes, a microdose of coffee can actually help you fall asleep. Crazy, right?! Another good example Guillaume shared: When you chop onions, your eyes tear up and get red and itchy. Your nose might start running too. Believe it or not, this is an allergic reaction. So, leveraging the onion's properties in a microdose of Allium Cepa can help you manage those everyday allergy symptoms. What Can Homeopathics Treat? So, now that we know what homeopathy is, let's talk about how you can use it. While I'm going to cover a few of the symptoms a lot of you ask me for advice on treating, Ollo\u00efs has a \"Search by Symptom\" feature on their website that can point you in the right direction for symptoms I don't specifically address below. Headaches Headaches have become so commonplace in our culture that sometimes we forget they're actually our body's way of alerting us that something is \"off\". Instead of reaching for a pill, try a homeopathic instead. Headaches can be treated with the following: Sinus headache? Kali BichronicumStress headache? Ignatia AmaraHeadache from the cold or flu? Gelsemium Sempervirens Upset Stomach Another sign something is amiss in our bodies, upset stomachs can signal a myriad of things - digestive issues, stomach bug, food allergy, stress, poor nutrition, and the list goes on. While I recommend getting to the root of the issue, Ollo\u00efs homeopathics can help you alleviate those uncomfortable symptoms. Gas? Carbo VegetabilisDiarrhea & vomiting? Arsenicum AlbumConstipation? Hydrastis CanadensisIndigestion? Nux Vomica Cough & Cold While there are so many over-the-counter medicines available to treat cough and cold symptoms, oftentimes they go hand-in-hand with some not-so-great side effects. With homeopathics, you can steer clear of those options and fast track your body's healing. Keeping this in mind, Ollo\u00efs recommends the following: Deep cough? PhosphorusNagging cough? Spongia TostaSore throat? Phytolacca Decandra Healing with Homeopathy And this is just the start!
