One of the biggest issues that the World Health Organization has named to be a risk, are \"vaccine hesitancy\". Vaccine hesitancy has the potential to make tackling preventable diseases more difficult. This group of individuals argue that the cause of mental health concerns are linked to vaccinations, and in turn argue the abandonment of mandatory injections that are required for new born babies and young infants. On the other hand, science has proven through quantitative evidence that vaccinations are necessary in combating early on disorders and diseases. With a focus on autism in particular, it has been ignorantly claimed that vaccinations are a cause for autism spectrum disorder and that abandoning science and factual evidence are the only way to avoid the disorder. The driving force behind these myths have been predominantly worked through social mediums such as blogs, twitter, instagram, etc. This creates difficulty in truly finding what is fallacious, since majority of the population is on these sources of media. In order to refute these claims I will break down the qualitative evidence presented by multiple sources, and will disprove them with quantitative evidence from scholarly articles that prove that vaccinations do not cause autism. Taking a stance from a biological model's perspective, it suggests a focus on more of a medical look at autism and how to tackle the obstacles individuals face. "}
