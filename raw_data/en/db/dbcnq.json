A customer came in needing a set of 4 tires. I somewhat resisted but decided to gut it out. Halfway through the set I realized I headache was gone. Amazing. Thanks so much for your care and professional expertise. - Mike In 2007, I was hospitalized on 5 different occasions due to severe pain, bed ridden, unable to walk with very high blood pressure and pulse rate without any normal lifestyle. I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis (R.A.), fibromyalgia and atrial fibrillation. I was on a high dose of Prednisone, Methotrexate, Enbrel and heart medicine to regulate my heart rate. I became under the care of Dr. Anne Abrahamson, M.D., Physical Therapist, who referred me to Dr. David Silbert, D.C. Chiropractic Care who uses a technique call ART (Active Release Technique). He not only keeps my spine aligned, but also helps me with very severe pain in my muscles and ligaments when I am in a R. A. flare by using the Active Release Technique. I have been to other chiropractors, but this is totally a new experience. Along with the recommendation of Dr. Williams Athens. Sr., D.O., I no longer take heart medication because of over-all health improvement due to the care of Dr. Anne Abrahamson, M.D. and Dr. David Silbert, a wellness chiropractor. It was a long road to recovery, but also, I no longer take the cancer drug, Methotrexate, decreased does of Prednisone from 25 mg, no bone density drugs(which made me very sick) and only take weekly injections of Enbrel and monitored pain medications. I noticed an immediate improvement after 1 visit with Dr. Silbert, and, of course, maintained following visits until the issue to the existing problem was resolved. I call him the (Miracle Worker) as I am always astonished at my well-being after my visits. Once my finger was turned inward and I could not straighten it due to my R.A. condition and , lo and behold , the doctor rectified my problem. Sometimes , months go by without any problems or flare-ups witch is a \"joy\" to lead a half-way decent life. In July 2012, I adopted a rescue Pomeranian Dog, Named Hailey, and we have not missed a daily walk- snow, rain, or shine! I sometimes wonder \"who rescued who\"! - Elaine Poshaldo I found out about chiropractic care from my wife who is a patient of Dr. Silbert's. I have Type II Diabetes, hypertension, high Cholesterol, gout, lower back Pain and knee pain. The dietary restrictions can be hard at times. The main problem that interferes with my daily routine is knee pain. I had no fear other than I hoped I could be helped as much as you helped my wife. The most pleasant surprise was that Dr. Silbert found out that my back being out of alignment was causing my knee pain. After only one adjustment, the pain in my knee had subsided greatly. I was able to move around more freely without horrible pain. By being more active, I lost weight, my cholesterol is within normal limits. The hypertension I suffered from before isn't there. My blood pressure medication was cut in half. Not only is my entire well being improved but I feel so much better and healthier. I have learned how to keep pain from coming back in my knee by doing stretching exercises. Less pain = being able to move freely! More movement = more weight loss. Weight loss = better health. Better health = higher quality of life! People have noticed the weight loss and how much easier it is for me to be active. I tell them it's all due to my wonderful chiropractor, Dr. Silbert! Being a patient of Dr. Silbert has been such a positive experience. Since the pain in my knee is under control now my life is so much more active and enjoyable. Not to mention being able to stand all day at work and not be in pain. If I do feel any type of discomfort, I know exactly what to do in order to take it away. Thank you so very much, Dr. Silbert for helping me get in better health and feel great. - Ron Campbell I would like to thank you for the high quality level of personal care you have given not only to myself, but to my husband Bud. He has suffered back pain for many years. He has stated to me recently that you have provided him more relief from his back pain in a short period of time than prior treatments, including other chiropractors in the past. He also states that your attention to all details makes a difference in the care you have provided for him. He appreciates all the adjustments to alleviate his pain, as well as the little tips on not carrying a heavy wallet, and lightening your load in your pants pockets while working. Just those little bits of advice have made his work day much more comfortable. As for me, you have provided the most professional care, in a very relaxed atmosphere. You have brought me from the depths of extreme pain, to a very comfortable, manageable level, that seems to improve more each day. I've had to spend time taking care of myself, as you have taught me, and with your treatments and advice, it has been a lesson well learned. We both have you to thank for enhancing our summer. After my ankle/foot injury on Memorial Day, it seemed like a very dreary summer. But with your treatment and recommendations, I am coming along very nicely. Bud saw how well I responded to your treatment after my injury, that he thought he would give it a try for his back pain. He and I have both improved due to your chiropractic care, and we would both like to sincerely thank you for giving us back our summer. Last weekend we went to the Nascar race and I walked many miles on my ankle/foot. Thanks to you...........I DID IT! Dr. Silbert, we both thank you for your high quality of care, and your professional treatment. Natural treatment and your care have helped both of us, and have also taught us to change life long bad habits that we had, and now we have made changes that will only continue to improve our life and our lifestyle. THANK YOU! - Bud and Peggie Reed Dr. Silbert definitely goes above and beyond any health care that I have ever experienced in my 30+ years of consulting several chiropractors and medical professionals. My experiences with Dr. Silbert were more in-depth; it wasn't just a typical 'adjustment' and hopefully the pain will subside after the swelling goes down. Dr. Silbert's attention to detail and knowledge of muscular activity far exceeds most of the medical professionals out there. Many of them like to prescribe drugs and perform operative procedures to correct functions that Dr. Silbert seems to have a knack for manipulation with minimal recovery and limited pain after the treatment. I cannot begin to compliment the professional care I received from the Silbert Chiropractic team over the past year! My previous chiropractor spent six weeks giving me what they called a \"maintenance adjustment and that my muscle spasm would eventually subside, hopefully...\" After that comment, I lost all confidence in them when I inquired as to why they were not treating the muscle, which was the issue. They had no answer! Dr. Silbert, when I first met him, observed my ailment and was able to immediately identify what the cause was and began treatments. After the first manipulation, and exercise, my pain began to subside - almost immediate improvement. My overall health was better; I had more energy, a sense of harmony, and above all, better sleeping patterns. In my professional opinion, not all medical services are the same. It is with the highest regard that I not only compliment but recommend Silbert Chiropractic to ANYONE and everyone who has experienced any discomfort due to injury or other activities, or if they have tried a chiropractor in the past with little or no luck. Please, do yourself a favor and at least visit Dr. Silbert; that first visit will give you enough confidence to continue - or better yet, make an educated decision to continue - with the services they provide. - Michael C. Marrs, Ph.D. I have numerous health problems, mainly in my back. Such as a herniated L5-S1 disc, degenerative disc disease, bulging disc at L4 - L5, Peripheral neuropathy - bilaterally, and my left knee buckles due to meniscal tear. These back and leg problems took away my life for the past 10 years. The constant pain and muscle weakness prevented me from working as a nurse. During the last three years the nerve pain in my leg was unbearable most days. The burning and throbbing of my legs and both feet prevented me from getting a full nights sleep. I was unable to walk very far without the left leg getting heavy and then the left knee would buckle and I would fall. Standing for longer than 10 - 15 minutes would cause horrible throbbing and burning pain in my lower back and legs. Sitting for longer than 20 minutes would cause aching and throbbing in my lower back. All my daily activities were very limited due to the pain and weakness. Cooking was very minimal, housework wasn't done on a regular basis and I needed help doing even the smallest task. After everyday activity I tried to do, I had to ice my back and lay down to get relief. The pain pills I had didn't give me any relief. I had physical therapy on a regular basis for the past 10 years. There was minimal relief, with the pain coming back in less than 30 min - an hour after each session. I continued with the home exercise program twice a day without any relief. With only three visits to Dr. Silbert I noticed a marked improvement. My left leg didn't buckle as much; the throbbing in my legs was greatly reduced to the point where I could sleep for 6 - 7 hours straight. The burning in the soles of my feet is gone. I am able to walk in a store without my back aching and legs going numb. The housework is improving, but for now I am not going to overexert myself. Going to Dr. Silbert has been a lifesaver for me. He has given me my life back. In the near future I am going to return to work as a nurse, and then my livelihood will be restored. My entire family extends their gratitude to Dr. Silbert for helping me get my mobility back and end the constant pain I was in. I would recommend Dr. Silbert to everyone who is having back or leg pain. I will always be grateful to Dr. Silbert for helping me begin to live again! - Carol Campbell Wyandotte Office Monday: 8:30 am-12:00 pm pm-7:00 pm am-12:00 pm 1:30 pm-6:00 pm Saturday: Closed Sunday: Closed "}
