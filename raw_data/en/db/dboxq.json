Gustavo Blanco, who serves as the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair and Dr. Warren Nothnick, who serves as the Vice Chair. We continue to be one of the large st basic science departments i n the School of Medicine . The current members of the department include 14 tenured faculty members, 5 research track faculty, 3 postdoctoral fellows, 2 senior scientists, and 16 graduate students. Two faculty members who had primary appointments with us (D rs. Andrei Belousov and Phil Lee) left our department this year. During this past year the physiology department has been successful in advancing our primary goals : 1) engage in high quality research to generate new discoveries of physiological relevance in basic and translational science that contribute to advance human health; 2) contribute to the innovative and high quality teaching of KUMC by training new generations of physicians, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in physiology and pathophy siology; and 3) perform academic service through participation in a variety of important committees and task forces that aid both the department and school . The department's research programs cover a broad range of topics including, integrative physiology, male and female reproductive physiology, neurophysiology , and different aspects of metabolism and energetics. Studies are performed at the molecular and whole animal level , utilizing a wide variety of methods and approaches. In a ddition, research in the department complements the research efforts of several centers in our institution. The department has had another outstanding year in its educational mission, participating in both the medical and graduate student curriculum. Our faculty continued to play key roles in medical education during the first and second year of the Active Competency based and Excellence driven (ACE) curriculum. Dr. Wood served as Thread Head Leader. Drs. Stanford, Wolfe, and Wood were Block Directors for Muscle and Movement, Reproduction and Sexuality, and Cardiopulmonary, respectively . All our faculty have been involved as Facilitators leading the small group Case Based Clinical Learning (CBCL) activities of the ACE medical curriculum. Members of our department have also cont inued to play a major role in the education of graduate students by participating in the core Integrated Graduate Program in Biological Sciences (IGPBS) curriculum and in our department's mandatory courses for graduate students, including PHSL 842 Comprehe nsive Human Physiology led, by Dr. Wolfe and PHSL 843 Physiology of Disease course, led by Dr. Steve LeVine. V arious advanced physiology courses were also offered. These courses have received excellent reviews from the students. Once again, the hard work of our faculty in teaching has been recognized with important awards given to individual lecturers and to course directors for their excellence in 2 education. Moreover, several of our faculty were invited to give educational seminars at other universities and at national and international meetings. Dr. Blanco taught lectures and a laboratory in the Frontiers in Reproduction international course offered every year at the Marine Biological Laboratories in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. We are also proud of the service activities of faculty have been engaged in. They serve in numerous key leadership roles and on committees at the university level which are essential to the overall mission of our school. Dr. Smith continues to serve as the Senior Associate Dean for Research and the Co- Director of the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (KIDDRC); Dr. Enna is the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education; Dr. Nothnick is the Director o f the Center for Reproductive Sciences; Dr. Stanford is the Program Director of the KUMC Biomedical Research Training Program and the Campus Coordinator, K -INBRE Program Director ; Dr. Blanco is the K -INBRE Research Developmental Core Director; Dr. Geiger i s the Facility Co - Director of the Metaboli c and Obesity Research Phenotyping Facility (Morph); Dr. Thyfault is the Scientific Director of Children's Mercy Healthy Lifestyle and Nutrition Center (KUMC/CMH joint funded center) ; Dr. Wood is the Director of Educational Programs, and Dr. Wolfe serves as the Research Integrity Officer of our school. In addition, we have maintained our presence at the national and international level. Our faculty have served on different review panels of the National Institutes o f Health as well as review panels of other funding agencies. They have also served as editors and as members of the editorial boards for a variety of journals. We are very grateful to our faculty who, through their talent and hard work, have continued to maintain the high academic standards and suc cess that gives our department great national and international visibility . The Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology has had a better year, compared to 2017- 2018, with respect to funds coming from the School of Medicine Allocation Model. H owever, the challenge continues regarding extramural funding for our research enterprise. This is caused by the continuous reduction in funding from local and national agencies , as well as the high level of competition for those funds. Despite this, new grant support has been obtained by several of our investigators. Our faculty have been actively submitting new grant proposals to diverse agencies and we are confident that we will continue to improve our success rate in securing new funds for the department . In the department's office Shari Stand iferd continues as the Director of Operations and Jennifer Wallace and Liam Higgins as coordinators for financial accounting support. Our special thanks go to them . They provide outstanding administrative support to our department through their hard work and continuous dedication. In addition, we would like to thank our work study student , Christine Younker , who has provided additional excellent clerical support to our office. 3 HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 201 8 - 2019 ACAD EMIC YEAR RESEARCH FUNDING: The difficulties in obtaining new grants has been one of the main obstacles for our growth. This has directly impacted researchers and their projects and has resulted in a decrease in research funding to the department. Most uni versities today face a climate o f low general funding levels. Currently , members of our department continue to work hard to produce and submit high quality grant proposals. This has resulted in new grants being funded; however, our goal is to increase this number. Based on data provided by KUMC Enterprise Analytics, total grant direct costs for FY19 was $2,008,644. The latest data available shows that our department was ranked 51st at the national level for NIH research funding among 81 medical schools receiving NIH funding. While this is a good position, we would like to improve this ranking. EDUCATION: Continuing a long tradition the physiology department has had another outstanding year with respect to teaching. The Cardiopulmonary block was selected and awarded by the students as one of the best modules in the ACE curriculum. Drs. Blanco, Wood and Wol fe received Student Voice awards for excellence in teaching. These awards were presented by the medical students at the Grande Affair celebration in January 2019. Dr. Blanco was the recipient of the Chancellors Club Teaching Professorship. These awards are a testimony to the commitment of our faculty members to education. Due to the importance of physiology in years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, faculty in our department will continue to have a key role in teaching new generations of physicians. With respect to the graduate student curriculum, besides our involvement with the IGPBS, we continued offering our two main courses. These include PHSL 842 Comp rehensive Human Physiology and PHSL 843 Physiology of Disease, directed by Drs. Wolfe and LeVine res pectively . In addition, several advanced courses were offered. These included the PHSL 835 Integrative Physiology of Exercise course (directed by Drs. Geiger and Thyfault) and PHSL 848 Molecular Mechanisms of Neurological Disorders (lead by Dr. LeVine). TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: No new primary tenure track appointments were made this year. RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS: Pavla Brachova, Ph.D. was appointed as Research Assistant Professor, beginning on April 1, 2019. Dr. Brachova's research is focused on oocyte quality and embryo development, with a specific interest in RNA modifications and how they drive physiological and pathological processes related to women's reproductive health. Current work focuses on deciphering the role of inosine in RNA stability and translation. Nehemiah Alvarez, Ph.D. was appointed as Research Assistant Professor, beginning on May 15, 2019. D r. Alvarez interests are on developing computational approaches to 4 detect RNA modifications. He uses these approaches to study how RNA modifications influence oocyte quality and embryonic development. JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS: The following researc hers received joint appointments at their current ranks. Jill Morris, Ph.D from Neurology became a joint appointment on October 15, 2018. FACULTY PROMOTIONS: No new promotions occurred this fiscal year. FACULTY/STAFF DEPARTURES: Peter Baumann, Ph.D. Investigator at Stowers moved to G ermany in July 2018 - Max Planck Institute Andrei Belousov, Ph.D. left for University of Oklahoma Health Science - Physiology Department - February 5, 2019 Phil Lee, Ph.D. transferred to Radiology April 1, 2019. FACULTY AWARDS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Numerous members of our department have been serving on review panels from NIH and other agencies. They have also served as editors or on the editorial board of different journals and presented invited lectures at different national and international meetings and s eminars at various universities. Approximately 55 peer reviewed original articles were published by our faculty in top research journals and as book chapters. Among the awards that our faculty received for research, Dr. Thyfault was the recipient of the Environmental & Exercise Physiology Impact Award from the American Physiological Society in recognition of his contributions to exercise and metabolism. GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PHYSIOLOGY SOCIETY: The student led \"Physiology Society\" continued functioning well this year. A new president was elected and a new committee was chosen. The leadership of the Physiology Society is currently: Ashley Cloud, President Page Hayley , Vice-President Elizabeth Thoenen, Social Chair The graduate students in the department had another active year. In 2018- 2019 six new students were recruited to the department. These include students who are working with our affiliate members at Stowers Research Institute and joint appointment faculty at KUMC. Currently, our department has a tot al of 16 enrolled doctoral students. Several of our students were awarded external fellowships to support their training. Funding came from different sources, including the SELF Fellowship program, the KUMC Biomedical Training Program, National Science Fou ndation, and National Institute of Health. 5 The new graduate students that joined the department in the 2018- 2019 fiscal year included the following individuals (their respective mentors are listed in parenthesis): Kelly Fuller (Dr. John Thyfault) Carol yn Kaufman (Dr. Sandra Billinger) Preethi Kunchala (Dr. Sue Jaspersen) Bradley Lamb Maurer (Dr. John Thyfault) Ayushi Vashisht (Dr. Warren Nothnick) Five students completed their Ph.D. degrees during the summer of 20 18 and one student in Fall 2018.

Osborn Chair 7 8 Molecular & Integrative Physiology Emeritus Professors 9 Emeritus Professors Retirement Activities Paul F. Terranova, Ph.D. From Dr. Terranova: \"Retirement has been super, and it will soon be my 5th year anniversary (retired January 2, 2015). I'm playing lots of golf. The pics are from a 2 -week golf trip to Scotland. The family is well and growing with 5 grandchildren and another grandson on the way in November. Kathy is s till working at KUMC. We will vacation in Pebble Beach California during the late fall. \" 10 Paul D. Cheney, Ph.D. From Dr. Cheney: \"Thanks to the Department leadership for providing this opportunity to report on \"life after retirement\". The good news is, YES, there is life after retirement! In a nutshell, we have been enjoying ourselves and keeping busy with various ac tivities. Of course, busy is a relative term. The pace is definitely slower that it was during my working days. So what are these acti vities? Some of them are depicted in the photos attached. Travel these days has been mostly in our small motorhome (2016 Leisure Travel Van). We especially enjoy visiting National Parks. The photo attached is from our stay at Boyd's RV Campground in Key West, Florida. We also drive the motorhome to our condo in Naples, Florida where we spend about 5 months during the winter. We really enjoy the Florida Winter weather. Bicycling is one of our regular activities in Florida. It's flat, which helps immensely. We also have regular visits from friends and relatives, including our two daughters and granddaughters. Many of you know I enjoy Corvettes. When my granddaughter Elizabeth (10) visited this summer she really wanted a ride in the Corvette. Of course, I obliged. (see photo). I tried to make it a ride to remember . Finally, I should mention that I haven't abandoned academics completely. As a retiree, I am pleased to report that my students, colleagues and I have published four papers.\" 11 Thomas Imig, Ph.D. From Dr. Imig: \"Both Dianne and I are now retired so we have spent some time traveling overseas and within the US. Both of our two children are now married. Matt and his wife live in Denver and have produced two granddaughters that are delights. We go to visit on occasion and have cared for the girls for a few days while their parents go on a vacation. It is much easier to be a grandparent than a parent and easier to be a grandfather than a grandmother. Cory is an artist and she and her husband recently bought an historic house built in 1893 on an acre of land in northeast Kansas City, MO that is set up as an urban farm. Her husband has a small restaurant in the cross roads and their crops are used there and sold to restaurants in Kansas City. It is quite interesting to visit the farm as the previous owner left 30 years of accumulations and junk that need to be sold or thrown away, including a 1978 Rolls Royce. I have also traveled with Cory on several trips to install her art at shows or look at installations throughout the western US. Dianne and I recently got a golden retriever puppy that we are attempting to train, and she keeps us on our toes. I still have several antique cars that never seem to reach a steady state of good repair, bu t I keep trying. I have been learning Spanish with some limited success but didn't feel comfortable with the language in our t rips to Spain or Mexico. I think that it will take some immersion to become fluent. Overall, life is relaxing and stress free alt hough I do miss seeing colleagues that I used to work with.\" 12 Joseph S. Tash, Ph.D. Dr. Tash continues to work with NASA as an emeritus professor. He travels to conferences and workshops and might be seen on KUMC's campus. He resides with his family in Oregon. Above is Dr. Tash riding his Lipizzan horse, Jabber. In his free time, he enjoy s competing in dressage. 13 James L. Voogt, Ph.D. From Dr. Voogt: \"Retirement is the closest to heaven that I will ever be. Traveling is our numero uno activity. We go on at least two international trips each year. I also do woodworking, hiking, golfing, fly fishing, snowshoeing, birding and v olunteering. Best of all I get to spent lots of time with our eight grandchildren. \" 14 In Honor of Physiology Donors and the Continued Impact that their Generosity Provides Mr. James Osborn (1919 - 2018) Mr. Osborn's relationship with our departme nt began through his daughter Kathleen. She developed an interest in science and biology in high school and while attending college at the University of Missouri. During the summers of 1968 and 1969, Kathleen work ed in the reproductive physiology lab of Dr. Gilbert Greenwald at the KU School of Medicine. This experience was particularly meaningful to Kathleen and might have motivated her to enter a career in science had she not been taken prematurely in an automobi le accident in 1970. At the time of her death, Kathleen was in her junior year at the University of Missouri. Mr. Osborn and his late wife Marion had such high regard for Dr. Greenwald, who died in 2004, and deep gratitude for Kathleen's experience, that they made plans to benefit the medical cent er through KU Endowment. Their generosity started with the Kathleen M. Osborn Lectureship in 19 71. This lectureship remains the longest running and most successful lectureship in the history of the medical center. It has attracted a long list of preeminent scientists from around the world and funds from the Kathleen Osborn Lectureship have also supported the annual Gilbert S. Greenwald Symposium. In 2006, in memory of his beloved wife, Mr. Osborn established the M arion M. Osborn Professorship to support reproductive science within the department. The inaugural and current recipient is Dr. Leslie Heckert. Mr. Osborn continued his generosity in honor of his daughter in 2012, establishing the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair to support the leadership position of the department. Dr. Paul Cheney was the inaugural recipient and in 2016 Dr. Gustavo Blanco was named the second Kathleen M. Osborn Chair. This year we are again the thankful beneficiaries of Mr. Osborn's philanthropy with the establishment of the Kathleen M. Osborn Fellowship in Reproductive Physiology. This fellowship will support graduate students in our department interested particularly in reproductive science. The first student to receive this great honor was Rikki Nelson. Since then, other four students have been the recipients of this fellowship. The Kathleen M. Osborn Endowed Chair, the Marion M. Osborn Professorship, and the lectureship in honor of Kathleen M. Osborn have made a great difference to our 15 department. These funds continue to support the research goals of our department and our studen ts. We immensely appreciate the generous contributions that Mr. Jim Osborn made over the years. They have significantly contributed to our success. 16 William Biklen Pendleton J.D. (1920 - 2015) William Biklen Pendleton attended Liberty High School and graduated in 1939 from Shattuck High School in Minnesota. After graduation he attend ed the University of Kansas and joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. William served during World War II in the U.S. Army from 1942 -1946 as a Lieutenant in the 593rd engineer boat and shore regiment that was attached to the Australian 6th Division for the invasion of Borneo. Following the war, he resumed his studies at the University of Kansas. He graduated with an AB in economics in 1946. He was hired by the accounting department of Link Belt Company of San Francisco. Later, he moved back to Lawrence and farmed for five years. In 1957 he received his JD from the University of Kansas Law School. During his law pract ice he was a municipal court judge from 1959- 1967, and president of the Douglas County Bar Association in 1981. In 1958 he married Edith Cottom Livingston and adopted her two children Stephen and Helen. Together, they had a son Martin William Pendl eton. E dith and Martin both passed away in 1974 in an automobile accident. When William retired he remain ed active in the community. He participated in many clubs including the KU Chancellors Club, Elizabeth M. Watkins Society, the Vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church and was treasurer in the 1960's, Lawrence B reakfast Optimist Club was Optimist of the Year in 1992 and 1997, the Midland Railway Historical Association where he was a director, and the American Legion. He volunteered at the Heartland Medical Clinic a t the Leo Center and Friends of Hidden Valley. When he was not volunteering or participating in clubs William enjoyed collecting one- cylinder antique engines, traveling and riding stea m trains around the world, and going on rail excursions in his own Fairm ont inspection car. He passed away at the age of 95 on May 15th, 2015 at Pioneer Ridge Assisted Liv ing in Lawrence, KS. Pendleton donated his body to research. Pendleton graciously donated to the University of Kansas Endowment Association. He wished for the money to be used in reproductive biology for family planning and birth control research and counseling. 17 Dr. Louis R. Fletcher (1892 - 1973) \"Life is so precious and exciting, and there is so much to be learned, that I dislike to waste a minute.\" Louis R. Fletcher, M.D. Dr. Louis R. Fletcher left an unforgettable and generous mark on the University of Kansas. Described as a farm boy from Harper, Kansas, Dr. Louis R. Fletcher attended the University of Kansas and Southwest ern College for medical s chool. Hardworking, humble , and adventurous are just a few words to describe the life Dr. Louis R. Fletcher lived. Dr. Fletcher was a modest man who worked extremely hard for his opportunities and income. Throughout college he paid for his expenses by washing dishes, lawn keeping, and working wheat fields. Additionally, he took breaks in his schooling to save money by working in various employment opportunities in Alaska including working in the gold mines, ore processing mills, and as a bridge carpenter. H e returned to KU for the 1917- 18 school year and then finished his last 2 years of education at Rush Medical College of the University of Chicago where he received his degree in medicine. He spent much of his professional career (26 years) working for the United Fruit Company in hospitals in Panama, Guatemala, and Honduras. He served his country as a commissioned Lieutenant Commander in the Navy. Additionally, he also served as chief of surgery at the Camp White Naval Hospital in Medford, Oregon. He had a lifelong love of learning . He returned to KU for postgraduate study in anatomy, not for a degree, but for the inner desire to learn. Dr. Fletcher rarely stayed idle in his work as he then served in many different medical positions. His adventurous spirit served as a driving factor as he traveled and worked in many different countries. He returned to the United Fruit Company for a few years, served at a hospital at Superior, Arizona, worked as the medical superintendent of the Valdez Community Hospital, was the project physician at the Naval Base at Point Barrow, and served as a surgeon for a construction company in the Marshall Islands. Following retirement from the medical profession, Dr. Fletcher spent time traveling to grand places. He began by sailing from New Orleans to South Africa and then continued his travels to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Throughout his life, Dr. Louis R. Fletcher became intrigued with the prospect of being a \"millionaire.\" Fletcher made this happen through \"frugality, skim ping, and strict economy.\" He invested his money and was very conservative with his spending and lifestyle. He 18 lived modestly, ate low cost substantial food, and chose to travel by bus instead of train or plane. Dr. Fletcher humbly achieved that goal of a million dollars, in which he then said, \"As you know, I have always dreamed of acquiring a million dollars. This has finally been accomplished and today I have given this million dollars to Kansas University, the school that I love so deeply and which has had such a tremendous good influence on my life. I have done this with the greatest of pleasure and satisfaction.\" His donation to the Kansas University Endowment As sociation has provided support for research in physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy at the University of Kansas Medical Center as well as construction of the Dr. Louis R. Fletcher Research Laboratories. The physiology department wants to extend a gracious and continued thank you to Dr. Louis R. Fletcher for the opportunities and s upport his generosity cont inues to provide. 19 Dr. Walter Joseph Meek (1878 - 1963) Dr. Walter Joseph Meek demonstrated academic excellence throughout his life. Dr. Meek and his family's generosity is continually valued and honored in the Physiology Department. Walter Joseph Meek was born in Dillion, KS in 1878. At age eight , Dr. Meek's father passed away followed by his mother's passing a few years later. Following their passing , he was raised with his first cousins. From a young age, Dr. Meek showed strong educational aspirations. Dr. Meek graduated from the University of Kansas in 1902 where he was senior class president and editor of the school paper. As of 1983, Dr. Meek held the hi ghest -grade point average of a University of Kansas Graduate. He continued his educational pursuits at Penn College and the University of Chicago obtaining his Ph.D. in Physiology in 1909. While pursuing his Ph.D. he taught at Penn College from 1903 - 1908 where he attained the rank of professor of biology. Dr. Meek then began teaching at the University of Wisconsin. He served as instructor in physiology (1908 -1910), assistant professor (1910- 1912), associate professor (1912- 1918), and professor (1918- 1948) . He then assumed the position of chairman of P hysiology Departm ent until his retirement in 1948. Additional professional accomplishments at the University of Wisconsin include assistant dean of medicine from (1920 - 1942), acting dean (1942 - 1945), and associate dean from 1945 until his retirement. Dr. Walter Josep h Meek also held the commission of major in the Chemical Warfare Serv ice during the World War I. A chemical warfare unit was set up at the University, and Dr. Meek assisted with discovering the biological effects of mustard gas, lewisite, and phosgene. Dr. Meek married Crescence Eberley on December 26, 1906. Six years later, they had their first child, Joseph Walter Meek, born in 1912. Joseph became a law school professor at the University of New Mexico. Their second child, Mary Crescence Meek, born in 1917, worked as a stewardess for American Airlines. Their third and final son, John Sawyer Meek, was born a year later in 1918. He became a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado. T he Meek family was very adventurous , embarking on many different outdoor endeavors. They visited Switzerland to hike over the high passes and climbed Pikes Peak. They also spent time at Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. Additionally, Dr. Meek enjoyed side hobbies including photography, gardening, repairing and refinishing antique furniture, and collecting shells and stamps. 20 Dr. Meek's contributions to the study of the history of medicine are nothing short of extraordinary. His bibliography consisted of 110 scientific papers and one of his most clinically relevant contributions was the discovery, in collaboration with Maurice H. Seevers and Ralph M. Waters, that catecholamines cause ventricular fibrillation in dogs anesthetized with cyclopropane. Upon Dr. Meek's retirement in 1948 he remained at the University of Wisconsin as a research professor for an additional year. He continued to lecture at the University of Texas and served on a committee to establish a medical school in Gainesville, Florida. His death occurred quietly in 1963 at the age of 84. Mrs. Meek pas sed away in 1973 at the age of 92. His ashes are buried with his wife's in her family' s burial plot in Pennsylvania. The Physiology D epartment extends remembrance and sincere gratitude to Dr. Meek and his family for the generosity bestowed upon the Physiol ogy Department. The allocation of funds is still greatly valued and utilized within the D epartment to continue Dr. Meek's passion of advancing medicine. 21 Mr. J. Hambleton Abrahams (1913 - 1996) Abrahams and his wife, Julie, lived in Topeka, where he was born and raised. Mrs. Abrahams was a KU Endowment Association trustee. He attended Chattuck Military Academy, Northwestern University and graduated from the University of Chicago w ith a bachelor's degree in philosophy. In 1978 he received an honorary doc tor's degree in Business from Washburn University. He served during World War II in the U.S. Navy and later in the Naval Reserve as an officer. Abrahams was active throughout the com munity. Serving as an officer or member on the board of banks, hospitals , the chamber of commerce, the Red Cross, and many other organizations. Security Benefit is the parent company of the Security Benefit Group of Companies, a financial services organization that maintains more than $13 billion of life insurance in force and has $2 billion in assets under management. After joining the company in 1935 he later held the positions of secretary treasurer, executive vice president, president, and chair man. Abrahams encompassed the leadership skills to grow Security Benefit from a s mall, midwestern company to one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States. The Security Benefit Group of Companies headquartered in Topeka, started an annual gift of $7,500 to the KU Endowment Association to fund the J Hambleton Abraha ms Lectureship in Physiology at KUMC. The lecture series honors Abrahams's 50 years with Security Benefit. According to Gilbert S. Greenwald, Ph.D., chairman of the Physiology Department in KUMC: \"the funds will be used to bring annually to the center a person of national and international reputation in one of the physiology subspecialties: cardiovascular physiology, renal physiology, neurophysiology, endocrinology, biophysics or epithelial transport physiology.\" After 60 years of service for Security Benefit Abrahams retired in 1995. He stayed busy traveling between homes in Topeka, Colorado, and Arizona. Abrahams passed away at the age of 83 in 1996 one year after retirement . 22 Kathleen M.

Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D., Professor & Kathleen M. Osborn Chair Our laboratory studies the role of ion- transport proteins of the plasma membrane in cell function. Research is focused on the Na,K -ATPase. The Na,K -ATPase or Na pump is an enzyme of the plasma membrane, that uses the free energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to transport cytoplasmic Na+ out of the cell in exchange for extracellular K+. The Na,K -ATPase is critical in maintaining cell volume and pH, the membrane excitability of muscle and nervous tissue, and plays a major role in the reabsorption of Na+ and water in the kidney. Na,K -ATPase consists of different isozymes, each resulting from the association of distinct molecular forms of the alpha (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 and alpha 4) and beta (beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3) subunits that constitute the enzyme. Whil e the alpha subunit is responsible for the catalytic and transport functions of the Na,K - ATPase, the beta polypeptide participates in the correct folding and targeting of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. A third protein, the gamma subunit forms part of t he Na,K -ATPase as a regulatory subunit. A schematic representation of the topology of the Na,K -ATPase subunits in the cell plasma membrane is shown below.

Joined department April 1st, 2019 62 Vargheese M. Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D ., Associate Professor My research interests include uterine fibroid pathogenesis, fertility and contraception. Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract and are the leading indication for hysterectomies in the US. Our laborat ory is trying to understand the aberrant regulation and function of PRICKLE1- REST -GPR10 pathway, which promotes uterine fibroid pathogenesis. We are currently utilizing genetically modified preclinical models of GPR10, Prickle1 and Rest, recently developed in our laboratory for the discovery of pharmacotherapies for uterine fibroids. Our laboratory is also interested in molecules that regulate sperm function and male fertility. We have an ongoing project to identify small molecule inhibitors of CDK2 that specifically inhibit meiosis, as potential contraceptive drugs. We are also studying the functional regulation of the sperm specific sodium -proton exchanger (sNHE) in expression systems that utilize chimeric channels.

Annual Meeting, Society for t he Study of Reproduction (SSR) , San Jose, CA 64 Lane K. Christenson, Ph.D. , Professor My research is focused on understanding the molecular processes of reproduction in order to enhance and inhibit fertility. My primary interest has been focused on understanding how post -transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms (i.e., microRNA - mediated, RNA editing) facilitate ovulation and luteinization of the ovarian follicle following the LH surge. More recently, my laboratory has focused on another aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation, A -to-I RNA editing, this exciting work is implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction within the oocyte, we are also simultaneously pursuing its role in ovarian somatic cell function. Our work in miRNA within the follicle also l ed to our studies looking at the role extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) play in ovarian function this was funded by an NIH -R21 grant in collaboration with Dr. Lynda McGinnis. I have established multiple collaborations with other laborator ies that have like interests in pursuing a better understanding of reproductive physiology and pathophysiology. These include Dr. Arulanandam at the Univ Texas San Antonio, understanding the interaction of chlamydia with host microRNA; Drs. Alwood and Ronc o (Ames NASA) and J. Tash (KUMC) effects of microgravity on ovarian function. Additionally, because of my interest in miRNA, my laboratory has partnered with a clinician, Dr. Ajay B ansal (KUMC) to use next generation sequencing and our established miRNA me thods to identify biomarkers involved in the transition of gastric reflux disease (GERD) to the benign Barrett's Esophagus and ultimately esophageal cancer. Lastly, because of my interest in extracellular vesicles, Dr. Paige Geiger and I are collaborating to better understand how heat shock proteins might be transported to tissues via extracellular vesicles.

Stanford, Ph.D. , Professor My research is focu sed on diseases and conditions that affect motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), neonatal jaundice, and aging. My approach is best described as a systems neuroscience approach using operant behavioral methods in rodent models. I have a longstanding interest in determining mechanisms that underlie, and potential treatments to ameliorate, orolingual motor deficits in aging and in ALS. Recent efforts in my lab have focused on the effects of isometric strength training on disease progression in rat models of aging and ALS. I am also involved in research into determining the short - and long- term neurological effects of hyperbilirubinemia in rodent models of neonatal jaundice. Finally, I remain interested in the effects of metabolic challenges on neural function to understand the co- morbidity between obesity and neurodegenerative diseases.

Undifferentiated spermatogonia with spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs or male germline stem cells, GSCs) at the foundation of the differentiation hierarchy undergo both self-renewal and differentiation to support lifelong production of sperm. We employ molecular, cellular, genetic, and transplantation approaches to investigate the mechanism regulating SSCs maintenance and mei otic differentiation. In addition to the basic science importance, our studies will aid the development of SSC transplantation therapy to improve and rescue fertility in clinical settings.
