Sanford Health completes a community health needs assessment every three years. It is through this work that we identify unmet health needs in the community, and then strategically plan how to best address those needs. This process is well aligned with Sanford's vision to improve the human condition. From December 2020 to February 2021, members of the community were invited to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs across a range of social det erminants of health. Sanford Health and the NDSU Center for Social Research partnered to analyze th e data from the primary research along with key secondary data points from County Health Rankings. Sanford also facilitated discussions with key stakeholders in each community to prioritize the identified needs. As a result of this process, we will address the following health needs in a formalized implementation strategy for the 2022- 2024 time period: - Access to affordable, quality health care including primary and specialty care. - Mental health services availability in our community. The CHNA process also focused on the many strengths and resources available in our community. This report includes an overview of the community assets that are available to address various community health needs. We have al so included an impact report from our 2019 implementation strategies. We are committed to extending care beyond our bricks and mortar, and ultimately improving the health and wellness of our entire community. We are committed to improving the quality of life for all Bagley area residents. We invite you to join us and thank you for your support of these ongoing efforts.

CHNA Purpose The purpose of a community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our comm unity. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and develop a Community Investment/Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate and justify the not-for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. A community health needs assessment identifies the community's strengths and areas for improvement. A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Investment/Community Benefit Program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progres s made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining our not -for-profit status. 5 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 Regulatory Requirements Federal regulations stipulate that non- profit medical centers conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years and prioritize the needs for the purpose of implementation strategy development and submission in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code 501(r)(3). The Internal Revenue Code 501(r) requires that each hospital must have: (1) conducted a community health needs assessment in the applicable taxable year; (2) adopted an implementation strategy for meeting the community health needs identified in the assessment; and (3) created transparency by making the information widely available. The regulations stipulate that each medical center take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community. Hospitals are required to seek at least one state, local, tribal or regional government public health department or stat e Office of Rural Health with knowledge, information or expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Non -profit hospitals are required to seek input from members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in the community, or organizations serving or representing the interest of such populations, and underserved populations experiencing disparities or at risk of not receiving adequate care as a result of being uninsured or due to geographic, language or financial or other ba rriers. The community health needs assessment includes a process to identify community resources that are available to address the assessed needs and to prioritize the needs. Hospitals are to address each and every assessed need or explain why they are not addressing the needs. Once the needs have been identified and prioritized, hospitals are required to develop an implementation strategy to address the top needs. The strategies are reported on the IRS 990 and a status report must be provided each year on IRS form 990 Schedule H. Finally, hospitals are to be transparent with the findings and make the written CHNA report available to anyone who asks for the report. Sanford places the CHNA reports and the implementation strategies on the Sanford website. Hospitals are required to keep three cycles of assessments on the web site. The 2022 report will be Sanford's fourth report cycle since the requirements were enacted in 2010. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned communi ty representatives in the survey process. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and responses to the community health needs assessment and the implementation strategies are welcome on the Sanford we bsite or contact can be made at https://www.sanfordhealth.org/about/community- health -needs -assessment . No community comments or questions regarding the previous CHNA have been made via the website link or email address. 6 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 CHNA Process Sanford Health, in coordination with public health experts, community leaders, and other health care providers, within the local community and across Sanford's care delivery footprint, devel oped a multi -faceted assessment program designed to establish multiple pathways for health needs assessment. Limitations The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the community. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. However, gaps in individual data sources may arise when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, income, minority status) with the current population estimates. For example, these gaps may occur due to the difficulty in contacting them through the survey process. To mit igate limitations, the CHNA evaluates community health from several perspectives; a stakeholder and community survey, meetings with community leaders that have special knowledge and expertise regarding populations, secondary data sources such as the U.S. C ensus Bureau and County Health Rankings, public comments from previous assessments, and institutional knowledge by Sanford employees locally and across the Sanford enterprise. Community and Stakeholder Survey Members of the community were asked a series of questions through an online survey designed in partnership with health experts and public health officials across the Sanford footprint to understand the needs of the community based upon the UW Population Health model. Each respondent was asked to rat e community drivers from poor to excellent. Any response other than excellent was offered a follow up opportunity to comment on the reason. Respondents were also asked a series of questions specific to their health care access, health care quality, barrier s to care, travel to care, and insurance. The survey was sent to a sample of the Clearwater County population secured through Qualtrics, a qualified vendor. The full set of questions is available in the appendix. To further promote community involvement the survey was also sent to community stakeholders and elected officials with knowledge and connections amongst medically underserved, low income, or minority populations. Stakeholders were asked to complete the instrument as a resident of the community and forward the survey to their respective populations for greater involvement. The survey was highlighted in a Sanford Health News article (https://news.sanfordhealth.org/community/health- needs -assessment -survey/) and promoted through social med ia via paid communications. The paid communications yielded 344,300 impressions and 1,150 completed surveys across the system. Survey data for the local community should be considered directional and best utilized in conjunction with additional data. A to tal of 78 respondents from the CHNA area completed the survey. 6,748 total respondents from across the Sanford footprint completed the survey. Consultation with Public Health, Community Leaders, Other Health SystemsCommunity & Stakeholder SurveySecondary DataAsset MappingLocal Community 7 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 Secondary Data County Health Rankings is based upon the UW Population Health model and serves as the main secon dary data source utilized for the community health needs assessment. Alignment of the survey and secondary data within the UW Population Health model allows for greater connection of the data sets. Population data are sourced to the U.S. Census Bureau. Add itional data sources may be used and are sourced within the document. Health Needs Identification Methodology The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University was retained to develop the initial community health needs list for each communit y and builds upon their involvement during the previous cycle. The following methodology was used to develop the significant health needs presented later in the report: Survey data was stratified into representative groups based upon population: large urba n communities, medium sized communities, and rural communities. The three groups were analyzed separately. Bagley, MN is included with Canby, MN; To identify community health care needs, each community's score by question was compared to the average stratified composite of the comparative group. For example, if the composite stratified sy stem -wide average score is 4 and an individual community's average response was 2.5, that would suggest an issue of concern and a potential community health care need to be highlighted in the summary findings. Upon determination of a potential strength or need, County Health Rankings (https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) and responses from open- ended questions provided additional insights into the drivers of the respective needs. A similar methodology was also used to provide additional insights into fin dings from County Health Rankings data with relevant health needs highlighted in the survey findings. Health needs identified through either the survey or County Health Rankings data but not both were also included in the findings. Community Asset Mappin g Asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise fo llowed with key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. Community Stakeholder Meetings Community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA research. Facilitated discussion commenced and each participant was asked to consider the needs identified above that should be further developed into implementation strategies. Health needs identified during the previous cycle but not raised through the survey or County Health Rankings were also considered. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. 8 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 The facilitated discussion sought to inform on several aspects: What are the biggest challenges currently with these needs in the community? Does the community h ave gaps in services, access, outreach, etc.? OPPORTUNITIES - where can we have greatest impact in addressing these needs? Which are most urgent in nature? Is there any work being done on these needs? What are the resources currently not utilized within the community that could address this topic? Which fall within the purview of healthcare system and which do not? Can the non- healthcare needs be shared with other entities or organizations? Is there anything you consider an urgent need that we have not discussed? Two health needs were identified by consensus during the meeting for inclusion in the implementation plan. The needs were confirmed with participants prior to the meeting's conclusion. Consensus based upon all factors, including primary and secondary data, input from the community stakeholder meeting, and scalability of current hospital programs and resources to address the identified needs efficiently and effectively. All identified needs not addressed in the implementation plan were shared with other community partners for action. Requests for survey data and other CHNA assets by public health organizations, governmental bodies, and community partners were and continue to be supported. Community Definition Clearwater County Minn esota is included in the data analysis and represents a majority of volumes to the hospital. No population was excluded from the process. 9 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Community Health Summary CHNA respondents were asked to rate various community health issues and their personal health and wellness on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1= poor, 2= fair, 3= good, 4= very good, 5= excellent. Overall, perceptions among CHNA respondents in the Bagley area regarding the following community health issues were positive. Average scores for long -term nursing care and senior housing quality (average score=3.12), employment and economic opportunities (average score=3.15), health care quality (average score=3.15), child care and preschool quality (average score=3.42), community safety (average score=3.55), access to exercise opportunities (average score=3.56), access to healthy foods (average score=3.69), and environmental health (average score=3.86) in the Bagley m arket were all above 3.00. However, with the exception of access to healthy foods and employment opportunities (which were similar to the comparison group average, average scores for CHNA respondents in the Bagley area for each of these community health is sues were lower than the comparison group average - and in some cases (i.e., health care quality and community safety), the lowest among all similar -sized market areas served by Sanford Health. When asked about their personal health, CHNA respondents in the Bagley area rated their current health and wellness as good (average score=3.16) and their current ability to access health care services as good (average score=3.36); however, both scores were the lowest scores among the comparison group. In addition, CHR data indicate that Clearwater County is among the least healthy counties in Minnesota in terms of overall health. The following eight areas of concern were identified for further discussion (in no particular order). Identified Significant Health Need s Access to Affordable Health Care Access to affordable, quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance, local care options, and a usual source of care help to ensure access to health care. Having access to care allows individuals to enter the health care system, find care easily and locally, pay for care, and get their health needs met. When CHNA respondents in the Bagley area were asked about their biggest health care concerns for themselves and their family ( concerns they face on a regular basis), c ost and the ability to afford needed health care was their top health care concern. In addition, when respondents were asked about the most important health care issues impacting their community, the cost of health care was also their top concern (higher than COVID -19 and general access concerns). Among CHNA respondents in the Bagley area, 86 percent indicated they had a primary care provider and 79 percent had received a routine checkup within the past year - both percentages are similar to the comparison group average. However, one in five CHNA respondents in the Bagley area indicated that they or a family member needed medical care in the past year but did not receive it (22%), which is the highest percentage amo ng similar markets. When asked why, the main reason was due to COVID -19 (59%) - which was followed by cost and inability to pay for health care services (35%) and a lack of health insurance (12%). For the 21 percent of CHNA respondents who had not receive d a routine checkup in the past year, the main reasons were due to COVID -19 (57%) and cost or inability to pay (50%). 10 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 According to CHR, 8 percent of people in the Bagley area are uninsured, a rate which is similar to the average for similar markets serve d by Sandford Health. However, CHR data also indicate that in the Bagley area, half of all children are eligible for free - or reduced -price lunch (49%) (which is the highest percentage among similar markets), median household income ($54,896) is lower tha n the comparison group average, and the unemployment rate (8%) is higher than any of the similar -sized market areas served by Sanford Health. Access to affordable health care, access to health care providers, and access to quality health care were discusse d as a single topic rather than individually since they are not mutually exclusive and overlap in scope. During the stakeholder meeting the group discussed issues surrounding access to affordable quality care. The group discussed specific components of aff ordability that may pose the greatest roadblocks to affordable quality care such as high copay levels, high deductibles, and/or lack of insurance. Assisting patients with sign up for coverage is an area in which Sanford Bagley can have an impact . The group also discussed the tradeoff that high housing costs have on the ability to afford health care related needs. The community is seeing the impact of delayed care due to the pandemic and/or due to affordability. The group discus sed the importance of family medicine and access to primary care.

It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. When CHNA respondent s in the Bagley area were asked which health care services they would like to see offered or improved in their community, most said behavioral and mental health services (60%) followed by addiction treatment (50%). According to CHR, adults in the Bagley ma rket average 4.2 mentally unhealthy days each month and 14 percent of adults average at least 14 days of mental distress per month - both rates are the second highest among similar -sized markets. According to CHR, there are 4,409 people for every one mental health provider in the Bagley area (which is the second highest ratio for similar- sized markets served by Sanford Health). During the stakeholder meeting the group discussed burdens and stresses that mental health is putting on healthcare and law enfo rcement in terms of Emergency Department visits and incarceration rates. The group identified isolation and lack of social interaction (much of it COVID related) as exacerbating the mental health issues facing the local community. Substance abuse and menta l health for youth were areas of particular concern. There are a lot of broken homes and dysfunctional family dynamics prevalent in the community. Mental health was the top priority of law enforcement. 12 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 Local Asset Mapping Mental Health resources : Sanf ord Bagley Clinic, 1656 Central St. W., Bagley Sanford Clearbrook Clinic, 22 Elm St., Clearbrook Essentia Bagley Clinic, 121 Central St. W., Bagley Clearwater Co.

While high rates of specialist physicians have been shown to be associated with higher (and perhaps unnecessary) utilization, sufficient availability of primary care physicians is essential for preventive and primary care, and, when ne eded, referrals to appropriate specialty care. While CHNA respondents in the Bagley area rated their ability to access health care as good (average score=3.36), the average score was the lowest among similar markets and 16 percent of respondents rated their ability to access health care as poor or fair. In addition, when respondents were asked about the most important health care issues impacting their community, access to health care was the second leading concern, behind the inability to pay for health care. When asked which health care services they would like to see offered or improv ed in their community, about two in five CHNA respondents in the Bagley area said walk -in or urgent care (43%) and dental care (37%) - and one in three said family medicine or primary care (33%) and dermatology (33%). According to CHR, in the Bagley area t here are 2,203 people for every one primary care physician and 2,939 people for every one dentist (ratios which are higher than the comparison group average). 13 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 Access to affordable health care, access to health care providers, and access to quality health c are were discussed as a single topic since rather than individually since they are not mutually exclusive and overlap in scope.

As housing costs have outpaced local incomes, households not only struggle to acquire and maintain adequate shelter, but also face difficult trade- offs in meeting other basic needs. When the majority of a paycheck goes toward the rent or mortgag e, it can be difficult to afford doctor visits, healthy foods, utility bills, and reliable transportation to work or school. This can, in turn, lead to increased stress levels and emotional strain. CHNA respondents in the Bagley area rated the availabili ty of affordable housing in their community as just good (average score=3.00) and the second lowest community health issue after transportation. CHR data suggest that 16 percent of households in the Bagley area have severe housing problems (i.e., overcrowd ed, high housing costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of plumbing facilities) and 12 percent of households spend at least 50 percent of their household income on housing costs; both rates are higher than any of the similar -sized market areas served by Sanford Health.

Public transportation services play an important role for people who are unable to drive, people without access to personal vehicles, children, individuals with disabilities, and older adults. 16 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 CHNA respondents in the Bagley area rated community access to daily transportation as less than good (average score=2.96) and lower than any ot her community health issue. When asked to explain why they rated community access to daily transportation the way they did, CHNA respondents cited few if any options for public transportation in their community. The stakeholder group felt that this is a cr itical issue impacting a large portion of the population in terms of barriers to health care including mental health. Local social services organizations give some rides but access to and availability of these services is limited . The bus system that used to be in place locally was terminated , contributing to a worsening issue. The stakeholder group felt that transportation availability is a significant barrier to health care, including mental health, and is compounded by the inability for many to afford ve hicles and other transportation alternatives.

While CHNA respondents in the Bagley area rated community safety concerns as good (average score=3.55), the average safety score for Bagley was the lowest among similar markets served by Sanford. CHR data indicate that the rates of violent crime (220 per 100,000 people), injury deaths (88 per 100, 000 people), and juvenile arrests (49 per 1,000 youth) in the Bagley area are higher than the comparison group average.

Members of the local public health agency and Sanford Health were also present. The list of attendees is thanked in the introduction. Stakeholders discussed the health needs, causes, and provided additional insight for their local populations and community resource s. Participants were also encouraged to offer additional needs that may not have been raised during the research process; none were brought forward. The Implementation plan will focus on the following items: 1. Access to Affordable, Quality health care i ncluding primary and specialty care. 2. Focus on Mental Health Services availability in our community. 19 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN Priority 1: Access to Health Care Providers Sanford Health is positioned locally to have a positive impact on Access to Affordable, Quality Healthcare within the community. This effort will focus on two primary goals. Current Activities Sanford Bagley actively promotes outreach specialty services available within the community. These outreach services bring specialty providers to Bagley facilities to provide access to care close to home. Current outreach services offered are General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, S leep Medicine, Psychiatry, Pediatrics. Opportunities to add dermatology services are being explored. Sanford Bagley recently expanded and updated the Eye Clinic and Optical Shop in Bagley - moving it to the main clinic location. This allows access to Eye, Primary Care, and Specialty care services in the same building. Projected Impact Upon completion of the action plan, the Community would see increased access to primary and specialty care within Sanford Bagley. Additionally, alternative appointment typ es, such as telemedicine visits, will be better utilized. Goal 1: Increased access to primary and specialty care within Sanford Bagley.

Current Activities Sanford Health is committed to working with the schools to provide culturally sensitive, age appropriate and family -oriented prevent ion programs to create and give children a healthy start in life. Sanford Health will build upon current relationships with area schools to identify in -school and/or telehealth programs and services that will augment and support healthy learning, emotiona l and behavioral development.

Rob Belanger , Stephanie McKnight Needs Not Addressed Needs identified during the CHNA process \u2014as referenced in the Community Health Needs Assessment Report above \u2014that are not addressed as a significant need for the purpose of this process: Long -Term Care, Nursing Homes, and Senior Housing: Long -Term Care, Nursing Homes, and Senior Housing is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group determined that the need is lower priority compared to other areas. Sanford Bagley is engaged with the greater Sanford Enterprise to determine ways to collaborate and support this need. Sanford Health of Northern Minnesota recently completed the donation of 16 acres of land to the State of Minnesota for a new Veterans Long Term Care facility to be built in the region. 22 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 Affordable Housing: Affordable housing is not included in the implementation Plan as the stakeholder group determined that this is a lower priority compared to other areas within the Community Health Needs Assessment process . Affordable housing information collected as part of the Community Health Needs Assessment Program will be shared with government and non-profit organizations. Community Safety: Community safety is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakehol der group determined that the need is lower priority compared to other areas for purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment. Sanford will continue to support and collaborate with Community Stakeholders to improve community safety. Access to Afforda ble Health Care: Access to affordable health care is not directly included in the Implementation Plan as it was assigned a lower priority compared to others for purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment. It was determined that addressing access to providers \u2014 included in the Implementation Plan \u2014would indirectly have a positive impact on affordability. Sanford Bagley is addressing the need through numerous programs, including Sanford Health of Northern Minnesota 's recently completed donation of 16 acres of land to the State of Minnesota for a new Veterans Long Term Care facility to be built in the region. Annually, Sanford provided $18 million in charity care to the greater region over the past three years. In addition, as being a covered entity of the 340B program we pass on 340B drug savings to our patients who have financial needs. Sanford has financial assistance programs available to patients and continues to promote services offered by the organization and government -sponsored programs. Additiona lly, Sanford encourages patients to retain a primary care provider and remain compliant with current health screening recommendations in an effort to increase early detection which typically results in less invasive and expensive treatments. Public Trans portation: Sanford Bagley is not addressing the need within the Implementation Plan as it was deemed a lower priority for purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment process. However, the expansion of telehealth services, additional providers, and gr eater access to service lines noted in the Implementation Plan will improve access to healthcare for services for those with limited transportation options. Sanford Bagley works in collaboration with community resources to develop additional transportation for patients needing transportation to their health care appointments. Access to Quality Health Care: Although not directly included as a standalone priority in the Implementation Plan as access to providers was deemed a greater priority, Sanford Bagle y is addressing the need through improved access to health care. C ontinual improvement around care close to home and patient access is a priority at Sanford. Projects include mammogram screening through MyChart and the ability to self -refer for screening mammograms, providing assistance with establishing a primary care provider to patients are seen in the Emergency department who do not have a primary care provider. Outreach to the Bagley community has grown to include General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sleep Medicine, Psychiatry, and Pediatrics. In addition to these services Sanford Bemidji, the regional hub, have leveraged specialist from Fargo to provide outreach care in Bemidji. Seeing a specialist in Bemidji, rather than traveling to Fargo, saves patients over 175 miles of travel, in addition to significant time savings. Patient feedback is collected through two survey processes. The first is a paper CAHPS survey completed by mail in which the patient has 42 days to respond from their enco unter date. The second is a real -time survey conducted by email or an interactive voice phone call. In this case, the patient has two weeks from the encounter date to respond. This real -time survey provides 23 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 patient an opportunity to give feedback and San ford the opportunity to improve the services we provide. Sanford Accountability for Excellence, or SAFE, is Sanford Health's commitment to patient safety on our journey to becoming a high reliability organization (HRO). Being an HRO means having systems in place that create reliable barriers to preventable harm, reducing or even eliminating serious safety events in our facilities. EVALUATION OF 2019 -2021 CHNA Goal 1: Mental Health and Substance Abuse In 2019, Sanford Bagley selected a current Family Medicine Nurse Practitioner and supported their return to school to receive a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Certification. The intent was to have a local expert in Psychiatric Medication Management for the community. The Psychiatric Nurse P ractitioner completed their clinical rotations and began seeing patients at the Bagley and Clearbrook clinics in 2019. At the time, they were able to see patients with both medical and mental health concerns due to the double certification. Unfortunately, the provider had personal commitments that led them to leave their role at Sanford in 2020. Mental health support for the local community continues through psychiatric telehealth, and outreach from Sanford Bemidji Medical Center. Pharma providers use Sanf ord Prescribing algorithms for opioid prescribing. This allows for a standard approach to opioid prescribing to patients - eliminating the patient trying different doctors to get different answers. Contracts are being used with patients as part of the opio id prescription process, having the patient and provider sign an agreement on how to safely utilize the prescribed medication. In the event we feel a provider is prescribing opioids outside of the guidelines we can audit each provider's prescriptions. Crisis services report in person for crisis visits. The crisis services team is a group out of Sanford Bemidji that can assist our providers in the event they have a patient in the middle of a mental health crisis. The crisis team can help determine the most appropriate next service. For example: a patient comes into the Emergency Department saying they are suicidal. Our provider can have the crisis team help determine next steps - inpatient vs. outpatient vs. other treatment. Goal 2: Children and Youth Sanford Bagley intends to make the Sanford fit wellness program available to local schools as well as parents of students. SBMC hosted Sanford fit night in conjunction with parent teacher conferences at the Bagley elementary school on February 13, 2020. A pproximately 200 people attended the event. Further expansion into additional districts at an appropriate time due to COVID -19 is under consideration. Sanford Bagley continued to partner with local school districts to support community youth. Unfortunatel y, most events were cancelled due to the COVID -19 pandemic. We have had the opportunity for our RN Health Coach to meet with patients for education on healthy lifestyle choices. In addition, online education opportunities were available to our patients, in cluding participation in career fairs at school. Sanford Health Northern Minnesota hired and onboarded a teen/adolescence psychiatric nurse practitioner and a full -time licensed psychologist in September 2019. Approximately 600 patients were seen in 2020. 24 dba Sanford Bagley Medical Center EIN #41-1266009 CONTACT INFORMATION The Community Health Needs Assessment, Implementation Plan, and survey data are available online at https://www.sanfordhealth.org/about/community -health -needs -assessment.
