Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I am a massage therapist in Portland and found this oil a few summers ago visiting our family cabin on Orcas. I've been using it at the end of a massage on client's neck and upper shoulders and they LOVE it. I've had a few order it for themselves. The scent is super grounding and woodsy, and it absorbs slowly but nicely. Doesn't leave the skin greasy. Not too heavy, not too light, but absolutely just right. This is a great massage oil, but it also wards of mosquitoes, can be used as a deodorant, has antiseptic properties from the essential oils, and smells amazing. I got a small one when visiting a year ago, which led me to recently order another $100 of Island Thyme products because I loved the oil so much. I still have a little of the 2oz left even though I use it a lot. Bought the 4oz this time. My favorite! Bought a 2oz bottle on Orcas that lasted me over a year and upgraded the the 4oz recently. Smells amazing, not greasy on your skin. Highly recommend! Hey Katie, Thanks for sharing your experience with our Wood Spirit oil! We're delighted to hear that you came back for seconds! Love it! The smell is fabulous! Thanks for your sweet feedback Kellie! :) "}
