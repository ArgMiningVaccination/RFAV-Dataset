I want to switch over to more naturopathic treatments for any future cold and cough issues that he may have. Does naturopathy medicine also cover immunization? 20 Answers [Serena Goldstein](/Expert/81225435-Serena-Goldstein)Naturopathic Physician Hi, great question and if I am understanding correctly, we have many different modalities and therapies available to help your son with any future cold and cough issues. Further, we can also provide counsel on any immunizations, schedule, etc. As far as administering immunizations, that would be doctor and state dependent. Please check out 'Find a Doctor' on our website, www.naturopathic.org, to speak to someone near you.

Dr. Serena [Dr. Nadene Neale](/Expert/1492335-Nadene-Neale)Naturopathic Physician Vancouver, WA Yes, some pediatric focused naturopathic physicians do administer vaccinations. It'd be best to call the office and ask for a free meet and greet with the doctor (if offered by the doctor) to discuss your preferences for your child's healthcare prior to establishing care. [Dr. Justin Taylor](/Expert/2539770-Justin-Taylor)Family Practitioner Elma, WA Yes [Sarah Sue Myers](/Expert/2827741-Sarah-Sue-Myers)Naturopathic Physician Bellingham, WA It depends. Naturopathic Medicine must be licensed in your state - you can check out the map here - https://aanmc.org/licensure/ Some states give naturopathic docs the same scope of practice as medical docs, and in some states, the scope of practice is more limited.

Osik](/Expert/2922504-Loretta-M-Osik)Naturopathic Physician Danbury, CT Yes and No. I am in Ct and in this state we are not allowed to immunize. However in other states it might be allowed. Immunization is not part of naturopathic medicine per se or training. [Tonya Houghton](/Expert/82738616-Tonya-Houghton)Counselor/Therapist Lady Lake, FL No. [Farzam Afshar](/Expert/82738325-Farzam-Afshar)Naturopathic Physician Houston, TX I want to start off by saying how wonderful it is that you are open to evidence-based natural treatments for your son. Every day people are experiencing the amazing benefits Nature has to offer us backed by our scientific knowledge of it. With that being said, many people think Naturopathic medicine is anti vaccines or immunizations, and this is simply not true. Naturopathic medicine is a form of medicine that covers training in conventional medicine, alternative and complementary medicines, pharmaceuticals, and minor surgeries. We are taught about immunizations at our medical schools and administer them, too. At the end of the day, we are trained as physicians and we adhere to our oath of \"first do no harm.\" Whereas most physicians will do the immunization and leave it at that, Naturopathic physicians look at the body holistically and look at areas where we can support the patient's body and immune system. We provide lifestyle, diet, and nutraceutical counseling to support the patient towards optimal health. We have many wonderful evidence-based natural therapeutics which allow us to support our patients both preventatively and during an active cold and/or flu, with or without a cough. [Christy Soto-Johnson](/Expert/81379098-Christy-Soto-Johnson)Naturopathic Physician Phoenix, AZ Hello there - this is a great question as it's often unclear to many. Part of the reason it is unclear is because each state determines how much or how little a naturopathic doctor can do (it's called \"scope of practice\"). If you live in a state where we are approved to be able to administer vaccines, then here is the answer to your question: While in medical school naturopathic doctors do learn the full scope of vaccination medicine, including safety, side effects, benefits, harm, administering, etc. It is up to each doctor to decide whether they offer vaccination in their office as a service. Some do, some don't. Some provide a natural alternative to vaccination. However, all naturopathic doctors will provide you with information on all of the above to help you decide if you want to vaccinate or not, and can even help you choose a vaccine schedule if you do wish to get them for your child. [Dr. Borislava Johnson](/Expert/81598995-Borislava-Johnson)Naturopathic Physician Cypress, TX Depends on which state you live in. In Texas, it is not covered. [Aumatma Shah Simmons](/Expert/82736806-Aumatma-Shah-Simmons)Naturopathic Physician Berkeley, CA Immunization can certainly be part of a Naturopathic doctors' office. Unfortunately, we do not offer immunizations in-office, but there might be other doctors who do. [Dr. Xan Simonson](/Expert/2764545-Xan-Simonson)Naturopathic Physician Tempe, AZ To answer your question each Naturopathic Physician has their own belief system in regards to vaccination. In licensed states such as Arizona where I am many of the naturopathic physicians support vaccines but with a modified schedule. Naturopathic Physicians (NMD) work with the patient and their parents for what is best for their patient. We are experts in treating colds, viruses, coughs with a natural approach. [Dr. Myleen Simone](/Expert/81738974-Myleen-Simone)Naturopathic Physician SURPRISE, AZ If you mean cover immunization as in actually give vaccines, then that lies on the practice you see. But if you mean does natural medicine improve the system, then yes there are things to help that. [Lorenzo J.

Dr. K [Lisa Ballantyne](/Expert/81226718-Lisa-Ballantyne)Naturopathic Physician Gig Harbor, Washington Immunizations depend on the Naturopathic doctor that you work with and whether or not they are willing or not to do immunizations. You will want to do some research when looking for a Naturopathic doctor. [Carolyn Ledowsky](/Expert/8134431-Carolyn-Ledowsky)Naturopathic Physician Neutral Bay, New South Wales One of the best things for immunity are transfer factors. There is a lot of good research on transfer factors boosting immune function and preventing viral, fungal and mould diseases.

Nolting](/Expert/8134761-Mark-Nolting)Naturopathic Physician Edmonds, Washington Yes, NDs are trained as primary care docs and will counsel you about proper vaccinations as well as giving you natural approaches to support your child's health as he grows and develops. [Dr. Chrisenia M. White](/Expert/81226047-Chrisenia-M-White)Acupuncturist Fairfax, VA This depends on the Naturopathic physicians view point on immunizations and the state in which they practice. Not all 50 states have a scope of practice for Naturopathic physicians to immunize, however most can assist you with making the best decision in regards to immunizations for both you and your son. Some Naturopathic physicians are pro immunizations, some are against immunizations and others believe it depends the risk of exposure and/or they feel the immunization schedule should be changes depending on the individual. If you decide to switch over to Naturopathic medicine, choose a physician that is open to an introductory consultation where you can discuss their views/concerns in regards immunizations and pick someone who has a similar view point as you. [Steven Sorr](/Expert/8134498-Steven-Sorr)Naturopathic Physician Scottsdale, Arizona Depending on what state you live in, naturopathic doctors may administer immunizations. However, there is no vaccine for the common cold. Naturopathic medicine aims to build one's immune system and prevent illness in the individual.
