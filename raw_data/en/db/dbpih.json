All minerals, plants, animals, liquids and objects are products of an endless array of cells which emit energy. And what is within each cell? Protons, neutrons and electrons, which are all composed of sub-atomic particles which are pure energy. Therefore, everything we see in this universe is at its root energy that evolves, changes and flows. That includes us as human beings. For this reason, it is not too far-fetched to think that within our own bodies we have areas that possess more condensed energy than others. When the energy within our bodies is too imbalanced due to bad habits, stress, unacknowledged feelings and thought patterns, we get sick and we suffer - it's as simple as that. This is where the importance of chakra balancing comes into play. In traditional Indian thought our bodies possess seven different energy centers that are subject to blockages according to our lifestyle habits. When our energy centers are blocked or misaligned we feel heavy, ill and emotionally imbalanced. In fact, if you've come to this article chances are that you are unconsciously attracted to \"cleaning\" or emptying an energy blockage within your body which is preventing you from living a centered life. The Importance of Chakra Balancing in Everyday Life Whether you like using the word \"chakra\" or perhaps \"meridians\" or \"energy centers,\" it is undeniable that we are all electric beings by nature. Simply dragging your feet across a carpet and then touching something metal will show you that. But don't worry: learning how to balance your chakras is by no means some kind of \"esoteric\" or complicated art. It simply requires sensitivity, introspection and a dedication to your well-being; all of which I can help you within this article. Simply reading through each energy center below will help you to determine which of the seven chakras within you are the most \"stuffy\" and imbalanced.
