The main symptoms are pain and irritation, especially when swallowing. Some home remedies, such as honey, lemon water, and chicken soup, can provide relief. A [sore throat](/articles/311449) occurs as part of the body's immune response to viral or bacterial infections. The natural immune response leads to [inflammation](/articles/248423.php) and swelling of the mucous membranes in the throat. However, several natural remedies may provide relief, including some that are supported by scientific evidence. Here are 15 natural sore throat remedies. People have used extracts from the marshmallow plant, Althaea officinalis, to treat sore throats and other conditions since ancient times. Its root contains a gelatin-like substance called mucilage that coats and lubricates the throat when a person swallows it. Researchers have tested lozenges containing marshmallow root in animals and found them to be effective and nontoxic, even at very high doses. It may also help soothe a dry cough ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina_Nikolova4/publication/258282899_Development_and_evaluation_of_novel_lozenges_containing_marshmallow_root_extract/links/00b7d527dff71b6959000000/Development-and-evaluation-of-novel-lozenges-containing-marshmallow-root-extract.pdf), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939213/) [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31770755) Marshmallow root infusion Here is a recipe for a cold marshmallow root infusion to soothe a painful throat: Ingredients: - 1 liter (l) of cold water - 1 ounce, or 28 grams (g), of dried marshmallow root Directions: - Fill a jar with the cold water. - Place the marshmallow root in cheesecloth and tie it up in a bundle. - Lower the bundle into the water until it is completely submerged. - Place the tied end of the bundle over the lip of the jar, place the lid on the jar, and screw it on. - Infuse overnight, or for at least 8 hours, then remove the bundle. - Pour the desired amount into a glass. Add an optional sweetener of choice. When it is ready, take sips throughout the day to help reduce symptoms. Choosing high quality dried marshmallow root from a reliable source is important. Bottom line: Marshmallow has a long history of use for treating sore throats. Its root contains a gelatinous substance, called mucilage, which coats and soothes the throat. [Sage](/articles/266480) is a popular herb in cooking, but it also has several medicinal uses. Sage, also called Salvia officinalis, originated in the Mediterranean. Now, people grow it around the world. Sage may help with many inflammatory conditions, and controlled studies suggest that it can help relieve throat pain ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5634728/) [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3242359/) [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16504956) In one study, a sage-echinacea spray was slightly more effective at reducing throat pain than a chlorhexidine lidocaine spray. Neither treatment caused any negative side effects ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3351972/) [Echinacea](/articles/252684.php) is another herb that people use in traditional medicine. It can fight bacteria, reduce inflammation, and help treat respiratory conditions ( [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29749084/) Sage-echinacea throat spray Follow this recipe to make sage-echinacea throat spray at home: Ingredients: - 1 teaspoon (tsp) of ground sage - 1 tsp of ground echinacea - 1/2 cup of water Directions: - Boil the water. - Place the sage and echinacea in a small jar, then fill it with boiling water. - Let it steep for 30 minutes. - Pour the mixture through a strainer. Add 1/2 cup of hard liquor if desired. - Place the mixture in a small spray bottle and spray into the throat every 2 hours or as needed. Bottom line: Research suggests that a sage-echinacea spray can help relieve a sore throat as effectively as antiseptic medication spray. Apple cider vinegar is a natural health tonic. It has been a staple in folk medicine remedies for centuries. Its main active ingredient, acetic acid, helps fight bacteria. The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, known as the father of medicine, prescribed a combination of apple cider vinegar and honey, called oxymel, to treat [flu](/articles/15107.php) symptoms, such as coughs and sore throats ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785201/) To help relieve throat pain, drink 1 cup of warm water mixed with 1 tablespoon (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar and 1 optional tbsp of honey. The possible risks of apple cider vinegar include tooth decay and digestive problems.

Bottom line: Apple cider vinegar has antibacterial properties and, when a person mixes it in small amounts with warm water, could help relieve a sore throat.

It may also help kill harmful microbes in the throat. Combine 1 cup of warm water with 1 tsp of salt and stir to dissolve. Gargle with a mouthful of this mixture for 30 seconds once per hour. Bottom line: Gargling hourly with warm salt water may help reduce swelling and ease throat discomfort. [Honey](/articles/264667) is a sweetener that people often combine with other natural ingredients to soothe a sore throat. People use honey as a medicine because it has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6225430/) In addition to helping fight infection and providing pain relief, honey can also make certain remedies taste better. Honey may be especially effective when a person combines it with warm water and apple cider vinegar or herbs. Some people choose to use [raw honey](/articles/324997) or [manuka honey](/articles/318298). However, children under the age of 1 should avoid honey. Their guts have not yet acquired healthy bacteria that can fight off some germs, such as [botulism](/articles/173943.php) spores, that sometimes occur in honey. Also, people who avoid sugar or follow a low carb diet may want to choose another remedy, since honey is a form of sugar. It contains 17.3 g of carbohydrates per tablespoon ( [11](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/789126/nutrients) Bottom line: Honey can help relieve throat pain, particularly when a person combines it with vinegar or herbs in warm water. Never give honey to children under 1. The [licorice](/articles/323761) plant, also called Glycyrrhiza glabra, is native to Europe and South Asia. Best known for its sweet flavor, licorice also has uses in traditional medicine. It has properties similar to [aspirin](/articles/161255.php) that may help reduce sore throat pain.

However, there is no research into its ability to relieve illness-related sore throats. That said, studies have reported that after surgery, licorice could significantly reduce throat pain due to breathing tube removal ( [13](https://journals.lww.com/ejanaesthesiology/Fulltext/2016/08000/The_efficacy_of_different_doses_of_liquorice.11.aspx), [14](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_Randomized,_Double_Blind_Comparison_of_Licorice.12.aspx)). One study found that gargling with licorice water before surgery reduced the risk of getting a sore throat by 50%, compared with gargling with sugar water ( [14](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_Randomized,_Double_Blind_Comparison_of_Licorice.12.aspx)). To make licorice tea, combine ground licorice root with hot water, let it steep for 5 minutes, then strain it prior to drinking. Licorice root tea is also available at natural grocery stores and online. Bottom line: Drinking or gargling licorice tea may help soothe a sore throat. [Lemon water](/articles/318662) is a refreshing beverage that may also reduce the throat pain that occurs during a cold or flu. Lemon contains [vitamin C](/articles/219352) and other powerful [antioxidants](/articles/301506.php). These compounds fight inflammation and reduce [oxidative stress](/articles/324863), which are common markers of disease ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431442/) Lemon also increases the amount of saliva the body produces, which can help keep the mucous membranes moist. Try combining lemon with warm water and a little honey or salt water to maximize its benefits. Bottom line: Lemon water contains vitamin C and compounds that can soothe a sore throat and assist with healing. [Ginger](/articles/265990.php) is a spice with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects that may help relieve throat pain.

Bottom line: Coconut oil is very soothing on the throat and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Take up to 2 tbsp (30 ml) per day alone or in warm beverages. [Cinnamon](/articles/266069.php) is a fragrant and delicious spice with a high antioxidant content. It can also provide antibacterial benefits ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702210) In Chinese medicine, cinnamon is a traditional remedy for colds, flus, and sore throats.
