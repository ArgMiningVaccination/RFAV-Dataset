It is a form of energy healing that has been known to help alleviate physical, emotional, mental and spiritual stress. It is a way to 'tune-up' your energy to its healthiest state allowing for healing to take place. Reiki is not affiliated with any particular religion or religious practice. It is not massage nor is it based on belief or suggestion. During a Reiki Session a practitioner places his or her hands on or above the person (Client preference) with the intention of the Reiki Energy to flow. This Reiki energy, also known as the Universal Life Force Energy, is not the practitioner's energy. It is a divinely guided energy that knows exactly where the blocks are and pushes them out as well as fills up the energy gas tanks wherever you are low in energy. It is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement. It should NEVER be used in place of medicines or a Physician, but works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery . You'll want to be sure you've eaten and hydrated a few hours before the session. Avoid eating a heavy meal beforehand, however, as you don't want all of your body's energy to be directed toward digesting while you're receiving your treatment. You will be laying down for the majority of your session. Be sure you are wearing comfortable clothes. Either wear or bring socks if your feet get cold easily, but I do have a sheet to place over you. When a Reiki practitioner places his/her hands on or just above an area of the Recipient's fully clothed body, Reiki flows through the practitioner into the person receiving the treatment. This flow may be felt as any type of sensation\u2014heat, cold, vibration, tingling, unusual heaviness, or sometimes as no sensation at all. After doing any type of energy work it's important to hydrate, so be sure to drink 1-2 glasses of water after your session. If you are hungry then make sure you eat something and that it's not heavy. Sometimes as with a lot of healing modalities you may feel off the next day physically, emotionally or both. This usually subsides by the next day. Drinking water helps with this as does dark chocolate. The number of times a session is needed varies by individual. Benefits of Reiki may include: Increased Energy Levels, Increased Mental Clarity, Personal Ability to Grow, A Sense of Calm or Balance, Emotional Healing & Stability, Improved Sleep, Clearing & Balancing of Chakras, Can Provide Relief from Chronic Pain, Boosts & Strengthens the Immune System, Compliments & Supports Conservative Medical Treatment, Helps to Deal with Suppressed or Blocked Emotions & Feelings, Helps with Depression and Reduces Stress, Tension, Anxiety & General Emotional Distress. Each individual responds uniquely so there are not set protocols for frequency of treatment. Reiki energy healing has been known to relieve pain and acute symptoms rapidly, while chronic problems may require more extensive sessions. Length of treatment depends on the root cause of the problem and the amount of energy needed to bring the problem area of the body back into balance. This website uses cookies.
