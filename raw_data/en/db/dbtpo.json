For COVID -19 vaccine administration services furnished before March 15, 2021, the Medicare payment rate for a single -dose vaccine or for the final dose in a series was $28.39. For a COVID -19 vaccine requiring a series of two or more doses, the payment rate was $16.94 for the initial dose(s) in the series and $28.39 for the final dose in the series. On March 15, 2021, CMS updated the Medicare payment rates for COVID -19 vaccine administration . Effective for services furnished on or after March 15, 2021, the new Medicare payment rate for administering a COVID - 19 vaccine is approximately $40 to administer each dose of a COVID -19 vaccine.
