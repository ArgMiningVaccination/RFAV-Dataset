It approaches health not just as absence of disease but as a state of optimal vitality, and uses all appropriate evidence-based modalities, including lifestyle interventions, complementary treatments, and conventional allopathic methods, in one paradigm. Use of non-conventional therapies by women and interest in integrative care is very high. Much disinformation exists and many women engage in non-conventional therapies without medical advice, sometimes benefiting from them, but also possibly delaying needed care or placing themselves at risk. Research and clinical interest in non-conventional methods also is rising within the medical community, with increased recognition of the value of an integrative health model for individuals and communities. Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a unique position to support their patients in holistic health optimization by choosing beneficial integrative strategies while identifying potentially harmful practices.
