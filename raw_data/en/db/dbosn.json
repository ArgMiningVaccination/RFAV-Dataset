Since vestibular migraine and PPPD can be comorbid, these supplements are usually prescribed for both, however if PPPD is caused by a different vestibular disorder, it may vary in combination. Magnesium It is challenging and expensive to measure magnesium accurately through blood tests, making low magnesium in the brain difficult to prove. Studies have found that many with migraine have low levels of magnesium in the brain and spinal fluid. This is why supplementation is important for those with migraine even if a deficiency may not be detected. A daily dose between 400mg-800mg is recommended for migraine prevention by most clinics, including Johns Hopkins. Magnesium oxide is the most widely recommended due to its use in studies and its easy and inexpensive availability, however it can cause diarrhea as a side effect. Because high doses are recommended for migraine prevention, a more easily absorbed form like magnesium glycinate may be better tolerated. Different types of magnesium may be recommended for different symptoms.

SUPPORT VEDA @ VESTIBULAR.ORG109Natural Supplements for Vestibular Disorders By Alicia Wolf VESTIBULAR.ORG :: 109 / COPING2 Riboflavin A European study in 2004 found that migraine days were cut in half after 3 months and 6 months of daily use of 400mg of B2 Riboflavin. In addition, the number of abortive medications were also significantly reduced. This supplement was found to be well-tolerated by the participants in the study as well. There are also many natural sources of riboflavin that can be supplemented with diet, including eggs, lean protein, green vegetables, and fortified cereals and breads. CoQ10 Two small, but effective studies have shown that CoQ10 may help with migraine prevention. In one study, patients took 150mg daily for 3 months and over half of them experienced a 50% reduction in migraine days without side effects. The other study used 100mg three times a day and compared it with a placebo. The CoQ10 was 3 times more effective at reducing migraine attacks than the placebo, yet some noted stomach upset as a side effect. Some of the side effects may be avoided by splitting the dosage throughout the day. It does interact with some medications. Ginger In a 2014 study, ginger was found to be as effective as sumatriptan in migraine patients without aura. Within 2 hours, pain severity was lessened. It is unclear whether this supplement helps with vestibular migraine dizziness without pain. 1/4 teaspoon of ginger powder is the recommended dosage, taken at the first sign of an attack. Feverfew An extremely small study of 8 patients showed that their headaches were unchanged, yet the frequency of headaches increased significantly when stopping feverfew to switch to the placebo. Some studies showed feverfew to be slightly more effective than the placebo. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting were also reduced. Other studies have shown it to not be effective for migraine prevention. Other than helping with nausea, there's no clear research on if this will help vestibular symptoms. VESTIBULAR NEURITIS, BPPV, AND MENIERE'S Vitamin D Low levels of vitamin D have been found in patients with vestibular disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's Disease, and Vestibular Neuritis. A few reports have shown supplementation can be beneficial for preventing BPPV attacks and Meniere's symptoms. Dosage should be discussed with your doctor as it could depend on how deficient you are. SUPPLEMENTS BY DIAGNOSIS Vestibular de / COPING3VESTIBULAR NEURITIS & MENIERE'S DISEASE L -lysine A naturally occurring amino acid, lysine has anecdotal evidence to be effective for tinnitus and treatment of vertigo. Gingko Biloba There is some research that points to gingko being helpful for enhancing cognitive function and improving memory loss. Some patients with tinnitus find it helps, while other research points to it being ineffective. It also thins the blood and is usually not recommended to be taken with other blood thinners. Preparations in the US vary, so it is important to look for labeling EGb 761, which is extracted from the leaves. Most studies of Ginkgo use between 120-240 mg a day. This could be effective for patients with multiple vestibular disorders.Lemon Bioflavonoid Although the research for this supplement isn't strong, it does appear to be helpful for some patients with Meniere's disease, particularly those with tinnitus as a symptom. This supplement is fairly well tolerated. Currently there are no vitamin or supplement recommendations for Mal de Debarquement (MDDS) and Acoustic Neuroma. \u00a92015 Vestibular Disorders Association VeDA's publications are protected under copyright.
