This is the second in the series since the first edition in 2008. It demonstrates that the Welsh Government remains committed to measuring and understanding the issues which affect the wellbeing of all our children and young people. The Monitor is vital to help us understand the broad picture of children and young people's wellbeing in our nation: that way we can take reasoned and thoughtful action that will improve the lives of our children and young people. This edition of the Monitor begins to develop a time series of data on key wellbeing indicators; and this will be continued in subsequent editions which will be published every three years. It also continues to fulfil our commitment to the UN to regularly publish data on children's wellbeing. Furthermore, it should serve as a useful resource for our stakeholders and partners to plan and monitor their actions. The aim of the Monitor is to report on the wellbeing of children and young people (aged 0-25) using a variety of wellbeing indicators, findings from the wider evidence base and the voices of children and young people themselves. The Monitor is based on themes taken from the Welsh Government's seven core aims for children and young people, which seek to ensure that all children and young people in Wales: have a flying start in life; have a comprehensive range of education and learning opportunities; enjoy the best possible health and are free from abuse, victimisation and exploitation; have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities; are listened to, treated with respect, and have their race and cultural identity recognised; have a safe home and community which supports physical and emotional wellbeing; and are not disadvantaged by poverty. Some of the findings presented are challenging, for example, hospital admissions for self-harm amongst young people have risen over recent years. Other aspects of children and young people's wellbeing are proving hard to change and some indicators have remained static over many years such as the latest figures showing that 12 per cent of young people in Wales are classified as not in education employment or training (NEET), the same level as in 1996. Infant mortality rates continue to fall in Wales, which is good, but there is room for improvement as they are higher than in a number of other EU countries such as Luxembourg and Sweden. However, smoking behaviour amongst adolescents continues to fall and rates of MMR immunisation have dramatically increased, which is encouraging.4Finally, it is notable that many of the wellbeing indicators reported here are not so favourable for those children and young people who are living in deprivation and/or poverty. These findings only serve to reinforce the importance of our commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020 by delivering on the actions set out in our child poverty strategy. The Monitor will continue to enhance our understanding of children and young people's lives and will help us to continue to strive for an equal and happy life for all of our children and young people.

Author: Richard Thurston This is the second in a series of reports on children and young people's wellbeing in Wales. The first was published in 2008 in response to calls from the UN for governments to publish information that can be used to assess progress and design policies to improve the outcomes for children and young people. The Welsh Government made a commitment to doing this in One Wales with the intention to publish new editions of the Monitor every three years. The Monitor is important to aiding the Welsh Government and its partners to measure and understand the issues which affect the wellbeing of children and young people and to use this as a basis for policy development and evaluation. The aim of the Monitor is to report on the wellbeing of children and young people (aged 0-25) using a variety of wellbeing indicators, findings from the wider evidence base and the voices of children and young people themselves. The Monitor is organised around themes taken from the Welsh Government's Seven Core Aims for children and young people, which are themselves based on the UNCRC (see Box 1). The Seven Core Aims seek to ensure that all children and young people in Wales: have a flying start in life; have a comprehensive range of education and learning opportunities; enjoy the best possible health and are free from abuse, victimisation and exploitation; have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities; are listened to, treated with respect, and have their race and cultural identity recognised; have a safe home and community which supports physical and emotional wellbeing, and; are not disadvantaged by poverty. 21The Monitor's fundamental aims remain unchanged. These are to: provide access to reliable and up-to-date information on child wellbeing in Wales, allowing the Welsh Government to monitor and respond to key trends; provide an opportunity to track the Welsh Government's cross-cutting child poverty targets within the context of child wellbeing; raise awareness of the issues that need to be tackled to secure children and young people's wellbeing; and fulfil the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) call on all state parties to publish data on children's wellbeing regularly. The Monitor is written by joint teams of Welsh Government social researchers, statisticians and economists. There are many sources of data used throughout the Monitor to populate the indicators. Care has been taken to ensure all sources are robust and legitimate. Indicators are reported at an all-Wales level, and all indicators reported on in the first Monitor are included again including data on the Welsh Government's Child Poverty indicators. In some cases there is no change as no new data have become available. 22Box 1: The four general principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) The UNCRC is an international human rights treaty that grants all children and young people (aged under 18), a comprehensive set of human rights. The UK signed the convention on 19 April 1990, ratified it on 16 December 1991 and it came into force in the UK on 15 January 1992. The four general principles of the UNCRC are: non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child. For further information, see http://www.unicef.org/crc/A New Look Monitor The 2011 edition of the Monitor contains a number of changes from the previous version. Most notably, it now reports on children and young people aged 0-25 years of age (the 2008 edition only reported to 18) to reflect the Welsh Government's policy focus on this age group and the transition from youth to adulthood. Also new is the inclusion of information and insights gained from children and young people themselves; their voice has been captured via the commissioned qualitative research the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study (undertaken by Glyndw r University). This was identified as a gap in the previous edition of the Monitor but recognised as extremely important in terms of guiding our developing knowledge about what counts from the perspective of children and young people themselves. The main findings from this study are reported in this summary and the qualitative material is integrated within the main report of the Monitor; there will also be a separate publication which reports on the findings in more detail. A more comprehensive review of existing evidence by Cardiff University was also commissioned and the findings have been used to construct the narratives of the chapters. New indicators and sources of data have been identified and included. In part this is due to the increased age range. And, a stronger focus on wellbeing theories has been included in the introductory chapter in part due to the increasing interest in wellbeing as a guiding concept in government policy making. Findings from the Welsh Government's work on children and young people's budgeting have also been included. An important feature of the 2008 Monitor was to identify significant gaps in the evidence. Since 2008, work has been done to address some of these gaps. Elsewhere these gaps remain and require continued work and commitment from the Welsh Government and relevant stakeholders. The 2011 edition of the Monitor also identifies some additional gaps. One notable on-going development consists of work examining how to collect representative survey data from children and young people themselves about their wellbeing and their views on public services. The most notable difference is that this edition of the Monitor begins to develop a time series of data on key wellbeing indicators. The summary of key findings that follow highlights some of the main trends alongside key findings from the qualitative research with children and young people, all of which is explained in more detail in the main report. 23Key Findings The Demographic Picture of Children and Young People in Wales In recent years, migration has been the main reason for population growth in Wales. However, Wales has experienced positive natural change (i.e. more births than deaths) since 2005-06 onwards. There are approximately 962,000 children and young people in Wales aged 0-25. The number of births continues to rise and, in 2009, 34,900 babies were born in Wales (See Figure 1). This means that the numbers of pupils of statutory school age (5-15) are beginning to rise, although these have been falling recently due to previously lower birth rates. Due to changes in life expectancy, the proportion of young people aged 0-25 is projected to decrease in relation to the general population by 2.5% to 937,700 by mid-2020. Other key demographic data relating to children and young people in Wales: The number of live births in Wales increased from 32,000 in 2006 to 34,900 in 2009. Death rates among 0-19 year olds in Wales continue to fall and, in 2009, there were 291 deaths, which is a rate of 40.8 per 100,000 population. As in recent years, the numbers of pupils of statutory school age (5-15 years) in maintained schools, decreased but rose among the under-fives and the 16-19+ years age groups. The level of Welsh language ability has not changed since the last edition of the Monitor with 13% of primary and 16% of secondary school children fluent speakers. The vast majority of school children aged five and over are white British (91.8%). 24Specific Groups of Children and Young People One of the most remarkable findings reported in the Monitor is that the number of looked after children has increased by 44% over the last decade (see Figure 2). It is likely that this rise is related to a number of factors including increased need and/ or local authority policies and practices. 25Box 2: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study As children grow older and parents relinquish their control over their environments and choices, they accept more responsibility for their safety, their health and their futures. It was apparent in this study that while young people talked about having responsibility for themselves (and about treating people how they would like to be treated), there was some reticence in accepting responsibility for others. However, those young people who had children of their own, talked about their responsibilities to their children, mostly prioritising these over their own interests. Their concerns for their children appeared largely informed by their own experiences, worries and opportunities available to them as young people.050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000400,000 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 202318-255-11 12-170-4PopulationFigure 1: Projected population by age group in Wales (mid-2001 to mid-2023) Year Source: Mid-year population estimates and 2008-based national projections, Office for National StatisticsThe proportions of pupils in local authority maintained schools, known to be eligible for free school meals has also increased. Between 2009 and 2010 the increase was just over 1% in primary schools and just under 1% in secondary schools. The Monitor also reports on a downward trend since 2000/01 in relation to statements of special educational need (SEN). In 2010 14,128 pupils in schools in Wales now having statements compared to 17,400 in 2000/01. Other key data relating to specific groups of children and young people include: There are 150,616 children and young people aged 0-18 years living with a disabled parent. There are 933 young carers (aged under 18) known to social services. There are around 25,000 children in need. In 2009/10, the majority of 16-24 year olds in Wales (94.9%) identified themselves as heterosexual or straight and 2.8% identified themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other. 1.3% didn't respond to the question and a further 1% refused to answer the question. There are around 59,000 children and young people in Wales aged 18 and under living in households with at least four dependent children aged 19 and under. 2601,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008NumberFigure 2: Number of looked after children in Wales at 31 March (1997-2010) 2009 2010 Year Source: Welsh GovernmentThe Early Years Being healthy at birth and through the early years is one of the most important indicators of the wellbeing of children. Measuring the health of young children can be undertaken in a number of different ways and many of the key indicators reported here incorporate those used by UNICEF, including low birth weight; infant mortality rate and childhood immunisation. Birth weight is an important determinant for future health and low birth weight (LBW) is associated with adverse outcomes in terms of poor health and education. Babies born weighing less than 2,500g are at risk of deficits in growth, cognitive development, diabetes and heart disease. There is also evidence that very low birth weight babies (those weighing less than or equal to 1,500g) are at an increased risk of learning difficulties later on in life. The proportion of babies being born with a LBW (less than 2,500g) in Wales has increased over recent years (see Figure 3). Between 1993 and 2000, the proportion rose from 6.3% to 7.5%. Since 2000, the proportion has remained relatively stable, except for a dip in 2005. In 2009, the percentage of babies with a LBW was 7.3%. Other key findings relating to the wellbeing of children in their early years are: The infant mortality rate continues to fall and in 2009 was 4.8 per 1,000 births. Of children aged 4-7, 73% eat fruit daily and 57% eat vegetables daily. 27012345678Percentage weighing less than 2,550g 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2006 2005Figure 3: Percentage of liveborns weighing less than 2,500 grams, Wales (1993-2009) 2009 2008 2007 Year Source: Birth Statistics, Office for National Statistics For seven-year-olds the highest cognitive scores were for children of graduate mothers and those from families in the top income groups. Boys are more likely than girls to have special educational needs and this is particularly pronounced for behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and speech, language and communication difficulties. Sixty-eight per cent of seven-year-olds report having 'lots of friends'. The uptake rate being immunised against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) continues to increase a of 80% in 2003-04. During 2009-10, 92% of two-year-olds had been immunised against MMR. In 2010 the proportion of pupils achieving at least level two (the expected level) in the Core Subject Indicator (CSI) in the National Curriculum was 81.6%. This was the highest level of achievement recorded over the last ten years. Girls out-performed boys in all subjects in the CSI, although recently this gender gap has been decreasing slightly each year. Access to Education, Training and Learning Opportunities Wales continues to see gradual improvement in Core Subject Indicator (CSI) performance at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 and in GCSE/Key Stage 4 attainment measures, but international comparisons show Welsh pupils performing less well comparatively. Most notably, the latest results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) show Welsh pupils are performing less well in assessments of reading, mathematics and science than previously, and also comparatively less well than their counterparts in the other UK countries, and lower than the OECD average in reading and mathematics (see Table 1). Table 1: PISA assessment area scores, UK and OECD average (2009) Assessment area WalesOECD averageScotland NI England Reading 476 493 500 499 495 Mathematics 472 496 499 492 493 Science 496 501 514 511 515 Source: Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) Gender continues to be a defining factor in the educational wellbeing of Welsh children and young people. For instance, girls continue to outperform boys in assessments during compulsory education and beyond. However, PISA assessments, which focus on the application of knowledge, show boys 28outperforming girls in two out of the three subjects assessed (i.e. maths and science). The other most clearly identifiable pattern is that deprivation continues to be correlated with absenteeism and lower attainment rates across much of the spectrum of education for children and young people in Wales. Other key education findings reported in the Monitor are that: The numbers of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) have remained largely at the same level for more than a decade (see Figure 4). The number of permanent exclusions in Wales (based on total number of occurrences rather than pupils) has dropped from around 1.0 to 0.5 per 1,000 pupils since the previous Monitor (which reported 2005/06 data). The numbers of Welsh domiciled1 enrolments2 to higher education institutions (HEIs) for those aged under 25 has increased over the last nine years from 49,260 in 2000/01 to 54,985 in 2008/09. Females continue to outnumber males by 55.8% to 44.2% in 2008/09. Looked after children have considerably lower attainment rates than all pupils. 291 A student is Welsh domiciled if that student's permanent or home address prior to entry to the course is in Wales. It is not necessarily the correspondence address of the student and because length of residence at the permanent address is not captured, does not necessarily represent the country where a student received the majority of their pre-HE learning. 2 Enrolments include postgraduate, undergraduate, part-time as well as full-time enrolments.02468101214Percentage 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008Figure 4: Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) aged 16-18, Wales and England (1996-2009) 2009 (p)Wales England Year Source: Welsh Government p = provisional dataHealth, Freedom from Abuse and Exploitation Clearly, the physical, mental and emotional health of children and young people is central to an analysis of their wellbeing. Equally, lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and obesity, are known to have a potentially deleterious impact on current and future health. And, many lifestyle indicators are socially patterned, with adverse behaviours more likely among those from the least affluent backgrounds. Focusing on such information alone could be said to follow a deficits model of public health, focusing on those problems that policies need to tackle. While this deficits model is important, it should ideally be complemented by addressing assets, those factors that develop resilience and promote positive health and wellbeing, such as participating in leisure activities, enjoying a positive school environment and ease of communication with family and friends - aspects of wellbeing reported in other chapters of the Monitor. One of the most significant findings reported in the Monitor is that smoking among 15-year-olds has continued to decline since its peak in the late 1990s among both sexes, although it is more prevalent amongst girls than boys (see Figure 5). This trend can be seen across the UK and is repeated for 13-year-olds. 30Box 3: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study Most children and young people enjoyed school, deriving satisfaction variously from aspects of the curriculum, pedagogy, their peers and teachers. One concern about school was its perceived fitness for purpose in a changing world. That is, pupils demonstrated preference for practical subjects and expressed desire to have a greater focus on subjects which would help them 'get on in life'. Learning about money management was highlighted particularly by many young people as very important in the current financial climate. Stress was an issue for young people especially in relation to the demands of educational achievement and, linked to this, the prospects of securing work. Young people felt under considerable pressure to get good grades, at the same time aware that even these may not secure their future.Also declining is the proportion of 15-year-olds drinking weekly which has fallen in recent years, such that in 2009/10 approaching two in five boys (36%) and one in three girls (30%) reported drinking this often. This compares with 58% of boys and 54% of girls in 2001/02. Other key findings in relation to the health related wellbeing of children and young people in Wales are that: The dental health of 11 and 12-year-olds has improved over recent years. A considerable minority of adolescents are sexually active at age 15 or younger these figures have remained stable in recent years, while rates of chlamydia have risen among 15 to 24-year-olds. Rates of teenage pregnancy have remained stable in recent years. The rate of hospital admissions for self-harm in Wales have increased in recent years and are lower for boys than for girls, particularly among 15 to 17-year-olds. There is evidence that the suicide rate for 15 to 24-year-olds has declined in recent years, particularly among males, although the trend must be interpreted with some caution given the, thankfully, small number of suicides each year. Adolescent girls tend to rate their health less well than boys, while life satisfaction declines with age for girls but remains stable for boys. A considerable minority of children, adolescents and young adults are classified as overweight or obese. Fewer than one in three adolescents report eating fruit or vegetables daily, while less than half of older girls report eating breakfast daily. 31020406080100Percentage 1990Figure 5: Weekly smoking among 15-year-olds, Wales (1990-2009) BoysGirls Year1994 1998 2002 2006 2009 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) studyAccess to Play, Leisure, Sport and Culture Children and young people's participation in play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities can have an important role to play in improving other aspects of wellbeing such as health in the case of physical activity. It can also contribute more generally in relation to helping improve motivation and in the development of a range of skills that help children and young people's learning, development of self-identity and engagement with others. As with other areas of wellbeing, gender and socioeconomic status provide the main differences. Monitoring such aspects of children and young people's lives can help to gauge some of the broader ways in which they are growing-up. For instance, it is worth highlighting that the proportions of young people spending four or more evenings per week with friends has declined between 2005/06 and 2009/10 in all ages. The age pattern differs between boys and girls. Boys are more likely to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines than girls, for both genders this declines with age so that by the age of 15 a fifth of boys and around one in ten girls report this level of activity. On a related point, there is a gradual trend for fewer hours of teacher time being spent on extra- curricular physical education activities (see Figure 6). However the proportion of pupils taking part in club sport has increased gradually during the past 10 years. A slightly higher proportion of pupils aged 7-11 participated in regular club sport than secondary school aged children (11-16). 32Box 4: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study Children and young people were aware of the relationship between their own behaviours and health (and thus accepted some responsibility for their own health). Irrespective of age, children and young people, distinguished between healthy and unhealthy diet, although most admitted a preference for unhealthy food. Some young people compensated for unhealthy dietary behaviours by taking exercise. Very few children and young people said they currently, or had ever, smoked and smoking was generally perceived as very unhealthy and no longer 'cool'. Most young children reported that they did not like, or engage in, alcohol consumption although this was considered the norm among older (including under-age) young people, a few of whom acknowledged binge drinking. 33Arts attendance and participation have both on the whole increased in the last two years for seven to 18-year-olds with more girls than boys attending/ participating and more children and young people from higher socioeconomic groups attending/participating. Other key findings relating to access to play, leisure, sport and culture are: The number of free public swims for those aged 16 and under in Wales fell from 808,000 in 2004/05 to 569,000 in 2009/10 a drop of 29.6%. The downward trend was consistent apart from a small rise in 2008/09. Part of the decrease may be due to an increased focus on structured activity and skill development within the Free Swimming Scheme. The number of free structured swimming activities rose almost four-fold between 2004/05 and 2009/10 from 24,000 to 94,000. The proportion of young people watching TV for at least two hours each weekday evening decreased between 2005/06 and 2009/10. On the other hand, the proportions of young people using a computer for playing games and other purposes increased. Over three quarters of pupils aged 11-16 take part in extra-curricular sport and physical recreation.05101520253035Hours of extra-curricular provision per weekFigure 6: Hours of Provision Survey34Children and Young People are Listened to, Treated with Respect and have their Race and Cultural Identity Recognised The main focus of this Core Aim 5 is enabling children and young people to participate in decisions that affect them. A key assumption is that this can help to shift the 'balance of power' in relationships between children and young people and adults, such as between school staff and pupils, or between children and parents or more broadly about inclusion within an institution or community. Participation provides opportunities to change attitudes, develop new skills and develop relationships which are more equal. The key findings reported in the Monitor are: Thirty-one per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds in Wales had volunteered to help friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the past year and 20% had volunteered for an organisation. This was a higher proportion on average than the 20% of 16 to 24-year-olds who responded to a similar question from the 2008 Living in Wales survey. (see Figure 7) 2009/10 HBSC study data showed that 60% of boys and girls aged 15 in Wales said their classmates were kind and helpful. As with the previous survey, girls were more likely than boys to report that their classmates were kind and helpful. Just over a fifth of young people aged 18-24 voted in the 2007 National Assembly for Wales elections. A significantly lower proportion of young people reported voting compared to the population as a whole. Estyn found that the extent to which children and young people are able to participate in decisions about their education is improving but still varies across Wales and between education sectors. Ninety-two per cent of 14 to 25-year-olds in England and Wales felt that there were significant gaps in the services provided for them. Young people in Wales aged 16-29 were significantly more likely to be a victim of discrimination, harassment or victimisation than residents over 40.Box 5: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study Young children were attached to the areas where they lived, mostly for the people that they knew (friends and family) and for their access to contexts (including gardens, the street and parks) where they could play. Older children and teenagers' assessment of where they lived also focused upon access to friends but, those in rural areas, were often critical about the perceived absence of suitable entertainment for young people. 35Box 6: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study Young people and children, irrespective of age, perceived relationships with others as one of the most important aspects of their wellbeing. For the most part, relationships were prioritised by children and young people over material possessions. Younger children focused primarily on the importance in their lives of their parents/guardians, while older children looked to their relationships with their peers, teachers and other significant others, as well as their families. Children and young people highlighted the importance of treating others with respect, and in the same way as they wished to be treated themselves. They appeared for the most part to be tolerant of, and indeed value, difference. Hence, they accepted and welcomed opportunities to mix with others, with different experiences, backgrounds and cultures. In this sense young people appeared generally accepting and inclusive of others. A sense of identity was highlighted as very important by many young people and children. Many participants in the study said that they were proud to be Welsh, and that this engendered a sense of belonging. Equally those young people who perceived themselves as English (often being born in England and having little exposure to the Welsh language in the areas where they lived) claimed an English identity. Importantly having a strong sense of identity was not perceived as threatening towards, or by, others with alternative allegiances. For those living on the borders, identity was less well0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 7: Percentage of respondents who volunteered for an organisation, friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the last 12 months, Wales (2010) 211822283540 Volunteered for an organisation in the last 12 monthsVolunteered for friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the last 12 monthsMales 16-25 Females 16-25 All ages Source: National Survey for Wales Pilot36Safe Home and Community It has long been recognised how important it is to protect children and young adults from the physical and psychological harm that can be caused by other people - for example through crime or bullying - or by their immediate environments - for example through accidents or poor housing. The Monitor reports on how younger people in Wales are faring in respect of safety and security. The key findings reported are: Around 20% of children aged between 10-15 in GB reported being victims of crime in 2009. The numbers of children killed or seriously injured has declined since 1979, reflecting changes in children's behaviour towards the road environment and, for car occupants, trends towards safer cars (see Figure 8). Some recent data, however, shows that the numbers of pedestrian and cyclists killed or seriously injured have levelled out from 2006 onwards and so they currently comprise an increasing proportion of child casualties. Recent trends in young drivers' involvement in accidents suggest that the rates are falling more slowly than for older drivers. Comparing the period 1994-98 with 2004-08, the number of young drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 10%, but the number of older drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 17%. In 2008 around 74,000 children and young people aged 0-24 were living in overcrowded conditions. Being the victim of bullying tends to decrease with age with around 6% of 15-year-olds reporting being bullied frequently in 2009/10.clear cut and some young people struggled to locate themselves. Despite the perceived importance placed on identity and belonging, for the most part young people distanced themselves from extremist patriotic attitudes and behaviours. Most young people highlighted the importance of champions in their lives, who were adults (including parents and teachers) who would listen to them. For the most part young people said that adults filtered out what they felt were non-important issues raised by children and young people, and in some cases the ability of adults to grasp what was important to those from the younger generation, was queried. Generally children said that outside those known to them, adults (and the media) as a whole were not respectful towards children and young people.37Box 7: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study Feeling safe and secure was important for children and young people, irrespective of age. Younger children, particularly, drew on adult fears (such as the 'stranger in the paper'), and looked to parents to protect them. Young people became more aware of the contexts of safety and age as they grew older, for example, when out alone at night and in different areas of the city. Whereas parents controlled the environment of young children (for example, where they play and access to the Internet), as they aged, young people learnt to take responsibility for their own safety. Young people with children of their own, valued safe environments and close community contexts for their children, although in rural areas the downside of these was perceived as everyone knowing their business. All participants were aware of bullying issues, and many had been directly affected. Young people talked about the misery and isolation caused by abusive behaviours towards them by others, particularly at school. While adults were described as trying to address bullying, they were perceived as sometimes unable to grasp the seriousness of the problem. Partly this was because the phenomenon was perceived as more serious contemporaneously than it had been when adults were children. Bullying was described as having serious implications for young people's outcomes (including psychological wellbeing as well as educational outcomes).050100150200250Figure 8: Trends - child casualties (aged 0-15) by type of road user, index 1979=100 (1979-2009) 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 1979 1981 1983 1985 2007 2009Car user - slight Pedestrian & pedal cyclist - slight Car user - KSI Pedestrian & pedal cyclist - KSI Year Source: Welsh Government KSI = Killed or seriously injured38Poverty Poverty can affect all aspects of a child's life. These effects range from economic and material disadvantage, through to social constraint and exclusion. In addition, there are personal issues associated with stigma such as shame, sadness and the fear of being different. These effects are often more hidden. In particular, evidence shows that children and young people growing up in poverty are vulnerable in a number of different ways. They are more at risk of poor educational attainment, are more likely to have poorer health outcomes, and have lower skills and aspirations. They are also more likely to be low paid, unemployed and welfare dependent in adulthood. Key findings from the Monitor show trends over time of the levels of child poverty in Wales and the extent to which children and families in Wales are living in severe and persistent poverty. For instance, nearly one in three (32%) children in Wales - around 200,000 - now live in poverty, according to a relative income measure (see Table 2). This is one percentage point higher than that for the UK. Ten years ago, child poverty was three percentage points higher than the UK figure. In the past ten years, child poverty in Wales has fallen by four percentage points whereas for the UK the figure has fallen by two percentage points.

This decreased to 20% in the period of 2002/03 to 2004/05 and has now begun to increase in recent years, increasing to 21% in the period of 2006/07 to 2008/09. From the end of the 1990s, there was a steady reduction in the proportion of children living in workless households in Wales - and by 2006, 16.9% of children were living in workless households. In more recent years, this figure has increased - and by 2009, just under a fifth (19.9%) of children were living in workless households39 Although being in employment reduces the risk of living in poverty, recent estimates suggest that more than half of all children living in poverty are now in households where at least one person is working. Although most of these are either self-employed or working part-time. There were 50,200 people aged 16-24 unemployed in Wales in the 12 months ending June 2010. This is an unemployment rate of 21.7%, compared to the UK rate of 19.5%. Between the year to June 2009 and the year to June 2010, the youth unemployment rate in Wales increased by 3.2 percentage points - which is the fifth largest increase of the English regions and devolved administrations. Wales had the third highest youth unemployment rate of the 12 regions and devolved administrations for 16 to 24 year-olds. In the same age range, the increase in the unemployment rate was larger for men than for women. The most recent Annual Population Survey data for Wales shows that 25% of children in Wales lived in lone parent families in 2009, compared to the UK figure of 23%. The number of lone parents in employment in Wales has been steadily increasing. In 2004/06, 54.5% of lone parents were in employment. This figure increased to 55.7% by 2007/09. Box 8: Extract from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study While children and young people readily identified preferred occupations, older children were uncertain about whether these would be realised because of the economic crisis and competition for jobs. Young people were thoughtful about money and had an eye on the future. University fees were described by some young people as acting as a deterrent to the taking up of university places because of the prospects of large debts with no guarantee of employment following graduation.404141Chapter 1: An Introduction to the 2011 Monitor In 2008 the Welsh Government published the first Children and Young People's Wellbeing Monitor for Wales1. This is the second edition, the next is planned for 2014 and every three years thereafter. The Monitor is beginning to put in place important time series data on children and young people's wellbeing which can be used to track both changes and trends over time. In 2009 the Welsh Government also published its first wellbeing monitor for older people (aged 50 and over)2. Taken together these Monitors are important steps in developing our understanding of wellbeing across the course of people's lives. 1.1 What has stayed the same? The Welsh Government remains committed to the UNCRC and continues to use it as the basis of all of its policies and programmes for children and young people in Wales (see Boxes 1.1 and 1.2). Also see Appendix I for more information. This commitment will be further reinforced when the proposed 'Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure' becomes law in 20113. Wales will be the first country in the UK and one of the few in Europe to have committed to getting the convention integrated into law. The Welsh Government's seven core aims for children and young people still form the primary structure for the Monitor (see Box 1.2). The Monitor's fundamental aims remain unchanged. These are to: provide access to reliable and up-to-date information on child wellbeing in Wales, allowing the Welsh Government to monitor and respond to key trends; provide an opportunity to track the Welsh Government's cross-cutting child poverty targets within the context of child wellbeing; raise awareness of the issues that need to be tackled to secure children and young people's wellbeing; and fulfil the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) call on all state parties to publish data on children's wellbeing regularly. The Monitor is written by joint teams of Welsh Government social researchers, statisticians and economists. 4242Indicators are still reported at an all-Wales level and all indicators reported on in the first Monitor are included again. In some cases there is no change as no new data have become available. For further information on indicators see Appendix II. When possible and when appropriate the indicators are reported on across: sub-groups (such as gender, age and socioeconomic group); time; and countries. Data on the Child Poverty indicators are still reported on within the relevant chapters; however these are now tagged with a P logo. See Appendix III for further information. Box 1.1: The four general principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) The UNCRC is an international human rights treaty that grants all children and young people (aged under 18), a comprehensive set of human rights. The UK signed the convention on 19 April 1990, ratified it on 16 December 1991 and it came into force in the UK on 15 January 1992. The four general principles of the UNCRC are: non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child. For further information, see http://www.unicef.org/crc/43431.2 What is new? This time the Monitor includes data on young people up to and including the age of 25 in order to reflect the Welsh Government's policy position in relation to children and young people. Also new is the fact that the voice of children and young people themselves has been included via commissioned qualitative work (Box 1.3). Box 1.2: The Welsh Government's Seven Core Aims for Children and Young People Core Aim 1 : Every child should have a flying start in life and the best possible basis for their future growth and development (UNCRC Articles 3, 6, 29, 36). Core Aim 2 : Every child and young person should have access to a comprehensive range of education, training and learning opportunities, including the acquisition of essential person and social skills (UNCRC Articles 3, 13, 22, 28, 29, 30). Core Aim 3 : Every child should enjoy the best possible physical and mental, social and emotional health, including freedom from abuse, victimisation and exploitation (UNCRC Articles 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 19-25, 32-40 and supported by entitlements 6 and 7). Core Aim 4 : All children should have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities (UNCRC Articles 15 and 31 and supported by entitlements 8 and 9). Core Aim 5 : All children and young people should be listened to, treated with respect and have their race and cultural identity recognised (UNCRC Articles 12-15, 21, 22, 30 and supported by entitlements 3 and 10. Core Aim 6 : All children and young people should have a safe home and community which supports physical and emotional well-being (UNCRC Articles 9, 11, 16, 23 and 33). Core Aim 7 : No child or young person should be disadvantaged by poverty (UNCRC Articles 26 and 27). Source: Children and Young People: Rights to Action (2004) Welsh Government444The 2008 Monitor1 identified that: \"The scientifically based information we have on what improves and detracts from children and young people's wellbeing is critically important but we need to set this alongside children and young people's own perceptions and experiences.\" (Page 27) This approach is also supported by leading experts on children's wellbeing: \"There is a growing recognition that, if we are to further develop our knowledge about child well-being, we need to ask children directly about their understanding of well-being... (Ben-Arieh).\" (5Page 39) A more comprehensive analysis of existing evidence has also been commissioned and the findings have been used to construct the narratives of the chapters (Box 1.4). 44Box 1.3: Qualitative work A qualitative study was commissioned and was conducted by the Glyndw r University, Wrexham. The study used the Seven Core Aims to structure interviews and focus groups with 80 children, young people and parents living in Wales. However, findings from this study are not intended to be representative of all children and young people in Wales. The quotes and themes are used throughout the Monitor to provide insight into what these topics mean to children and young people in their own words. Throughout the Monitor this work is referred to as the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study. Further details on this study are provided in Appendix IV. Box 1.4: Evidence review An evidence review was commissioned and conducted by the Support Unit for Research Evidence (SURE) at Cardiff University. They searched and reviewed literature for each topic chapter (Chapters 4 -10). Before inclusion, the literature was assessed for both relevance and quality. Their findings were used to compile the narrative of the chapters. Further details on the evidence review and search strategy is provided in Appendix IV.45This time the Monitor has an ISBN, ensuring that it is more easily obtained via libraries. New indicators and sources of data have been identified and included. In part this is due to the increased age range. See Appendices II and V for full details. There are many sources of data used throughout the Monitor to populate the indicators. The majority of these are surveys. Care has been taken to ensure that these surveys are legitimate and robust and summary details about the surveys can be found in Appendix V. A stronger focus on wellbeing theories has been included in the introductory chapter (section 1.5). Findings from the Welsh Government's work on children and young people's budgeting have also been included (section 1.6). 1.3 Structure of the Monitor The Monitor is organised into three introductory chapters, seven topic chapters and six appendices. The topic chapters are based on the seven core aims of the Welsh Government for children and young people (Box 1.2). The chapters are as follows: Chapter 1: An introduction to the 2011 Monitor Chapter 2: The demographic picture of children and young people in Wales Chapter 3: Specific groups of children and young people Chapter 4: The early years Chapter 5: Access to education, training and learning opportunities Chapter 6: Health, freedom from abuse and victimisation Chapter 7: Access to play, sport, leisure and culture Chapter 8: Children and young people are listened to, treated with respect and have their race and cultural identity recognised Chapter 9: Safe home and community Chapter 10: Poverty Given the complexity and inter-related nature of these topics, presenting findings in this way can result in artificial divides. Indicators of wellbeing have been placed in the chapters where we think they best sit and have not changed from the previous Monitor to ensure consistency. Where possible chapters provide cross- references to relevant information in other chapters. 4546461.4 Policy context It is important to note that it is not the Monitor's function to comment on the effectiveness of any Welsh Government policies or interventions. However, it is important to be aware of the policy context within which the evidence in the Monitor sits. The previous Monitor provides a comprehensive Welsh policy context (Pages 3 to 52 and Appendix 4 in the 2008 Monitor1 for wider policy information)a. 1.5 Wellbeing One of the drivers for developing the 2008 Monitor was in response to the UNICEF Report Card 7 on child wellbeing which ranked the UK bottom out of 21 OECD countries on six different dimensions of wellbeing6. Recently UNICEF has published a ninth report card which looks at the issue of inequality in wellbeing. This ranked the UK 19th out of 25 OECD countries on material wellbeing, 13th on educational wellbeing and 11th on health wellbeing. It concluded that \"...Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland are leading the way in limiting how far behind the least advantaged children are allowed to fall\"7. The concept of wellbeing and its importance is not new but what is new is the increased government and policy focus of the last 10 to 15 years. Predominantly this shift has occurred with the understanding that economic prosperity, or GDP , is not enough in itself. This is often cited as the maxim that 'people are no happier than they were 50 years ago, despite increased economic prosperity'8 as well as by the 'Easterlin Paradox' which is that, once a certain level of GDP is reached, the relationship between income and reported happiness begins to plateau. However, agreeing a definition of 'wellbeing' is no easy endeavour. Indeed, there is no agreed universal definition in use. It is generally thought that wellbeing is an over-arching concept regarding the quality of people's lives. It is also 'best thought of as a dynamic process, emerging from the way in which people interact with the world around them' (Michaelson et al., 2009)9. The Welsh Government has signed up to the wellbeing definition developed by the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)10. \"...a positive physical, social and mental state; it is not just the absence of pain, discomfort and incapacity. It requires that basic needs are met, that individuals have a sense of purpose, that they feel able to achieve important personal goals and participate in society. It is enhanced by conditions that include supportive personal relationships, strong and inclusive communities, good health, financial and personal security, rewarding employment, and a healthy and attractive environment.\" a See the Welsh Government website for further details of policies - www.wales.gov.uk4747Andrews et al. (2002) define child wellbeing as follows: \"Healthy and successful individual functioning (involving physiological, psychological and behavioural levels of organisation), positive social relationships (with family members, peers, adult caregivers and community and societal institutions, for instance, school and faith and civic organisations), and a social ecology that provides safety (e.g. freedom from interpersonal violence, war and crime), human and civil rights, social justice and participation in civil society.\"5 (Page 145) As Thomas11 puts it \"Wellbeing is intangible, difficult to define and even harder to measure. This combined with the methodological issues involved in research with children and young people makes investigating children's wellbeing a challenging task.\" It is important to note that wellbeing is not necessarily the same as happiness, because anxiety, depression and anger are sometimes to be expected in life12. Childhood wellbeing is defined in many different ways but there is some emerging consensus that childhood wellbeing is multi-dimensional, should include dimensions of physical, emotional and social wellbeing; should focus on the immediate lives of children but also consider their future lives; and should incorporate some subjective as well as objective measures12. Three distinct phases have been identified in the work of measuring children's wellbeing over the last two decades, see Box 1.5. 4848A literature review conducted by the Childhood Wellbeing Research Centre12 suggests that improvements in theorising and operationalising childhood wellbeing are likely to emerge from a shared understanding that childhood wellbeing: is multi-dimensional; considers measures offering both objective and subjective perspectives on quality of life; incorporates the views and perspectives of children and young people themselves; focuses on attributes and strengths as well as difficulties and deficiencies; considers the wellbeing of children in the 'here and now' and does not focus exclusively on long-term outcomes; incorporates measures of individual physical and emotional/mental wellbeing; incorporates measures which take account of the context for children and young people's lives;Box 1.5: The development of measuring children's wellbeing Firstly there was a focus - stemming from the wider social indicators movement - on measurement and trends in child wellbeing primarily using available indicators such as child poverty rates. There was little information on the children and young people themselves and they were seen very much within the context of the family. Secondly, there has been a growing interest in measuring the constructs of children's subjective and psychological wellbeing, and in particular the former, through self-report surveys. Examples of such surveys are the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study (HBSC) and the Programme for International Assessment (PISA). This provided excellent information from children and young people themselves. Thirdly, there has been a move to develop concepts of child wellbeing taking into account the perspectives of children and young people themselves. This is trying to unpick what lies behind the indicators and questions chosen. It is felt that information can be selectively chosen and can reflect an adult agenda. What do we really know about what is important to young people and influences their wellbeing. The 2008 Monitor stopped at the second phase and this edition moves into phase three. Source: Adapted from the Children's Society (2010)94949 is considered at different stages of children and young people's lives (from in-utero through to the transition to adulthood); pays attention to culture, gender, age and other personal characteristics and how these factors may influence feelings of wellbeing as well as objective child wellbeing outcomes; is not overly focused on mainstream contexts of young people's lives - such as home and school - but also considers the wellbeing of young people who are excluded from these environments and differences across contexts. These broad definitions of wellbeing underpin the approach and the indicators contained in this Monitor. A 'basket' approach to wellbeing indicators was adopted by the 2008 Monitor and this approach is continued in this edition. The intention is that this approach provides a great deal of information on Welsh children and young people and allows them to be seen in a holistic manner. Both positive and negative as well as subjective and objective indicators of wellbeing are reported on. Objective measures are those material and social circumstances believed to foster wellbeing, and subjective measures are an individual's own assessment of their wellbeing12. Both indicators of wellbeing and well becoming are reported on. Well becoming indicators can be defined as those things which lay the foundations for wellbeing later in life5. Subjective wellbeing indicators are drawn from the HBSC study as follows: Personal wellbeing - as measured by the 'Cantril ladder' and self-defined health - this is measured by the percentage who rate their health as fair or poor. Both of these measurements are provided in Chapter 6 Health, freedom from abuse and exploitation . Wellbeing at school - as measured by the percentages who report feeling pressured by school work and reporting that they like school a lot. The second measurement is provided in Chapter 5 Access to education, training and learning opportunities . 1.6 Children and young people's budgeting The UNCRC requires state parties to report on the amount and percentage of budgets spent on children. In 2007-08 an estimated 30% of Welsh Government and local authority expenditure can be attributed to 0-17 year olds, which equates to \u00a35 billion. In the same year this age group represented 21% of the total Welsh population. An estimated 8% of Welsh Government and local authority expenditure can be attributed to 18-25 year olds, which equates to \u00a31.3 billion. In the same year this group represented 8% of the total Welsh population13.50The method which was used to attribute expenditure to different groups of the population ensures that the total for each group sums to total expenditure overall. It could be argued that this understates the benefits that accrue from the expenditure because of two main reasons. Firstly, many areas of expenditure provide benefits which go beyond the immediate recipient of the service. For example, education expenditure does not simply benefit children and young people but it has wider labour market and societal benefits. Secondly, the cost of provision of some services would be the same whether it was available to all ages or just specific ones, e.g. the provision of parks and leisure amenities13. Care should be taken in interpreting these results in addition to the practical difficulties associated with determining the level of spend on each group, outcomes are also likely to reflect a wide range of factors beyond the level of spending by the Welsh Government. UK spending is also important. The effectiveness of policies vary and there may be greater scope for beneficial outcomes to be created by spending on some groups than on others. Levels of need vary across groups, so that some groups may need less spending to achieve equal outcomes. Outcomes may be influenced by policies that do not require higher levels of spending e.g. laws and regulations, the tax system and approaches which seek to change behaviour. Lastly, income is likely to be redistributed within households so that the ultimate beneficiaries of spending may not be the same as the immediate recipients13. In conclusion, it is expected that an advanced and prosperous society should invest in its children and young people which should in turn have beneficial impacts for them. However, it is not clear how much and what proportion of total spending this investment should be. 1.7 Update on the information gaps identified from 2008 An important feature of the 2008 Monitor1 was that each chapter based on one of the core aims identified key information gaps. Since the 2008 edition, work has been done to address some of these gaps. Elsewhere these gaps remain, and require continued work and commitment from all relevant stakeholders. In compiling this edition of the Monitor, chapter authors have identified some additional gaps. More information on the key information gaps is provided in Appendix VI. A key overarching information gap is a detailed breakdown on many wellbeing indicators for children and young people from minority ethnic groups and children and young people with disabilities. 505151The 2008 edition proposed to \"...explore how the Welsh Assembly Government could more systematically collect information on the views and experiences of children and young people, including their views on public services.\" (1Page 29) Since then a module for children was included as part of the pilot for the new National Survey for Wales. Unfortunately response rates for the children's module were low and so not usable for robust estimates. However work is continuing to establish how the Welsh Government can address this important information gap and develop the evidence base. 5252References 1.

In particular it focuses on: the number of children; schools Ethnicity; and Migration.Key Findings There are approximately 962,000 children and young people in Wales aged 0-25. The number of births continues to rise and, in 2009, 34,900 babies were born in Wales. Death rates among 0-19 year olds in Wales continue to fall and, in 2009, there were 291 deaths, which is a rate of 40.8 per 100,000 population. The population of people aged 0-25 is projected to decrease by 2.5% to 937,700 by mid-2020. As in recent years, the numbers of pupils of statutory school age (5-15 years) in maintained schools decreased but rose among the under-fives and the 16-19+ years age groups. The level of Welsh language ability has not changed since the last edition of the Monitor with 13% of primary and 16% of secondary school children fluent speakers. The vast majority of school children aged five and over are white British (91.8%). 542.1 The number of children living in Wales1 In mid-2009, according to official population estimates, the population of Wales was 2,999,300, almost 5% of the UK population. Those aged 0-25 numbered 962,100, or 32.1%, which was roughly the same as the UK figure (32.2%). Table 2.1: Age structure, UK and constituent countries Age group 0-4 5-11 12-17 18-25 26-64 65+ United Kingdom 6.1 7.8 7.3 10.9 51.5 16.4 Wales 5.7 7.7 7.6 11.1 49.6 18.3 England 6.2 7.8 7.3 10.9 51.6 16.3 Scotland 5.6 7.4 7.1 10.8 52.4 16.7 Northern Ireland 6.8 9.0 8.4 11.6 49.9 14.2 Source: Mid-year population estimates (2009), Office for National Statistics The age structure of Wales and the other UK countries in mid-2009 is provided in Table 2.1. It shows that Wales had a lower proportion of children aged 0-4 (5.7%) than the UK as a whole, despite an increase in births in Wales since 2002. The population of 18-25 year olds in Wales (11.1%) was slightly higher than the UK as a whole, and second highest after Northern Ireland. The Welsh local authority with the highest proportion of people aged 0-25 in mid-2009 was Cardiff with 38.6%. This was a result of a high number of people aged 18-25 in Cardiff (61,500), which was almost double the figure for the second highest local authority, Swansea, with 32,300 people aged 18-25. This is mainly due to students migrating in to attend higher education institutions in Cardiff. The authorities with the lowest proportion of people aged 0-25 were Conwy and Powys at 27.6%. These authorities tend to experience high proportions of people aged 65 and over. Ceredigion was the local authority with the lowest proportion of children aged 0-4 at 4.2% (3,200). Future trends Population projections provide estimates of the size of the future population, and are based on assumptions about births, deaths and migration. These assumptions are based on past trends. Figure 2.1 shows the projected population for selected age groups in Wales over the next 15 years. The number of people aged 0-25 in Wales increased by 2.9% from 934,900 in mid-2001 to 962,100 in mid-2009. The population of people aged 0-25 is projected to decrease by 2.5% to 937,700 by mid-2020, before increasing slightly from here until mid-2023.55The 0-4 age group is projected to increase by 5.2% until mid-2021 and, despite an initial decline in the 5-11 age group, the population is projected to increase by 10.5% from mid-2011 to mid-2023. The projected population increase in these age groups may be due to a projected increase in births from 34,700 in mid-2011/12 to 35,800 in mid-2018/19a. The population of the 12-17 age group is projected to decline until mid-2017, reaching 199,400 before increasing from here onwards as a result of a cohort effect, as the increase projected in the 5-11 age group gradually feeds into the 12-17 age group. The population of 18-25 year olds is projected to decline by 13.1% from 332,700 in mid-2009 to 289,300 in mid-2023. Eight local authorities are projected to experience population growth in the 0-25 age group between mid-2009 and mid-2023. Cardiff is projected to see the greatest increase in the 0-25 population between mid-2009 and mid-2023, with a 12.1% rise, while Torfaen is projected to experience the greatest decline at 11.2%. Cardiff is also projected to experience the largest growth in the groups aged 0-4, 5-11 and 12-17 from mid-2009 to mid-2023. In line with the Wales projection, all local authorities are projected to see a decrease in the 18-25 age group between mid-2009 and mid-2023, varying from a 5.9% decline in Ceredigion to 29.1% in Merthyr Tydfil. Figure 2.2 sets the population aged 0-25 of each UK country to a base of 100 and shows how the population of each country changes relative to this base over the projection period. a That is all the births which are projected during the mid-year to mid-year period.050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000400,000 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 202318-255-11 12-170-4PopulationFigure 2.1 Projected population by age group in Wales (mid-2001 to mid-2023) Year Source: Mid-year population estimates and 2008-based national projections, Office for National Statistics56England shows the highest percentage growth in the UK, with Scotland being the lowest. Between mid-2009 and mid-2023, the population of 0-25 year olds in England is projected to increase by 3.3%. The population trend seen for those aged 0-25 in England is very similar to the UK trend. The population of 0-25 year olds is projected to decrease in Wales for the first ten years of the projection period (a 2.5% decrease by mid-2020), before increasing from there on. Northern Ireland and Scotland show similar trends to Wales for the projected population aged 0-25, with a projected decrease of 4.5% in Scotland and a projected decrease of 2.9% in Northern Ireland from mid-2009 to mid-2023. 2.2 Schools and pupils2 In January 2010 there were 25 nursery, 1,462 primary, 223 secondary and 43 special schools in Wales. Of these, 29% of primary schools (428) and 15% of secondary schools (34) were classified as Welsh medium. There were 64 independent schools. The total number of pupils (headcount) in local authority maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools was 467,141. As in recent years, the numbers of pupils of statutory school age (5-15 years) in maintained schools, decreased but rose among the under-fives and the 16-19+ years age groups. 2.3 Household characteristics Table 2.2 gives an idea of the type of family in which children in Wales live.889092949698100102104106108110 England UK Wales Northern IrelandPopulation 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023Figure 2.2: Indexed chart of people aged 0-25, UK constituent countries (mid-2001 to mid 2003) Scotland Year Source: Mid-year population estimates and 2008-based national projections, Office for National Statistics57Table 2.2: Dependent children aged 18 or under, by type of family unit in which they live, Wales (2009) Family Unit Number Married couple 374,100 Cohabiting couple 98,900 Lone parent 166,600 Total* 639,800 Source: Annual Population Survey (APS) * Includes civil partnerships, however the number is too small to quote separately 2.4 Births and deaths of children in Wales Approximately 34,900 babies were born in Wales in 20091. In the last Monitor it was reported that the most popular names for babies born in Wales were Jack and Megan. Jack has remained the most popular name but Megan has been replaced by Olivia3. In 2009, 291 children and young people resident in Wales (aged 0 to 19) died. This is a rate of 40.8 per 100,000 population, which has been falling over the past decade (see Table 2.3 and Figure 2.3). Table 2.3: Number of deaths of Welsh residents aged 0 to 19 (1998-2009) 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 358 382 346 312 283 267 316 290 280 337 277 291 Source: Office for National Statistics582.5 Welsh language According to the 2001 Census, 21% of the population in Wales could speak Welsh. Among those aged three to 19 the figure was 35%. In 2009/10 in terms of the ability of school children (aged five to 15) to speak Welsh, 8% of primary school pupils and 9% of secondary school pupils spoke Welsh fluently at home. A further 5% of primary school pupils and 7% of secondary school pupils do not speak Welsh at home but are fluent. This level of Welsh language ability has not changed since the last edition of the Monitor2. 2.6 Ethnicity In local authority maintained schools, 91.8% of pupils, aged five and over, were classified as white British, 6.9% were of minority ethnic origin and 1.3% were unknown or not stated2. 0102030405060Rate 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006Figure 2.3: Death rate of Welsh residents aged 0 to 19 (per 100,000 population) (1996-2009) 2009 2008 2007 Year Source: Office for National Statistics59Data from the 2007 Population Estimates by Ethnic Group show that 95.9% of people aged 0-15 years in Wales were White, compared to 84.9% in England and Wales. For people in Wales aged 0-15 years the proportion categorising themselves as Mixed was twice as high as for all people in Wales and almost ten times as high as for people of pensionable age in Wales. At local authority level, Cardiff and Newport had the highest levels of minority ethnic groups. 2.7 Migration This section provides an analysis of the migration trends of young people in Wales1. Net migration is a key driver for population growth in Wales. In mid-2009, although the number of births exceeded the number of deaths in Wales for the fourth successive year, net migration still contributed around 2,600 more people to the population than natural change. However the age profile of the migrants is an important factor to consider, as high numbers of females of fertility age migrating into the local authority may result in higher birth numbers and further population growth. If the age profile of migrants tends to be older, for example, then the effect of migration may not be so significant. Estimates of long-term international migration to the UK are based on the International Passenger Survey. This survey includes a small number of international Figure 2.4: Pupils aged ve or over attending primary, secondary and special schools in Wales by ethnic background (2009/10)* White British Traveller of Irish Heritage Gypsy/Roma Any other White background Mixed Asian0.1%1.4%0.6% 0.2% 0.8% 1.3% 91.8%1.9% Black Chinese Any other ethnic group1.8% Unknown or not stated0.1% Source: Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) * At January. Ages at 31 August.60migrants to and from Wales, so it is not possible to provide a breakdown of international migrants by age and gender. Estimates of movements within the UK are based on information from GP registrations, which are adjusted by Higher Education Statistical Agency data to improve estimates of student moves. Internal migration estimates are available by broad age group. Table 2.4 shows the average annual inflow, outflow and the corresponding net and total flows of migrants between Wales and the UK. It also shows the migration turnover rate, which is a measure of frequency of migration movements within the population. The rate of movement is highest for the 20-24 group, indicating people moving away to or from university or to find work. This is followed by the 15-19 group which also contains students moving to or from university. Total flows and turnover rates are considerably lower for the younger age groups. Net migration for the 20-24 age group is negative, indicating that around 2,400 people are moving from Wales to other parts of the UK. These may be students returning home after their studies, or students seeking work in other areas of the UK.

Figure 2.5 shows the average annual net migration flows with England to five regions in Wales by broad age group. North Wales attracted the largest average net inflows of migrants aged 0-15 from England with an average net of around 490 people, while South East Wales attracted the lowest average net inflows of people aged 0-15 with an average net of around 150 people.61All regions except for South East Wales saw an average net outflow of people aged 16-24 to England; these outflows are likely to be a result of students moving to attend higher education institutions. South East Wales saw an average net inflow of around 650 people aged 16-24 into the region, likely to be students migrating in to attend university. However, South East Wales was the only region to experience an average net outflow of people aged 25-44, with an average of around 360 people migrating out of the region to England. This could be a result of students moving from South East Wales back home or seeking work elsewhere. -600-400-20002004006008001,0001,2001,400Figure 2.5: Average annual net migration flows with England by age group (based on estimates from year ending mid-2005 to year ending mid-2009) 0-15 16-24 25-44 North Wales45-64 65+ Mid Wales South West Wales South East Wales Valleys Source: International migration estimates, Office for National Statistics62References 1.

In particular the chapter considers: looked after children; unaccompanied asylum seeking children; Gypsy Traveller children; children with disabilities; pupils with special educational needs; children and young people living with disabled adults; young carers; children in need;Key Findings The number of looked after children has increased by 44% over the last decade. 14,128 pupils in schools in Wales have statements of SEN, this figure continues the recorded drop since 2000/01. The proportions of pupils in local authority maintained schools known to be eligible for FSM increased between 2009 and 2010 by just over 1% in primary schools and just under 1% in secondary schools. There are 150,616 children and young people aged 0-18 years living with a disabled parent. There are 933 young carers (aged under 18) known to social services. There are around 25,000 children in need. In 2009/10, the majority of16-24 year olds in Wales (94.9%) identified themselves as heterosexual or straight and 2.8% identified themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other. 1.3% didn't respond to the question and a further 1% refused to answer the question. There are around 59,000 children and young people in Wales aged 18 and under living in households with at least four dependent children aged 19 and under. 64 children and young people in custody; children living in large families. In addition, since the 2008 edition of the Monitor the following sections have been added: children living in families where there is domestic violence; children with parents who are in prison; young people who are gay or lesbian; children in receipt of free school meals. 3.1 Looked after children According to the Children Act 1989, looked after children is the term used to describe all children who are the subject of a care order, or who are provided with accommodation on a voluntary basis for more than 24 hours. On 31 March 2010, 5,162 childrena were looked after, an increase of 10% over the previous year and a rate of 82 per 100,000 population aged under 18. The number of looked after children has increased by 44% over the last decade. The majority of these children in 2010 - 78% or 4,049 - were in foster-care placements. a This figure does not take into account the 224 children who were being looked after at 31 March 2010 for respite purposes01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000NumberFigure 3.1: Number of looked after children in Wales at 31 March (1997-2010) Year1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Source: Welsh Government65The reasons for children starting to be looked after were1: abuse or neglect (59%); family in acute stress or dysfunction (24%); parental illness, disability or absence (10%); socially unacceptable behaviour (5%); other (2%). 3.2 Unaccompanied asylum seeking children As of September 2010, Wales had 93 unaccompanied asylum seeking children that the UK Border Agency supported. This figure does not include those unaccompanied asylum seeking children for whom local authorities receive no grant from the UK Border Agency forb. 3.3 Gypsy Traveller children Limited information is collected about Gypsy Traveller communities in Wales. According to the January 2010 bi-annual Gypsy Traveller Caravan Count, there were 694 caravans across 50 sites. The 2009/10 Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) recorded 160 pupils aged over five in primary schools who were 'Travellers of Irish heritage' and 265 who were Gypsy or Roma. For secondary schools 34 'Travellers of Irish heritage' were recorded and 146 Gypsy or Roma. This is a total of 605 Gypsy Traveller children recorded for both primary and secondary schools. Both the caravan count and the PLASC are likely to underestimate the numbers of Gypsy Traveller children in Wales. 3.4 Children with disabilities The most up-to-date figures on those children and young people who report having a limiting long-standing illness (LLSI) is available from the 2009 Welsh Health Survey. This found that 6% of children aged under 16 have an LLSI. The Welsh Health Survey also provides information for those aged 16-24, 7% reported a limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Both LLSI and LLTI can be used as proxies for disability. For the year ending 31 March 2010, 1,219 children aged under 18 in Wales were registered as having a physical or sensory disability. There are no Welsh figures for the numbers of children with disabilities according to the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). b Figure provided by the UK Border Agency based on returns from local authorities.663.5 Pupils with special educational needs (SEN) The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice for Wales describes children with special educational needs if they: a) have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of the same age; b) have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of educational facilities of a kind generally provided for children of the same age in schools within the area of the local education authority; c) are under compulsory school age and fall within the definition at a) or b) above or would so do if special educational provision was not made for them. Under the Education Act 1996, a local authority must provide a statement on the special educational needs of any child who has been assessed as requiring special educational provision. In January 2010, 14,128 pupils in schools in Wales had statements of SEN. This continues the fall in pupils with a statement of SEN since 2000/01 that was reported in the 2008 Monitor. The 2010 figure is 1,472 lower than that reported in the last Monitorc.

In Wales in 2009/10, there were 933 young carers (aged under 18) known to social services3. 3.8 Children in need The term 'children in need' has a specific meaning under the Children Act 1989, which places a statutory duty on local authorities to 'safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in need'. The Act defines a child in need as one who is unlikely to achieve or maintain, or have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining, a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision of services by a local authority. In addition to children looked after and on the Child Protection Register, children may be in need and receiving social services for other reasons, such as having a disability or being a young carer providing substantial care to a family member. Table 3.2: Number of children in need receiving services in Wales (2005-2010) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 23,600 23,800 24,200 23,600 24,900 25,000 Source: Welsh Government Table 3.2 shows that the numbers of children in need in Wales have been gradually rising over time. The first Welsh Children in Need census has recently been carried out and the results will provide greater detail on these children. It will also provide important comparisons of their outcomes with that of the general population4. 3.9 Children and young people in custody The age of criminal responsibility in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is ten. It is currently eight in Scotland but legislation, including proposals to raise the age to 12, is currently being discussed at committee stage5. Ministry of Justice figures reveal that, by the end of April 2010, there were 2,116 children under 18 in custody in England and Wales. Of these 1,707 were held in young offender institutions, 249 in secure training centres and 160 in secure children's homes. 68Many of these have a background of social exclusion, have previous contact with social services, have previously been homeless, have special educational needs, have been excluded from school and have mental health problems. According to Ministry of Justice figures, at the end of April 2010, there were 10,004 young people aged 18-20 in prison in England and Wales. Among these young people both mental health and drug and alcohol abuse are common5. 3.10 Children living in large families Table 3.3 shows that there are around 59,000 young people in Wales aged 18 and under living in households with at least four dependent children aged 19 and under. Table 3.3: Children living in larger households in Wales (2009) NumberProportion of total Households in Wales with four dependent children* aged under 1911,300 0.9 Households in Wales with five or more dependent children aged under 192,700 0.2 Persons aged under 18 living in households with four dependent children aged under 1944,900 7.2 Persons aged under 18 living in households with five or more dependent children aged under 1914,100 2.3 Source: Annual Population Survey * Dependent children are all those aged 0-15 and those aged 16-18 who are in full-time education. 3.11 Children living in families where there is domestic violence For the 12-month period up until the end of June 2010, 3,392 cases across Wales were referred to the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC)d. A total of 4,219 children and young people were identified as being involved in these cases. According to figures from Welsh Women's Aid, there were 1,044 children accommodated in a refuge in 2009/10 due to domestic abuse in the home. d The MARAC aims to make the victim and their children safe from ongoing abuse.693.12 Children with parents who are in prison Routine figures for this are not easy to find. However, some figures for England and Wales are published by the Prison Reform Trust which included5: Ministry of Justice figures showing an estimated 160,000 children with a parent in prison each year. Home Office research showing 66% of women and 59% of men in prison with dependent children under 18. An estimated 283 children were born to female prisoners in England and Wales between April 2005 and July 2008, a rate of almost two a week. 3.13 Young people who are gay or lesbian Figures are available on young people's sexual identity. According to the Integrated Household Survey (2009/10), 94.9% of 16-24 year olds identified themselves as heterosexual or straight, 2.8% identified themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other, 1.3% didn't respond to the question and a further 1% refused to answer the questione. 3.14 Free school meals Pupils in receipt of free school meals (FSM) are commonly used as a proxy measure of disadvantage. Figures for 2010 indicate an increase in the proportions of pupils in local authority maintained schools known to be eligible for FSM in 2009. The percentage of pupils of compulsory school age in maintained schools, known to be eligible for FSM in 2009 and 2010, is shown in Table 3.4. Table 3.4: Percentage of pupils eligible for FSM, Wales (2009-2010) 2009 2010 Primary schools 18.8 20.1 Secondary schools 16.3 17.1 Special schools 39.5 42.0 Source: Welsh Government e Total sample was 368,140. 'Don't know' and 'refusal' is a response that was provided by the respondent spontaneously. Interviewers were advised to code as refusal instances where a respondent did not volunteer an answer to the question but reacted in a way indicating embarrassment or offence, such as total silence. 'No response' refers to where an eligible responder did not provide any response to the question, this could be for a number of reasons, i.e. the interviewers were unable to ask the question.References 1.

Core Aim 1 seeks to provide a 'flying start in the early years of a child's life and the best possible basis for future growth and development'.Key Findings The infant mortality rate continues to fall and in 2009 was 4.8 per 1,000 births. Since 2000, the proportion of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies has remained relatively stable, except for a dip in 2005. In 2009, the percentage of babies with a LBW was 7.3%. Of children aged 4-7, 73% eat fruit daily and 57% eat vegetables daily. For seven-year-olds the highest cognitive scores were for children of graduate mothers and those from families in the top income groups. Boys are more likely than girls to have special educational needs and this is particularly pronounced for behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and speech, language and communication difficulties. Sixty-eight per cent of seven-year-olds report having 'lots of friends'. The uptake rate being immunised against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) continues to increase a of 80% in 2003-04. During 2009-10, 92% of two-year-olds had been immunised against MMR. In 2010 the proportion of pupils achieving at least level two (the expected level) in the Core Subject Indicator (CSI) in the National Curriculum was 81.6%. This was the highest level of achievement recorded over the last ten years. Girls out-performed boys in all subjects in the CSI, although recently this gender gap has been decreasing slightly each year. 73The chapter provides an insight into the wellbeing of children from pre-birth to seven years in terms of key health, education and social related indicators. Specifically, the chapter reports on: physical health; well nourished at birth and through the early years; developmental milestones; special needs in early years; good and secure attachments in early years. 4.1 Physical health Being healthy at birth and through the early years is one of the most important indicators of the wellbeing of children. Measuring the health of young children can be undertaken in a number of different ways and many of the key indicators reported here incorporate those used by UNICEF, including low birth weight; infant mortality rate and childhood immunisation. Low birth weight Birth weight is an important determinant for future health and low birth weight (LBW) is associated with adverse outcomes in terms of poor health and education1. Babies born weighing less than 2,500g are at risk of deficits in growth, cognitive development, diabetes and heart disease2. There is also evidence that very low birth weight babies (those weighing less than or equal to 1,500g) are at an increased risk of learning difficulties later on in life3. The proportion of babies being born with a LBW (less than 2,500g) in Wales has increased since the early 1990s. Between 1993 and 2000, the proportion rose from 6.3% to 7.5%. Since 2000, the proportion has remained relatively stable, except for a dip in 2005. In 2009, the percentage of babies with a LBW was 7.3%.74LBW is caused by either a short gestation period or retarded intrauterine growth, or a combination of both. Many factors contribute to the incidence of LBW and it is commonly associated with maternal factors such as poor general health, poor education, poor nutrition, smoking and alcohol consumption, both pre- conceptually and during pregnancy1. Multiple births also contribute to the incidence of LBW. These have risen in recent years with the increased use of assisted conception by mothers. However, the recent increase in LBW is only partially accounted for by multiple births4. Maternal age is also a factor as older and younger mothers are more likely to have an LBW baby and therefore the increase in LBW may be influenced by the high levels of teenage pregnancy in Wales, alongside an increasing number of older mothers. There is also a strong association between LBW and deprivation. Wales has a 2020 child poverty target to reduce LBW amongst babies born in the most deprived fifth of the population to no more than 7.3% and achieve a ratio of LBW proportions between the most deprived and the middle fifth of the population of no more than 1.12 (12% higher). For the period 2005-07, the proportion of LBW babies was 8.9% in the most deprived fifth of the population and 7.2% in the middle fifth. The ratio has fallen slightly to 1.23 since the last reporting period (2003-05) when it was 1.29.012345678Percentage weighing less than 2,500gFigure 4.1: Percentage of liveborns weighing less than 2,500 grams, Wales (1993-2009) Year1993 1994 1995 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 1996 1997 1998 1999 Source: Birth Statistics, Office for National Statistics P75Perinatal mortality rate The perinatal mortality ratea has fluctuated between seven and eight per 1,000 live and stillbirths over the past ten years, but is showing a downward slight trend, with the 2009 rate at 7.4 per 1,000 live and stillbirths, compared to 7.8 in 1999. Neonatal mortality rate As with the perinatal mortality rate, the neonatal mortality rateb has fluctuated over the past ten years. The neonatal mortality rate in 2009 was 3.1 per 1,000 live and stillbirths, compared to 4.1 in 1999. Birth defects, prematurity and other conditions arising during pregnancy are the principal factors contributing to neonatal mortality in developed countries5. Infant mortality rate The infant mortality ratec is a basic indicator for population health, signifying the quality of perinatal and infant care. There has been an overall decrease in Wales' infant mortality rate over the last ten years, although it has also fluctuated over this period and 2009 saw an increase. In 2009, Wales' infant mortality rate was 4.8 per 1,000 live births. This is part of a wider trend over the last 40 years, during which infant mortality has been declining in Wales. This decrease has been attributed to 'improved living conditions, diet and sanitation, birth control, advances in medical science and the availability of healthcare'7. a The number of stillbirths plus the number of liveborn babies who die during the first seven days of life per 1,000 live births and stillbirths. b Deaths of infants under four weeks of age per 1,000. c The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age in a given year, expressed per 1,000 livebirths.0123456789Perinatal mortality rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births Neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live birthsMortality rateFigure 4.2: Perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality rates, Wales (1999-2009) Year1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Source: Welsh Government676Around two-thirds of the deaths that occur during the first year of life are neonatal. With an increasing number of women deferring childbearing and the rise in multiple births linked with fertility treatments, the number of preterm births has risen. This increases the risk of neonatal death and appears to have contributed to a levelling off of the downward trend in infant mortality rates over the past few years. The principal causes of death in the post-neonatal period include accidents and infections, which are often preventable and the infant mortality rate is more highly correlated with social factors than the neonatal mortality rate8. Figure 4.3 compares the infant mortality rate in Wales with other European countries. There is a correlation between socioeconomic deprivation and infant mortality. In 2004-08, the infant mortality rate in the most deprived fifth of areas in Wales was 5.65 per 1,000 live births. This compares with a rate of 3.53 in the least deprived fifth of areas. The ratio between the most and least deprived fifths was 1.6 during 2004-08. The Welsh Government child poverty target to reduce the infant mortality rate states, that the rate for the most deprived fifth of the population will be no more than 4.12 per 1,000 live births by 2020; and that the ratio of infant mortality rates between the most deprived and least deprived fifths of the population will be no more than 1.3 (30% higher). There is a correlation between infant mortality rates and LBW. 2009 data for England and Wales, shows that, for very LBW and LBW babies, the infant mortality rates were 175.9 and 38.3 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively, compared with 02468101214Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live birthsFigure 4.3: Infant mortality in the European Union (2009) Slovenia Sweden Luxembourg Finland Czech Republic Denmark Greece IrelandCyprus Belgium Spain Germany Estonia Portugal Netherlands Austria France United Kingdom Wales Lithuania Hungary Malta Poland Slovakia Latvia Bulgaria RomaniaItaly2.4 2.5 2.52.62.93.1 3.1 3.2 3.33.4 3.4 3.53.6 3.6 3.73.8 3.8 3.94.54.84.95.15.35.65.77.89.010.1 EU Country Source: Eurostat P77a rate of 1.5 among babies of normal birth weight9. Around half of infant deaths occurred among very LBW babies. There is also a correlation between gestation and birth weight. In 2009, 93% of live births to Welsh residents took place at 37 weeks gestation or more. The majority of these had a birth weight of over 2,500g. However 98% of premature births (after gestations of less than 32 weeks) and 56% of those born at 32-36 weeks have low birth weights (less than 2,500g). Congenital anomalies The Welsh Congenital Anomaly Register and Information Service (CARIS) provides reliable data on congenital anomalies in Wales. Between 1998 and 2008, the gross rated of congenital anomalies reported in Wales was 5%. Data from CARIS has identified the factors that can be shown to affect anomaly rates. These include maternal risk factors such as age and smoking. There is also an association with socioeconomic deprivation, particularly for non-chromosomal anomalies. Immunisation Childhood immunisation is one of the most effective preventive health measures10. Communicable diseases such as polio, measles and pertussis (whooping cough) - which are preventable with immunisation - can cause death or long-term health problems. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends immunity levels of around 95% to prevent outbreaks of disease. Of children in Wales who reached their first birthday by 31 March 2010, 96% had received all three doses of the combined '5 in 1' DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccinee. mumps and rubella (MMR). The uptake rate continues to increase from a low of 80% in 2003-04. The uptake pattern across the UK countries, between 1998 and 2009, shows that the uptake rate in Wales has recovered at a faster rate than in England, although Scotland had the highest level of MMR immunisation at the end of 2009-10. National uptake of a completed two dose course of MenCf vaccine in children reaching their first birthday by March 2010 was 95.5%. A similar proportion (95.6%) had received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV)g. There is evidence to suggest that certain groups of children are at risk of low uptake of immunisations - for example, children in care, those with physical or d The gross rate includes all cases of anomaly recorded as miscarriages, terminations of pregnancy, live and stillborn babies, per 10,000 live and stillbirths. e DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). f Men C vaccine protects against meningitis caused by meningococcus group C infection. g PCV protects against pneumococcal meningitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia and otitis media.78learning difficulties, those with lone parents, hospitalised children, those not registered with a GP , and those from minority ethnic groups11. Dental health The decayed, missing or filled teeth (dmft/DMFTh) score is the standard measurement of tooth decay. The average dmft score for five-year-olds in Wales in 2007/08 was 1.98. There is a significant difference in dmft scores between children living in the most deprived areas of Wales (2.65) and those in the least deprived areas (1.16). Due to a change in survey procedures, it is not possible to present a time series of dmft scores or make UK comparisonsi. Limiting long-standing illness (LLSI) LLSI is a widely used measure of health status. According to the Welsh Health Survey (WHS), 4% of children aged seven and under in Wales had an LLSI and 18% of children aged seven and under had a long-standing illness. General health The WHS includes a measure of children's general health. In 2009, 95% of children under seven were described as being in 'good or very good general health'. h dmft/DMFT relate to deciduous and permanent teeth respectively. i In 2006 new guidance was issued to the NHS requiring positive parental consent for dental surveys of children in primary school settings. The changed consent arrangements resulted in participation of about 55% of children compared with 85-90% in previous surveys. The low response rate for the 2007/08 survey indicates a strong non-response bias, which has impacted on the reported dmft indices. There is now a distinction between dmft collected before 2006 and dmft collected after 2006 (via positive consent); these are two separate indicators and therefore it is not possible to undertake any trend analyses - until new dmft data is collected from future surveys.0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0Mean dmft score 1 (most deprived)Figure 4.4: Average dmft scores for ve-year-old children by material deprivation, Wales (2007/08) 2 3 4 5 (least deprived) Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) Quintile2.65 2.04 1.77 1.56 1.16 Source: British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry Survey (BASCD)P79Asthma is the most common condition experienced by young children. The WHS found that 7% of children under seven were currently being treated for asthma and this is a similar proportion to previous years. Combined data from the WHS (2007, 2008 and 2009) show a correlation between children living in the most deprived areas and a higher occurrence of asthma, both as a long-standing illness and as an illness that is currently being treated, (although the differences are not statistically significant). Results for Wales from the fourth sweep of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) when the children were seven-years-old shows that 8% of children had had some time off school during the school year. There was a significant difference between children who experience poverty and others - 11% of children who have experienced poverty had been off school during the school year compared with 5% not in poverty at either the third or fourth survey. Maternal smoking and drinking This section considers the various effects that maternal smoking and alcohol consumption can have on the developing baby and young child, including LBW, asthma and other developmental concerns. The 2008 Monitor showed that over a third (37%) of Welsh mothers smoked before or during their pregnancy. It included data from the 2005 Infant Feeding Survey (IFS) that showed that women with lower education, income and 0246810Percentage 1 (most deprived)Figure 4.5: Asthma in children aged 0-7 by material deprivation, Wales (2007-2009 combined) 2 3 4 5 (least deprived)Asthma - currently treatedAsthma - long-standing illness Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) Quintile69 58 36 46 35 Source: Welsh Health Survey (WHS) * Please note these differences are not statistically significant80employment status, and those aged under 20, were far more likely to continue to smoke during pregnancy. Maternal smoking can directly impact on the health of the developing baby and young child. Although the incidence of LBW is twice as high among smokers as non smokers12, there is evidence that LBW babies often show greater 'catch-up growth' than normal-weight infants13. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with future offspring obesity and overweight14. This study showed an increased risk of obesity at a mean age of nine years in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. In addition, confounders of maternal obesity, low social status, low birth weight and not being breastfed seemed to be risk factors for offspring obesity. The effects of maternal smoking on the young child continue beyond those identified during pregnancy. UK data from the MCS shows an association between mothers' current smoking and children's asthma at age seven. Almost 20% of children whose mother smoked had experienced asthma, compared to 15% where mothers did not smoke. The effects of tobacco smoke are not restricted to active maternal smoking. There is evidence that passive smoking also increases the risk of LBW15. In terms of alcohol consumption, the 2008 Monitor showed that 55% of Welsh mothers drank during pregnancy. Across the UK, older mothers were the most likely to drink during pregnancy. Data from the 2005 IFS showed that 47% of mothers aged under 20 drank alcohol during pregnancy compared to 61% of mothers over 35 or older. Mothers from managerial and professional occupation groups were also more likely to drink alcohol during pregnancy than other socioeconomic groups. 0102030405060708090100Percentage who drank alcohol during pregnancy Under 20Figure 4.6: Drinking behaviour during pregnancy by mother's age, UK (2005) 20-24 25-29 30-34 All mothers 35 or over Age Group47 48 496061 54 Source: Infant Feeding Survey (IFS)81There is consensus that heavy drinking during pregnancy has damaging effects on the central nervous system of the unborn child, leading to delayed mental development and later behavioural problems16. The damage prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause depends on the level of consumption, the pattern of exposure and the stage of pregnancy during which it is consumed17. However, the evidence on the impact of low to moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy on children's later cognitive and socioemotional development is unclear18. Recent research, tracking MCS babies up to the age of five, has found no evidence to suggest that the behavioural or intellectual development of children whose mothers were light drinkers during their pregnancy (one or two units a week or at any one occasion) had been compromised. Furthermore these children were 30% less likely to have behavioural problems than those whose mothers who did not drink during pregnancy. The study also found evidence for the harmful effect of heavy drinking (seven or more units a week or six at one sitting) during pregnancy. In these cases, the children were more likely to be hyperactive and have issues with their peers and girls were more likely to have emotional issues19. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to serious damage in the form of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in some cases20.The number of hospital admissions for babies born with conditions relating to maternal substance use including FAS in Wales increased by 10% (n=9) in 2009 following a gradual decrease over the previous three years. Figure 4.7 illustrates this trend, although it should be noted that determining the incidence of FAS across the UK is complicated by a lack of reliable and consistent data collection20. 020406080100Number of babies 2005Figure 4.7: Number of hospital admissions for babies born with conditions related to maternal subtance misuse including FAS, Wales (2005-2009) 2006 2007 2008 200953 58 54 50 5342 41 30 31 37Primary diagnosisAny mention of Year Source: Patient Episode Database Wales (PEDW)824.2 Well nourished at birth and through the early years Breastfeeding Breastmilk is the optimal diet for infants, and research continues to strengthen this position. An extensive body of evidence supports the consensus that not breastfeeding increases the risk of illness in both mothers and infants. Formula-fed babies are more likely to develop a number of conditions including gastro-intestinal, respiratory and urinary tract infections21,22. Blood pressure, total cholesterol, the prevalence of overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes are lower among breastfed babies21. Government policy across the UK has consistently supported breastfeeding as important in the promotion of maternal and infant health and it is recommended that babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months. The 2005 IFS is the most reliable and recent source of data on breastfeeding across the UK. It is a major source of information about how infants are fed and provides national figures on the incidence, prevalence and duration of breastfeeding and other feeding practices adopted by mothers. A further survey took place during 2010 but data were not available for the 2011 Monitor. According to the IFS, the breastfeeding initiation ratej for Wales in 2005 was 67% compared to 78% in England, 70% in Scotland and 63% in Northern Ireland. The equivalent rate was 76% for the UK. The IFS shows that infant feeding practices varied in a consistent pattern according to certain socio-demographic characteristics of the mother. Younger mothers, mothers from lower socioeconomic groups and mothers with lower educational levels were less likely to initiate and continue breastfeeding. The clear difference between groups is illustrated by Figure 4.8. Mothers from lower socioeconomic groups were also more likely to introduce solids, follow-on formula and additional drinks at an earlier age. Figure 4.9 shows that older mothers are more likely to breastfeed and that this pattern is consistent across all UK countries. j This refers to all babies whose mothers put them to the breast, even if this was on one occasion only.830102030405060708090Percentage who breastfed initially Never workedFigure 4.8: Incidence of breastfeeding by mother's socioeconomic classication, Wales Routine & Manual Intermediate occupations41557284 Mother's socioeconomic classication (NS-SEC)Managerial & Professional Source: Infant (IFS) 0102030405060708090Percentage who breastfed initially Under 20Figure 4.9: Incidence of mother's and country (2005) 20-24 25-29 30-34 35 or Survey (IFS)84Weight Being overweight or obese in childhood has consequences for health in both the short term and the longer term. Childhood obesity is a risk factor for a number of chronic diseases in adult life including heart disease, some cancers and osteoarthritis. Some diseases, however, can become manifest during childhood, particularly type 2 diabetes23. Data on young children who are underweight, overweight and obese are included in Chapter 6 Health, Freedom from Abuse and Exploitation . Diet Healthy eating habits in the years before school are important because in later childhood they impact on growth, development and achievement24. Table 4.1 shows the percentage of four to seven-year-olds who eat selected foods daily. Table 4.1: Percentage of children aged four to seven reported as eating the following foods daily, Wales (2007-2009) Food type Percentage Fruit 73 Vegetables 57 Sweets 28 Chips 4 Source: Welsh Health Survey (WHS) In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, children at a young age were aware of the importance of diet for health. Hence, while many expressed a preference for 'unhealthy' foods, all participants were able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy food as these quotes demonstrate: \"I'm not healthy, because I eat junk, chocolate, sweets...because I like it.\" (Sophie, 7) \"I don't eat white bread I only eat brown bread because it's healthy.\" (Abbie, 6) 4.3 Developmental milestones Cognitive development Cognitive development in the early years is of great importance to later outcomes, and performance on cognitive assessments at ages three and five are related to later school achievement, academic attainment and occupational outcomes25. 85Poor cognitive performance early in life has also been found to be related to higher chances of unemployment, low qualifications and low income26. The cognitive development of seven-year-old children was examined in the MCS. Three cognitive assessments were administered to cohort children using a verbal and non-verbal subscale of the British Ability Scales (BAS) as well as a maths test. The three assessment scales have been combined into a single index and the mean figures for this overall index are shown in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Mean figures for overall cognitive index for seven-year-olds Mean England 100.1 Wales 99.1 Scotland 99.8 Northern Ireland 99.4 Full sample 99.8 Source: Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) There were no significant differences among the four UK countries on the overall index. However, there were differences between the countries within the individual assessments. For the verbal and non-verbal BAS, children in Wales and Northern Ireland scored higher than children in England, but children in England and Scotland scored higher on word reading. On the maths assessment, there were no differences between the countries. In Wales, the highest cognitive scores were among children of graduate mothers and those from families in the top income group. The lowest cognitive scores are for children whose mothers had no qualifications and whose family income was lowest, particularly workless couples. Further analysis indicates that persistent disadvantage is associated with lower cognitive scores, be it long-term residence in disadvantaged areas, long-term lone parenthood or repeated low income. Table 4.3 shows cognitive scores by family income. The gap between the top and bottom income groups is nearly 12 points, with bigger and more clearly separated jumps between the lower levels of income.86Table 4.3: Cognitive index by income quintiles for seven-year-olds OECD equivalised income quintiles at sweep 4 Mean Bottom Second 97.6 Third 100.6 Fourth 102.6 Top 105.0 Source: Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) Key Stage 1k Pupils in Wales are not statutorily tested at each Key Stage. In deciding on a pupil's level of attainment at the end of each Key Stage, teachers assess which description best fits the pupil's performance. The 'Core Subject Indicator' (CSI) represents the percentage of pupils attaining the expected level in English (or Welsh, where Welsh is the first language of the pupil), mathematics and science in combination. This is the most appropriate summary indicator of pupil performance for this age group. In 2010 the proportion of pupils achieving at least level two (the expected level) in the CSI in the National Curriculum was 81.6%. This was the highest level of achievement recorded over the last ten years. Girls out-performed boys in all subjects, although, this gender gap has been decreasing slightly each year. The greatest difference was in English at 9.8 percentage points and the smallest in science at 3.7 percentage points. k Key Stage 1 - pupils are aged five to seven and in school years 1 and 2. Please note that Key Stage 1 is currently being phased out in Wales and is being replaced by the Foundation Phase, which is a more play based experiential curriculum.87Entitlement for free school meals (FSM) can be used as a proxy measure of the socioeconomic conditions of a school's population. As noted in the 2008 Monitor, there is a strong link between achievement and the level of entitlement to FSM. As the level of entitlement to FSM increases, the level of achievement decreases. In 2009, the difference in attainment between pupils eligible for FSM and those not eligible was 21.2%. Figure 4.11 illustrates that this pattern has remained over time. It should be noted that whilst there is a link between FSM entitlement and performance, many other factors affect school assessment and examination 0102030405060708090Percentage achieving CSI 2005Figure 4.11: Attainment at Key Stage 1, by FSM entitlement, Wales (2005-2008) 2006 2007 2008Eligible for FSM 4.10: Percentage of pupils achieving at least level 2 at Key Stage 1 in teacher assessments, Wales (2010) Welsh Mathematics Science CSIGirlsBoys Government88results. (See Chapter 5 Access to Education, Training and Learning Opportunities for further discussion of this issue). Figure 4.12 shows the level of attainment for the main ethnic groups over the period 2007-09. At Key Stage 1, pupils from Chinese, Mixed and White ethnic backgrounds performed above the national average for 2007-2009. Pupils from a Black ethnic background performed considerably below the national average. Figure 4.12 shows aggregated data, so that the number of pupils in each ethnic background group is larger to enable more robust conclusions to be drawn about the attainment of pupils in each group. However, within these ethnic groups, there was some variation in attainment. The pupils with the highest CSI attainment were those from an 'any other Asian' ethnic background, who recorded 88.5%. The lowest achieving group comprised pupils from a White Gypsy/Roma ethnic background with 31.4%. 0102030405060708090100Percentage achieving CSI BlackFigure 4.12: Attainment at Key Stage 1, by ethnic background, Wales (2007-2009) Any other ethnic groupUnknown Asian Chinese or Chinese BritishAll pupils White Mixed Ethnic Background70.57576.27880.8 81 81.3 82.1 Source: National Pupil Database, Welsh Government894.4 Special needs in early years As set out by the 1996 Education Act, 'children have special educational needs (SEN) if they have a learning difficulty which calls for special educational provision to be made for them'. Children have a learning difficulty if they have significantly greater difficulty in learning than other children of the same age, or have a disability which makes it difficult to use normal educational facilities. As at January 2010, 17.4% of children aged seven or under in maintained schools in Wales had SEN. Table 4.4 presents the number of pupils with statements in schools by their major need. The most common form of SEN is moderate learning difficulties, followed by speech, language and communication difficulties. Boys are more likely than girls to have SEN and this difference is particularly pronounced for behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and speech, language and communication difficulties. Table 4.4: Percentage of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in maintained schools aged seven and under, Wales (2010) SEN type Boys Girls Total Moderate learning difficulties 9.2 6.1 7.7 Severe learning difficulties 0.4 0.2 0.3 Profound and multiple learning difficulties 0.2 0.1 0.2 Specific learning difficulties 1.8 1.1 1.5 Autistic Spectrum Disorder 0.8 0.2 0.5 Physical and medical difficulties 0.9 0.6 0.8 Hearing impairment 0.3 0.3 0.3 Visual impairment 0.2 0.1 0.1 Multiple sensory impairment 0.0 0.0 0.0 Speech, language and communication difficulties5.6 2.6 4.1 Behavioural, emotional and social difficulties 2.9 0.8 1.9 Total 22.3 12.3 17.4 Source: Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) The percentage of pupils with SEN achieving the CSI in 2009 was 47% at Key Stage 1. The difference in performance between pupils with the various SEN requirements decreases through the key stages (see Chapter 5 Access to Education, Training and Learning Opportunities ).904.5 Good and secure attachments in early years Behaviour The MCS collects data on emotional and behavioural problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A higher score indicates more behavioural problems. The score for Welsh seven-year-olds was 7.5; lower than the average score in England, but higher than the average scores in Scotland and Northern Ireland. For the study as a whole, children from families with two working parents showed fewer behavioural problems, as did children from households not classified as living in poverty. Boys showed significantly more evidence of behavioural problems than girls and were more likely to exhibit conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems. The total difficulties score at age seven was correlated with scores from previous sweeps (when the children were aged three and five). There are strong associations between indicators of problematic behaviour at age seven and measures at age three and five, suggesting that behavioural problems are relatively stable over time. Friendship Evidence shows that friendships are crucial to children's wellbeing and development at all stages in their lives. Children's friendships are key predictors of their later adjustment and enjoyment of school27. The fourth survey of the MCS included a self completion questionnaire for the cohort child. The questionnaire was designed to assess the wellbeing of children from their own point of view and included questions about friends. The findings showed that 68% of children in Wales reported having a lot of friends (Figure 4.13). Children in Northern Ireland and Wales were more likely to have lots of friends than those in Scotland and England. The children were also asked whether they had any best friends - almost all reported that they did (96%). Figure 4.13: Percentage of seven-year-old children answering the question 'how many friends do you have?' 22% 68% 10%SomeLots Not many Source: Millennium Cohort Study (MCS)91Family life Parenting that is warm and supportive facilitates the development of strong and secure relationships and it can also act to ameliorate associations between adverse influences28. The MCS self-completion questionnaire asked children how often they had fun with their family at the weekend - 65% of children in Wales said they had fun all of the time. Across the UK, children in Wales were the least likely to report that they never had fun with their family at the weekend (2% compared to 3.4% in Northern Ireland). The Voices of Children and Young People in Wale s study, which included parents with young children, highlighted the importance of love and security for wellbeing in the early years. One parent of a ten month-old boy reflects on this: \"I like to think that he's been really fortunate, he is surrounded by people who love him and hopefully he is being offered all the opportunities that a little one needs in this particular age...he feels comfortable and secure...\" (Ava, 35, child ten months) Parental involvement has a significant effect on child development outcomes28. According to the MCS, 39% of mothers in Wales say they read daily with their seven year-olds, a further 27% read 'several times a week' and 3% of children are never read to by their mother. The proportion of mothers who read every day with their child has declined since earlier sweeps of the MCS. Forty-nine per cent of mothers read to their child everyday when the cohort child was five-years-old and 58% at age three. The proportion of children read to everyday by their mother increases along with 0102030405060708090100Percentage EnglandFigure 4.14: Percentage of seven-year-old children answering the question 'how often do you have fun with your family at the weekend?'

Of children with a mother holding a NVQ5 (or equivalent) qualification, 54% are read to everyday, compared to 27% of children whose mother has no qualifications. For children with a father figure who took part in the survey, 13% are read to daily by their father, a further 25% read to 'several times a week' and 6% are never read to by their father. It is likely that this decrease reflects the child's increased time at school and the development of their own ability to read. 93References 1. Bull, J., Mulvihill, C., and Quigley, R., 2003.

Girls continue to outperform boys in assessments during compulsory education and beyond. However, international assessments on the application of knowledge show boys outperforming girls in two out of the three subjects assessed. Deprivation continues to be correlated with absenteeism and lower attainment rates across much of the spectrum of education for young people in Wales. Wales continues to see gradual improvement in Core Subject Indicator (CSI) performance at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. Wales continues to see gradual improvement in GCSE/Key Stage 4 attainment measures but there remains a gap in comparative performance with England and between girls and boys. The numbers of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) have remained largely at the same level for more than a decade. The number of permanent exclusions in Wales (based on total number of occurrences rather than pupils) has dropped from around 1.0 to 0.5 per 1,000 pupils since the previous Monitor (which reported 2005/06 data). The rate per 1,000 pupils was 0.8 for boys and 0.3 for girls in 2007/08 and the gender difference has been consistent over a number of years. The numbers of Welsh domiciled enrolments to higher education institutions (HEIs) for those aged under 25 has increased over the last nine years from 49,260 in 2000/01 to 54,985 in 2008/09. Females continue to outnumber males by 55.8% to 44.2% in 2008/09. Looked after children have considerably lower attainment rates than all pupils. 98This chapter focuses on Core Aim 2 of the Welsh Government's aims for children and young people in Wales. This aims to ensure that 'every child and young person has access to a comprehensive range of education, training and learning opportunities, including the acquisition of essential personal and learning skills'. According to Gutman and Feinstein (2008)1 learning is closely intertwined with wellbeing and school plays an important role in the social, emotional and behavioural aspects of children's wellbeing. The positive association between learning and wellbeing has also been shown to be longitudinal - predicting change from adulthood to adolescence. Children's learning and enjoyment in primary school predicts their later wellbeing in secondary school, although with some socioeconomic and gender differences. For boys, learning in primary school has the strongest influence on behavioural aspects of their later wellbeing, whereas for girls it is more predictive of the social aspects of their wellbeing2. Educational attainment is also a strong independent factor affecting other aspects of wellbeing. For instance, the direct contribution of educational attainment towards health status is equal to, if not greater than, the impact of income. As a result educational attainment is a key determinant of future socioeconomic status, wellbeing and health across the population3. The chapter provides an insight into children and young people from Key Stage 2 (age seven to 11 years) onwards. Key Stage 1 is considered in Chapter 4 The Early Years . Specifically, the chapter reports on: young people's views of education; engagement in compulsory education; achieving early learning goals; achieving full potential; essential and key skills; and engagement in post-compulsory education, training and learning.995.1 Young people's views of education The 2009/10 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study asked young people their views about school with responses ranging from 'I like it a lot' to 'I don't like it at all'. Figure 5.1 shows that those reporting that they like school a lot declines significantly from age 11 to age 15 for both boys and girls. The provider-led learner voice survey for post-16 learning 2010 (pilot study) asked a series of questions about the learners' experience at their further education or work-based learning provider. This culminated in the question: 'overall, how good do you think your college/provider is?' Table 5.1 shows high levels reporting their provider as 'very good' or 'good', with no clear pattern relating to age.020406080100PercentageGirls 09/10Boys 09/10 Boys 05/06Figure 5.1: Percentage reporting that they like school 'a lot', Wales (2005-2010) 11 12 13 14 15Girls Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study100Table 5.1: Responses to the question 'overall, how good do you think your college/provider is?'

The Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study identifies the imperative of succeeding in education as one of two key stressors for children and young people. Here, many young people felt under enormous pressure to do well, with greater pressure felt that, in the current economic conditions, even getting good grades may not necessarily secure employment. This meant that for some young people, education should be 'fit for purpose' in order to provide them with requisite skills, including life skills such as financial management. In the same way, many young people were sceptical about university, not convinced it would help them with future employment, while at the same time anticipating it would burden them with considerable debt. \"Yeah it is quite stressful, I suppose that's a big issue ... especially when it comes down to coursework end times, coursework deadlines, yeah I do tech this year which is quite hard because we've got so much work to do but especially like we've all got resits in January and when we've got them over we've got coursework deadlines and when we've got that over we've got other exams.\" (Alexa 17)101Participant perceptions of teachers were clearly associated with enjoyment of schooling in young people's accounts: \"Some teachers are alright, some teachers are really nice but you obviously get some of the teachers that are just like, shouldn't be here, some teachers can't. I think they find it difficult to teach students, they know what they're talking about but they just find it difficult to like to show it, to tell people what it is and for people to absorb the information.\" (Alexa, 17) \"I'd just like teachers that I actually know but one thing I don't like about school is some of the teachers that you all know and like retire because I don't really like that like Mrs X she is a fun teacher even though she had a bad knee it didn't really matter she did awesome maths.\" (David, 8) The study found that homework constituted the least positive aspect of school for some children: \"I don't like (homework) because we've already worked hard in school, we shouldn't have homework.\" (David, 8) Opinions on homework differed according to the subject and its required format: \"We've got this thing it's like the only fun homework I think is fun is this thing called we have a learning log book and we can do the homework any way we want which is good.\" (Harry, 10) 5.2 Engagement in compulsory education Absenteeism Absenteeism has a negative impact on attainment. As the overall absence rate increased, the percentage of pupils achieving the Core Subject Indicator (CSI)a decreased at each Key Stage in 2009. a The Core Subject Indicator represents the percentage of pupils achieving the expected attainment level in English or Welsh (as a first language), mathematics and science.102Absenteeism, including unauthorised absences remains higher in secondary schools than in primaryb. For secondary, both overall and unauthorised absence remained fairly constant from 2000 to 2009, standing at 9% and 1.6% respectively in 2009/10. Overall absence for primary schools has stood at around 7% from 2003 to 2009, with unauthorised absence rising from 0.6% to 1% over that time. There was little difference in absenteeism between boys and girls in either setting from 2005 to 2009, except in overall secondary school absence where girls had a higher overall rate of absenteeism. Absenteeism and deprivation, as measured by the proportion of pupils entitled to free school meals (FSM) continued to be correlated in Wales. When comparing schools with less than 10% of pupils entitled to FSM to those with greater than 30% entitled, the absentee rate rises from 7.5% to 11.9% in secondary schoolsc and from 5.4% to 8.8% in achieving the CSI 0% to 4% at mostFigure 5.2: Percentage of pupils achieving the CSI at Key Stage 2, 3 and 4 by overall absence rates, Wales (2009) KS2 (age 11) KS4 (age 15)KS3 (age 14) Over Government b To allow comparison 2008/09 figures have been used. 2009/10 statistics for absenteeism from secondary schools were released in September 2010 and show no large variations from the indicators reported. c 2009/10 data. d 2008/09 data.103Table 5.2: Percentage of absent pupils of compulsory school age in maintained primary and secondary schools, Wales and England* (2008/09) Sessions missed due to overall absenceSessions missed due to unauthorised absence Primary Schools England 5.3 0.6 Wales 6.8 1.0 Secondary Schools England 7.2 1.5 Wales 9.0 1.7 Source: Welsh Government and Department for Children, Schools and Families * Data for England and secondary school data for Wales relate to the period September 2008 to 22 May 2009. Wales' primary school data relate to the whole academic year. Wales has higher levels of overall and unauthorised absence compared to England for both primary and secondary schools. Exclusions Fixed-term exclusions remain much more common than permanent exclusions in both Wales and the other UK nations. The number of permanent exclusions in Wales (based on total number of occurrences rather than pupils) has dropped from around 1.0 to 0.5 per 1,000 pupils since the previous Monitor (which reported 2005/06 data). The rate per 1,000 pupils was 0.8 for boys and 0.3 for girls in 2007/08 and the gender difference has been consistent over a number of years. The fall in permanent exclusions can largely be explained by the rise in the practice of 'managed moves', whereby a pupil in danger of permanent exclusion is moved to another school before the situation escalates. Guidance sets out that managed moves have to be agreed with all parties and be in the best interest of the child. Moreover they should not be undertaken at the point of an incident which merits permanent exclusion, in order to reduce, artificially, the number of permanent exclusions. Such action would remove the right of parents and pupils concerned to appeal against an exclusion. Figures for 2008/09 show that on the 16th day after being permanently excluded from school, 23% of pupils were provided with home tuition, 23% were transferred to another school and 18%, attended a 'Pupil Referral Unit' or had 'no provision'.104There were 19,034 fixed-term exclusions from schools in Wales in 2008/09, continuing a downward trend since the last Monitor (figures from 2005/06). The duration of exclusions has also been getting shorter. The proportion of fixed term exclusions lasting six days or more decreased during that period with a corresponding rise in fixed-term exclusions of five days or fewer. Table 5.3 provides the reasons for both permanent and fixed-term exclusions. Table 5.3: Reasons given for permanent and fixed-term exclusions, Wales (2005/06 and 2008/09) Permanent exclusions (%)Fixed-term exclusions - 5 days or fewer (%)Fixed-term exclusions - 6 days or more (%) 05/06 08/09 05/06 08/09 05/06 08/09 Assault/violence towards staff 10 15 4 5 8 11 Assault/violence towards pupils 11 15 17 19 19 19 Defiance of rules 27 11 20 22 18 17 Disruptive behaviour 16 8 17 15 16 11 Bullying or theft 2 1 4 3 4 3 Racial or sexual harassment 1 4 1 1 2 2 Verbal abuse 6 2 17 14 11 9 Threatening or dangerous behaviour12 16 9 8 11 14 Possession/use of weapon 3 4 1 1 1 2 Damage to property 2 2 3 3 4 2 Substance misuse 8 14 2 2 4 4 Other 2 7 5 8 3 5 Source: Welsh Government There has been a substantial drop since 2005/06 in the proportion of permanent exclusions given for 'defiance of rules' (down from 27% to 11%) or 'disruptive behaviour' (down from 16% to 8%). However, this has to be seen in the context of an increasing use of managed moves because pupils previously excluded for these reasons are most likely to have been the subject of managed moves. Data are not available for analysis on exclusions amongst children looked after by local authorities. While data are available by ethnicity, it is difficult to analyse trends in relation to permanent exclusions, owing to very small numbers. 105Permanent and fixed-term exclusions in Wales are also recorded by special educational needs (SEN). Of the 213 permanent exclusions in 2008/09, 43% involved pupils who were School Action SENe, while 10% involved pupils who had a Statement of SENf. A similar split holds true for fixed-term exclusions. When compared to 2005/06 data, the proportions with a Statement of SEN who are excluded, either permanently or for a fixed-term, remain within one or two percentage points. Comparison with the other UK Nations, using the latest figures from 2007/08, shows Wales' rate for permanent exclusions to be lower than England and higher than Scotland (0.6, 1.1 and 0.2 per 1,000 pupils respectively). For fixed-term exclusions, the rate for Wales is lower than England and Scotland. Although direct comparisons cannot be made with Northern Ireland as their figures are based on number of pupils rather than incidents their rates are significantly the lowest in the UK. 5.3 Achieving early learning goals Key Stages 2 (age 11) and Key Stage 3 (age 14) The 'Core Subject Indicator' (CSI) represents the percentage of pupils achieving the expected attainment level in English or Welsh (as a first language), mathematics and science. This is the most appropriate summary indicator of pupil performance at the end of Key Stage 2 (KS2) and Key Stage 3 (KS3), which correspond with ages 11 and 14 respectively. Figure 5.3 and Table 5.4 show the results for teacher assessments. They show that, as was the case in the 2008 Monitor, improvement in performance continues. e When a teacher identifies that a pupil has SEN. f A statement of SEN sets out a pupil's needs and the help they should have. It is based on an assessment conducted by the appropriate local authority.106Table 5.4: Percentage of pupils at Key Stage 2 and 3 achieving the CSI by gender, Wales (1999-2010) YearKey Stage 2 Key Stage 3 Girls Boys All pupils Girls Boys All pupils 1999 65 57 61 51 44 47 2000 69 59 64 54 45 49 2001 73 64 68 55 46 51 2002 73 66 70 57 48 52 2003 75 67 71 59 50 54 2004 76 68 72 62 52 57 2005 78 70 74 63 54 58 2006 79 70 74 63 53 58 2007 78 70 74 61 52 57 2008 80 72 75 65 55 60 2009 82 73 77 66 57 61 2010 82 74 78 69 59 64 Source: Welsh Government The 2020 child poverty target at KS2 is that 86% of pupils will have achieved the expected attainment level for the CSI.

The greatest difference between girls and boys was seen in Welsh at KS2 and KS3, and the smallest difference was in science and mathematics for each Key Stage. Overall the margin by which girls outperform boys has remained broadly stable over the period 1999-2010. As was the case in the 2008 Monitor, pupils in Wales' publicly-funded schools achieved results which were higher than, or equal to, those in all Government Office regions in England for KS2 English and mathematics in 2008/09g. For KS2 science, they outperformed all but two English regions. In those two regions they equalled performance levelsh, which represented an improvement on the results reported in the 2008 Monitor. For KS3, Wales' results were lower than Englandi and all Government Office English regions for all comparable core subjects, except for science in London. The difference was greatest for English with 78% of pupils in England achieving the expected level, compared to 71% in Wales. For children looked after by local authoritiesj, 2008/09 data show the percentage of children achieving the expected CSI level was 44% at KS2 and 25% at KS3. The equivalent figures for all pupils were 77% at KS2 and 61% at KS3. The percentage of pupils with SEN achieving the CSI at KS2 was 34.7% and 19.4% at KS3. The correlation between deprivation and attainment remains strong in Wales. The proportion of pupils achieving the KS2 CSI in 2010 is 20 percentage points less in schools with higher numbers of those receiving free school meals (FSM) and 28 percentage points less for KS3. This holds true when examining pupil data. In 2009, 59.4% of pupils eligible for FSM achieved the KS2 CSI compared to 81.1% of those pupils not eligible. For KS3 the corresponding figures were 34.8% and 66.9%. g N.B. Provisional data for England. h As above. i As above. j Some looked after children have difficulties that should be taken into account when making comparisons. 108Figure 5.5 shows that for KS2 and KS3, pupils from a Mixed, Chinese or White background performed above the national average for 2007-2009. For KS3 performance by pupils from a Chinese background were markedly higher than those from Mixed or White ethnic backgrounds. For each Key Stage, pupils from a Black ethnic background performed considerably below the national average.0102030405060708090100Percentage Key Stage 2Figure 5.4: Percentage of pupils achieving the CSI at Key Stage 2 and 3 by FSM entitlement, Wales (2009) Eligible for FSM All pupils Not eligible for FSM Key Stage 3 Government 0102030405060708090100Percentage MixedFigure 5.5: Percentage of pupils achieving the CSI at Key Stage 2 and 3 by main ethnic group, Wales (2007-2009) Key Stage 2 Key Stage 3 White Chinese All Unknown Asian Other Black Ethnic for the Welsh Government in 20064 found that once personal characteristics such as poverty are accounted for, few of the differences in scores between ethnic groups are significant. However, the relationship between ethnicity, FSM and educational attainment is complex and a recent report published by the Equality and Human Rights Commission5 reported England and Wales analysis that: 'The performance of Chinese children at GCSE is scarcely affected by whether or not they are eligible for free school meals (FSM), whilst by contrast that of Indian children is strongly diminished if they are eligible for FSM.' (page 645). It is therefore difficult to make a definitive statement here on the effect of ethnicity on attainment in Wales. New analysis shows that the month of birth of a pupil in relation to the academic year has an impact on attainment. The proportion of those born earlier in the academic year achieving the expected level at CSI is higher than those born later in the academic year. Of those pupils born in September, 83.3% and 67.3% achieved the expected level at KS2 and KS3 respectively in 2009. Of those born in August, 70.3% and 56.7% achieved the expected level at KS2 and KS3. Transition from primary to secondary school Concern has been voiced over the transition from primary to secondary school at age 11 and the impact that has on pupils' expected performance levels in Wales. The Welsh Government Child Poverty Expert Group offered recommendations in March 2009 regarding the '...loss of educational progress of many young people as they move into and through the early years of secondary education. The research should explore the apparently close association between this phenomenon and child poverty'.6 In November 2008 the National Assembly for Wales Children and Young People Committee was concerned regarding '... the reasons why educational progress seems to decline in the early years of secondary school, with particular reference to children from poorer socio-economic backgrounds.'7 Figure 5.6 provides some analysis of the percentage of pupils achieving an improvement of at least one level between KS2 and KS3, for example improvement from Level 2 to Level 3 or from Level 4 to Level 5. This is not necessarily the expected level of achievement for children of that agek. It shows that, for all the subjects analysed, FSM status has a negative impact on improvement. k For 11-year-olds (KS2) the expectation is that the majority of pupils will attain Level 4 in each individual subject. For 14-year-olds (KS3) the general expectation is that the majority of pupils will attain Level 5 in each individual subject.110Table 5.5 shows that, while many pupils achieve more than one level over the transition between KS2 and KS3 in these subjects, there is a proportion who do not improve and small proportions whose performance decreases. However, analysis by FSM status shows that deprivation has a negative impact on attainment levels in each category.

There are two key measures of performance in Wales for this group: those achieving the Level 2 threshold; equivalent to the volume of 5 GCSEs at grade A*-Cl, and those achieving 5 GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English or Welsh (as a first language) and mathematics. Figure 5.7 shows that Wales continues to see gradual improvement but that there remains a persistent gap in performance between girls and boys. Sixty-four per cent of pupils achieved the Level 2 threshold in 2010, nine percentage points more than in 2007 as reported in the previous Monitor. In 2007, 44% of pupils achieved GCSE grade A*-C including English or Welsh and mathematics. This rose to 49% in 2010. l Up to 2005/06 includes GCSEs, GCSE Short Course, GNVQs and NVQs. From 2006/07, includes all qualifications approved for pre-16 use in Wales.P112* Not including English, Welsh and mathematics. ** Including English, Welsh and mathematics.

It is possible to look at KS4 attainment for different groups by considering the CSI. The gender gap has increased in the percentage achieving the CSI since 2007 from 5 percentage points to 6.9 percentage points in 2008/09 (this gap subsequently reduced to 6 percentage points in 2009/10).020406080100PercentageBoys achieving level 2*Girls achieving level 2* Boys achieving level 2**Girls achieving level 2**Figure 5.7: Percentage of pupils aged 15 who achieved Level 2 threshold, Wales (2001-2010) Year2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Source: Welsh Government m Comparisons cannot be made with Scotland due to differences in qualification structure or Northern Ireland as they report on a different cohort i.e. school leavers.113Again, the correlation between deprivation and attainment remained strong and fairly static between 2007-2009. The proportion of pupils eligible for FSM who achieved the CSI for KS4 was 31.3 percentage points lower than pupils not eligible for FSM. Data collected on the educational attainment of looked after children show that, in the year to 31 March 2010, 503 children aged 16 or over ceased being looked after. Of these children 65% had at least one qualification, a 22 percentage point increase on 2007 figures although a similar level to 2008 and 2009. However, the proportion of care leavers aged 16 or over, achieving five or more GCSEs at grade A*-C was 9%. This is a quarter of the level of all pupilsn. In 2009 at KS4 12.2% of SEN pupils achieved the CSI. Pupils from a Chinese ethnic background performed considerably above the national average in 2007-2009 in achieving CSI at KS4 - 68.2% compared to 44.1%. Again, pupils from a Black ethnic background performed below the national average at 30.9%. However, research undertaken in 2006 showed that, at KS4, no minority ethnic group produces significantly lower scores than White British pupils. In fact, when poverty levels are taken into account, some groups, for example, Black Africans, do better than expected4. Nevertheless as discussed in section 5.3, the relationship between ethnicity, FSM as an indicator of deprivation and educational achievement is complex and the evidence is not available at a Wales level to make a clear statement on how one factor affects the other. Again, month of birth has an impact with 50.1% of pupils born in September achieving the expected level at CSI at KS4, compared to 41.8% of those born in August. A Welsh Government child poverty target for 2010 is that no pupil in Wales should leave full-time education without an approved qualification. In 2009/10, 0.8% of pupils left full-time education without a recognised qualification which was 0.9 percentage points lower than in 2007/08. A greater percentage of boys than girls left without a qualification. Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification The Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification (WBQ) was created to help to add breadth to learners' studies, to encourage inclusiveness and attainment and to develop learners' personal skills. It was felt that these skills were essential if learners were to do well when they left school and started a job or went on to further education. n Some looked after children have difficulties that should be taken into account when making comparisons. P114It is available at three levels and consists of two parts; the 'Options', and the 'Core', both of which must be successfully completed to achieve the WBQ. The Options consist of recognised qualifications such as A-Levels, GCSEs and NVQs. All students must achieve a minimum level of these qualifications to pass the Options part of the Welsh Baccalaureate. The Core Programme comprises Individual Investigation, Key Skills/Essential Skills, Work-Related Education and Personal and Social Education and Wales, Europe and the World (including a language module at a level suitable for the student). It should be noted that the Options element of WBQs are reported as part of the Key Stage or FE/HE results as appropriate. The WBQ is designed as a 14-19 qualification, though not exclusively, and is mainly pursued by learners in that age range. It is estimated that the vast majority of individuals undertaking the qualification to date will have been under 25 years. Table 5.7 and Figures 5.8 and 5.9 show entries, completions and achievements respectively since 2006. They show that, since roll-out of the WBQ began, learner numbers have increased substantially. The numbers entering and completing the qualification have been more volatile at Intermediate than at Advanced or Foundation level. Table 5.7: Entries* for Welsh Baccalaureate Qualifications (2006-2010) 2006 2007 2008 2010 Advanced * Entries refers to learners who are formally entered for the summer award by centres. ** Foundation level awards began in 2007. 0102030405060708090100Figure 5.8: Completions as proportion of entries for Welsh Baccalaureate Qualication (2006-1010) Advanced Intermediate FoundationPercentage Year2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Source: Welsh Government115Overall levels of achievement have increased for the Advanced Level from 76% to 81% over the period, Intermediate level has decreased by one percentage point and Foundation level has decreased by six percentage points, with a dip in 2008 to 44% of those completing achieving the full diplomao. A quote from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study uncovered the following view: \"We did the [Welsh] Bac, yeah. That kind of helped me in confidence, I did things in front of teachers and you had to teach classes and I actually enjoyed a lot of that, volunteering and work experience. I enjoyed the experience of that ...I think it was quite important learning those skills.\" (Rhys, 18) Qualifications gained at age 17 (post-compulsory education) The numbers of young people in Wales achieving the Level 3 threshold, equivalent to two A-levels at grade A-E, was 95% in 2010p. This is one percentage point lower than 2009 but two percentage points higher than 2000/01. A gender gap remains, with 93% of boys achieving this level compared to 96% of girls. This changed little from the 92% of boys and 95% of girls who achieved it in 2006/07, as reported in the 2008 Monitor. There are no published data in England or Northern Ireland directly comparable to Wales' published data.0102030405060708090100Figure 5.9: Achieved full diploma as proportion of completions for Welsh Baccalaureate Qualication (2006-2010) Advanced Intermediate FoundationPercentage Year2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Source: Welsh Government o Students must pass their Options plus all aspects of the Core to achieve the Welsh Baccalaureate Diploma.

In both reading and mathematics, Wales' mean score was significantly lower than the OECD average and the England and Scotland scores. For reading, it was also significantly below Northern Ireland. In science, it achieved around the OECD average, as did Northern Ireland, but was again significantly below the performance of England and Scotland. Table: 5.8: PISA assessment area scores, UK and OECD average (2009) Assessment area WalesOECD averageScotland NI England Reading 476 493 500 499 495 Mathematics 472 496 499 492 493 Science 496 501 514 511 515 Source: Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) An analysis of the results for Wales8 reported the following results by gender. Of the 64 participating countries, all had a statistically significant difference in gender performance on the reading scale, favouring girls. Despite being significant, the gender difference was not as large in Wales as that in the majority of other countries. \"Boys performed significantly better than girls in mathematics. This was a common pattern internationally with more than half the PISA countries showing a similar difference. However, Wales did have one of the biggest gender differences.\" (page 27) \"Performance by gender was variable across the countries that participated. In Wales there was a significant difference in gender performance on the science scale, favouring boys.\" (page 32) The study investigated pupils' views on reading and found that \"More than 40 per cent of pupils in Wales report that they never read for enjoyment. Both internationally and in Wales there was a large difference in scores between those who never read for enjoyment and those who do, even if only for a short time each day.\" (page 44) PISA also reported that \"The connection between socio-economic background and reading scores was in the mid-range compared with other OECD countries. Many pupils can overcome disadvantage and achieve higher scores than predicted by their background. In some other OECD countries this is much more difficult.\" (page 45)1175.6 Engagement in post-compulsory education, training and learning Further education, community and work-based learning The proportion of young people aged under 25 years at further education institutions, local authority community learning (CL) and with work-based learning (WBL) providers, increased slightly over the last couple of years from 36% in 2006/07 and 40% in 2008/09q. Males outnumbered females for all ages below 20. However, within the 20-24 age group, females made up 53% of learners and males 47%. Females continue to dominate the numbers in learning for older age groups. Ethnic minority learners aged under 25 made up around 4% of the learner population between 2007-2009. Analysis of success rates17r for 2008/09 shows that: for FE provision, those aged 25 and under, achieve very similar success rates as those over 25 for Level 1, 2 and 3 qualifications overall. They do less well on key skills for Levels 2 and 3 but better at A/AS/A2 Level. Notably, they achieve a lower success rate for Level 4 qualifications but better for e-learning aims; for WBL provision, those aged 25 and under, achieve very similar success rates overall for Modern Apprenticeships and Modern Skills Diploma but less well for Foundation Modern Apprenticeships and Skill Build; around three-quarters of learners aged 25 and under, achieve success in a full frameworks qualification for Foundation Modern Apprenticeships and Modern Apprenticeships. A similar level for all learners. Analysis undertaken by the Welsh Government on the educational attainment of young people by age 19, considers data over the period 2002/03 to 2006/07. It considers attainment at Levels 1 to 3t on the National Qualifications Framework. q Of the unique learners aged under 25 enrolled at FEIs, CL and WBL providers in 2008/09: 74,800 (75.7%) were enrolled solely at FEIs. 7,800 (18.0%) were enrolled solely at other training providers. 1,450 (1.5%) were enrolled solely at a local authority community learning provider. Further to this: 4,250 (4.3%) were enrolled at both a FEI and an 'other' training provider. 450 (0.5%) were enrolled at some other combination of providers (e.g. an 'other' training provider and a local authority community learning provider). r Success rates are calculated as the number of learning activities attained divided by the number of learning activities terminated. s Learners on apprenticeship programmes have to achieve a range of qualifications including an NVQ, key skills and technical certificate in order to gain the full apprenticeship 'framework'. t Level 1 - equivalent to 5 GCSEs at Grade D-G; Level 2 - equivalent to 5 GCSEs at Grade A*-C; Level 3 - equivalent to 2 A-Levels.118Key findings include: By age 19, 96% had attained the Level 1 threshold, 71% had Level 2 and 46% had Level 3. Level 2 attainment increased by 23 percentage points between ages 15 and 19 and Level 3 attainment increased by 10 percentage points between ages 17 and 19. Level 1 and 2 attainment at each age from 15 to 18 was generally higher for subsequent cohorts. The proportion of females achieving each level was higher than for males at all ages although the size of this gap decreased as age increased. Higher education The numbers of Welsh-domiciledu enrolmentsv to higher education institutions (HEIs) for those aged under 25 has increased over the last nine years from 49,260 in 2000/01 to 54,985 in 2008/09.

Provisional figures show the numbers of 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training (NEET) as at the end of 2009 to be 12%. The figure for 19 to 24-year-olds stands at 22%. Just under half of those 16 to 18-years-olds were unemployed, while others were economically inactive, being neither employed, nor seeking and being available for work. In 2008, young people who were NEET were more likely to be unemployed (61%) than economically inactive (39%). For the age group 19-24 the figures stood at 42% and 58% in 2009, very similar proportions to the previous year. For the younger age group, males were more likely to be NEET than females; 15% compared to 9% in 2009. This is reversed for 19-24 year olds, 22% of females compared with 21% in 2009. Comparisons can be made with England for estimates of young people who are NEET. Figure 5.13 shows that between 1996 and 2009, Wales generally had a higher proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds who were NEET than England. The gap was slightly wider in 2009 than 1996. p = provisional data. Many young people aged 25 years and under will be engaged in or seeking to gain employment. Employment also provides access to training and learning, and an analysis of employment and employment rates is therefore essential to understand engagement in training and learning opportunities in full.

This trend can be seen across the UK and is repeated for 13-year-olds. The proportion of 15-year-olds drinking weekly has fallen in recent years, such that in 2009/10 approaching two in five boys (36%) and one in three girls (30%) reported drinking this often. The dental health of 11 and 12-year-olds has improved in recent years. A considerable minority of adolescents are sexually active at age 15 or younger these figures have remained stable in recent years, while rates of chlamydia have risen among 15 to 24-year-olds. Rates of teenage pregnancy have remained stable in recent years. The rate of hospital admissions for self-harm in Wales have increased in recent years and are lower for boys than for girls, particularly among 15 to 17-year-olds. There is evidence that the suicide rate for 15 to 24-year-olds has declined in recent years, particularly among males, although the trend must be interpreted with some caution given the, thankfully, small number of suicides each year. Adolescent girls tend to rate their health less well than boys, while life satisfaction declines with age for girls but remains stable for boys. A considerable minority of children, adolescents and young adults are classified as overweight or obese. Fewer than one in three adolescents report eating fruit or vegetables daily, while less than half of older girls report eating breakfast daily. a Public Health Wales125This chapter focuses on Core Aim 3 of the Welsh Government's aims for children and young people in Wales. This aim seeks to ensure that 'every child should enjoy the best possible physical, mental, social and emotional health, including freedom from abuse, victimisation and exploitation'. It describes the physical, mental and emotional health of children and young people in Wales, including data across a range of lifestyle indicators, such as alcohol consumption and obesity, which are known to have a potentially deleterious impact on current and future health. It should be noted that, as Chapter 4 The Early Years covers children up to seven years of age, the focus of this chapter is on those aged from eight to 25. Many of the indicators presented here could be said to follow a deficits model of public health, focusing on those problems that policies need to tackle. While this deficits model is important, it should ideally be complemented by addressing assets, those factors that develop resilience and promote positive health and wellbeing1. The findings in this chapter should, therefore, not be seen in isolation from some of the assets or determinants of positive health captured elsewhere in the Monitor, such as participating in leisure activities, enjoying a positive school environment and ease of communication with family and friends. Specifically, the chapter reports on: health; lifestyle indicators; and abuse, victimisation and exploitation. 6.1 Health This section covers the following aspects of health: illness; dental health; sexual health; immunisation; self-reported health; and mental health and wellbeing. Illness According to the 2009 Welsh Health Survey (WHS), one in five (22%) children aged eight to 15 were reported as having a long-standing illness. The most commonly reported long-standing illnesses were asthma (8%), skin complaints (3%) and mental illness (3%).126Limiting long-standing illness (LLSI) is widely used as a measure of health status and has been shown to be an accurate predictor of early age mortality, psychological health and use of hospital services. According to the 2009 WHS, 7% of those aged eight to 15 were reported as having a LLSI. Dental health The dental health of 11 and 12-year-olds has improved in recent years. The standard measurement of tooth decay is the DMFT score (i.e. decayed, missing or filled teeth), the mean value of which has declined over the period 1988-89 to 2008/09 (Figure 6.1). The mean DMFT score of 0.98 for 2008-09 is statistically significantly lower than the mean DMFT of 1.09 recorded in 2004-05. Previous research has demonstrated an association between dental decay and deprivation among children2. The Welsh Government has set child poverty targets to improve the dental health of 12-year-olds in the most deprived fifth of the population. The aim is to reduce the average DMFT score from 1.3 to 1.1 by 2020 and to reduce the percentage with a DMFT of more than zero (at least one decayed, missing or filled tooth) from 54% (2004/05 baseline) to 46% by 2020. While the overall decline is to be welcomed, further analysis shows that the change between 2004/05 and 2008/09 for the most deprived fifth of the population was small and statistically non-significant. Focusing on this most deprived fifth of the population, the mean DMFT score declined from 1.35 to 1.31 and the proportion with a DMFT of more than zero fell from 54% to 52%.0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.0Mean DMFT score the Study of Community Dentistry (BASCD) P127The 2009/10 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study found that among 11 to 15-year-olds (school years seven to 11), approaching two in three boys and four in five girls reported brushing their teeth at least twice a day. These proportions increased with age. Among 11-year-olds, 61% of boys and 72% of girls reported brushing their teeth at least twice a day, while the equivalent figures among 15-year olds were 66% and 85%. The HBSC study uses the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) to measure socioeconomic inequality, with respondents falling into low, medium or high affluence groups3. For boys and girls, those from the most affluent backgrounds were more likely to brush their teeth regularly. Overall, for 11 to 15-year-olds, the proportions reporting regular tooth brushing were 64% for low FAS, 69% for middle FAS and 76% for high FAS. Sexual health Positive sexual health is a key component of both a healthy lifestyle and general wellbeing. Among adolescents, the issue of sexual health is complex, particularly given social norms around the appropriateness of sexual activity. However, being pragmatic, it is clear that a considerable minority of adolescents in Wales, and beyond, are sexually active and engaging in behaviours that leave them exposed to risks including early pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections4. Moreover, early sexual initiation has been linked to a range of negative outcomes including substance use, school drop-out, economic hardship and poor general wellbeing5. This section looks at sexual activity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), condom use and teenage pregnancy. Sexual activity The 2009/10 HBSC study found that among 15-year-olds in Wales, 28% of boys and 38% of girls reported having had sexual intercourse. These proportions are similar to those found in 2005/06 (30% for boys, 41% for girls). As was the case in 2005/06, there was no association between experience of sexual intercourse and family affluence in the most recent findings6. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study the participants talked easily about girlfriends and boyfriends as well as same-sex relationships. However having a girlfriend or boyfriend had different meanings for participants, particularly across the different age groups. There was a clear gender split in the responses amongst those similarly aged, reflecting an earlier maturation of girls as the following quotes illustrate. \"Yeah it's fine, everyone has like normally has a girlfriend and whatever...since year five really.\" (Joshua, 14)128\"I don't tend to have girlfriends really, just make people laugh.\" (Cameron, 13) \"The whole boyfriend and girlfriend thing has started to come around in my year and just a few people have them.\" (Dylan, 12) While pre- (and early) teenaged boys avoided the subject of sex, some of the girls were less reticent to broach the subject. \"We learnt about that (sex) in RE...but I don't want to have sex until I am at least 16 or 17.\" (Meredith 13) Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Whilst there are known limitations on data concerning STIs, it is clear that there has been an increase in reported cases and that young people are most likely to be affectedb. The data presented here are based on the number of STIs treated at Genito-Urinary (GUM) clinics across Wales. Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in the UK. Chlamydia has important implications for future reproductive health since it is estimated that between 10% and 15% of untreated infected women go on to develop pelvic inflammatory disease which can result in infertility. Chlamydia can be symptom- free, especially in women7. Between 1995 and 2008, the number of reported cases amongst 15 to 24-year-olds in Wales increased from 192 to 758 per 100,000 population (Figure 6.2). This rate of increase far outweighs that of other age groups. It should be noted that increased awareness and diagnostic techniques may well have contributed to this increase in reporting over recent years. b It should be noted that barriers to STI surveillance in Wales remain, such as the inability to produce statistics at local health board level. A project to tackle these barriers and develop and implement timely, person and area-based STI surveillance is currently underway across Wales. For further details see Public Health Wales (2010). HIV and STI trends in Wales. Surveillance Report, March 2010. Cardiff: Public Health Wales and Welsh Assembly Government. Sexual Health and Well Being Action Plan for Wales . Cardiff: Welsh Assembly Government.129After chlamydia, gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK. Rates have increased since the early 1990s, although the trend is rather more erratic and there has been a decline since 2004 back to the levels reported around the start of the decade (Figure 6.3). In 2008, more than half (56%) of a total of 403 cases of reported gonorrhoea in Wales involved young people aged 15 to 24.Figure 6.2: Reports of uncomplicated chlamydia from GUM clinics in Wales (1995-2008) 0100200300400500600700800 15-24 years All AgesRate per 100,000 population 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Year Source: Public Health Wales Figure 6.3: Reports of uncomplicated gonorrhoea from GUM clinics in Wales (1995-2008) 02040608010012015-24 years All AgesRate per 100,000 population 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Year Source: Public Health Wales 130Condom use Using a condom reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy and contracting an STI. The 2009/10 HBSC study found that, of sexually active 15-year-olds in Wales, 86% of boys and 79% of girls said they had used a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse. These proportions are slightly higher than those found in 2005/06 - 82% of boys and 71% of girls. Teenage pregnancy The UK has the highest levels of teenage pregnancy in Western Europe, with implications for the physical, emotional and socioeconomic wellbeing of young mothers and their children8. While for some young people becoming a parent will be a positive experience, it is also associated with poor health and social outcomes, including postnatal depression and failure to complete education. Children born to young parents are less likely to be breastfed, more likely to live in poverty and to become a young parent themselves9. That said, there is a strong association between rates of teenage pregnancy and socioeconomic circumstances, such that it is difficult to disentangle the precise impact of early parenthood over and above other prevailing factors. Data for 2008 show that conception rates for those aged 15-19, 15-17 and 13-15 have fallen slightly since the late 1990s (Figure 6.4). Looking at data for 13 to 15 year-olds, aggregated across 2006 to 2008, the conception rate was 8.3 per 1,000 population in Wales, compared with 7.8 per 1,000 population in England. Rates do vary by government region in England such that the figure for Wales is slightly lower than London (8.7), the North West (8.9), Yorkshire and the Humber (9.6) and the North East (10.5).131* Rate per 1,000 female residents aged 15-19 ** Rate per 1,000 female residents aged 15-17 *** Rate per 1,000 female residents aged 13-15 The Child Poverty Strategy for Wales includes the rate of teenage conceptions among young people aged under 16 as an indicator of progress. Analysis presented in a recent update shows a small decline has been seen in the most deprived fifth of people, falling from 12.14 to 11.97 per 1,000 between 2002-2006 and 2004-2008. Immunisation During 2009/10, 61.1% of 16-year-olds in Wales had received the 3 in 1 Td/ IPV vaccine, which boosts protection against tetanus, diphtheria and polio into adulthood and is usually administered between 13 and 16 years of age. Coverage of a complete two dose course of MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella in this age group, was 84.2%. Coverage of a complete three-dose course of HPV vaccine in 14-year-old girls during 2009/10 was 85.3%. HPV vaccine protects against cervical cancer associated with Human Papilloma Virus types 16 and 18 and is usually administered to girls during school year eight10. Self-reported health Data on the self-reported health of young people in Wales are available from two sources. The first is the WHS, which includes questions on self-rated health for children and young adults, albeit with slightly different scales ('excellent', Figure 6.4: Teenage conception rates by age group, Wales (1992-2008) 01020304050607080 Under 20* Under 18**Conception rate 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2008Under 16*** 2005 2006 2007 Year Source: Office for National Statistics P132'very good', 'good', eight to 15-year-olds). The proportions reporting their health to be at least 'good' in 2009 was 94% for eight to 15-year-olds and men and women aged 16-24. Among the 16 to 24-year-olds, men were more likely than women to report their health as 'excellent' with 37% and 25%, respectively, responding this way. Similar data are also available from the HBSC study, although these are not strictly comparable with the WHS, as a four point scale is used, with respondents asked to choose one of 'excellent', 'good', 'fair' or 'poor'. As can be seen in Figure 6.5, boys were more likely than girls to report their health as 'good' or 'excellent' in 2009/10. The percentage of girls reporting 'good' or 'excellent' health declines with age but stays fairly constant among boys. Combining data across the age and gender groups shows that those from the most affluent backgrounds are more likely to report 'good' or 'excellent' health - 81% of the most affluent compared to 68% of the least affluent. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, participants did not perceive health as an issue until they, or a significant other, became ill. Older children tended to associate their own health with engagement in health-related activities, as the following quotes illustrate:0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.5: Percentage reporting their health to be 'good' Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 132133\"I feel fine like but I do a lot of sports outside of school and that but I've finished doing more inside, instead of just the one hour a week of PE, I just like do two hours.\" (Drew, 15) \"Oh God I'm not very healthy at all. I eat all the wrong foods.\" (Brooke, 17) (Do you feel healthy?) \"No, because I smoke.\" (Gwen, 19) In the 2009/10 HBSC study, pupils were also asked how often in the previous six months they had experienced any of the following eight symptoms: head ache; stomach ache; back ache; feeling low; irritability bad temper; feeling nervous; difficulties in getting to sleep; and feeling dizzy. The proportions reporting two or more symptoms at least weekly was stable across age groups for boys but increased with age for girls. By 15-years-old, 21% of boys and 37% of girls reported experiencing symptoms this frequently. Among 15-year-olds, the most commonly reported symptoms were irritability or bad temper (18% of boys, 27% of girls), difficulties in sleeping (16% of boys, 25% of girls) and head ache (10% of boys, 26% of girls). In addition, those in the least affluent households were more likely to report frequent symptoms than those in the most affluent (36% compared with 24% among 11 to 15 year-olds). These findings are similar to those found in 2005/06. Indeed, previous HBSC research has shown that these differences by age, gender and socioeconomic circumstances exist across participating countries6. Mental health and wellbeing Mental wellbeing underpins good quality of life, with young people who are happy more likely to enjoy good quality of life into adulthood. Indeed, the importance of mental health and wellbeing is clear given its influence on so many facets of life, including self-esteem, school attendance, educational performance and risk taking behaviours11. In terms of mental health problems, children and young people's experiences vary by gender and age. Boys are more likely to experience conduct disorders and girls are more likely to experience emotional problems, increasing with age. 134Mental illness is an important factor linked to suicide and self-harm12. The link between poverty and mental wellbeing among adolescents should also be recognised13. Life satisfaction among young people in Wales continues to be measured through the HBSC study, using a scale (Cantril ladder14) such that zero represents the worst possible life and ten the best possible life. Life satisfaction declines slightly with age for girls and remains fairly constant for boys, as can be seen in Figure 6.6, using a score of six or more to represent being reasonably satisfied with life. The HBSC study also uses the KIDSCREEN-10 Index for measuring adolescent mental health and wellbeing15. Analysis of data from 15 countries, including the UK, confirms this pattern of lower mental health and wellbeing scores being found for females. The gender difference increases with age and for those in households of lower socioeconomic status16. The incidence of mental health problems amongst looked after children in Wales is much higher than for children in the general population. The most recent figures date back to 2002/03, showing that almost half (49%) of five to 10-year-olds being looked after were recorded as having a mental disorder, compared with 6% in the general population. The corresponding proportions for 11 to 15-year-olds were 40% and 12%, respectively. The most common disorder was conduct disorder, followed by emotional disorders and hyperactivity17. These rates are based on the ICD-10 Classification of Mental 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.6: Percentage reporting high life satisfaction by age and sex, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys Age878587 8486 (HBSC) study 135and Behavioural Disorders with strict impairment criteria such that the disorders have a major impact on daily life. Analysis of UK data shows that children looked after by local authorities have higher levels of psychopathology, educational difficulties and neurodevelopmental disorders, having adjusted for educational and physical factors. Psychiatric disorder is particularly high where individuals have experienced numerous changes of placement18. Further data on the health of looked after children should soon become available through the Children in Need (CiN) census in Wales which began in March 2010 and will be included as appropriate in future Monitorsc. Self-harm Self-harm, also commonly referred to as self-injury, self-wounding and parasuicide, is more common among adolescents and young people, typically taking the form of cutting, severe scratching, burning or hitting. Most who self-harm use more than one method. Reasons for self-harming include alleviating negative emotions, expressing anger and seeking help from others19. It has been shown to be predictive of future suicide attempts, although most will not go on to commit suicide12. Figure 6.7 shows the rate of hospital admissions for self-harm per 100,000 population in Wales for boys and girls. In general, rates have increased in recent years and are lower for boys than for girls, particularly among 15 to17-year-olds. It should be noted that, as these data relate to hospital admissions, cases of self-harm that are not treated at hospital are not included. c Further detail on the dataset and guidance on the Children in Need census can be found at http://wales.gov.uk/cssiwsubsite/newcssiw/publications/ourfindings/allwales/2009/ cincensus2010/?lang=en, including the text of Circular WAGC 15/2009.01002003004005006007008009001,000Males 10-14 Males 15-17 Males 18-24RateFigure 6.7: Continuous periods of hospital care with any mention of self-harm, Wales residents, rate per 100,000 (1999-2008) Public Health Wales using Patient Episode Database Wales (PEDW) and mid-year estimates, Office for National Statistics136Suicide While the factors behind each case of suicide are complex, evidence suggests that there are important risk and protective factors. Risk factors include mental illness, self-harming behaviour, substance misuse, epilepsy, certain personality traits, unemployment and poverty/deprivation20. International data suggest that suicide rates in the UK are relatively low, although variations in reporting procedures might have an impact. In Wales, suicide accounts for around 300 deaths a year, accounting for some one in five deaths among males aged 15-24 and one in ten among females in this age group. In 2004-06, the suicide rate in Wales was higher than the UK average, although the highest rate was found in Scotland21. As can be seen in figure 6.8, the most recently available data for 15 to 24-year-olds indicate that young males are more likely to commit suicide than their female counterparts, with rates per 100,000 population of 10.5 and 3.4, respectively, in 2006-08. There is evidence that this rate has declined in recent years, particularly among males, although the trend must be interpreted with some caution given the, thankfully, small number of suicides each year. The most common method of attempting suicide among young men is hanging and for young women it is self poisoning, which is less likely to prove fatal12. 051015202530Male FemaleRateFigure 6.8: Suicide rates per 100,000 by Public Health Wales using Office for National Statistics Annual District Deaths Extract (ADDE) data1376.2 Lifestyle indicators It is established that lifestyle can have a significant impact on current and future health and wellbeing, including that of children and young people. This section focuses on the following lifestyle indicators: weight; diet; smoking; and the use of alcohol and drugs. Physical activity is covered in Chapter 7 Access to Play, Leisure, Sport and Culture . Weight The increasing trend in overweight and obesity presents a serious public health challenge, with recent estimates suggesting that around one in five children and adolescents in the European Union are overweight or obese22. This has implications for health-related quality of life during adolescence and the future burden of disease23. Less attention has been paid to monitoring under-nutrition, which also poses a major public health problem internationally24. Previously published international comparisons using HBSC data have shown that rates of overweight and obesity among adolescents are higher in a small group of countries including Wales, with the primary factors associated with overweight being lack of regular breakfast consumption and vigorous physical activity25. The introduction of a comprehensive programme for measuring childhood height and weight to estimate overweight and obesity is planned in Wales in autumn 2011, following a feasibility study. In the meantime, while data collection mechanisms have their limitations and different methods of calculating levels of overweight and obesity and thinness are usedd, the information available suggests that a substantial minority of children and young people in Wales are overweight or obese. Using objective height and weight measurements of children and young people aged between two and 15 years of age, the 2009 WHS found that around one in three children (34%) were overweight or obese and one in five (19%) were obese, with no difference by gender. Whilst not comparable with these measures, self-reported height and weight is available for young adults from the WHS and in 2009, 33% of men and 28% of women aged 16-24 were overweight or obese, with 10% of both sexes obese. Further analysis of WHS data for these young adults also shows a clear social patterning, with the proportions obese highest where households are headed by d Note that for children in the Welsh Health Survey, the 85th and 95th percentiles of the age and sex-specific 1990 UK BMI reference curves were used as cut-offs for estimating overweight and obesity, respectively. Estimates are not comparable with those based on different measures. For instance, in the HBSC study overweight and obesity are estimated using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-points, which tend to produce lower estimates. This IOTF approach is outlined in Cole et al., 2000. Establishing a standard definition of child overweight and obesity world wide: international survey. BMJ, 320, 1240-1243. This work has recently been developed to address thinness in Cole et al., 2007. Body mass index cut-offs to define thinness in children and adolescents: international survey. BMJ, 335:94. The use of these IOTF cut-points is recommended for use in comparative international work such as the HBSC study. P138those in routine or manual occupations and in more deprived areas. It should also be noted that 6% of men and 8% of women aged 16-24 were classified as being underweight. Self-reported data are also available from the HBSC study and in 2009/10, it can be seen that among 11 to 15-year-olds, no clear age or gender pattern emerges (Figure 6.9). There is also no association with family affluence. Previous validation work on Welsh HBSC data suggests that these estimates are likely to be conservative, as adolescents tend to overestimate height and underestimate weight26. Further analysis of HBSC data indicates that at age 11, around 8% of boys and 7% of girls are estimated to be thin. By age 15, the figures are 2% and 4%, respectively. Diet A healthy diet during adolescence is important to avoid immediate health problems, such as weight gain leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes or problems associated with being underweight, including anaemia and fatigue. Moreover, young people who develop healthy eating behaviours early in life are more likely to maintain them into adulthood27,28. The 2009/10 HBSC survey found that around one in three 11 to 15-year-olds in Wales report eating fruit and/or vegetables on a daily basis (Figures 6.10 and 6.11). These proportions are slightly higher for girls and among younger age groups. In addition, fruit and vegetable consumption rises with affluence. 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.9: Percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds overweight or obese, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys 21 16 1721 19 18 22 1523 14 Age Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 139For example, looking across the age and gender groups, among those young people in the highest affluence group, 36% reported eating fruit and vegetables daily. Among their counterparts in the lowest affluence group, the corresponding proportions were 23% for fruit and 21% for vegetables. Reported frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption and social patterning was similar to that found in 2005/066. Whilst not strictly comparable with the WHS data reported in Chapter 4 The Early Years , it is clear that fruit and vegetable consumption drops substantially from the early years into adolescence. 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.10: Fruit consumption, by age and sex, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys 34 37 3334 2933 study 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.11: Vegetable consumption, by age and sex, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys 2733 3034 30 33 29 293031 Age Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 140WHS data for young adults are also available for fruit and vegetable consumption during the previous day, showing that one in three (33% of men and 32% of women) aged 16 to 24 met government guidance to eat at least five portions of fruit and/or vegetables each day in 2009. Breakfast consumption is another important aspect of diet, with evidence suggesting that it can aid concentration and reduce snacking during the day29,30. Prior research undertaken as part of the evaluation of the Primary School Free Breakfast Initiative in Wales has shown a relationship between skipping breakfast and snack consumption31. Previous HBSC research using Welsh data has also shown an association between higher levels of obesity and skipping breakfast32. HBSC data for 2009/10 suggest that older children and girls are more likely to skip breakfast during weekdays. The proportions eating this meal daily falls from 69% of boys and 67% of girls aged 11 to 56% and 40%, respectively, aged 15. Those reporting higher levels of family affluence were most likely to eat breakfast daily, with 60% eating the meal compared to 52% in the low and 53% in the middle affluence groups. These findings are similar to those found in 2005/066. Smoking While smoking remains the single greatest cause of preventable death and ill health in Wales, it also brings with it a range of immediate health problems for young people, such as respiratory problems and decreased fitness levels33. Smoking behaviour is commonly established during adolescence and in 2009/10 around one in six boys (16%) and one in five girls (22%) aged 15 reported first smoking at age 13 or younger. Figure 6.12 presents HBSC data for the period 1990 to 2009 and shows that smoking among 15-year-olds remains more prevalent among girls but has continued to decline since its peak in the late 1990s among both sexes. This trend can be seen across the UK and is repeated for 13-year-olds. Regular smoking is reported by very few below this agee. Data are also available for smoking within the last 30 days and while the proportions, not surprisingly, are higher, the same age and gender pattern emerges. For example, among 15-year-olds, one in five boys (18%) and one in four girls (25%) reported smoking in the last 30 days. Rates of smoking decline with higher levels of family affluence, such that across 11 to 15-year-olds, 9% from the least affluent families report regular smoking, compared with 5% from the most affluent. While smoking rates in the adult population have declined in recent years, WHS data show that among 16 to 24-year-olds, just over one in four (27% of men and 28% of women) still smoke, with around one in five (20% of men and 22% of women) being daily smokers. e Smith, M.P. et al., 2010 United Kingdom Health Statistics Edition No: 4 Newport: ONS.141In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, the vast majority of participants reported that they did not, and had never, smoked. Anti-smoking attitudes were prevalent and many had sophisticated knowledge of what smoking can cause. The general consensus seemed to be that it was no longer 'cool' to smoke. \"I think a lot more people now are starting to realise that it's not cool because it used to be sort of you know people would get pressured into it and to an extent there is still a little bit of that but more people are just like 'why are you doing it?', it seems very unhealthy, I've personally never been pressured into smoking and I've never been tempted to try it. I know one of my younger friends started smoking because she thought it would make her feel bigger, more cool, but I don't think a lot of people really think that any more, I think that the attitude is definitely changing because of all the things we've done, especially lower down in the school about awareness of how it affects you. We've done these things in science where you there is like the cigarette machines and it shows you like all the tar and everything that comes out and it's really horrible.\" (Charlotte, 17) Alcohol For young people, excessive drinking is associated with a number of health risks. These range from immediate harm through alcohol overdose or injuries related to alcohol consumption, immediate harm to others, particularly through drink driving or injury to longer-term problems associated with establishing an inappropriate drinking pattern early in life34. Figure 6.12: Weekly smoking among 15-year-olds, Wales (1990-2009) 020406080100Boys GirlsPercentage 1990 Year1994 1998 2002 2006 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 142Drinking weekly is often used as an indicator of regular alcohol consumption, and data from the HBSC study show that significant numbers drink this frequently. As can be seen in Figure 6.13, the proportion of 15-year-olds drinking weekly has fallen in recent years, such that in 2009/10 approaching two in five boys (36%) and one in three girls (30%) reported drinking this often. In addition to measuring frequency, it is also important to measure the volume of alcohol consumed. While data are currently lacking for the volume of alcohol consumed by adolescents in Wales, it is possible to use drunkenness as a proxy measure for large amounts being consumed on a single occasion. As can be seen from Figure 6.14, the proportions reporting drunkenness on four or more occasions in their lifetime increases with age. By age 15, 24% of boys and 28% of girls report having been drunk on four or more occasions in their lifetime. In addition, 36% of boys and 42% of girls reported being drunk in the last 30 days. Further analysis of HBSC data indicates that, among this 15-year-old age group, 18% of boys and 19% of girls reported first being drunk at age 13 or younger. This is particularly important given evidence that alcohol dependence in adulthood is less likely if initiation is delayed35. In contrast to many other risk behaviours, young people from more affluent backgrounds were more likely to report weekly drinking. For drunkenness, there was no overall difference by level of affluence, although a gender difference does emerge. Boys of lower affluence and girls of higher affluence were more likely to report this frequency of drunkenness. Among 16 to 24-year-olds, WHS data show that one in two men (50%) and two in five women (38%) report drinking alcohol at least weekly, with similar Figure 6.13: Percentage drinking alcohol weekly among 15-year-olds, Wales (1990-2009) 020406080100PercentageGirlsBoys 1990 Year1994 1998 2002 2006 2009 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 143proportions - 51% of men and 43% of women - reporting they had drunk above recommended daily guidelines on at least one day in the last weekf. People aged under 20 account for almost one in ten of all referrals for treatment for alcohol problems in Wales. In 2009/10, there were 218 young people under 15 years of age and 1,031 aged 15 to 19 receiving treatment for an alcohol problem. Hospital admission data for an alcohol-related diagnosis show that among under-15s, admissions are higher for females than males. In 2009, there were 68 admissions with a primary specific alcohol diagnosis for boys and 95 for girls, down slightly on the figures reported for 2005 (81 for boys and 146 for girls). This gender pattern is reversed for admissions relating to older age groups36,37. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, participants aged 18 and over, associated increased alcohol consumption with nights on the town, and talked about their experience of peer pressure to conform to high levels of consumption. \"Drinking, I think everyone does that at our age. I can't think of anyone who doesn't...on the peak times it would be like twice a week, proper drinking... probably like go over someone's house with like eight cans or something then when you get into town buy some drinks. But we're only 18 so we don't need as much as a 25-year-old.\" (Jake, 18)0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 6.14: Drunkenness on four or more occasions by age and sex, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys Age31 2 36916202428 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study f The Department of Health guidelines on sensible drinking suggest that men should not drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol per day and women not more than 2-3 units a day. For the purposes of the analysis using Welsh Health Survey data, drinking above the guidelines refers to more than 4 units for men and 3 for women on the heaviest drinking day of the week. 144Drug use Cannabis use among adolescents is a cause of concern for a range of reasons, including short and long-term psychological problems and the potential for dependence in adulthood6. Research shows that cannabis is the most widely- used drug by adolescents in Wales. Data from the 2009/10 HBSC study indicate that, among 15-year-olds, around one in five report having ever used cannabis, slightly smaller proportions for use in the last 12 months and around one in ten for use within the last 30 days (Table 6.1). Table 6.1: Percentage of 15-year-olds reporting cannabis use by sex, Wales (2009/10) Lifetime Last 12 months Last 30 days Boys 20 17 9 Girls 18 15 8 All 15-year-olds 19 16 9 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study A number of young people under 20 years of age are referred to receive treatment for drug problems36. In 2009/10, 134 males and 46 females aged under 15 years and 891 males and 331 females aged 15 to 19 were referred for treatment. This total of 1,402 referrals accounts for some 13% of all those received by treatment service agencies. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, there was little discussion about drugs. For younger children, drugs were primarily associated with medication, and to a lesser extent, sport. For the older participants, taking drugs was described as a matter of choice rather than availability. \"I don't touch drugs neither.\" (Isaac, 16) \"I don't touch drugs only cigarettes.\" (Aaron, 15) \"I've been brought up the right way not to touch drugs and that.\" (Isaac, 16) \"And me.\" (Aaron, 15) (Are there a lot of drugs about?) \"Oh yeah, if we wanted to then we could.\" (Aaron, 15)1456.3 Abuse, victimisation and exploitation There is a body of evidence emerging that individuals reporting maltreatment during childhood are more likely to be at risk of a range of immediate and longer-term physical and mental health problems38, 39.This is particularly so where 'toxic stress' caused by abuse and neglect is found40. For example, research under the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study has shown that breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction is related to multiple risk factors for a number of the leading causes of death among adults, including substance use and dependence, depression and suicide, sexually transmitted infections, physical inactivity and obesity41. Such child maltreatment can take many forms and occur in a variety of settings including the home, other care locations, schools and public places. Maltreatment may present itself in different ways to health professionals and having identified a problem, it may still be difficult to act on what is found42. At population level, data limitations mean that painting a picture of the extent of the problem is far from easy. In a recent review of the burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries, it is suggested that every year 4% to 16% of children are physically abused, one in ten is subject to neglect or psychological abuse while around one in six is exposed to some form of sexual abuse39. Research on child maltreatment has previously been undertaken at UK level. For example, a random probability survey of young adults (18-24) in 2000 found that 7% of the sample could be classified as having suffered from serious abuse by parents or carers, while 6% were assessed as suffering serious absence of care43. This research also highlights the association between poverty and child maltreatment44. A partial assessment is possible in Wales, drawing on data from Child Protection Registers. These data provide an estimate of the number of children at risk of neglect or abuse such that interagency support is necessary. It is important to note, therefore, that the data do not provide estimates of the number of children actually being neglected or abused. Additional care should be taken when interpreting these data, given that the registers are tools for Social Services Departments and Local Safeguarding Children Boards and were not designed to collect statistical information. In addition, management practices may vary between departments. As can be seen in Figure 6.15, there were 2,700 children (including unborn children) on child protection registers in Wales as at 31 March 2010. This represents an increase of 9% compared with a year earlier and gives a rate of 43 children per 10,000 population aged under 18. For boys and girls, the most common reason for being on a register was neglect, which related to 43% of children, followed by emotional abuse found with 27% of children.14605001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000Number 2001Figure 6.15: Number of children on child protection registers at 31 March, Wales (2001-2010) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Year Source: Welsh child protection registers147References 1.

On the other hand, the proportions of young people using a computer for playing games and other purposes increased. The proportions of young people spending four or more evenings per week with friends has declined between 2005/06 and 2009/10 in all ages. The age pattern differs between boys and girls. There is a gradual trend for fewer hours of teacher time being spent on extra-curricular physical education activities. The proportion of pupils taking part in club sport has increased gradually during the past 10 years. A slightly higher proportion of pupils aged seven to 11 participated in regular club sport than secondary school aged children (11-16). The number of free public swims for those aged 16 and under in Wales fell from 808,000 in 2004/05 to 569,000 in 2009/10 a drop of 29.6%. The downward trend was consistent apart from a small rise in 2008/09. This is due primarily to the increased focus on structured activity and skill development within the Free Swimming Programme. Arts attendance and participation have both on the whole increased in the last two years for seven to 18-year-olds with more girls than boys attending/participating and more children and young people from higher socioeconomic groups attending/participating. Physical activity decreases with age among both boys and girls. Over three quarters of pupils aged 11-16 take part in extra-curricular sport and physical recreation. a Play Wales. b Arts Council of Wales. c Sport Wales. 152153This chapter focuses on Core Aim 4 of the Welsh Government's aims for children and young people in Wales. This seeks 'that all children should have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities'. Specifically, the chapter reports on: play; leisure; sport; culture. 7.1 Play The current definition of play adopted by the Welsh Government is as follows : \"Play encompasses children's behaviour which is freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated. It is performed for no external goal or reward, and is a fundamental and integral part of healthy development - not only for individual children, but also for the society in which they live.\"1 From the literature there appear to be two important reasons why children and young people play, for fun and to develop. Play helps children to develop physically, cognitively, emotionally and socially. It is agreed that play continues throughout childhood and adolescence but that the type of play changes. Some play behaviours which older children engage in such as 'hanging out', can be seen to be important for their development of an identity and social skills2. It is widely agreed that play is an essential part of children's development and a fundamental part of their lives3. There are recognised benefits of play both immediate, such as pleasure, and delayed, such as good development4. Some gender differences in the types of play practised by young children have been identified with girls tending to prefer passive and domestic types of play, such as dolls and playing house, and boys preferring more active types of play such as construction. How these gender differences develop is less clear. Despite this agreement that play is important, definitions which are amenable to measurement are difficult to find. For this reason some of the indicators presented in this section are 'proxy indicators' but are, nevertheless important steps in developing our knowledge of play and wellbeing. Information from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) on having fun with family and having lots of friends is provided in Chapter 4 The Early Years .154Play association projects There are ten regional play association projects covering Wales, but there is currently no Wales-wide data and research. These projects have mapped and audited play provision in each local authority area. This is a first attempt to bring together and compare current local priorities in play provision5. Activities with friends Spending time with friends is an important aspect of most young people's lives. There is strong evidence that, for older children, spending time with their friends in the evenings may be linked with risk behaviours6. The most recent data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study found that boys are more likely than girls to spend four or more evenings per week with their friends. The proportions who do this are 42% and 35% respectively. However the proportions of young people spending four or more evenings per week with friends has declined between 2005/06 and 2009/10 in all ages. The age pattern differs between boys and girls. The proportion of boys spending four or more evenings per week with friends increases by age, while 14-year-old girls are most likely to report that they spend four evenings or more with friends (38%), followed by 15-year-olds (33%) and 11-year-olds (30%). Spending time out with friends in the evenings is significantly associated with family affluence. Those with lower family affluence are more likely to spend time out with friends in the evening7. 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 7.1: Percentage of young people who spend four or more evenings per week with their friends, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14 15GirlsBoys Age38 3041 155The MCS found that 81% of seven-year-olds in Wales spend time with friends outside of school at least once or twice a week. Children from disadvantaged areas were more likely to do this than their counterparts in non-disadvantaged areas. Ninety-one per cent report that they like to play with their friends 'a lot'. The children were also asked how much they liked playing sports and games outside and inside. Seventy-two per cent reported that they liked playing outside 'a lot' - 75% of boys and 68% of girls - and 50% reported that they liked playing inside 'a lot' - 51% of boys and 48% of girls. 7.2 Leisure The MCS provides information on the percentage of seven-year-olds in Wales attending various activities in the last 12 months before their interview in 2008. The most popular activities were visiting the cinema, visiting a zoo or aquarium and attending a play or a musical performance. Around 80% of seven-year-olds attended such activities in the last 12 months. The proportion of girls and boys attending these events was broadly similar. According to the MCS, the only activity where there was a significant difference in attendance levels by gender was visiting sporting events, with 39% of boys attending sporting events in the last 12 months, compared to only 15% of girls. 0102030405060708090100Percentage Play/musicFigure 7.2: Percentage of seven-year-old children visiting various cultural activities, Wales Art gallery/ museumTheme park Cinema Sporting 647981 41% of MCS children 'never', or 'almost never', visited library. Sixty one per cent 'never', or 'almost never', attended a religious serviced with a further 11% attending at least once a year. The Sport Wales Active Young People Survey asked whether children aged seven to 11 have been to various leisure and sports facilities during the last year (Figure 7.3). The most frequently used venue was a park, with 92% of children reporting that they had been to a park in the last year. Eighty-eight per cent had been to a swimming pool and 81% had used playing fields. Thirty-six per cent had been to a skate park and 35% visited an ice rink. There was little difference in use by gender. Furthermore, according to the same survey, 80% of 11 to 16-year-olds had been to a leisure centre in 2009. Around 45% went regularly, defined as once a week or more often. There was little gender difference in overall leisure centre visits, but boys were more likely to go regularly - 47% compared with 43% of girls. Electronic media usage According to HBSC, 70% of boys and 67% of girls in Wales watch television for two or more hours each weekday. The proportion increases between the ages of 11 (60%) and 13 (71%) years (Figure 7.4). A significantly higher proportion of boys (59%) compared to girls (30%) reported that they play computer games for at least two hours per day. This level of d Outside of school.0102030405060708090100Percentage ParkFigure 7.3: Use of facilities for sport and exercise in the past year, children aged seven to 11, Wales (2009) Swimming poolPlaying eldTen-pin bowling alleySkatepark Playground Ice rink Activity92 8887 81 59 3635 Source: Sport Wales Active Young People Survey157game playing increases slightly between ages 11 (44%) and 13 (49%) year olds, then decreases between 13 and 15 (39%). Half of boys (51%) and 61% of girls reported using computers for activities such as chatting on-line, internet, emailing or homework, for at least two hours each weekday. The proportion rises with age with significant increase between ages 11 (43%) and 13 (60%). It is interesting to note that the proportion of young people watching television for at least two hours each weekday evening has declined between 2005/06 and 2009/10 in all ages by 4 to 5 percentage points. However, the proportion using computers for playing games and other purposes has increased in all ages. * or a games console. ** for chatting on-line, emails, internet, homework. As part of its 2009 Media Literacy Audit8, Ofcom collected data on the media activity children in Wales would miss the most if it were taken away. Around 55% said that they would miss television the most, 14% selected computer or video games and 7% said they would miss the internet most. In the same study, children who used the internet were asked about their internet activities in the previous week. Over two thirds had used the internet for schoolwork purposes, while around half had used it for both social networking and games. HBSC electronic media communication (EMC) data have been analysed. EMC includes contacting friends by means of phone, text-messaging and the internet. They conclude that EMC increased in all UK countries between 2001/02 and 2005/06. The results suggest that EMC amongst young people facilitates rather than supersedes face-to-face contact. 0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 7.4: Percentage of young people spending at least two hours watching TV, playing computer games, using a computer on weekdays, Wales (2009/10) 12 14 15 13Playing computer games*Watching (HBSC) study 158The higher the frequency of EMC, the higher the number of afternoons and evenings spent with friends. The use of EMC increased with age and was more common among girls than boys. This was true for Wales and all of the participating countries. In 2005/06, the figures using EMC on five or more days per week in Wales were 45.9% for 11-year-olds, 59.5% for 13-year-olds and 65.8% for 15-year-olds9. According to the MCS in Wales, when children were aged seven: 21% of them had their own mobile phone. 63% watched between one and three hours of television, video or DVDs on week days. 62% had a television in their bedroom with 55% having rules about how much they could watch in one day. 78% of MCS families had internet access at home and of these 81% of children used the internet at home. 80% of all children had access to a computer at home. Of these 53% spent one hour or less on the computer each day. 13% had their own computer. 83% of boys and 62% of girls had access to a games console with 66% of boys and 50% of girls having their own games console. According to the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, children were very familiar with information technology at a young age: \"(I like) my Wii.\" (Daniel, 6) \"I have my iPod...my dad has an iPhone.\" (Charlie, 5) The computer, in particular was seen to be an important part of the young people's lives. \"Computer, without that you couldn't live, because...I go on the Internet like YouTube and stuff things online but be really careful and you can go on lots of games...see videos of animals and rich people.\" (Evan, 8) \"My favourite thing would be probably be my laptop I just like to go on the internet and like search things and see what's going on there is like loads of games everywhere that I can click on a link and it will take me to this game it's quite cool...I used to go on club penguin (when I was younger) but I don't any more.\" (Harry, 10)159\"I do spend about an hour and sometimes more each night on my laptop, I do use it for my college work a lot more at the moment and I email friends and things.\" (Erin, 16) \"Like with Facebook. Although it might say you've got 230 friends, a lot of those might be acquaintances. But it is a good way of keeping in touch - if you lose their telephone numbers. Skype is especially good with for example (good friend in Wales) and (other friend in Kent). It's a good way of communicating. Especially as they work shifts and it's someone I can see and communicate with in the day. It's really good that I can communicate sort of physically with them during the day.\" (Tom, 22) Outdoor recreation The Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission Wales jointly commissioned the 2008 Welsh Outdoor Recreation Survey. This survey collected information on people's use of the outdoors, places visited, motivations for using the outdoors, barriers to visiting the outdoors and the 'latent demand' for outdoor recreation. Outdoor activities include walking on roadside pavements or tracks, accessing woodlands, forests, local parks, open spaces, seaside etc. Young people aged 16-24 generally visited the outdoors more often than adults of all ages. Around a half of 16 to 24-year-olds visited the outdoors once a day or more during the summer months, compared with around 36% of all adults. Around 10% of young people aged 16-24 visited the outdoors less than once a week in summer. The equivalent figure for the winter months was 20%. The most popular reasons cited by young people for visiting the outdoors were for health or exercise, to exercise a dog, for fresh air, to enjoy pleasant weather and to enjoy, and participate in, a hobby. On their most recent visit to the outdoors, slightly more than a half of young people went with friends, less than a quarter went with family, and less than a quarter went alone. 7.3 Sport Physical activity is very important for both children and young people's development and health. Sport is one aspect of physical activity and, as well as being important for such activity, it is also important for fun and for developing social skills. Current physical activity guidelines recommend that children and young people should have at least 60 minutes of physical activity of at least 160moderate intensity at least five days a week. Sport is one of the ways in which this target can be met. Sport and physical activity amongst seven-year-olds According to the MCS, 71% of seven-year-olds in Wales go to a club or class at least once a week for sport or physical activity. In addition, 94% of them take part in physical activity with friends and siblings outside of a club or class at least once a week. At this age, there is very little difference in the levels reported for boys and girls. Physical activity amongst secondary school pupils According to the 2009/10 HBSC study, 24% of boys and 15% of girls in Wales undertook 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. As with earlier surveys, boys are more likely than girls to be active in all age groups (see Figure 7.5). The proportions active for at least an hour a day decline with age among both boys and girls, and, by the age of 15, only a fifth of boys and around one in ten girls report this level of activity. There is some evidence to suggest that young women have some negative attitudes to physical education (PE) in school, including not liking the changing facilities or the kit they have to wear10. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, the participants reported taking part in a wide range of sporting and physical activity, both inside and outside of school, as the following exchange highlights:0102030405060708090100Percentage 11Figure 7.5: Percentage of young people who report at least one hour of moderate to vigorous activity daily, Wales (2009/10) 12 13 14GirlsBoys 15 Age27 2127 1923 Children (HBSC) study 161\"I do Taekwondo about four or five times a week and I do Welsh squad (similar to Taekwondo), so that's about two hours and I do horse riding and stuff.\" (Nicole, 13) \"I do rugby.\" (Callum, 13). \"Rugby for the school and for (the town).\" (Kai, 13) \"I do netball for (the town) and for the school and athletics for the school...we do a lot of cross country.\" (Maddison, 13) \"We have double gym on Friday.\" (Nicole, 13) Travelling to and from school Travelling to and from school can add to the amount of physical activity that children and young people are undertaking. According to 2009/10 HBSC, 41% of 11-year-olds in Wales reported that they usually travel by bus, followed by walking (34%) and by car (24%). As shown in Figure 7.6, travel-to-school patterns have remained very stable for nearly a decade. Cycling has been very rare with only 0-1% reporting that they travel this way. 0102030405060708090100Percentage WalkFigure 7.6: Travel to school, 11-year-olds, Wales (2000-2010) Cycle Bus Car Other20062000 2010 Mode of travel32 3334 01 141 41 41 24 24 24 2 1 1 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 162Figure 7.7 uses data from the National Travel Survey (NTS) for mode of travel to school for five to 16-year-olds in 2008-09 across the UK. This shows that the North East region had the highest levels of walking at 54% and Wales had the lowest levels at 36%. Extra-curricular provision Information on PE provision in Welsh schools has been collected by Sport Wales since 1999/00e. The amount of time provided by schools for extra-curricular sport and physical recreation in an average week is recorded. In the 2008/09 academic year, the average secondary school in Wales provided an additional 24 hours of teacher time for extra-curricular PE per week. 020406080100Figure 7.7: Main mode of travel to school for ve to 16-year-olds in each Government Ofce Region (GOR) and country in GB (2008-09) BusOther Wales ScotlandEngland South EastLondon East of EnglandNorth West West Yorkshire & HumberEast Midlands North EastGreat BritainWalkCar GOR and countryPercentage Source: National Travel Survey, Department for Transport e Sports Wales PE Provision Surveys.163Extra-curricular and club participation amongst seven to 16-year-olds Extra-curricular participation is defined as activity that takes place at lunchtime, after school or at weekend with the help of a teacher. According to the Sport Wales Active Young People Survey, since 2004, over three quarters of pupils take part in extra curricular sport and physical recreation. Figure 7.9 shows the percentage of children and young people who have taken part regularly in any extra-curricular sport and physical recreation in the academic year. Regular participation is defined as at least once a week.05101520253035Hours of extra-curricular provision per week 1999/00Figure 7.8: Hours of Percentage of seven to 11-year-olds and 11 to 16-year-olds regularly participating in extra-curricular activities 61 Source: Sport Wales Active Young People Survey164In 2009, a slightly higher proportion of children aged seven to 11 take part in regular extra-curricular activities regularly than young people aged 11-16 (69% and 61% respectively). In previous years, girls were less likely than boys to participate in extra-curricular activities, however this gap has almost disappeared in the latest survey findings. Figure 7.10 shows that the proportion of pupils taking part in club sport has increased gradually during the past ten years. A slightly higher proportion of pupils aged 11-16 participated in regular club sport than primary school-aged children (seven to 11). The Active Young People Survey asks pupils what would encourage them to do more club-based sport. The most frequent response was that pupils would do more 'if there were more sports that suited me'. Just over a fifth of primary age pupils (22%) and nearly half of secondary school age pupils (48%) cited this as a barrier. Around 19% of primary school pupils said they would be encouraged to do more sport if 'my friends went with me'. At secondary school age, this increased to 40% of pupils overall and there was a clear gender difference with 29% of boys citing this as a reason compared with 51% of girls. There was less of a gender difference for this measure at primary school age (15% of boys cited this as a reason that would encourage them to do more compared with 23% of girls). Lack of time was also an issue. Cost, however, appears to be less of an issue than the above reasons 0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 7.10: Percentage of seven to 11-year-olds and 11 to 16-year-olds regularly participating in club sport (2004-2009) 2004 200611 to 11-year-olds 2009 Year62 Sport Wales Active Young People Survey165with 11% of primary school pupils and 18% of secondary pupils saying they would do more if 'it was cheaper'. Free swimming participation In recent years, the Welsh Government has funded free swimming for children and young people aged 16 and under during all school holidays. The aim of this initiative is to increase participation in physical activity and improve the health and wellbeing of the nation. The number of free public swims for those aged 16 and under in Wales fell from 808,000 in 2004/05 to 569,000 in 2009/10 a drop of 29.6%. The downward trend was consistent apart from a small rise in 2008/09. Part of the decrease may be due to an increased focus on structured activity and skill development within the programme. The number of free structured swimming activitiesf for ages 16 and under in Wales, rose almost four fold between 2004/05 and 2009/10, from 24,000 to 94,000. Sport participation amongst 15 to 24-year-olds According to the Sport Wales Active Adults Survey, participation in sport declines with age in Wales. Around 73% of 15 to 24-year-olds had taken part in sport and physical recreation in the previous four weeks, compared with 56% of all adults. Females are less likely to take part - 63% compared with 81% of males in the 15-24 age range.0100200300400500600700800900ThousandsFigure 7.11: Free public swims and free structured activities (thousands) for ages 16 years and under (2004-2010) 2004/05 Source: Sport Wales fA structured swim includes activities such as 'aquafit' or swimming lessons.166When participation is broken down by activity type, certain activities can be seen as maintaining their participation rates as age increases. Thus, while participation in outdoor games and activities decreases sharply beyond the 15-24 year old age group, the participation rate for outdoor pursuits remains above 40% for all age groups other than the 65 and over age group. A quarter of 15 to 24-year-olds are members of a sports club, although males at 35% are more likely than females at 14% to belong to a club. Thirty per cent of 15 to 24-year-olds had visited a leisure centre in the previous four weeks with males again being more likely to do so - 34% had visited a leisure centre compared with 26% of females. 7.4 Culture Arts attendance amongst seven to 18-year-olds During 2009, almost three quarters - 74% - of children and young people aged seven to 18 attended arts events at least once a year or more. Figure 7.12 outlines some of the main differences in levels of attendance by demographics over the two years. Base: 2008 (1,012), 2009 (1,014) * Higher socioeconomic groups - ABC1 ** Lower socioeconomic groups - C2DE0 20 40 60 80 100Figure 7.12: Arts attendance for seven to 18-year-olds by gender and socioeconomic group, Wales (2008/09) Overall attendance Girls20092008 Boys Higher socioeconomic groups* Lower socioeconomic groups**72 74 77 78 66 71 76 80 67 68 Percentage Source: Children's Omnibus Survey, Beaufort Research167As Figure 7.12 shows, in both years more girls than boys attended arts events, however, there has been an increase in boys' attendance over the two years. Over the whole period it was the higher socioeconomic groups who attended the arts more often. Levels of attendance tend to be higher for younger children and slightly lower for older children. In 2009, while 81% of seven to ten-year-olds attended, this decreased to 66% of 16 to 18-year-olds, and the pattern was the same in 2008. If children and young people have some levelg of Welsh language ability, they are more likely to attend arts events, with 82% attending compared to 69% of those with no Welsh language ability. Again this represented a similar pattern to 2008. In 2009 plays were the artform most often attended by seven to 18-year-olds, followed by live music, and art and craft galleries and exhibitions. Arts participation amongst seven to 18-year-olds Levels of participation in the arts are extremely high among seven to 18-year-olds with over 80% taking part once a year or more. Figure 7.13 highlights the main changes in levels of participation among seven to 18-year-olds over the two years. Base: 2008 (1,012), 2009 (1,014) * Higher socioeconomic groups - ABC1 ** Lower socioeconomic groups - C2DE0 20 40 60 80 100Figure 7.13: Arts participation for seven to 18-year-olds, Wales (2008-2009) Overall Participation Girls20092008 Boys Higher socioeconomic groups* Lower socioeconomic groups**81 83 85 85 78 82 85 89 78 78 Percentage Source: Children's Omnibus Survey, Beaufort Research g Some Welsh language ability includes all children and young people who are fluent in Welsh and also all those who speak Welsh but are not necessarily fluent.168Figure 7.13 shows that while participation in the arts is higher among girls than boys, participation among boys has increased over the past two years, from 78% to 82%. In terms of levels of participation among the two socioeconomic groups in both years, there were greater levels of participation amongst the higher socioeconomic groups. In 2009, 89% of the higher socioeconomic group took part in the arts compared to 78% of the lower socioeconomic group. As with attendance levels, participation tends to be higher for younger children with 92% of seven to ten-year-olds taking part, compared to 86% among 11 to 15-year-olds and 65% of 16 to 18-year-olds. If children and young people have some level of Welsh speaking ability, they tend to have slightly higher levels of participation in the arts than those with no Welsh speaking ability - 89% compared to 80%. Visual arts and crafts is the artform most commonly participated in, followed by media arts, and then creative writing. Arts attendance for 16 to 24-year-olds According to the Wales Omnibus Survey (conducted by Beaufort Research), 75% of 16 to 24-year-olds attended arts events once a year or more which is higher than the adult attendance rate as a whole which currently stands at 71%h. Levels of attendance among the 16 to 24-year-age group have experienced a small increase from the previous year when 69% attended once a year or more. The most frequently attended artform by this group was live music, followed by carnivals. The pattern for 2008 was very similar. Arts participation amongst 16 to 24-year-olds According to the Wales Omnibus Survey, 16 to 24-year-olds show lower levels of participation than seven to 18-year-olds with 37% taking part in the arts once a year or more. However, this is higher than the adult participation rate as a whole which currently stands at 35%. Patterns of participation are very similar to the younger age groups with visual arts and crafts being the most popular art form to take part in, followed by music and then creative writing. Young people's attitudes to the arts Young people aged 16-24 have extremely positive attitudes towards the arts. For example, 96% of young people agree with the statement: 'all children should h This figure excludes cinema to make it comparative with the Children's Omnibus Survey.169have the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument or participate in arts activities at school'. A further 88% agree with the statement that 'taking part in arts and cultural activity helps people build their confidence' while 86% agree that 'there should be public funding of the arts'. Just over three quarters (76%) agree that 'arts and culture make Wales a better place to live in'. They also agree that taking part in the arts improves their career prospects, with 75% supporting the statement that 'skills gained from participating or learning about arts and cultural activity can help you get a job'. 170References 1.

The aim is that every child and young person in Wales is listened to, treated with respect and has their race and cultural identity recognised. Specifically, this chapter explores the extent to which children and young people in Wales: Key Findings Thirty-one per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds in Wales had volunteered to help friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the past year and 20% had volunteered for an organisation. This was a higher proportion on average than the 20% of 16 to 24-year-olds who responded to a similar question from the 2008 Living in Wales survey. 2009/10 HBSC study data showed that 60% of boys and girls aged 15 in Wales said their classmates were kind and helpful. As with the previous survey, girls were more likely than boys to report that their classmates were kind and helpful. Just over a fifth of young people aged 18-24 voted in the 2007 National Assembly for Wales elections. A significantly lower proportion of young people reported voting compared to the population as a whole. Estyn found that the extent to which children and young people are able to participate in decisions about their education is improving but still varies across Wales and between education sectors. Ninety-two per cent of 14 to 25-year-olds in England and Wales felt that there were significant gaps in the services provided for them. Young people in Wales aged 16-29 were significantly more likely to be a victim of discrimination, harassment or victimisation than residents over 40. 172173 are engaging in meaningful decisions made on issues affecting their lives; know about their rights and how to obtain them; feel valued and respected; and are able to express their cultural identity and race freely. 8.1 Engaging in meaningful decisions made on issues affecting their lives Participating in decisions at home A young person's rating of how often they talk to their parents may be a helpful indicator of whether or not they are likely to be involved in decision making at home. Data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) 2009/10 study provides information on how easy children aged 11-15 in Wales find it to speak to their mother, father or best friend. Figure 8.1 shows that while most young people find it easy to speak to their mother and father, fewer girls than boys report this. Furthermore, girls show a marked preference for talking to their best friend rather than their parents. Both boys and girls find it more difficult to talk to their father than their mother or best friend. 0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 8.1: Percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds who report nding it easy to talk to mother/ father/best friend by gender, Wales (2009/10) Mother FatherGirlBoy Best 568492 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study174Participating in decisions about their education The Welsh Assembly Government Survey 'Learner Voice 2010' asked further education (FE) and work-based learning students whether their learning provider helped them to participate in decisions about their education. Eighty-five per cent said their college was 'good' or 'very good' at listening to them and hearing what they needed to help them learn. Eighty-three per cent also felt that the college was either 'good' or 'very good' at talking about learning aims or goals. Analysis reveals little difference in responses between under 19s, under 25s and all FE learners. On 1 December 2005 it became law in Wales that, by 1 November 2006, all schools should have a school council. According to an Estyn 2007 report1 many primary schools had involved children in decision making for some time and their school councils were well-established. Other schools were in the early stages of establishing school councils and, as yet, staff and pupils had little or no understanding of their role or function. Furthermore, some councils operated in isolation from the day-to-day work of the school and lacked connections to other aspects of school life. Overall, it was judged that primary schools in Wales were successful in providing pupils with opportunities to make decisions. According to an Estyn 2008 report2, most secondary schools complied with almost all of the requirements of the School Council (Wales) Regulations 2005, but only a minority complied fully. Furthermore, the report found that school councils influenced decisions about practical arrangements such as school uniform and meal options in most schools, but had a significant impact in only a few schools. In these schools, pupils were involved in the appointment of senior staff, budgeting decisions and the development of school policies. Many of the participants in the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, talked about school councils as a context in which their opinions were represented, as the following exchange highlights: \"We gather opinions of what children want to say about school...we're just speaking for the children.\" (Taj, 8) \"We make suggestions like to make our school better, if we want to have more equipment or if children don't want to have an apple in the fruit trolley we could get oranges.\" (Aisha, 8) \"We were talking about like what school dinners were like and where you can sit or where you are allowed to sit.\" (Maya, 10)175However, some children said they were disillusioned with school councils, because while they listened to what children had to say, things rarely changed as a result: \"I am on (the school council).\" (Joshua, 14) \"Yeah I did it as well but they don't do anything, if you put your opinions down they don't get taken in really...I think the bike shed was mentioned...but there's no point if no one's bringing any bikes and there's no point in having it just before winter because who's going to bring a bike when it is icy and stuff like that. It's like a danger hazard and stuff like that.\" (Cameron, 13) \"They like waste money like I think like that bike shed, that must have cost like about 500 quid or a bit more and there's four bikes in it so there's no point.\" (Joshua, 14) The Estyn 2008 report also considered work-based learning, it was reported that learners were invited to complete brief questionnaires on their views, but beyond this, very few learners had enough opportunity to be involved in deciding issues which affected their lives. In FE learners were increasingly being consulted about their preferred learning styles, but the extent to which this influenced teaching depended on the commitment of individual teachers. About half of the local authorities inspected in the year before the report, had consulted effectively with learners often using school councils and youth forums. However, some local authorities consulted only with headteachers and parents rather than with pupils, on decisions that affected young people's education2. Participating in decisions within their community A common theme emerging in citizenship-related research is that people feel they should have the opportunity to have a say, but don't necessarily want to take advantage of that opportunity in practice3. This trend is also evident in the views of young people. In a survey of young people carried out for the then Department for Education and Skills (DfES) in 2004, a significant majority of young people felt they should have some say in decision-making about local facilities and issues such as compulsory identity cards. However, only 3% had taken part in an organised event in the previous three months4. Attitudes to voting and voting activity The NatCen 2010 British Social Attitudes Survey has shown that the number of people who vote because they feel it is their civic duty has fallen sharply during the last two decades to a current level of 56%. The survey, undertaken in England, Wales and Scotland, also found that the decline in 'duty' as motivation 176is more marked among young people than other age groups. Only 34% of 18 to 24-year -olds feel they have a duty to vote5. The GfK NOP All-Wales Convention research, carried out in 2009, reported a marked difference between the voting behaviour of young people and the population as a wholea. Only 17% of 16 to 24-year-olds said that they always voted in the National Assembly for Wales elections compared to 49% of the general public. 27% of 16 to 24-year-olds said they always voted in the UK general elections compared to 66% of the general public6. This continues a trend identified by a DfES study undertaken in 2004, which found that political interest among young people had declined since 1994. In 2004, 59% of young people felt that when in a general election 'people should vote only if they care who wins'. Nine per cent said they believed there was no point to voting at all4. 8.2 Knowing about their rights and how to obtain them Knowledge of rights The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) states that all children and young people should be made aware of their rights. The UN has also recommended that the UNCRC and human rights agenda should be included in a NB 24% from the 16-24 age group reported having been ineligible to vote.0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 8.2: Percentage of respondents who feel 'it is everyone's vote', 67 53 54 46 Source: British Social Attitudes survey, National Centre for Social Research177the education curriculum. To date, Wales is the only nation to have made a specific strategic commitment to deliver the UNCRC. When responding to the Welsh Government's 2010 National Survey pilot, fewer 16 to 25-year-olds than over 25s reported having heard of the UNCRC - 12% for those aged 16-25 versus 33% of over 25s. Awareness was particularly low among young men, with only 9% of 16 to 25-year-old males reporting any awareness of the UNCRC. This compared with 16% of young women in the same age group. Advocacy services As reported by the 2008 Monitor, research commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2007 showed that, among those who had used advocacy services, experiences were largely positive7. However, this research highlighted gaps in some participants' knowledge about advocacy and their rights. Earlier qualitative research carried out in Wales, among 105 five to 25-year-olds with a disability, also found that there were gaps in the knowledge held by the children and young people. These gaps related to their disability, care and treatment, the roles and responsibilities of staff, the services they received and the services that were available. Many disabled children and young people received information 'second hand' from their parents or carers, rather than directly from professionals. Furthermore, the study found that whilst the children and young people made small day-to-day decisions, adults still appeared to make the more important decisions on their behalf. There were few examples of children and young people with disabilities being involved in shaping services. However, the children and young people in the study wanted to participate in decisions about their individual care and the services they use8. Advice and guidance services Quantitative interviews with 14 to 25-year-olds undertaken in England and Wales for the Prince's Trust, showed that 92% of respondents believed that there were significant gaps in the provision of services they needed in their local community. Females were more likely than males to consider that there were insufficient services to advise them on issues such as safe sex, pregnancy and setting up home9. 178A 2005 report for the Wales programme of Save the Children, had some optimistic messages about service provision for young asylum-seekers in Wales including advice and guidance and advocacy services. The children and parents studied reported being positive about the treatment they had received10. 8.3 Valued and respected as members of society Relationships with others One potential indicator of a young person feeling valued and respected is how positively that individual views his or her relationships with classmates and neighbours. 2009/10 HBSC study data showed that 60% of 15-year-olds in Wales said their classmates were kind and helpful, compared to 58% in 2005/06. As with the previous survey, girls were more likely than boys to report that their classmates were kind and helpful. The 2008/09 Citizenship survey sought information from 10,000 people on their local community. The survey asked whether people felt a sense of belonging to the neighbourhood. Most people (77%) felt that they belonged 'strongly' to their neighbourhood, with 37% saying they belonged 'very strongly'. A feeling of belonging was highest amongst those aged 65 to 74, with 92% responding this way, and 90% of those aged 50 to 64 responding this way. It was lowest amongst those aged 16 to 24 at 72%. However, it is worth noting that the feeling of belonging reported among this age group is still quite high and slightly higher in the survey figures for Wales compared to those for England where the equivalent figure was 70%. Voluntary activity The extent to which a person feels connected to, and valued by, society may be reflected in their involvement, or willingness to be involved, in voluntary or civic activities. The 2010 National Survey for Wales Pilot provides information about volunteering to help people and organisations. The percentages of respondents who reported having volunteered in this way during the last year are provided in Figure 8.3.179As Figure 8.3 shows, fewer respondents from the 16-25 age group had volunteered than from the population as a whole. The difference was particularly marked in the number of people reporting having volunteered for friends, neighbours or other members of the community, as opposed to volunteering for an organisation. Young females were more likely to report having volunteered on this basis, with 35% of females and 28% of males aged 16-25 providing this response. A higher proportion of all respondents reported having volunteered than respondents to a similar question from the 2008 Living in Wales survey. Feeling valued and respected The National Survey for Wales Pilot also sought information on the levels of respect that people experienced in their local community. When asked how much of a problem they thought there was with people not treating each other with respect and consideration, young people aged 16-25 were more likely to report this was either a 'very big' or 'fairly big' problem. When specifically asked whether they themselves had been treated with respect by their local public services in the last year, there was a less marked difference between the under 25s and the population as a whole. However, young males were notably less likely to report being treated with respect than young females. Eighty-six per cent of women aged 16-25 reported being 0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 8.3: Percentage of respondents who volunteered for an organisation, friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the last 12 months, Wales (2010) Volunteered for an organisation in the last 12 monthsVolunteered for friends, neighbours or other members of the community in the last 12 monthsMales 16-25 Females 16-25 All ages 211822283540 Source: National Survey for Wales Pilot180treated with respect either all or most of the time, compared with 79% of men of the same age. The 2008-09 Citizenship survey undertaken by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), asked how people felt about their freedom to practice religion. People aged 16-29 who practised a religion were less likely than older people to say that they felt able to do so freely. Ninety-six per cent of people aged 50 and over who practised a religion said that they felt free to do so, compared with 91% of those aged 16-29. Eighty-three per cent of practising Muslims aged 16-29 felt they could practise their religion freely, compared with 89% of practising Muslims aged 30-49 and 94% aged 50 and over. According to the 2008 Living in Wales Survey, young respondents aged between 16 and 29 were twice as likely as residents aged between 60 and 69 to have been a victim of discrimination, harassment or victimisation in the previous five years and more than three times as likely as residents aged 70 and over. Ten per cent of all respondents had suffered some form of discrimination, harassment or victimisation in the previous five years. However about 16% of 16 to 29-year-olds and almost a quarter of all male respondents aged 16 to 29 had suffered11. 024681012141618PercentageFigure 8.4: Percentage of respondents who had experienced discrimation, harassment or victimisation in the last ve years by age, Wales (2008) 16-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70+ Age Category16 8 5 Source: Living in Wales Survey181According to the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, being listened to, and related to this, being respected, was an important issue for young people and this was reflected by the lengthy discussions on this topic. Because most of the participants were still at school, these discussions often centred on the extent they felt listened to by teachers. While acknowledging that teachers had a lot of call on their attention, children were aggrieved when they felt teachers did not listen to their point of view and/or were perceived as unfairly taking the side of another: \"Sometimes (grown-ups listen to you). But some, like Miss Black, if you get like in trouble and it's somebody else too, she's always like 'no no no shush shush shush' and she doesn't give us the chance to talk. When we're like doing things and one of the teachers thinks like it's you, you just lose like golden time or something and it just isn't fair.\" (David, 8) The participants talked about 'champions' in their lives such as parents and teachers who would listen and try to resolve problems but across all the respondent age groups, there was some strength of feeling that adults did not perceive children's problems as significant. In other words that children and young people were less important that adults: \"Adults in general are just like, if you hang around on the street laughing with your friends then there will be some adults passing you and they will give you a really snooty look and probably think like they are probably drinking and there is adults that don't listen...adults that base them on their experiences of when they were a kid, it's changed since they were little so they don't listen to, like, what we have to say.\" (Grace, 13) Impact of the media It is widely understood that the media can have a significant impact on an individual's perception of a particular group. This can, in turn, impact on how individuals feel themselves to be perceived by others in society. Research undertaken by MORI in 2005 for the Young People Now Positive Images campaign found that stories being written about young people tended to focus heavily on crime. Four in ten such stories during the period studied, related to criminal activities including violent and petty crime, vandalism and anti-social behaviour. In addition, for every positive mention of young people there were five negative ones12. Most young asylum-seekers involved in the Save the Children research said they had been made to feel welcome by the people of Wales. However, several of the children and young people interviewed had experienced racial abuse and 182harassment. Some interviewees were of the opinion that the media in the UK fuels negative perceptions of asylum-seekers10. In the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, much group discussion among participants focused on the perceived negative image that many adults held of young people in general: \"Like when you go out most people say teenagers stay indoors too much these days. So you go out and they say 'oh, they are always hanging around the street'. So it's kind of like you don't win, so you just don't know what to do.\" (Scarlett,13) \"Most teenagers are disengaged at the moment, but that could be something to do with their backgrounds and to do with youth culture as well today and I don't think it helps with the media giving negative stereotypes all the time because it's not fair.\" (Freda, 14) 8.4 Able to express their cultural identity and race freely Forty-six per cent of respondents to the Learner Voice 2010 survey reported that their college or learning provider was either 'good' or 'very good' at offering Welsh language support. Forty per cent reported that this did not apply to them. The Girl Guiding UK study undertaken in 2009 suggested that girl guides living in Scotland and Wales have a much stronger sense of their national identity than those living in England, which leads them to question the institutions and concepts of 'British' identity. Around 30% of the girls surveyed would not claim to be proud to be British, citing reasons as diverse as immigration, a lack of community cohesion and negative public perceptions of young people14. A series of focus groups involving approximately 100 people aged 16-25 in England, Wales and Scotland, undertaken for the Policy Research Centre in 2009, also supported this finding. The study's young English Muslim participants felt a sense of tension when it came to questions around national identity. However, by contrast, their Scottish and Welsh counterparts expressed a strong sense of national identity. When questioned further they reluctantly disclosed a sense of Britishness, but their affinities lay with Scotland and Wales15. Issues of identity and belonging were clearly important to children and young people who took part in the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study. Those participants who were born in Wales, with Welsh parents and (in some cases) spoke Welsh, were clear about their own identity as Welsh. Participants who identified themselves as Welsh reflected on the historical relationship between 183England and Wales and what they thought was acceptable patriotism and how this was different from more extreme views. \"I'm Welsh...most people don't know what Wales is, they think it's just another part of England.\" (Zoe, 13) \"I don't understand why there is this competition between England and Wales, because that all happened centuries ago. I think it's good to be patriotic but not so patriotic that you put others down.\" (Grace, 13) Others who were born in England, had English parents and lived in areas of Wales where the Welsh language was not commonly used, often saw themselves as English. For those with one English and one Welsh parent some saw themselves as English, some as Welsh and some were not sure. For those who lived in border areas, the issue of identity seemed less clear cut. \"If you are born in Wales, you are Welsh...I like saying I am Welsh, it makes me feel like proud.\" (Maddison, 13) \"I was born pretty much on the border of Wales and England so I say British.\" (Callum, 13) \"I would call myself British but I am very proud of Wales in general, it's got beautiful landscapes.\" (Kai, 13)184References 1.

The aim is that 'all children and young people should have a safe home and community which supports physical and emotional wellbeing'. It has long been recognised how important it is to protect children and young adults from the physical and psychological harm that can be caused by other people - for example through crime or bullying - or by their immediate environments - for example through accidents or poor housing. The purpose of this chapter is to show how younger people in Wales are faring in respect of safety and security. How successful is Welsh society in providing these pre-conditions for a happy childhood and adolescence leading to a flourishing adult life?Key Findings Around 20% of children aged between 10-15 in GB reported being victims of crime in 2009. The numbers of children killed or seriously injured has declined since 1979, reflecting changes in children's behaviour towards the road environment and, for car occupants, trends towards safer cars. Some recent data, however, shows that the numbers of pedestrian and cyclists killed or seriously injured have levelled out from 2006 onwards and so they currently comprise an increasing proportion of child casualties. Recent trends in young drivers' involvement in accidents suggest that the rates are falling more slowly than for older drivers. Comparing the period 1994-98 with 2004-08, the number of young drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 10%, but the number of older drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 17%. In 2008 around 74,000 children and young people aged 0-24 were living in overcrowded conditions. Being the victim of bullying tends to decrease with age with around 6% of 15-year-olds reporting being bullied frequently in 2009/10. 187Specifically, the chapter on: crime; bullying; injuries and accidents; environmental pollution; housing; and fuel poverty. 9.1 Crime Victims of crime People experience crime as direct or indirect victims or through committing crime. Data on the extent to which children and young people are victims are harder to find than data on the offences committed. One of the problems is that the survey approach usually taken to gather information about being a victim of crime always puts a lower limit on the age of the respondent, and there is a natural barrier to asking babies and very young children about their experiences. This makes it extremely difficult to estimate victimhood amongst the youngest members of society. There are no Welsh-specific data for young people as victims of crime, but experimental statisticsa on victimisation of children aged 10-15 from the 2009 British Crime Survey (BCS) for the year ending December 2009, show their risk of being a victim of personal crime over the past year, and the proportion of crimes actually reported to the police (Table 9.1). Table 9.1: Percentage of children aged 10-15 who stated they were victims of crime, GB (2009) Children stating they were victims of crimeProportion of these crimes that were reported to the police Theft from the person 1 5 Other personal theft 5 4 All BCS violence 20 13 All personal crime 24 11 Source: British Crime Survey (BCS) a Experimental statistics are new official statistics undergoing evaluation. They are published in order to involve users and stakeholders in their development and as a means to build in quality at an early stage.188In addition to direct victimhood, observing or hearing about criminal behaviour in the local neighbourhood, or the home is likely to have some influence on a child's perception of those around them and their later attitudes and behaviour. Analysis of recorded crime statistics (Table 9.2) shows marked differences in the level and nature of crime committed in areas of higher and lower levels of deprivation. Table 9.2: Police force recorded crime: incidents as a percentage of 'population', by area of deprivation, Wales (average over 2005/06-2006/07) Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2008: Quintile of Deprivation 1 (most deprived)2 3 4 5 (least deprived) Violent crime* 4.7 3.6 2.1 1.4 1.1 Burglary** 3.1 2.4 1.6 1.5 1.5 Theft* 3.7 2.8 1.9 1.5 1.7 Criminal damage* 5.9 4.1 2.9 2.0 1.7 Source: Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2008; community safety domain. Recorded crime incidents are provided by the four Welsh Police Forces. * Violent crime, theft and criminal damage - the population is the resident population excluding prisoners, plus the total non-resident workplace population. ** Burglary - the population is the total number of dwellings, plus the total number of business addresses. The general perceptions of parents, children and young people on the safety or otherwise of their neighbourhood is likely to have a significant bearing on how and where children play and interact with other children and adults. This in turn will affect their broader socialisation and wellbeing. Evidence tends to be limited to adults' views. For example the Living in Wales (LiW) survey asked adult respondentsb in 2008 how safe or unsafe they felt in a variety of situations at varying times of the dayc. This showed a high proportion feeling safe at home. Ninety-nine per cent felt safe 'at home in daylight'. A slightly lower proportion - 94% - felt this way about being 'at home after dark' although with twice as many females as males felt unsafe at home after dark. The proportions feeling safe were lower outside the home. Just over 95% felt safe 'when walking in their neighbourhood during daylight', compared with 92% 'when walking in their nearest town or city centre in daylight'. However, for respondents who went out 'walking in their neighbourhood after dark', almost a quarter felt 'unsafe', while over half felt this way when 'walking in their nearest town or city centre after dark'. b The household reference person or partner/spouse. c This question has the weakness that it may be capturing reactions to a hypothetical situation and concerns about social change rather than safety per se1.189According to the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), nearly two thirds (63%) of seven-year-olds in Wales report feeling safe in the playground 'all of the time'. Thirty-one per cent report feeling safe 'some of the time' and 6% report that they 'never' feel safe. Those children living in disadvantaged areas, or who have experience of poverty, are more likely to report 'never' feeling safe. Committing crime Many victims of crime also commit crime, and vice-versa. This is particularly true for older children and younger adults. The Youth Survey 20082 asked pupils aged 11-16 in schools across England and Wales about their offending behaviourd. It found that Wales had the second highest percentage, of Wales and the nine English regions, of young people reporting they had committed a criminal offence in the previous 12 months. The Welsh figure of 28% was just behind the South East at 30%. Wales also had the lowest detection rate of any region, at 38% compared to the West Midlands at 59%. Twenty-three per cent of young people said they had committed a criminal offence in the past year. These reported offences were mainly low level, with 53% admitting to travelling on a bus, train or tube without paying a fare. When offences are grouped together, the most common were anti-social behaviour (79%) and theft (71%). A higher percentage of boys (27%) than girls (18%) reported committing an offence. Anti-social behaviour Anti-social behaviour is defined in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as acting 'in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as himself'. This definition straddles the distinction between criminal and non-criminal behaviour and can therefore encompass both. The BCS provides information on the public perception of anti-social behaviour. A summary measure of anti-social behaviour was derived from the combined responses to questions about seven types of behaviour. These were: drug use or dealing; dropping rubbish or litter; drunk or rowdy behaviour; d The sample size for Wales was 523. The sampling tolerance at the 95% confidence interval for these results is +/- 4%. 190 vandalism, graffiti or other deliberate damage to property; noisy neighbours or loud parties; teenagers hanging around on the street; and abandoned or burnt-out cars. It is worth noting that this measure relates to perceptions of anti-social behaviour committed by anyone and not exclusively by children and young people. However some of the questions asked relate directly to young people and, in political debate, anti-social behaviour has been increasingly defined as being largely committed by young people3. Using this measure, the proportion of respondents in Wales who perceived a high level of anti-social behaviour in their locality increased from 13% to 18% between 2004/06 and 2008/09. Table 9.3 shows that, over the same period, the perceived level of drug use or dealing also increased, whilst worry about violent crime and burglary remained broadly unchanged.

However these represent just one possible response to the problem, and police forces in Wales4 tend to see them as a last resort. However, research conducted using Home Office figures shows that the rate of ASBOs issued in Wales per 100,000 population almost doubled between 2004 (16) and 2005 (31), before falling back close to the 2004 level in 2007 (17), by which time it was on a par with England5. A more direct way to gauge the prevalence of anti-social behaviour is to ask young people themselves. In the Youth Survey 2008, 18% of young people aged 11-16 in England and Wales admitted carrying out anti-social behaviour in the past 12 months.1919.2 Bullying Bullying can be classified into three main types: 1. physical - including hitting, kicking, taking belongings, sexual harassment or aggression; 2. verbal - including name-calling, insulting, making offensive remarks; 3. indirect - including exclusion from social groups, being made the subject of malicious rumours, sending malicious emails or text messages. A key source of data on bullying amongst secondary school-aged children in Wales is the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. This reports on the proportion of children aged 11-15 who report being bullied at least twice a month in the previous two months. This might be seen as a measure of repeat victimisation, and may be indicative of young people at higher risk. The data show that, as children get older, they are less likely to be bullied. According to the 2009/10 survey, 10% of boys and girls aged 11 in Wales were bullied at least twice a month in the previous two months. For 13-year-olds, these were 12% of boys and 8% of girls. For 15-year-olds, the figures were lower (6% of boys and 5% of girls). 0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 9.1: Percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds who were bullied 2-3 times a month, Wales (2009/10) 11 12GirlsBoys 13 14 1510 1015 12 12 8 7 7 6 5 Age Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study192Figure 9.3 shows that levels of reported bullying have remained stable over the last ten years.0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 9.2: Percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds who bullied others 2-3 times a month, Wales (2009/10) 11 12GirlsBoys 13 14 15313 3525 141 Age Behaviour School-aged Children (HBSC) study 0102030405060708090100PercentageFigure 9.3: Percentage of 11-year-olds who reported being a month, Wales (2001-2010) 2001/02GirlsBoys 2005/06 2009/1011 1214 10 Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study193The Survey into the Prevalence and Incidence of School Bullying in Wales was a self-completion survey of pupilse. A high percentage of pupils - ranging from 74% to 89% depending on year - stated that they know who to talk to in the school if they were bullied. The majority of pupils in years six, seven and ten who had experienced bullying had told their family, friends, or a member of staff (Table 9.4), with younger pupils more likely than older pupils to tell other people. Table 9.4: Percentage of children who have been bullied in the last school year telling other people about it, Wales (2009) Year 6 (aged 10-11 years)Year 7 (aged 11-12 years)Year 10 (aged 14-15 years) Family 62 55 39 Friend 50 43 42 School staff 46 44 35 No-one 12 15 19 Other 8 6 7 Source: Survey into the Prevalence and Incidence of School Bullying in Wales, Welsh Government The survey also uncovered gender differences in the type of bullying experienced. Girls in all year groups were more likely than boys to report indirect forms of bullying, such as being excluded from activities on purpose. Boys in years six, seven and ten were more likely to report homophobic bullying, and boys in years four and seven were more likely to report being physically bullied. It also provides some information on 'cyber-bullying'. Unlike other forms of bullying, the decline in the percentage of pupils experiencing cyber-bullying as pupils get older is small (see Table 9.5). Table 9.5: Percentage of pupils in years six, seven and ten reporting different types of cyber-bullying within the last two months, Wales (2009) Social website Mobile phone E-mail Year 6 12 7 6 Year 7 11 7 6 Year 10 9 6 4 Source: Survey into the Prevalence and Incidence of School Bullying in Wales, Welsh Government e This survey included pupils from primary schools, secondary schools, pupil referral units and special schools.194According to the MCS 12% of boys and 9% of girls aged seven in Wales report that they are bullied 'all of the time'. A further 44% report that they are bullied 'some of the time'. The analysis found that children at higher risk of being bullied all of the time are those who are obese, living in poverty and living in a lone parent or 'other' family situation. The Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) found that young people with special educational needs and those with disabilities, were more likely than other young people to report all types of bullying at all ages. The risk of being bullied does not seem to decline for these young people as they grow older. Also there was a strong relationship between having been in care and being bullied. Young people who had reported being bullied at secondary school had a significantly lower Key Stage 4 (GCSE and equivalent) scores than those who hadn't reported being bullied. Young people who had reported being bullied were much less likely to be in full- time education at age 16 than those who had not. They were more likely to be in full-time work, or in part-time college, and part-time work, but were much more likely to be NEET (not in education, employment or training) than those who were not bullied. According to the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study, most of the participants were aware of, or had direct experience of, bullying. Some of the younger children found it difficult to distinguish between bullying and other accidental or intended aggressive behaviours. For some participants, their experience of bullying has implications for their education and other life outcomes. The following quotation describes how bullying deterred one girl from school and interrupted her education. \"In (my secondary school) I used to be bullied by boys calling me fat, so that was one of the reasons I moved from there... they took me to court with my mother about the attendance, because I didn't want to go to school because of what they were doing. They put out a fag on my neck, that was this boy who - he went ages ago. I had pee thrown over me, I got called fat. \" (Ellen, 14) 9.3 Injuries and accidents Child road traffic casualties Child road casualties form the largest component of injuries and deaths from preventable accidents. The majority of children killed or seriously injured (KSI) were either pedestrians or cyclists. In contrast the majority of slightly injured children were car users (see Table 9.6). In 2009, pedestrians and cyclists comprised 19577% of children's deaths and serious injuries while car users comprised 53% of slight injuries. Table 9.6: Child* casualties by type of road user and severity, Wales (2009) KilledSeriously injuredSlightly injuredTotal Pedestrian 3 80 262 345 Pedal cyclist 0 21 88 109 Motorcycle users 0 4 6 10 Car, taxi and minibus users 2 25 460 487 Other vehicles 0 1 58 59 Total casualties 5 131 874 1,010 Source: Welsh Government * Aged 0-15 inclusive. The numbers of children killed or seriously injured has declined since 1979, reflecting changes in children's behaviour towards the road environment and, for car occupants, trends towards safer cars. Figure 9.4 shows, however, that pedestrian and cyclist KSIs have levelled out from 2006 onwards and so they currently comprise an increasing proportion of child KSI casualties. Figure 9.4: Trends - child casualties (aged 0-15) by type of road user, index 1979=100 (1979-2009) 050100150200250Car user - slight Pedestrian and pedal cyclist - slight Car user - KSI Pedestrian and pedal cyclist - KSI 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1991 1993 1995 1989 1999 2001 2003 1997 2007 2009 2005 Year Source: Welsh Government196Child pedestrian casualties are likely to occur when they are walking or cycling on their own or with other children, rather than when they are under adult supervision. In 2008, children aged 12-15 had the highest risk of any age group of being a pedestrian road casualty. The risk for them was 121 casualties per 100,000 population over four times the rate for 40-49 year olds. The next highest age group was the 8 to 11-year-olds with a risk of 104 per 100,000, between three and four times the rate for the 40-49 age group. Males are more likely than females to become road traffic casualties both as adults and children. Among child pedestrians the relative risk casualty for boys is 70 to 80% higher than for girls up to the age of 11.The gap falls to around 20% higher among children aged 12 to 15 and 40% for those aged 16 to 19. For adults aged between 20 to 39, the casualty rate among men is 80% to 90% higher than that for women, although it falls for the older age groups. The time of the greatest risk for a child pedestrian casualty is at the end of the school day, with some risk from children staying out after school - this is shown in Figure 9.5. 020406080100120 06:00 07:00 18:00Figure 9.5: Child pedestrian casualties by time of day, average Monday to Friday, by gender, Wales, total adults aged 16-59, the greatest risk period for pedestrian casualties is in the evening, with peaks around 11pm, when the pubs close, and 2am, when many clubs close. The pattern in child pedestrian casualties through the year has a low figure for August; and in winter with less playing outside. The return to school in September is associated with an increase in child casualties. Child pedestrian casualties are more likely to occur in deprived areas. For example, analysis shows that over the whole period from 1998 to 2008, just under one third of child casualties aged five to 14 occurred in the most deprived fifth of local areas in Wales, with just over a quarter in the next fifth. In contrast, around a tenth of these casualties took place in the least deprived fifth of local areasf. Young people road traffic casualties The road safety issues for young people are quite different from those for children. For example, for 16 to 24-year-olds, the majority killed or seriously injured were car drivers (see Table 9.7). In 2009 car users and motorcyclists, aged 16-24 comprised 81% of young people's deaths and serious injuries. Just under half of these were car drivers, accounting for 37% of the total. Pedestrian and pedal cyclist deaths and serious injuries comprised much of the remaining figures with 17% of the total. However because these were more vulnerable road users, they only accounted for 9% of slight casualties.

Young drivers comprised 10% of people holding driving licenses in Walesg, but, during 2008, they accounted for: 26% of drivers in all motorised vehicleh accidents and 25% of drivers involved in fatal or serious accidents. 37% of drivers involved in accidents who subsequently tested positive for blood alcohol. 34% of drivers involved in single vehicle accidents. The younger the driver, the higher the risk of being involved in an accident. During 2008, just under a third of the young drivers (up to and including age 24) involved in accidents were aged 18 and 19. Young drivers comprised 26% of all drivers involved in accidents. Of this figure 17% were young men, while 9% were young women. The higher involvement of young men was not, however, any higher than the general tendency of men to be more involved in accidents. During 2008, 26% of male drivers involved in accidents were aged up to and including age 24, and 26% of female drivers involved in accidents were aged up to and including age 24. Recent trends in young drivers' involvement in accidents suggest that the rates are falling more slowly than for older drivers. Comparing the period 1994-98 with 2004-08, the number of young drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 10%, but the number of older drivers involved in accidents has fallen by 17%. Injuries and poisoning An indication of the prevalence of injury and poisoning amongst children is obtained by looking at the causes of admissions to hospital. Figure 9.6 shows admissions to Welsh hospitals due to 'external causes' - that is accidents, rather than on-going medical conditions or infections for children aged under 15. It shows that the major single cause of admission is a 'fall', with a significant proportion of admissions arising from other accidental injuries, for example 'being struck' or a 'foreign object entering body'. In contrast, admissions from road accidents, or from using bicycles, accounted for around 8% of admissions. g But in the lowest index of Multiple Deprivation quintile, 20% of drivers are unlicensed, disqualified, or are driving on a provisional license. h Includes motorcycles.199The HBSC study provides information on injuries which required medical attention (see Table 9.8). The data shows a clear gender split with more boys than girls reporting these types of injuries in all age groups. It is likely that this gender difference is due to the fact that boys are more likely to be involved in sports and risk-taking behaviours both of which increase the possibility of injury7. Table 9.8: Percentage of medically attended injuries in the last 12 months by age and gender, Wales (2009/10) Boys Girls Age 11 45 37 Age 12 50 39 Age 13 51 39 Age 14 52 41 Age 15 53 35 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 9.4 Environmental pollution Our knowledge of the extent to which children and young people are exposed to deleterious environmental pollution is currently very limited, though it is known that some pollutants can be very damaging to physiological development. Figure 9.6: Admissions to hospital at Welsh hospital trusts, for children aged 0-14: External causes for admission, by broad category of cause (2008-2009) Bitten by animal - 1% All other causes - 3% Fall - 38%Exposure to heat - 2% Assault - 2% Other - 6%Motor cycle rider injury - 1% Motor vehicle/car/bus/train occupant injury - 1% Pedestrian injury - 2% Pedal cyclist injury - 4% Intentional self-poisoning - 3% Accidental poisoning - 6% Drugs, vaccines and biological substances - 4% Adverse healthcare incidents - 7% Injury - undetermined intent - 1% Contact with sharp objects - 1%Being struck - 9% Foreign object entering body - 5%Crush injuiry - 4% Source: Patient Episode Database Wales (PEDW)200The prime environmental pollutants can be classed as those present within the home and those in the wider outdoor environment. Within the home The clearest causal links to health and wellbeing are those arising from exposure to lead, radon gas, carbon monoxide and environmental tobacco smoke. Even small amounts of lead, ingested over a prolonged period, can affect children's neurological development and lead to lowered IQ, anaemia and damage to the nervous system. Such damage can occur even before birth8,9. Unfortunately there are no Welsh data for levels of environmental pollution for children and young people in the home. However Chapter 4 The Early Years does provide some information on maternal smoking. Outside the home Data on children and young people's exposure to environmental pollution outside the home are sparse, though some indicators of key potential pollutants are available at an aggregate level. Regular monitoring of air and water quality shows steady improvements over recent decades. However, there is some evidence that air quality and noise pollution tend to be worse in more deprived areas because of greater proximity to major roads and industrial point sources, as well as the concentration of domestic emissions in urban areas. Deprived areas tend to be more exposed to waste sites10. There is strong evidence of the effects of air pollution on children's health11. This report states that \"the accumulated evidence indicates that children's health is adversely affected by air pollution levels currently experienced in Europe\" (page 3). The specific vulnerability of children to air pollution is related to the continuing development of their lungs, metabolic and immune systems, high rates of respiratory infection and their patterns of activity, particularly outdoors. In addition, there is a possible causal relationship between particulate air pollution and neonatal death. There is no direct evidence concerning the amount of harm caused by air pollution to the children and young people of Wales. One proxy measure is the number of children and young people living in Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs)i. Apart from one, each of the 28 Welsh AQMAs have been designated because of the pollutant Nitrogen Dioxide, with the primary source being traffic in urban areas. Around 24,000 people in total live in Welsh AQMAs, with perhaps a third being under the age of 25. i These are areas where atmospheric concentrations of one or more pollutants are close to, or exceed, the statutory objectives set out within the UK Air Quality Strategy. Welsh local authorities are responsible for assessing air quality within their jurisdictions, and declaring AQMAs where necessary, but the designation of AQMAs does not imply that residents outside these areas suffer no ill-effects.2019.5 Housing Homelessness The most acute form of homelessness is rough sleeping, defined as sleeping, or bedded down, in the open air, or in buildings or other places not designed for habitation. Recent counts carried out by local authorities working with local agencies, together with other sources including contacts with outreach services, give a broad indication of how many people sleep rough in Wales. In March 2008 the likely number was judged to be between 128 and 165. This kind of 'snap-shot' estimate can only be a rough approximation. Many rough sleepers alternate between life on the streets and hostels while many choose places to sleep which minimise the risk of detection. Moreover those carrying out the counts may have limited local knowledge of likely sleeping sites. The weather has a big influence on whether people sleep rough or use a night shelter or hostel and there are big logistical problems in fully covering sparsely populated areas. The counts did not record personal information on the individuals found to be sleeping rough but it is well established from other studies, and known by homelessness agencies, that the overwhelming majority of rough sleepers are young males. Rough sleeping is the most extreme form of homelessness, but people are homeless in all situations in which they have no accommodation that they are entitled to occupy, or they have accommodation but it is not reasonable for them to continue to occupy it. Local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation are the commonest way to gauge homelessness, but these are based only on approaches by people seeking help, and cannot provide a complete picture. The local authority has to assess whether the applicant is eligible for any form of assistance, for example some foreign nationals may not be. The authority must then assess whether they are genuinely homeless, then whether they are in 'priority need' and if they are intentionally so. If in 'priority need', for example because the household contains dependent children the local authority must ensure suitable accommodation is available quickly and then a settled home. Table 9.9 gives the age and sex of applicants for assistance over the period of July to September 200912. Some of these applicant households contain other members, including children.202Table 9.9: Homelessness decisions taken, by age and gender, Wales (July to September 2009) Ineligible householdEligible, but not homelessnessEligible, homeless but not in priority needEligible, unintentionally homeless and in prioirity needEligible, unintentionally homeless and in priority needAll Households Male: 16-17 0 34 - 5 87 126 18-24 2 103 143 19 133 400 25 and over 9 258 342 47 338 994 All ages 11 395 485 71 558 1,520 Female: 16-17 2 44 - 10 130 186 18-24 5 205 98 22 344 674 25 and over 9 306 109 43 443 910 All ages 16 555 207 75 917 1,770 Persons: 16-17 2 78 - 15 217 312 18-24 7 308 241 41 477 1,074 25 and over 18 564 451 90 781 1,904 All ages 27 950 950 692 146 1,475 3,290 Source: Welsh Government Table 9.9 shows that applicants are split fairly evenly between those aged 16-24 and those aged 25 and over. Some insight into the households in priority need is provided by Table 9.10.203Table 9.10: Number of households accepted as homeless by priority need*, Wales (2007-2009) 2007-08 2008-09 Household with dependent children 2,687 2,269 Household member pregnant and no other children 486 485 Household with vulnerable member due to: Old age 154 126 Physical disability 290 346 Mental illness/learning disability 305 339 Young person at risk 18-21 125 143 Young person at risk 16-17 550 527 Domestic violence or threat of domestic violence 719 717 Homeless after leaving armed forces 35 26 Former prisoner with no accommodation to return to 656 640 Other 299 205 Households homeless in emergency 61 43 Total Households 6,367 5,866 Source: Welsh Government * A homeless household is one that is eligible, unintentionally homeless and in priority need. The relative importance of households with dependent children, of young people 'at risk', people fleeing domestic violence and former prisoners is clear, strongly suggesting that priority need acceptances are dominated by the young. Families with children in temporary accommodation Figure 9.7 shows the major increase in the use of temporary accommodation to meet the needs of homeless families and children (dependent children aged under 18) from 2003 and the significant decline since 2006.P204Unfit housing The 'fitness standard', against which homes were judged fit for human habitation, is no longer in use, but in 2008 the LiW stock survey assessed for the last time how many homes were unfit and who their occupants were. It found that 18,994 households containing one or more people aged under 25 were living in unfit homes. This equates to 3.9% of all households containing people aged under 25, compared with 22,126 or 4.3% in 2004. Overcrowded accommodation The effects of overcrowding on children's health and education were reviewed in a study for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 200413. It concluded that overcrowding is likely to contribute to Heliobacter Pylori infection in childhood, and that there is limited evidence for weak links to various health conditions, including respiratory conditions, meningitis, childhood TB and mental health problems. Some tentative evidence suggests that overcrowding may affect educational attainment. Overcrowding is generally defined against the 'bedroom standard', which takes it that a separate bedroom is needed for: a cohabiting couple (married or unmarried); any person aged 21 or over; each pair of young persons aged 10-20 of the same sex;02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002,000NumberFigure 9.7: Homeless households, families with children in each pair of children under 10, regardless of sex, and a young person aged 10-20 paired with a child under 10 of the same sex. If a household has too few bedrooms to meet these conditions, it fails the standard. The 2008 LiW survey shows that 26,100 or 2.1% of households failed the standard. This equated to 130,500 or 4.3% of all people. The proportions and numbers have risen a little over previous years. Naturally, larger households form a higher proportion of overcrowded households than smaller households, with five persons per household on average, compared to 2.4 for households overall. The failure rate was highest in the social housing tenure, at 5% or 12% of all the people in that sector. This compares to just 1% in the owner occupied sector. Figure 9.8 shows that children and young people are much more likely to be living in overcrowded conditions than people in older age groups. The percentages equate to around 47,000 children aged 0-15; 6,000 aged 16-17 and 21,000 aged 18-24 living in overcrowded conditions in 2008. Unsurprisingly, children in households with three or more children were around three times more likely to be overcrowded than those in households with only one or two children. 0246810PercentageFigure 9.8: Percentage of people living in a household that failed the bedroom standard by age, Wales (2008) 0-15 16-17 Living in Wales206The most recent figures for families living in overcrowded conditions come from the 2009/10 National Survey for Wales pilot - 22,663 families living in overcrowded conditions in Wales. Children with disabilities living at home A significant number of children in Wales suffer disabilities serious enough to qualify for Disability Living Allowance. Some of these may require homes to be adapted to meet their needs. Table 9.11 provides an age and gender breakdown for Wales at May 2010 and shows that twice as many males as females are entitled to the allowance, possibly reflecting the riskier behaviours favoured by boys and young men. Table 9.11: Number of young people entitled to Disability Living Allowance, by age and gender, Wales (May 2010) Aged under 5Aged Work and Pensions 9.6 Fuel poverty Box 9.1: Definition of fuel poverty A household is judged to be 'fuel poor' if it would need to spend more than 10% of its income on all fuel - to heat particular rooms within the home to a specified minimum temperature for set periods during the day and night, to provide hot water and to cook. Fuel poverty arises through the interaction of three factors: the energy efficiency of the dwelling; how much income the household has; and fuel prices. A poor household in a very energy efficient home may not need to use much fuel and hence may not be 'fuel poor'. However, partly because most UK housing is still relatively energy inefficient, poor households are generally speaking, also 'fuel poor'.P207The LiW 2008 survey provides insight into the extent of fuel poverty amongst vulnerable and non-vulnerable households and, in particular, among those containing children and young people. Table 9.12 shows that 19% of households with children aged 15 or younger are fuel poor, representing 64,000 households. Around 15,000 of these have members who are long-term sick or disabled. Fuel poverty is generally calculated according to a 'full income' definition and a 'basic income' definition. 'Full income' includes as part of household income any housing benefit (HB) or Income Support for Mortgages Interest (ISMI) payments. This is the definition used for setting UK fuel poverty targets and is the basis for the information in this section. (Tracking is also done against the 'Basic Income' definition, which excludes Housing Benefit or Income Support for Mortgage Interest payments). In setting targets and monitoring a distinction is made between 'vulnerable' households and others. Vulnerable households are those with members who are particularly susceptible to the effects of living in cold homes. These include members aged 60 or over, dependent children aged under 16 or those with any long-term sickness or disability.208 Table 9.12: Fuel poverty by vulnerable household member, Wales (2008) Type of vulnerable household memberFuel Poor Not Fuel Poor Total Number of Households (000s)Percentage of fuel poor householdsPercentages of groupNumber of Households (000s)Percentage of fuel poor householdsPercentages of groupNumber of Households (000s)Percentage of fuel poor householdsPercentages of group Anyone 60+No 149 45 20 584 62 80 733 58 100 Yes 183 55 34 353 38 66 536 42 100 Total 332 100 26 936 100 74 1,268 100 100 Anyone less than 16No 268 81 29 654 70 71 922 73 100 Yes 64 19 19 282 30 81 346 27 100 Total 332 100 26 936 100 74 1,268 100 100 Anyone long-term sick/disabledNo 194 58 23 634 68 77 828 65 100 Yes 138 42 31 302 32 69 440 35 100 Total 332 100 26 936 100 74 1,268 100 100 Source: Living in Wales (LiW)209References 1.

In the period 1998/99 to 2000/01 the percentage of children living in absolute poverty was 34%. This decreased to 20% in the period of 2002/03 to 2004/05 and has now begun to increase in recent years, increasing to 21% in the period of 2006/07 to 2008/09. From the end of the 1990s, there was a steady reduction in the proportion of children living in workless households in Wales - and by 2006, 16.9% of children were living in workless households. In more recent years, this figure has increased - and by 2009, just under a fifth (19.9%) of children were living in workless households Although being in employment reduces the risk of living in poverty, recent estimates suggest that more than half of all children living in poverty are now in households where at least one person is working. Although most of these are either self-employed or working part-time. There were 50,200 people aged 16-24 unemployed in Wales in the 12 months ending June 2010. This is an unemployment rate of 21.7%, compared to the UK rate of 19.5%. Between the year to June 2009 and the year to June 2010, the youth unemployment rate in Wales increased by 3.2 percentage points - which is the fifth largest increase of the English regions and devolved administrations. Wales had the third highest youth unemployment rate of the 12 regions and devolved administrations for 16 to 24-year-olds. In the same age range, the increase in the unemployment rate was larger for men than for women. The most recent Annual Population Survey data for Wales shows that 25% of children in Wales lived in lone parent families in 2009, compared to the UK figure of 23%. The number of lone parents in employment in Wales has been steadily increasing. In 2004/06, 54.5% of lone parents were in employment. This figure increased to 55.7% by 2007/09. 212This chapter focuses on Core Aim 7 of the Welsh Government's aims for children and young people in Wales. This seeks to ensure that 'no child or young person should be disadvantaged by poverty'. A recent review of research on the experiences of children and families living in poverty concluded that poverty can affect all aspects of a child's life1. These effects range from economic and material disadvantage, through to social constraint and exclusion. In addition there are personal issues associated with stigma such as shame, sadness and the fear of being different. These are often more hidden. In particular, evidence from this Monitor and the 2008 Children and Young People's Wellbeing Monitor for Wales shows that children and young people growing up in poverty are vulnerable in a number of different ways. They are more at risk of poor educational attainment, are more likely to have poorer health outcomes, and have lower skills and aspirations. They are also more likely to be low paid, unemployed and welfare dependent in adulthood. This chapter provides information on previous and current levels of child poverty in Wales. It also explores the extent to which children and families in Wales are living in severe and persistent poverty. Specifically, the chapter reports on: relative child poverty; material deprivation and low income combined; child child poverty; out-of-work poverty; in-work poverty; lone parents; youth unemployment and benefit claimants and experiences of families, children and young people living in poverty. The Welsh Government uses a measure of child poverty based on relative income after housing costs. Children living in poverty are those living in households with below 60% of the median income for households of that type. For example, this equates to a weekly income of \u00a3333 per week after housing costs for a couple with two children aged between five and 14a. In addition to using a 'relative low income' measure of child poverty, the UK Government also uses an 'absolute low income' measure, and a 'material deprivation and low income' combined measure. a Figure for 2008/09 from the Family Resources Survey.213The Child Poverty Act 2010 also commits the UK Government to monitoring persistent poverty. Box 10.1 provides the definitions of these different measures of child poverty. Source: Save the Children (2007)Box 10.1: Measures of Child Poverty Absolute low income : This indicator measures whether the poorest families are seeing their income rise in real terms. The level is fixed as equal to the relative low-income threshold for the 1998-99 (the baseline year) expressed in today's prices. Relative low income : This measures whether the poorest families are keeping pace with the overall growth of incomes. This indicator measures the number of children living in households below 60% of contemporary median equivalised household income, excluding income tax and council tax. It takes account of the different expenditure needs between households of various sorts, sizes and children's ages. It compares the incomes of the less well off with those of 'typical households'. Relative low income can be calculated either Before Housing Costs (BHC) or After Housing Costs (AHC), where these costs include rent or mortgage interest; buildings insurance; and water charges. The latter measure can account for variations in the unavoidable costs of paying for adequate shelter. Income is usually measured as weekly income. Material deprivation and low income combined : This indicator provides a broader measure of people's living standards and general resources. It measures the number of children living in households experiencing material deprivation - going without a range of items and activities - that have an income below 70% of contemporary median equivalised household income. The material deprivation measure is based on 21 items, ten household items and 11 child items. It considers living standards such as: a holiday away from home at least one week a year with family; swimming at least once a month; friends around for tea/snack once a fortnight; celebrations on special occasions (for example, birthdays); and going on a school trip at least once a term.21410.1 Relative child poverty Child poverty in Wales is measured using Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data - which is published on an annual basis. The HBAI data uses household disposable incomes, adjusted for household size and make-up, as a proxy for material living standards. It is based on sample data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The most recent HBAI data for Wales covers the period 2006/07 to 2008/09b. Using the relative income measure, this shows that nearly one in three children in Wales (32%) are now living in poverty. This equates to around 200,000 children. Table 10.1 provides HBAI data for Wales on previous and current levels of child poverty. It also provides a comparison with the other UK countries. Child poverty in Wales is currently one percentage point higher than that for the UK. Ten years ago, child poverty was three percentage points higher than the UK figure. In the past ten years, child poverty in Wales has fallen by four percentage points whereas for the UK the figure has fallen by two percentage points.

The lowest levels of child poverty are recorded for the regions of East, South East and South West - at 26%. See Table 10.2 for further details. b The figures published in the HBAI publication for Government Office Regions and devolved administrations are three-year moving averages. That is, an average of the current year and the previous two years. This reduces any unreliability in the single year estimates caused by sampling variation and allows for better comparability over time.P215Table 10.2: Percentage of children living in households below 60% of median income (After Housing Costs), Wales and Government Office Regions of England (1997-2009) 97-98 to 99-0098-99 to 00-0199-00 to 06-0705-06 to 07-0806-07 to 08-09 Wales 36 35 34 34 32 31 28 29 32 32 N East 40 39 35 36 33 34 32 33 33 34 N West 38 37 35 33 32 30 31 31 34 33 Yorks 36 35 33 32 32 31 30 29 30 31 E Mid 30 30 29 29 28 28 27 29 30 30 W Mid 33 34 34 34 32 31 32 33 35 36 East 27 26 24 23 23 23 24 25 26 26 London 42 41 40 39 38 40 41 41 39 39 S East 25 24 24 23 22 22 22 25 26 26 S West 31 30 29 28 28 26 26 26 27 26 Source: Department for Work and Pensions 10.2 Absolute child poverty In 2008/09, there were around 1.6 million UK children living in absolute poverty compared to 3.4 million in 1998/99. Data for Wales show that 21% of children in Wales for the period 2006/07 to 2008/09 lived in households below 60% median line for 1998/99, held constant in real terms (i.e. absolute poverty). The proportion of children living in absolute poverty in Wales had been falling (see Figure 10.1), but has gone up again in recent years.21610.3 Material deprivation and low income combined As noted in Box 10.1, the combined material deprivation and low income indicator provides a broader measure of people's living standards and general resources. A family is on low income and in material deprivation if they have a material deprivation indicator score of 25 or more and a household income below 70% contemporary median income (Before Housing Costs). In Wales, the number of children living in materially deprived and low income households has remained stable over the past few years. The most recent HBAI data for Wales show that for the period 2006/07-2008/09, 17% of children were living in such households. 10.4 Severe child poverty Although there is currently no official measure of severe child poverty, a recent study by Save the Children defined severe child poverty as: 'A household with an income below 50% of the median (after housing costs), and where both adults or children or both groups lack at least one basic necessity, and either adults or children or both groups lack at least two basic necessities'c,2. This same study found that 13% or 1.7 million children in the UK live in severe poverty. According to Save the Children, the proportion of children living in severe poverty is fairly similar across the four countries of the UK: 'In 2007/08, 13% (1.5 million) of children in England were living in severe poverty, 15% (96,000) in Wales, 10% (43,000) in Northern Ireland and 9% (95,000) in Scotland.' Since 2004/05, the number of children living in severe poverty has increased c 'Measuring Severe Child Poverty in the UK' is based on an analysis of trend data on the levels of severe poverty over a four year period - at UK and devolved levels. The study also used data from a three year period (2005/06 to 2007/08) to provide three year rolling averages to look at which groups of children are more at risk of living in severe poverty.Source: Department of Work and Pensions0102030405060708090100Percentage 1998/99 to 2000/01Figure 10.1: Percentage of children living in absolute poverty in Wales, (After Housing Costs) (1998-2009) 2000/01 to 2002/032002/03 to 2004/052004/05 to 2003/042003/04 to 2005/062005/06 to 2007/08217in England and Wales, while there has been no change in Northern Ireland and Scotland. This distribution of severe poverty across the UK is similar to the distribution of non severe child poverty3. Children living in workless households are particularly at risk of living in severe poverty3: over half of all children living in severe poverty were in families with no adult working. Also at risk of living in severe poverty, were children whose mothers have low educational attainment, children living in single parent households, those living in rented social housing, children in families with disabled adults, children from minority ethnic groups and children in large families3. It should also be noted, however, that concerns have been expressed over the reliability of data on severe poverty. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, for example, has suggested that households with very low recorded incomes (responding to the FRS) will include those who have not identified some income sources. It will also include those on temporarily low incomes, such as the self-employed or those with seasonal work, and low income households who are using savings to support their expenditure. 10.5 Persistent child poverty Persistent poverty, where a family experiences poverty over an extended period of time can have a particularly detrimental impact on children. Recent research has shown that children in persistently poor households were more likely to have a long standing illness or disability, less likely to do physical exercise, more likely to be temporarily and/or permanently excluded from school, more likely to be perceived by others as being below average in English and Welsh and considerably more likely to be living in temporary, unfit and/or overcrowded accommodation4. These families were also more likely to be suffering from material deprivation, for example lacking two pairs of shoes per person, not having a one-week holiday and not being able to keep the house warm. There are a number of factors associated with persistent poverty. Evidence from the Families and Children Study (FACS) suggests that children living in families with parents who do not work and whose income is dependent on state benefits, are more likely to be persistently poor4. Conversely, children living in families with parents who do work - are less likely to be persistently poor. Other factors are also important. Families where the mother is aged under 25 and where the parents have no qualifications are more likely to be persistently poor, than families with four or more dependent children and families living in social housing4. 218Recent analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) by Bradshaw and Holmes5 looked at changes in poverty over the first three MCS surveys, carried out when the children were aged nine months, three years and five years. This analysis used two measures of poverty: income poverty and subjective povertyd. Using these two measures, 39% of all MCS families in the UK experienced income poverty and 57.5% experienced subjective poverty in at least one of the three surveys. In addition, 27.9% experienced both income and subjective poverty in at least one of the three surveys. In terms of persistent poverty, analysis of the MCS shows that 13.8% of families were income poor and 15.8% were subjectively poor in all three surveys. When using both measures, 4.9% of families were 'poor' in all three surveys. Evidence from this same study found that: 'About a fifth of families with income data at both MCS1 and 3 were income poor at both surveys. A further 9.6% left income poverty, but these were almost exactly matched by the 9.7% who became income poor between those surveys'5. Moves into poverty tend to be associated with relationship breakdown - with one in four MCS mothers (26.8%) moving into poverty between the first and third surveys on becoming a lone parent. A change in the number of earners in a family is also a factor, with 27.2% of families moving into poverty having become workless between the first and third surveys, and 10.5% having lost one earner out of two. It should also be noted, however, that entering employment does not necessarily guarantee a move out of poverty. Analysis of the MCS shows that 'more than one in six (17.1%) of those who remained in poverty did so despite one or two parents becoming employed'5. Turning to data for Wales at MCS3 and 4 at ages five and seven, a quarter of families in Wales were living below the MCS income poverty line at both the third and fourth MCS surveys, when the children were aged five and seven respectively. Another one in six families were below the MCS income poverty line at one or other of these two surveys. Levels of income poverty in the third and the fourth MCS surveys were highest for workless couples and lone parents. In terms of the subjective measure poverty, analysis of MCS data collected when the children were aged seven showed that 13% of families in Wales were finding it 'quite or very difficult' to manage financially - while 29% said that they were 'just about getting by', and 36% said that they were 'doing alright'. Levels of 'living comfortably' (22% on average) rise in line with levels of parental education, while levels of distress are greater where parents have lower qualifications. d Income poverty is defined in this analysis as 'having a net equivalent income below 60% of the national median, taking account of the number and age of people in the home'. In terms of 'subjective poverty' - MCS respondents were asked 'how well would you say you (and your partner) are managing financially these days?' Those finding it 'quite or very difficult to manage' plus those 'just about getting by' were defined as living in 'subjective poverty'.21910.6 Out-of-work poverty A workless household is one where no individuals aged 16 and over are in employment6. Families living in workless households are particularly at risk of poverty. The number of children living in workless households is one of the indicators being used to measure progress against the Welsh Government's 2006 child poverty milestones and targetse. From the end of the 1990s, there was a steady reduction in the proportion of children living in workless households in Wales - and by 2006, 16.9% of children were living in workless households. In more recent years, this figure has increased - and by 2009, just under a fifth (19.9%) of children were living in workless households. Table 10.3 provides data on the percentage of children living in working households, households with both working and workless members, and workless households - for the period 2004 to 2009. Table 10.3 Children* living in working-age households** by combined economic activity status of household, Wales (2004-2009) Year Working households Mixed households Workless households 2004 52.5 28.8 18.7 2005 53.5 29.0 17.5 2006 52.6 30.5 16.9 2007 52.2 53.7 29.1 17.2 2009 51.0 29.1 19.9 Source: Annual Population Survey (APS), household datasets * Children aged under 16. ** Households including at least one person aged 16-64. 10.7 In-work poverty While children in workless households are more at risk of poverty, 'in-work poverty' (i.e. where a family is living in poverty despite having at least one adult working) is becoming an increasing issue. The risk of 'in-work poverty' is dependent on a number of factors - including the number of hours worked and pay. Analysis of the Families and Children Study (FACS) has shown that, while entry into work is an important factor in reducing child poverty, 'the likelihood of poverty exit with work entry' is higher in the case of fathers than it is for mothers in couples or lone mothers7. e The Welsh Government child poverty target for 2010 is to reduce the percentage of children living in workless households to 13.5%. See Appendix III for further information on the Welsh Government's child poverty targets.P220The likelihood of 'poverty exit' also falls if the family has more than one child but is more likely for owner-occupiers and those with higher qualifications. The probability of 'poverty exit with work entry' also depends upon key work characteristics. It is higher for those entering full-time work, and is also associated with higher hourly earnings. This same research found that: 'A sizeable proportion of poverty transitions reflect smaller shifts in income around the poverty threshold: Over half of poverty exits involve parents moving just above the poverty line...while two-thirds of poverty entries involve parents falling into poverty from just above the poverty line'7. Recent estimates suggest that by the end of the period 2004-07, slightly more low income children in Wales were in working families, than in workless families8. However it should be borne in mind that some of these working families were self-employed, where there are grounds for caution about the reliability of the measurement of income. In many other cases, employment was part-time. Full-time employment offers greater protection from poverty. Employment also reduced the risk of severe poverty and material deprivation. An important indicator of levels of in-work poverty in Wales is the number of families in receipt of Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Working Tax Credit (WTC) who have an equivalised income below 60% of the median income. As of November 2010 this has been included in the suite of indicators being used to measure progress against the Welsh Government's 2006 child poverty milestones and targets. According to HMRC, there were 97,000 families in Wales in receipt of WTC and CTC in 2008/09 and 170,000 children living in these families. Data show that 19,745 children were in families in-work in receipt of tax credits, who had an equivalised income below 60% of the median income. In 2008-09 26.7% of children in Wales were living in in-work poverty. 10.8 Lone parents Lone parents are also at risk of living in poverty. According to recent HBAI figures, 50% of children in lone parent families in the UK were living in households with income less than 60% of the median (After Housing Costs) during the period 2006/07-2008/09. The most recent Annual Population Survey (2009) data for Wales shows that 25% of children in Wales live in lone parent families, compared to the UK figure of 23%. Table 10.4 provides data on lone parents in Wales, and their participation in the labour market. Data show that the number of lone parents in employment in Wales has been steadily increasing. In 2004/06, 54.5% of lone parents were in employment. This figure increased to 55.7% by 2007/09. Lone parents in P P221employment is one of the indicators being used by the Welsh Government to measure progress against its 2006 child poverty milestones and targets. Table 10.4: Labour market summary for lone parents, Wales (2004-2009) 3 year rolling averageIn employment (000s)ILO 55.5 2007/09 55.6 7.5 36.7 100.0 55.7 Source: Annual Population Survey (APS), household datasets As with other families, being in employment reduces the risk of poverty among lone parents although a range of other factors also come into play around access to appropriate and affordable childcare, and the extent of lone parents' ability to work full-time. Recent analysis of the MCS has shown that previously married lone mothers were less likely to be in poverty than those mothers who had previously cohabited9. Furthermore, mothers who had previously been cohabiting were less likely to be living in poverty than mothers who had been single since the child's birth. This suggests that 'the chances of living in poverty are associated with both the family context at the child's birth and subsequent partnership'9. 10.9 Youth employment and benefit claimants This section provides information on the 16 to 24 age group in Wales, in relation to youth unemployment, economic inactivity and benefit claimants. Educational outcomes for children and young people are a key determinant of future employment outcomes and wage levels. These in turn impact on poverty levels among young adults and the next generation of children in Wales. Because children and young people from poorer backgrounds in Wales are more likely to leave school with no or low educational and vocational qualifications, and are more likely not to engage in post-16 education or training, they are also more likely to be unemployed or in low-paid unskilled work as young adults. Please note that educational attainment is covered in Chapter 5 Access to Education, Training and Learning Opportunities . Young adult unemployment is a particular issue in Wales, and there is strong evidence that the recent recession has had a disproportionate effect on this age group. Using the ILO definition of employment, there were 50,100 people aged 22216-24 unemployed in Wales during the 12 months ending June 2010. This is an unemployment rate of 21.7%, compared to the UK rate of 19.5%. Between the year to June 2009 and the year to June 2010, the youth unemployment rate in Wales increased by 3.2 percentage points - which is the fifth largest increase of the English regions and devolved administrations. Wales had the third highest youth unemployment rate of the 12 regions and devolved administrations for 16 to 24-year-olds. In the same age range, the increase in the unemployment rate was larger for men than for women. There were 136,300 economically-inactive people aged 16-24 years in Wales during the 12 months ending June 2010, with 69% of these being students10. Between January 2010 and January 2011, the total number of unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds, based on the narrow JSA claimants' definition fell from 28,210 to 24,645 - a drop of 13%. The claimant count rate for 18 to 24-year-olds decreased by 1.2 percentage points - from 9.6% to 8.4%. Recent DWP data show that there was a 0.8% increase in the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming benefits (excluding JSA) between May 2009 and May 2010. As at May 2010 the benefit claimant rate for Wales was 9.1% of the 18 to 24-year-olds - up 0.1 percentage points over the year.

A recent qualitative study carried out by Barnardo's of 16 UK families living in poverty showed that many often struggle to meet the costs of basic living and that 'anything additional to that - be it birthday presents, school uniforms or replacing an essential household appliance - can derail even the most careful budgeting'10. In addition, while employment is essential for reducing family poverty, families often face challenges around the cost of travel and childcare11,1. As one participant in the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study commented: \"I don't really want to be like a statistic who just sits at home and does nothing and gets paid on the benefits and stuff I do want to go out there to work but like I say (working enough hours to compensate for benefits) puts strain on the family, me being not able to see them. Every night before pay day we write it all down. I'm paid fortnightly then there's my contract phone then (my partner's) going mad Source: Annual Population Survey (APS), Welsh Government Please note that these figures are for the year ending 30 June 2005 etc.010203040506070 30 Jun 05Figure 10.3: Employment rate amongst 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales and the UK (2005-2010) 30 Sep 05 30 Sep 06 30 Jun 06 31 Mar 06 31 Dec 05 31 Dec 06 31 Mar 07 30 Sep 07 31 Dec 07 31 Mar 08 30 Jun 08 30 Sep 08 31 Dec 08 31 Mar 09 30 Jun 09 30 Sep 09 31 Dec 09 31 Mar 10 30 Jun 10Wales GB 30 Jun 07Percentage Year224and saying we don't need it. But then I'm stuck in a contract and if I come out of it I'm going to get a red mark next to my name. There's the TV, gas, water, electric, obviously phone contract.\" (Emma 19 with children aged 6ms, 3 and 6) In particular, the availability and cost of childcare facilities (which might enable them to work or study) was seen as especially problematic: \"They ought to be giving a good childminding option to you free - that would be an incentive for you to work, because you wouldn't have to spend all your wages paying for childminding.\" (Mair 22, with child aged 1) \"At the end of the day they are going to make it impossible for people to live, they are not going to be able to survive, because if they're going to, you know cut the benefits down for the people like (friends with young children) who can't go to work, they are not going to be able to survive on the money they are having.\" (Eleri 23 with children aged 2 and 5) One of indicators being used to measure progress against the Welsh Government's 2006 child poverty milestones and targets is the total number of childcare places in Wales. In 2006, there were 72,894 childcare places in Wales, rising to 73,645 by 2009. Children living in poverty often worry about their family's lack of money10. Many children in poverty lack important everyday items, such as food, bedding and clothing, have reduced opportunities for shared social activities and restricted opportunities at school10,1. They may also lack the same material goods and clothes as their peers. In addition, such children often experience tensions with parents, have additional responsibilities, for example housework, caring responsibilities, or even paid work themselves. Moreover they often live in poor-quality housing, located in areas where there are no safe places to play and no low cost leisure facilities1. Evidence from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study suggests that, for some, money is an issue from a young age: \"We haven't got enough money - we're poor...we don't have enough money for sweets and candyfloss.\" (Sophie, 7) In particular, the effects of the current economic crisis were acknowledged by young people - when they compared what they could buy previously with what they could afford now:P225\"I think we can't hold onto our money as well as we used to because of the prices going up and it's very difficult to find things that we enjoy doing that we can afford, because there aren't as many recreational things that we can afford we don't have much to do and that can be quite depressing.\" (Ruby, 13) It is also important to note that the disparity in the amount of money that young people had at their disposal was acknowledged by some of them as problematic: \"They don't get as much as we get, they get less and less things than we've got... and they feel like they're left out.\" (Fiona, 14) \"They get jealous, when we're all talking about stuff like going to the cinema they might feel a bit left out.\" (Seren, 14) There is also evidence that families in poverty experience a 'poverty premium' whereby they end up paying higher prices for basic necessities such as electricity, gas and banking10,12. Furthermore, families living in poverty often have very little access to affordable credit. One of the indicators being used to measure progress against the Welsh Government's child poverty milestones and targets is the number of adults who are members of a credit union. In 2006, there were 36,000 credit union members in Wales. By 2009, this figure had increased to 41,000. The number of junior credit union members also increased - from 5,700 in 2006 to 8,300 in 2009. Evidence from the Voices of Children and Young People in Wales study suggests that there is awareness of the need for money management - particularly among those who are older: \"I definitely get by on my money. I don't have a lot. I get \u00a3150 a week because I'm an apprentice. So I don't get paid a fortune. It does get me by.\" (Brooke, 17) In the following account, Tom describes how his awareness about the importance of money management arose from his experiences of watching his mother struggle financially to make ends meet: \"I don't like debt because I think from seeing mum struggle, when I was a kid, I don't like it...and I think it comes from seeing mum struggle. Because going through her finances every week I used to sit on a Saturday morning with her and she used to have her books out and go through them with a fine-tooth comb, and she'd know how much money she had down to a penny. I always know what's coming in and going out of my account. Not like a lot of people I know who just go to the ATM and keep withdrawing money until their account's empty, until it stops giving them money.\" (Tom, 22)P226A recent systematic review of the ways in which mothers 'manage poverty' found that they will adjust strategically to living on a low income by adopting different coping strategies, which focus on 'cutting back and making do' despite potential costs to emotional and physical wellbeing. Specifically, studies have found that a mother's self-worth is often affected by her ability to provide and maintain 'mainstream' diets for their children, despite costs to their personal health and wellbeing13. For lone mothers, their ability to 'manage poverty' is further affected by having sole responsibility for their children's wellbeing, given that there tends to be no second income 'to cushion financial hardship'13. It is important to note, however, that recent analysis of the MCS has explored the extent to which family experiences - and whether the children are living in married, cohabiting or lone parent families - can affect a child's emotional wellbeing and make them more or less prone to emotional and behavioural problems. Evidence from the MCS suggests that there are 'no significant differences between children in different family groups, after taking into account income level and whether the mother had depressive symptoms'9. 227References 1.

Qualitative study: Voices of Children and Young People in Wales The qualitative study was undertaken by researchers based at Glyndw r University, Wrexham, Cardiff University and Red Kite Research and Consultancy. Specifically by Professor Odette Parry, Emily Warren, Dr Iolo Madoc-Jones, Sally-Ann Baker, Caroline Hughes, Professor Andrew Pithouse and Anne Crowley. The study focused on children and young people, up to the ages of 25. The project set out to explore children and young people's perceptions of wellbeing. The Welsh Government's seven core aims for children and young people were used to guide the study and the research materials. Additional areas explored by the study included: the concept of wellbeing or happiness; what being a child/young person in Wales/the world is like today; aspirations, dreams, hopes for their lives and futures; any challenges or difficulties; self perception and how others view them and their peers; and rights and responsibilities.251A mixture of one-to-one and group interviews were conducted with children and young people and also included responses from parents of very young children. There were 82 participants in the research that represented a wide age range (under 25) and circumstances. The full demographics of the sample are provided below: they were from nine counties of household types were represented including; separated, single, married and step-parents; adopted children and children living in care. Household size also varied from single parent households with one child to households with ten family members; the children and young people sample ranged from six months to 25 years of age, children aged four and above spoke for themselves, younger were represented by a parent. Parents' ages ranged from 19 to 37 years of age; 61 children under 18 were interviewed, 15, 18 to 25-year-olds were interviewed and 11 parents spoke on behalf of their children aged under four (parents who were under 25 were counted twice); 37 female children and young people were interviewed and 32 male, 13 female parents were interviewed; one-to-one, face-to-face interviews were conducted involving 15 respondents, 16 group interviews were conducted involving 67 respondents; 63 interviews/group discussion responses were in English, 19 in Welsh. 3. Additional analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) The Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Institute of Education, University of London conducted additional analysis of the MCS Welsh sample when the children were aged seven. Specifically this work was conducted by Professor Heather Joshi and Sosthenes Ketende. The Welsh Government's seven core aims for children and young people were used to structure the analysis conducted. A series of data tables were produced with accompanying commentary. Where possible these findings have been incorporated into the relevant Monitor chapter.252 Title Description Frequency Link All Wales Perinatal Survey A surveillance of perinatal and infant mortality. The survey is based on the usual residential address of the mother. All deaths of babies whose mother is usually resident in Wales are included regardless of the place of birth or death. Notification of relevant deaths to the perinatal survey office is dependent on a network of unit co-ordinators. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is used to ascertain deaths which have not been reported through the perinatal survey system. The All Wales Perinatal Survey works alongside the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH). The Survey provides CEMACH with a subset of the collected data.Annual http://medicine.cf.ac.uk/ en/departments/child- health/neonatal/awps/ Annual Population Survey (APS) The Annual Population Survey (APS) is a combined survey of households in Great Britain.

It consists of a representative quota sample of 500 young people aged 7-18 who are resident in Wales. It is conducted three times per year - April, July, October. Interviewing is spread across 43 separate locations throughout Wales. All interviews are conducted face-to-face in respondents' homes using CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing). It is used to assess (and track) the views and behaviour of children and young people on many different topics including that of participation and attendance in the Arts.Annual http://www. beaufortresearch. Link Beaufort Wales Omnibus survey The survey is conducted by Beaufort research and was established in 1986. It is based upon a representative quota sample, consisting of a minimum of 1,000 adults aged 16+ who are resident in Wales. Surveys are conducted four times per annum - in March, June, September and November - and a fresh sample is drawn each time. Interviewing is spread across 68 separate locations throughout Wales. All interviews are conducted face-to-face in respondents' homes using CAPI.Annual http://www. beaufortresearch. co.uk/index.php/site/ omnibussurveys/wales_ British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry (BASCD) Dental Epidemiology ProgrammeThe programme contributes to the national monitoring of service provision and targets in a devolved UK, while also providing data locally to aid in service planning and evaluation of oral health strategies and plans. The first national survey was conducted in 1985/86 for 5-year-old children. Since then, the surveys have provided a longitudinal perspective on the changing oral health of children. Representative samples are drawn from participating health authorities and boards according to the agreed BASCD guidelines.Annual www.bascd.org British Crime Survey (BCS) The BCS measures the amount of crime in England and Wales (the first survey covered Scotland as well). It is a victimisation survey in which adults living in private households are asked about their experiences of crime in face-to-face interviews. The BCS currently interviews over 51,000 people aged 16 or over every year. This includes around 47,000 interviews in the main survey, with an additional boost to the number of interviews with 16 to 24-year-olds. Since January 2009 interviews have been carried out with children aged 10 to 15. However these are currently classed as experimental statistics.Continuous since 2001 www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ rds/bcs1.html British Household Panel Survey (BHPS)The BHPS is a panel survey of individuals living in private households in the UK which began in 1991. An annual face-to-face interview is carried out with all household members aged 16 and over. 11 to 15-year-old children are also interviewed. The survey follows the same representative sample of individuals - the panel - over a period of years. It contains sufficient cases for meaningful analysis of certain groups such as the elderly or lone parent families. The wave one panel consists of approximately 5,500 households and 10,300 individuals drawn from 250 areas of Great Britain. Additional samples of 1,500 households in each of Scotland and Wales were added to the main sample in 1999, and in 2001 a sample of 2,000 households was added in Northern Ireland (making the panel suitable for UK-wide research).Annual www.iser.essex.ac.uk/ulsc/ bhps/254 Title Description Frequency Link British Social Attitudes survey (BSA)The British Social Attitudes survey is the primary social research survey in Britain. Since 1983, the annual surveys conducted by the National Centre for Social Research have continually monitored and interpreted the British public's changing attitudes towards social, economic, political and moral issues. It involves over 3,000 interviews annually. Participants are selected using random probability sampling to ensure that the results are representative of the British population. New areas of questioning are added each year to reflect current issues, but all questions are designed with a view to repeating them periodically to chart changes over time.Annual http://www.britsocat. com/Body.aspx? control= HomePage Census A census is a survey of all people and households in the country. It provides essential information from national to neighbourhood level for government, business and the community. The last census was carried out in 2001. The census forms were designed for self-completion and to provide information which related to census day - 29 April 2001. The results represent 100% of the population as it was on census day 2001. However, they are estimates, as some people were missed by the census and not everyone answered every question. The missing information had to be imputed on the basis of evidence from people and households of similar types. In England and Wales, the census is planned and carried out by the Office for National Statistics. The next census will take place in 2011 on the 27th of March.Every 10 years www.ons.gov.uk/census The Citizenship Survey The 2009-10 Citizenship Survey was conducted by Ipsos MORI and TNS-BMRB on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). It is a household survey covering a representative core sample of 10,000 adults in England and Wales each year. There is also an ethnic minority boost sample of 5,000 and a Muslim boost sample of 1,200 each year, to ensure that the views of these groups are robustly represented. It asks about a range of issues including views about the local area, community cohesion, racial and religious prejudice and discrimination, values, interaction/mixing, political efficacy, civic engagement, volunteering and charitable giving. Following the Secretary of State's consideration of the responses received to the Department's recent public consultation, The Future of the Citizenship Survey, the survey, which is a complex and expensive survey to run, will be cancelled.

It is designed to collect information about health, education, work, income, childcare and the wellbeing of children. The study (formerly known as the Survey of Low Income Families) is a longitudinal refreshed panel survey which began in 1999. Eight waves have been carried out to 2006. Substantial changes were made to the survey in the third wave, when the name was changed. From 2001 (wave three) onwards the focus has been on all families irrespective of income. The study involves a face-to-face interview with approximately 8,000 families each year. Children aged 11-15 are also now included in the study and asked to complete a questionnaire.Longitudinal, continuous sweepshttp://www.natcen.ac.uk/ facs/index.htm Family Resources Survey (FRS) The Family Resources Survey collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in the United Kingdom for the Department for Work and Pensions.

The 2005 IFS was the seventh national survey of infant feeding practices to be conducted. The main aim of the survey was to provide estimates on the incidence, prevalence, and duration of breastfeeding and other feeding practices adopted by mothers in the first eight to ten months after their baby was born. The 2005 survey is the first to provide separate estimates for all four countries in the UK, as well as for the UK as a whole. The survey is based on an initial representative sample of mothers who were selected from all births registered during August and September 2005 in the UK. Three stages of data collection were conducted with Stage one being carried out when babies were around four to ten weeks old, Stage two when they were around four to six months old, and Stage three when they were around eight to ten months old. A total of 9,416 mothers completed and returned all three questionnaires.Intervals of five years www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics- and-data-collections/ health-and-lifestyles- related-surveys/infant- feeding-survey Integrated Household Survey (IHS)The Integrated Household Survey (IHS) is conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and is a composite household survey combining the answers from a number of ONS household surveys to produce an experimental dataset of core variables. Current modules of the IHS are: General Lifestyle Survey (GLF), Living Cost and Food Survey (LCF), English Housing Survey (EHS), Annual Population Survey (APS) and Life Opportunities Survey (LOS).Quarterly http://www.statistics.gov. uk/statbase/Product.asp? vlnk=15381&More=Y International Passenger Survey (IPS)The International Passenger Survey (IPS) is carried out by the Office for National Statistics. The IPS is a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the UK by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel. Over a quarter of a million face-to-face interviews are carried out each year. The data collected includes, country of visit (for UK residents), country of residence and region of the UK visited (for overseas residents), expenditure, purpose of visit, length of stay, age group, gender, mode of transport, port, year and quarter of visit.Continuously results published monthly, quarterly and annuallyhttp://www.statistics.gov. uk/STATBASE/Source. asp?vlnk=348 Labour Force Survey (LFS) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a survey of households living at private addresses in Great Britain. Private households account for 99% of the sample. The list of households is based on the PAF . ONS estimates this sample to cover 97% of all private households. Its purpose is to provide information on the UK labour market that can be used to develop, manage, evaluate and report on labour market policies.Quarterly www.statistics.gov. uk/StatBase/Source. asp?vlnk=358&More =Y257Title Description Frequency Link Learner Voice Survey The Learner Voice survey is a large scale pilot program developed and commissioned by the Welsh Government to look into ways of engaging learners and providers. All FEIs, 12 work-based learning providers and one Welsh for Adults centre were invited to take part in the pilot of the provider-led approach, which involved a combination of paper and online data collection against a core set of questions. The survey was conducted between January and March 2010.Pilot http://wales.gov.uk/topics/ statistics/articles/voice survey results/?lang=en Living in Wales Survey (LiW) This annual survey was carried out from 2004 to 2008. It was based on face-to-face interviews with the household reference person or another appropriate adult in a sample of households across Wales. In 2004 and 2008 a property survey was also carried out, which meant that some respondents received a follow-up visit by a qualified surveyor to undertake a property assessment of their home. The addresses were randomly sampled from the PAF . The random sample was structured to deliver at least 300 interviews within each local authority per year, and as near to 1,000 over 3 years as possible.Annual http://wales.gov. uk/topics/statistics/ headlines/housing2009/ hdw200904301/?lang=en Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE)LSYPE, also known as Next Steps, managed by the Department for Education (DfE), is a major panel study of young people which brings together data from a number of different sources, including both annual interviews with young people and their parents and administrative sources. The main role of the study is to identify, and enable analysis and understanding of, the key factors affecting young people's progress in transition from the later years of compulsory education, through any subsequent education or training, to entry into the labour market or other outcomes. Sample boosts took place for deprivation factors and for ethnicity.Longitudinal http://www.esds.ac.uk/ longitudinal/access/lsype/ L5545.asp Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) This is a major longitudinal survey, managed by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the Institute of Education, University of London on behalf of the ESRC and a range of Government Departments and devolved administrations. The study follows the lives of a sample of nearly 19,000 babies born in England and Wales in 2000/01, and in 2000/02 in Scotland and Northern Ireland and charts their early social, economic and health circumstances. To date, there have been four sweeps of data collection across 73 Welsh wards. Interviews have been conducted with the families and assessments taken of the children in Wales at around the ages of nine months (2,760 babies, sweep one); three years (2,232 children, sweep two); and five years (2,200 children, sweep three). The fourth data collection sweep took place in summer 2008 when the children were aged approximately seven, 2,018 children in Wales took part. The fifth sweep is planned for 2012 when the children will be aged 11.Longitudinal study, four sweeps to datewww.cls.ioe.ac.uk258 Title Description Frequency Link National Survey for Wales Pilot The National Survey for Wales is one of the main ways in which the Welsh Government knows what issues are important to the people of Wales. The National Survey for Wales will help to; monitor trends in the concerns and needs of people in Wales, assess views and experiences of public services; and target resources to meet needs. The survey was carried out by CELLO mruk on behalf of the Welsh Government. Fieldwork ran from October 2009 to July 2010 and involved almost 4,600 households in Wales. The survey was conducted via face-to face interviews with a short self-completion element for the more sensitive questions. The final sample is a representative sample across Wales. The results are based on responses from the Household Reference Person (HRP) in each household as well as a sample of household members aged 16 and over. A short self-completion questionnaire was also left for every adult in the household to complete and return. The 2009/10 wave of the survey was a pilot, testing the survey design while also providing valuable information for the Welsh Government on a range of issues. Once the survey design is finalised, the National Survey for Wales is expected to run continuously from 2011 to at least 2014.Pilot in 2009/10 http://wales.gov.uk/about/ aboutresearch/social/ ocsropage/nationalsurvey forwales/?lang=en National Travel Survey (NTS) The National Travel Survey (NTS) is commissioned by the Department for Transport (DfT) and is the latest in an established series of household surveys of personal travel in Great Britain. The NTS has been running continuously since 1988, following previous ad-hoc surveys. The survey is primarily designed to track long-term development of trends in travel, although short-term changes can also be detected. NTS data is collected via two main sources - interviews with people in their homes, and a diary that they keep for a week to record their travel. The NTS covers travel by all age groups, including children. In 2009, data was collected from over 8,000 households, covering nearly 20,000 individuals.Continuously http://www.dft.gov. uk/pgr/statistics/ datatablespublications/ nts/ Ofcom Media Literacy Audit There have been three waves of this survey, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

Four assessments have so far been carried out (in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009). Data for the assessment which took place in 2009 was released on 7 December 2010. Tests are typically administered to between 4,500 and 10,000 students in each country. Intervals of three years http://www.pisa.oecd. org/pages/0,3417, en_32252351_ 32235731_1_1_1_ 1_1,00.html Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC)PLASC was originally introduced to replace the aggregate STATS1 collection from all maintained schools that took place in January. The name 'PLASC' has been retained to describe the statutory collections of school information and pupil details, characteristics and curriculum. The main collection still takes place in January, from nursery, primary, secondary and special schools. In addition there are two collections, in the autumn and summer terms, from schools Sports Council for Wales has commissioned large-scale population-based surveys of adult participation in sport in Wales since 1987. The Sport Wales 2008/09 Active Adults Survey results are based on 22,176 interviews with adults aged 15 and above across Wales. Households are selected at random to participate in the research using the PAF . The selection is clustered by Output Area (selected at random) to minimise costs while ensuring the survey is robust. Interviews are conducted in the respondent's home, and take on average just over 20 minutes to complete. Only one adult is selected (at random) in each household. The main change made to the survey since 2004/05 has been to change the sampling method from a quota sampling method - where individuals are selected in line with personal characteristics to reflect the population - to a random probability sampling method.Biennial http://www.sportwales. org.uk/research--policy/ our-surveys/active-adults- survey.aspx#260 Title Description Frequency Link Sport Wales Active Young People SurveyThe Active Young People Survey is commissioned by Sport Wales to measure levels of sports participation among children in school years three to six in primary schools, and young people in school years seven to 11 (11-16) in secondary schools, across Wales. The surveys have taken place since 2000 for children and since 1991 for young people. The 2009 survey was undertaken on behalf of Sport Wales by Wavehill Consulting, in conjunction with the National Centre for Social Research and Snap Surveys. The fieldwork took place between June and July in 2009. For the first time, every maintained school in Wales was invited to participate and pupils from each year group were asked to complete the questionnaire; previously a sample of schools was selected to administer the survey. Over 15,000 pupils completed the survey from 416 schools across Wales. 8,093 were from primary schools and 7,098 from secondary schools. 84 secondary schools took part (38% of the total number of secondary schools in Wales) and 328 primary schools (24% of primary schools in Wales).Biennial http://www.sportwales. org.uk/research--policy/ our-surveys/active-young- people-survey.aspx Sport Wales PE Provision Survey The PE Provision Survey is commissioned by Sport Wales to assess provision of curricular and extra curricular sport in primary and secondary schools, perceptions of PE in the school environment. The survey was undertaken by Beaufort Research. All maintained primary and secondary schools covering school years three to 11 were invited to take part in the survey, and were sent a questionnaire to complete. Questionnaires were sent to the PE Co-ordinators in primary schools and Heads of PE in secondary schools. 49% of primary schools and 43% of secondary schools returned a completed questionnaire.One-off http://www.sportwales. org.uk/research--policy/ our-surveys/pe-provision- surveys.aspx The Survey into the Prevalence and Incidence of Bullying in WalesThe Welsh Government commissioned the People & Work Unit to undertake a survey of school bullying in Wales. The survey aimed to provide baseline evidence of the incidence and prevalence of bullying among compulsory school aged pupils in Wales. The survey focuses on pupils' experiences of bullying by other pupils within their school life. The survey used self-completion questionnaires, which were completed by pupils in years four, six, seven and ten in participating schools between April 2009 and July 2009. In total, 7,448 pupils from 167 schools and five pupil referral units (PRUs) took part in the survey.

The purpose of the CIN census is to collect data that measures the characteristics and attributes of children in need who receive social services from their local authorities, including children looked after by local authorities. The census has focused particularly on data about the reason that children receive help from social services departments; parenting capacity; and on the health and education outcomes for each child. 18,800 children in need were included in the census. The findings are currently classed as experimental statistics.One-off http://wales.gov. uk/topics/statistics/ headlines/health2011/ 110224/?lang=en Welsh Health Survey (WHS) The survey provides information about the health of people living in Wales, the way they use health services and the things that can affect their health. Information is collected from a sample of adults and children in Wales living in private households through a short interview and a self-completed questionnaire. An achieved sample of around 15,000 adults and 3,500 children is aimed for per year, to include a minimum of 600 adults per local authority area. For the 2009 survey an individual response to self- completion questionnaires within productive households was 82% for adults and 79% for selected children.Annual http://wales.gov.uk/topics/ statistics/theme/health/ Cardiff: Welsh Assembly Government Welsh Outdoor Recreation surveyJointly commissioned by the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission Wales the research aimed to gain responses from residents of Wales on: their use of the outdoors; places visited, including woodlands; motivations for using the outdoors; barriers to visiting the outdoors; the 'latent demand' for outdoor recreation.

Readers are encouraged to email us if they feel that there are further gaps - Research.Evaluation@wales.gsi.gov.uk. 2008 Key Information Gap Progress update Chapter 4: The Early Years Ethnicity and disability data for Wales on many of the early years' indicators.This remains a key information gap. Dietary behaviours of young children in Wales (although this may be addressed by developments to the Welsh Health Survey (WHS)).Combined data from two years of the WHS have now allowed dietary information for young children to be included. Data on levels of foetal alcohol syndrome. Data on this is now provided. Chapter 5: Access to Education, Training and Learning Opportunities Educational outcomes among different ethnic groups and those with disabilities in Wales.This remains a key information gap. Impact of poverty on the school lives and academic achievement of children and young people.This remains a key information gap. Reasons for attainment dropping between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. Since the last Monitor we have commissioned a Rapid Evidence Assessment to consider this question. This provides some greater understanding of the area, however the evidence base was uncovered to be weak. In addition to this we also report on some analysis which investigates this phenomenon from a statistical point of view in the chapter. Research with young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) on the barriers they may face in accessing services and the reasons for their current NEET status.A small scale evidence review on what is known about being NEET has been conducted and findings from this incorporated. Research into the impact that FSM eligibility may have on wellbeing for school children in Wales.This remains a key information gap. New gap identified The views of children and young people and their parents about the quality of the education services they receive, and their aspirations for future learning and employment.2632008 Key Information Gap Progress update Chapter 6: Health, Freedom from Abuse and Exploitation Ethnicity and disability data for Wales on many of the health indicators in this chapter.This remains a key information gap.

The National Child Measurement Programme (Wales) has the potential to contribute, with biennial data collection suggested for children in year 4. Understanding the phenomenon of self-harm especially among girls.Some of the articles from the evidence review have improved our understanding of this. However it does remain a key information gap. New gap identified Further development of indicators consistent with an assets model of public health is required.

More information on ethnic differences in the extent to which young people feel able to express their cultural identity and race in Wales. Robust evidence on the impact of adopting a rights-based approach with children and young people. Research into how younger people engage with local services. Robust information on the level of civic participation and membership of interest groups among young people in Wales.2652008 Key Information Gap Progress update Chapter 9: Safe Home and Community The extent to which children and young people in Wales (particularly those aged less than 16 years) are the victims of crime.Some information is provided on this from the new youth element of the British Crime Survey (BCS), albeit at an England and Wales level. Re-offending rates of children and young people in Wales.This remains a key information gap.
