I've forgotten how much I've missed this, breathing in the fresh air after being cooped up all day. Fresh air benefits the body in many different ways; physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 1. Fresh Air Cleans Out Your Lungs Breathing in fresh air can replenish your body with positive attributes, while you exhale the processed air. Doing this at the beginning or the end of the day can decompress your body, setting you up for a calmer day or settling the body before bed. 2. Fresh Air Makes You Happy Stimulating both the physical being and the emotional being, fresh air has the powerful capability to revitalize your emotions, even if you've had a bad day, week, or month. Getting outside and taking deep breaths settles the nervous system and garners peacefulness. 3. Fresh Air Can Create Focus Around this time of year, it is important to get outside so that you can properly work toward finals. Fresh air will help you focus on your responsibilities and help you ignore distractions. Either taking your studies outdoors or simply taking a long walk before you settle down to do your work will help you zone in on what needs to be completed. 4. Fresh Air Gives You Energy We thrive off of positive energy sources, and fresh air and sunlight are two of the most important forms of a positive energy source. Fresh air helps you naturally wake up, so starting your morning with a walk can be a great way to start the day if you're trying to stay away from caffeine. 5. You Can't Crash From Fresh Air Many ways of getting energy leave you exhausted by the end of the day, but fresh air is natural and uplifting. This is one of the major perks of getting outside and breathing fresh air, as it lets your body naturally raise to the energy level it needs to perform throughout the day while also gently relaxing the body at the end of the day to wind down. Making the effort to get outside every day has made me a more focused and successful student, while it has also improved my every day social lifestyle. If you are going to do anything to better your health and wellbeing, I suggest taking a walk every day. Trust me, the results are incomparable. "}
