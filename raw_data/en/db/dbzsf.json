In fact, scientists have known for some time that the actual process of vision involves all of those things plus something you would never guess... I'm talking about electrical impulses... In order for your brain to \"see\" actual images it takes data sent from the eye and transforms that data into the images you see in your head. This transfer is conducted through electrical impulses. Ordinarily, you wouldn't need to know this, except for a recent discovery that may be the most important discovery in eye vision in years... Read on to discover.... How you may stop needing your reading glasses Start possibly seeing images more clearly Help your body slow age related vision loss Help defend your eyes against debilitating age related eye ailments |In recent years, major progress has been | made in understanding the human visual system because of new clinical investigative technologies. It has only been in the last ten years or so that these \"high tech\" diagnostic options such as Near-infrared spectroscopy tomography (SPECT) that can produce 3-D images has opened up researchers eyes to a critical aspect that they were missing. | | To understand and treat vision conditions the vision pathway and electrical impulses are a major and necessary component to understand. What does this mean to you? | | | | | | Ancient Greeks Were the First to Begin to Understand the Eye An ancient Greek physician named Galen concluded that the optic nerve collects information from the eye and sends it to the brain although he didn't understand exactly how that was done. It wasn't until hundreds of years later, Constanzo Varolio (1543-1575) of Bologna first dissected the brain from below and detailed the structure of the optic nerve in its relation to the central nervous system. Within 20 years of the ophthalmoscope's introduction in the latter 1800's, many vision conditions were being reclassified either as neurological diseases or as conditions that exerted their primary effect on the nervous system. According to the American Association of Family Physicians: Vision loss among the elderly is a major health care problem. Approximately one person in three has some form of vision-reducing eye condition by the age of 65. I don't know about you but ever since I went north of fifty it's just been getting worse. I need to use the light on my cell phone to read the menu at a restaurant. Obviously, it's not just me, it's everyone who is aging. My friends and I lament for the days when we could read a paper without glasses. But, while this kind of thing is an inconvenience, there are many people who have catastrophic life quality issues because of vision loss associated with aging. In fact, the American Foundation for the Blind says that 6.5 million Americans over age 65 have a severe visual impairment. The idea of a loss of your independence and enjoyment of life that could come from this kind of vision loss is terrifying. A Seismic Shift in Combating Vision Loss The really tragic thing here is that there are millions of people that are having their happiness in life stolen from them because of reversible eye ailments.. Yes, in many cases degenerative eyesight loss can often be prevented or reversed but usually isn't. That's because doctors are prioritizing on the wrong problem! Let me explain with an analogy...if you owned an older car that had some wear and tear. -- Let's imagine the tires were old and balding, that could be a serious problem. So, you can spend a few hundred bucks and replace the tires. Normally, that would be an idea that makes sense. But, what if that same car also had a small but serious problem with the engine...one that was causing it to misfire, stall and eventually stop running? Would you still replace the tires first? Before the engine problem? Of course not! If the engine can't run what's the point of replacing the tires? Well, the same principal applies to your aging eyes. As I've explained, we now know that our vision is dependent upon the transmission of electrical impulses from your eyes to your brain. And that much of the problem with bad vision as you age comes from the breakdown of that \"electrical\" flow. The good news is that there is a simple and effective way to repair that transmission and restore good vision. The Natural Discovery that Might Change Everything Cutting edge research neural biologists have discovered that Neural Code Transmission is the secret to long term high grade vision. In order to understand how this discovery can help save your own eyesight, it's helpful to understand the biology of how electric impulses affect your vision. | | | | The description in the box to the right gives the technical description of how your eyes and brain work together. But this is the simplified version. Your eyes capture light signals and transmit them to your brain through electrical impulses which turns them into images it can process and you can visualize. | | | | How Your Eyes and Brain Work Together Light enters the front of the eye through the pupil and is focused by the lens onto the retina. Rod cells on the retina respond to the light and send a message through the optic nerve fiber to the brain. Then your brain uses mapping to make sense of visual information from the eye. I'm sure you've heard the old expression, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?\" There is no place this is more applicable than when it comes to your eyes. Flush Your Body with a Vital Nutrient for Your Neuroprotection The above diagrams can help you envision the difference of how well electric impulses are transmitted from the eyes to your brain in a healthy body compared to one that isn't getting the right nutrients to protect it. You can see that if there is degeneration of cells, the steady and reliable transmission of impulses can be interfered with. The before picture depicts an image of a weakened impulse signal from an aged eye that is malnourished. The strong electrical impulses picture depicts the kind of improved signal one might have if the body is flushed with potent natural nutrients. The optic nerve primarily routes information with the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, where visual perception happens. If the electric transmissions don't function properly it can cause your vision to diminish. Unfortunately for us, as humans age there is degeneration of the cells that are critical in the sending of these electronic impulses. But, as I said there is good news. Researchers have uncovered an essential nutrient that can actually offer your body neuroprotection. This miraculous nutrient is essential to life itself and actually comprises 1/1000 of the composition of your body. It originally came to the attention of scientists in the 1970's when experiments were conducted on animals that were deprived of this nutrient and didn't develop proper vision. The name of this miracle nutrient is Taurine. Since that time significant research has been conducted into taurine's role in the development and maintenance of vision. Studies have also revealed that the levels of taurine do decline in the retina when people age. (1) Taurine is available in food sources but in such small quantities that people simply don't get enough of it to maintain the levels needed to protect your vision. However, there are multiple \"platinum\" studies that show that taurine can and does indeed offer protection for your vision if optimum levels of taurine are maintained by the body. For instance there is one landmark study conducted by renowned Neurochemical and behavioral scientist, Dr. Nicolas Froger that had a group of 35 healthy humans consisting of 25 females and 10 males ranging in age from 50 to 89 years. In the abstract Dr. Froger explained that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration occurs in numerous retinal disorders leading to blindness. So, they sought to investigate if taurine could indeed fight cell retinal cell degeneration. The researchers led by Dr. Froger came to an iron clad conclusion: | | \"This study indicates that enriched taurine nutrition can directly promote RGC survival through RGC intracellular pathways. It provides evidence that taurine can positively interfere with retinal degenerative conditions.\"(2) | | Let me be clear that Dr. Froger is not a fringe scientist. He is a highly regarded leader in vision research. As I said this study is far from the only one that shows the miraculous protective qualities of taurine. In another platinum study published by The National Institutes of Health, taurine supplementation was found to help deter other serious retinal ailments. (3) As the president of a leading all natural health company I ordered my research team to immediately researching the possibility of developing an all natural dietary supplement that could help people preserve their vision with the leading ingredient being none other than taurine. | | | | Nicolas Froger Ph.D. Posseses a Ph.D. in neuropharmacology from Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris. He then investigated neuroglial interaction at College de France. He is currently Project Manager in neuroprotection at Vision Institute. He has published more than 20 papers in peer-reviewed journals and more than 10 communications in international meetings. | | | | Did Taurine Restore this 65 Year Old Man's Vision? | | Malcolm Morgan is a sixty five year old man that lives in Delray Beach, Florida. He was finding that over the last couple of years his eyesight was really deteriorating at an alarming rate. Then, Malcolm began a dietary supplementation program that included a healthy dosage of taurine. He has not been examined by a physician so he can't say for sure, but all he knows is that not only did his vision stop diminishing, but it has dramatically improved. He's back to reading the newspaper without glasses! Malcolm is a steadfast believer in the power of taurine. I tasked by team to continue the research and uncover any other vital nutrients that a person concerned about their vision loss associated with aging must have. It was a long and exhaustive search. I'm very pleased to tell you that besides the powerhouse taurine, we've identified some additional powerful natural vision enhancing nutrients. And, we've put them all together in what I feel is the world's finest all natural restorative vision products. I would like to present: If Crystal Vision only contained the powerhouse nutrient I've told you about, it would still most likely be the most effective and potent vision supplement you've ever tried. But the good news keeps on coming because I've got a few other very powerful restorative vision ingredients that we added. You just won't find many if any products that have such a fine combination of high grade, proven ingredients like Crystal Vision has. I would guess that many of the companies that sell these low quality inferior products skimp out on the expensive nutrients that really work. Or maybe they just don't know much about the latest research in how important the proper transmission of electrical charges in your eyes are? Crystal Vision is Very Expensive to Produce I'm not going to clown around with you when it comes to something as serious as protecting your vision. It's a fact of life. If you want high quality products you've got to pay for them. For me, when it comes to being able to keep my vision and the independence and joy that are dependent upon vision I'll pay. I'm not going to lie to you. Crystal Vision is not cheap. But, I have done everything that I can do to command efficiencies and shave off any possible costs to get you a price that won't put you in the poor house. I'll give you all the details on what it will cost to get your Crystal Vision, but first let me tell about these other amazing ingredients Crystal Vision has. The National Eye Institute Demonstrated this Nutrient Acts as a Powerful Antioxidant in Eye Tissue The next powerful nutrient in Crystal Vision we added was Quercetin. It appears to promote eye health in several ways. For example, the National Eye Institute demonstrated it acts as a powerful antioxidant in eye tissue. (7) And in Japan, studies on quercetin and related antioxidants showed they have a protective effect on retinal cells, as well. Retinal cells line the back of your eye and act as light receptors. So they play a critical role in the color, clarity and brightness of everything you see. (8) Have you heard of grape seed before? We included grape seed in Crystal Vision because it offers exceptional eye protection properties. A study published in the April 2012 issue \"Current Eye Research\" found that antioxidants in grape seeds protect cells in the retina. (9) In another study published in the January 2011 \"Molecular Vision.\" grape seed extract reduced oxidative damage to human lens cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. And to round out our formula to have the maximum raw power of the world's most potent eye protecting nutrients we have the below triple threat... Vitamin A: Vitamin A is essential to healthy vision. Your retinas use the vitamin A to convert light into the chemical reactions that make up vision. Vitamin A also helps to protect your eyes from the free radicals generated by exposure to UV light from the sun. Plus, vitamin A supports the macular tissues in your eyes, helping to keep your vision sharp and clear. Bilberry: Bilberry has been used for centuries to treat a variety of health conditions. It is related to the blueberry and is native to Northern Europe. Bilberry fruit contains chemicals known as anthocyanosides, plant pigments that have excellent antioxidant properties. During World War II, British fighter pilots reported improved nighttime vision after eating bilberry jam. Bilberry has exhibited protective benefits to the various eye conditions that are associated with aging. Lutein: Lutein is one of the carotenoids, yellow and orange pigments found in many fruits and vegetables including mangoes, corn, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, tomatoes and dark, leafy greens such as kale, and collards. Lutein and another carotenoid, zeaxanthin, form the yellow pigment of the retina and absorb blue light, a harmful component of sunlight. Lutein cannot be created by your body and must be gotten through nutritional sources.
