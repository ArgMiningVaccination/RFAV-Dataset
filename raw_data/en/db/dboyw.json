The short answer is, perhaps it needs investigation. The longer answer is, temporary facial paralysis with a probability of around 1 in 5000 versus the risk of death currently at about 1 in 300-400 if you get coronavirus?

It gave the numbers, but it didn't go into whether the ratio would be considered medically significant or not. Not that this is a reason to avoid getting a vaccine of course. I just think it's important to fully understand the risks before taking medications of any sort. We don't live in-and never will live in- a risk-free world. You could get in a wreck on the way to getting the shot. That any side effect is 'concerning' is granted, but in my opinion, should be tempered with reasoning and good sense. Do we even know if the facial paralysis was even caused by the vaccine? One person in the placebo group developed it from nothing more than being alive. One must weigh the risks of every decision we make, but when the decision involves lessening the chances of contracting a horrible disease, certain risks are worth taking.The one exception was Bell's Palsey, a temporary paralysis of facial muscles, which occurred in three people in the vaccine group, but only one in the placebo group.

And is the side effect itself entirely unexpected? It seems weird to me that facial paralysis would occur after an arm injection, but maybe that's something that happens with vaccines sometimes. I think it's probably more a case of \"that's a thing that happens to *people* sometimes\". I imagine it's hard to extrapolate from 4 cases in 30,000 trial participants to know whether that's much outside the number of people who get temporary facial paralysis for whatever reason in a given timeframe. Plus, one person in the placebo group also experienced it. If the first dose carries well more than half the benefit, perhaps then rollout should delay the second dose until everyone who needs the vaccine has had a least one dose?All this is great news, but I have yet to read any information about manufacturing capacity. This is a piece of information that is really needed to start to understand the rate at which the general population can get to a certain percentage of vaccination. Moderna said, a month or so ago, that they can supply 500 million doses (i.e. 250 million people) over the next year (globally, not just US), and possibly up to 1 billion doses if they can get enough of the necessary raw ingredients. Pfizer is in the same general ballpark. You are objectively terrible at effectively interpreting research data.1 in 300 is for the population at large, but you should know at this point that varies dramatically with age to the point where very few people actually face the average risk with most being far above or below it. Obviously someone 50+ has more to gain than lose from this vaccine. For younger adults, it is less clear cut. For children, where the chance of covid causing any problems whatsoever is in the one in hundreds of thousands range a benefit actually hasn't been shown so far.Any reason to be concerned about long-term issues that may arise from these vaccines not caught yet? I realize the trial results that lasted several months were overall very positive. But we have no long-term data and this is being authorized through emergency use. Yes, there are reasons to be concerned. Just like there are reasons to be concerned about that car in the other lane. You still get in the car. But there aren't any (rational) reasons to skip the immunization when it's offered. A poster earlier pointed out, you have a 1:300 or worse chance of a fatal outcome with COVID-19 (an analysis which doesn't include any of the obnoxious non fatal but sub acute to chronic issues with the viral infection). We're way past that in terms of vaccine safety. Furthermore, it looks like the first dose gives more than half the benefit, while the second dose gives more than half the risk for Pfizer which is similar to Moderna. That's interesting, and it means for low risk people the second dose may not produce more benefit than risk. It's a statistical occurrence. There is very little causally defined in any of this (they determine a mechanism in further study). They look to the frequencies and compare them to determine if there is a difference. It isn't necessarily the case that there was any causal connection between the issue and either the placebo or the vaccine being given. Imagine that it was \"stubbed their toe\"... shit just happens. If 99.99% of people who got the vaccine stubbed their toe vs 0.01% of the placebo group, everyone would look at it and scratch their heads and try to figure out the Why as that level of frequency and grouping would heavily imply possible causality. As it was some tiny subgroup, the placebo is taken as either giving the placebo effect (for facial paralysis i guess) or as a representation of baseline to compare the vaccine to. What it is taken as saying is 3 vs 1 has a 3x bump up over baseline... so maybe it does some tiny thing to increase probability of Bell's. Most people would pretty much dismiss it.The one exception was Bell's palsy, a temporary paralysis of facial muscles, which occurred in three people in the vaccine group, but only one in the placebo group.

I just think it's important to fully understand the risks before taking medications of any sort. I promise that you engage in activities that are more dangerous in so many ways, and many of them you do literally every day, multiplying your risk by n+1 every day you do it. This includes things like eating whatever food you eat, which comes with a very much higher than zero risk of a foodborne illness or even eventually causing cancer or diabetes; driving a car, which has a MUCH higher than zero risk of death or serious injury; walking, which carries a risk of falling, twisting your ankle, etc (falls kill more people every year than you might think); or even such mundane things as undergoing meiosis, which is a horribly inexact and messy process prone to error at an alarmingly high rate, leading to things like cancer and, eventually, death. Get your vaccines. And be sure to drink your Ovaltine. the.mighty.oracle wrote: defbca wrote: Just curious. How do you get Bell's Palsey from the placebo? It's a statistical occurrence.

You don't get it from the placebo. About 1/10,000 people just get it randomly in some given period of time (see posts above for frequency), and this study included 30,000 people.

And is the side effect itself entirely unexpected? It seems weird to me that facial paralysis would occur after an arm injection, but maybe that's something that happens with vaccines sometimes. Totally anecdotal, but my mother just had an elderly friend hospitalized with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome with Bell's Palsey that they believe was caused by a flu shot. Apparently it's a one in a million or so side effect, but you're more likely to get it from the flu itself. So it's not an unheard of side effect of vaccines in general. Scary stuff, but she's doing better and it usually resolves within six months. Yes! They had more cases by a load of 3x in vaccine vs placebo. That level of random event is NOT enough to imply causality. It's not even enough to lead to testing, because the correlation sucks. It's more likely a random event with marginal disparity between the populations. If there turns out to be a really solid correlation over time, they will move on to causal determination attempts.You don't get it from the placebo.

Would it be wrong to think that of the other two in the vaccine group, that the vaccine didn't have anything to do with the Bell's palsy for those two? Dude.

That then gives you until next fall to make enough vaccines for everyone to get a full series. An undertone here is whether your goal is to eradicate covid at any cost, in which case only permanent sterilizing immunity will do, or end the excess deaths the most expedient way possible in which case even just reducing the chance of severe covid is a big win.

Well, the incidence rate was tiny: 0.013% of the participants - with one of them being in the placebo group. Could just be RNG (randomly happened)- but even if not, risk to the vaccine group was awfully tiny. And per [http://www.neurocntr.com/bells-palsy.ph ... population]\"Worldwide statistics indicate a frequency of about .02% of the population.\" So the rate was actually lower in the Moderna study than would have been expected. If 0.2% of 30,000 people had gotten Bell's Palsy, you'd have expected 6 cases, not 4. I wouldn't. It's unilateral and even more profound than a controlled Botox for those good looks of yours.While that is possible I would say the likelyhood is that it does ever so slightly increase you risk of Bell's Palsy.

Vioxx was removed from market not Celebrex. Celebrex is still available with a prescription.Of course there is always the potential for unknown side effects with a new chemical entity. Generally though, long term side effects generally show up in drugs taken on a chronic basis. There is also the potential for low incidence serious side effects. FDA approved drugs have been removed from the market for both of these scenarios. Celebrex, a widely prescribed COX2 type anti-inflammatory, was removed from the market for cardiovascular side effects. (snip...) It all comes down to \"Do the benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks?\" (snip)... Full disclosure: I am a pharmacist and the above is just from memory and so the exact details may be slightly inaccurate but the general gist holds true. (snip)[/i]. But you're looking at production of only this one particular vaccine, and ignoring immunity conferred through infection (which we know lasts over six months). Furthermore, reducing deaths to a fraction of the current levels wouldn't require herd immunity, it would require protection for those over 60 who comprise the vast majority of the severe outcomes.You could make that same argument with respect to the second dose\u2014 we don't know how long that lasts either.

I would argue the latter should be done first\u2014 that doesn't preclude doing the former later. Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that a one-dose regimen gives around two months of protection (i.e. weeks 3-10 after dosing). In the US, with the estimated production rates over the next year, that's enough to protect a bit under 1/3 of the population at any given time (estimates are 300 million doses over the next six months, so 50 million per month, and 100 million within the protection window). That would certainly help tamp down outbreaks, but it's well below the ~2/3 needed to get into the herd-immunity regime. All I'm saying is that it's not a slam-dunk decision to go with a 1-dose regimen. Not until we have some idea of what would be involved. If it's one month of protection, the numbers are a lot worse. If it's 3 or 4, then yes go for it, that's enough to make a big difference and at the upper end it gets you into the herd immunity range. But it's a big decision to make, and doing it without any data seems rather risky. The hosts of the \"This week in Virology\" podcast [1] are frequently (including the most recent episode) mentioning that there's not yet evidence that any of the vaccines provide \"sterilizing immunity\". I.e. that being vaccinated means you just don't catch the virus. It's still possible that a vaccinated person will catch the virus, be asymptomatic, and infect others who are unvaccinated.As such, it's critical to have younger people be vaccinated to prevent transmission to elderly folks (and others) with less substantial immune responses. There's no previous coronavirus vaccines nor any previous RNA vaccines to compare to. What it's actually based on is that the antibody response is bigger after two doses. Antibody studies don't supersede the real-world data about infection rates from this study. There are many vaccines that work well enough to be useful in a single dose. Seasonal flu being an example. In fact, in the case of flu B there was a long-standing debate in the field about whether a second dose actually made you less immune, although that seems to be tilting in favor of it not mattering.FWIW, the two-dose regimen is based on quite a lot of already established research.You could make that same argument with respect to the second dose\u2014 we don't know how long that lasts either. In fact there's no evidence about whether the second dose increases the duration one way or another.We know from this data that a single-dose regimen (of either the Pfizer or the Moderna) offers a few weeks of immunity. We don't know how long it lasts after that without the second shot. Seems like something worth studying, because it would certainly be a huge win in many respects (twice as many people protected, fewer side effect issues, less of a logistical headache getting second shots arranged for the right time window), but if the protection faded after a month or two without the second dose that'd be bad.If the first dose carries well more than half the benefit, perhaps then rollout should delay the second dose until everyone who needs the vaccine has had a least one dose?All this is great news, but I have yet to read any information about manufacturing capacity. This is a piece of information that is really needed to start to understand the rate at which the general population can get to a certain percentage of vaccination. Moderna said, a month or so ago, that they can supply 500 million doses (i.e. 250 million people) over the next year (globally, not just US), and possibly up to 1 billion doses if they can get enough of the necessary raw ingredients. Pfizer is in the same general ballpark. But even if we concede that the first dose only helps for a couple months while the second makes it last a lifetime, that still doesn't make giving half the people two doses makes sense at this time in places that are dealing with major outbreaks. Vaccinating twice as many people could bring the current high death rates in countries like the USA down faster and be more likely to end the winter outbreak. That then gives you until next fall to make enough vaccines for everyone to get a full series. An undertone here is whether your goal is to eradicate covid at any cost, in which case only permanent sterilizing immunity will do, or end the excess deaths the most expedient way possible in which case even just reducing the chance of severe covid is a big win. I would argue the latter should be done first\u2014 that doesn't preclude doing the former later. So, on some level, they actually *do* kind of know what they are doing here. You are just pulling wild speculation right out of your own ass and acting like it's some kind of brilliant thought. Maybe its just my 2020 talking, but I can't help but feel like there's another shoe that's going to drop at some point here. Maybe a long term side effect that we haven't studied it long enough for or something like that. 2020 has ruined everything, even good news like this data seems to be. Thank you for this.All this is great news, but I have yet to read any information about manufacturing capacity. This is a piece of information that is really needed to start to understand the rate at which the general population can get to a certain percentage of vaccination. I've been keeping a spreadsheet on the different vaccines, manufacturing capacity, US contracts, etc. I'm a software developer, not an Epidemiologist or Logistician. Keep that in mind. My data sources have been all from reports and comments from experts and news articles. [https://twitter.com/siromega/status/1338863234846060546] 1 in 300 is for the population at large, but you should know at this point that varies dramatically with age to the point where very few people actually face the average risk with most being far above or below it. Obviously someone 50+ has more to gain than lose from this vaccine. For younger adults, it is less clear cut. For children, where the chance of covid causing any problems whatsoever is in the one in hundreds of thousands range a benefit actually hasn't been shown so far.Any reason to be concerned about long-term issues that may arise from these vaccines not caught yet? I realize the trial results that lasted several months were overall very positive. But we have no long-term data and this is being authorized through emergency use. Yes, there are reasons to be concerned. Just like there are reasons to be concerned about that car in the other lane. You still get in the car. But there aren't any (rational) reasons to skip the immunization when it's offered. A poster earlier pointed out, you have a 1:300 or worse chance of a fatal outcome with COVID-19 (an analysis which doesn't include any of the obnoxious non fatal but sub acute to chronic issues with the viral infection). We're way past that in terms of vaccine safety. Furthermore, it looks like the first dose gives more than half the benefit, while the second dose gives more than half the risk for Pfizer which is similar to Moderna. That's interesting, and it means for low risk people the second dose may not produce more benefit than risk. Doh! I knew that. (I did use the caveat though! Old man brain.)Vioxx was removed from market not Celebrex. Celebrex is still available with a prescription.Of course there is always the potential for unknown side effects with a new chemical entity. Generally though, long term side effects generally show up in drugs taken on a chronic basis. There is also the potential for low incidence serious side effects. FDA approved drugs have been removed from the market for both of these scenarios. Celebrex, a widely prescribed COX2 type anti-inflammatory, was removed from the market for cardiovascular side effects. (snip...) It all comes down to \"Do the benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks?\" (snip)... Full disclosure: I am a pharmacist and the above is just from memory and so the exact details may be slightly inaccurate but the general gist holds true. (snip)[/i]. But you're looking at production of only this one particular vaccine, and ignoring immunity conferred through infection (which we know lasts over six months). Furthermore, reducing deaths to a fraction of the current levels wouldn't require herd immunity, it would require protection for those over 60 who comprise the vast majority of the severe outcomes.You could make that same argument with respect to the second dose\u2014 we don't know how long that lasts either. In fact there's no evidence about whether the second dose increases the duration one way or another. But even if we concede that the first dose only helps for a couple months while the second makes it last a lifetime, that still doesn't make giving half the people two doses makes sense at this time in places that are dealing with major outbreaks. Vaccinating twice as many people could bring the current high death rates in countries like the USA down faster and be more likely to end the winter outbreak.

An undertone here is whether your goal is to eradicate covid at any cost, in which case only permanent sterilizing immunity will do, or end the excess deaths the most expedient way possible in which case even just reducing the chance of severe covid is a big win. I would argue the latter should be done first\u2014 that doesn't preclude doing the former later. Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that a one-dose regimen gives around two months of protection (i.e. weeks 3-10 after dosing). In the US, with the estimated production rates over the next year, that's enough to protect a bit under 1/3 of the population at any given time (estimates are 300 million doses over the next six months, so 50 million per month, and 100 million within the protection window). That would certainly help tamp down outbreaks, but it's well below the ~2/3 needed to get into the herd-immunity regime. All I'm saying is that it's not a slam-dunk decision to go with a 1-dose regimen. Not until we have some idea of what would be involved. If it's one month of protection, the numbers are a lot worse. If it's 3 or 4, then yes go for it, that's enough to make a big difference and at the upper end it gets you into the herd immunity range.
