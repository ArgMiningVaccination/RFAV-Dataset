A. King2, Charles H. King2 1Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio, United St ates of America, 2Center for Global Health and Diseases, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America, 3Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, United States of America Abstract: On a global basis, both potent vaccine efficacy and high vaccine coverage are necessary to control andeliminate vaccine-preventable diseases. Emerging evi- dence from animal and human studies suggest that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) significantly impairresponse to standard childhood immunizations. A reviewof efficacy and effectiveness studies of vaccination among individuals with chronic parasitic infections was conduct- ed, using PUBMED database searches and analysis of datafrom the authors' published and unpublished studies. Both animal models and human studies suggest that chronic trematode, nematode, and protozoan infectionscan result in decreased vaccine efficacy. Among pregnantwomen, who in developing countries are often infected with multiple parasites, soluble parasite antigens have been shown to cross the placenta and prime or tolerizefetal immune responses. As a result, antenatal infectionscan have a significant impact on later vaccine responses. Acquired childhood parasitic infections, most commonly malaria, can also affect subsequent immune response tovaccination. Additional data suggest that antiparasitetherapy can improve the effectiveness of several human vaccines. Emerging evidence demonstrates that both antenatal and childhood parasitic infections alter levelsof protective immune response to routine vaccinations. Successful antiparasite treatment may prevent immuno- modulation caused by parasitic antigens during pregnan-cy and early childhood and may improve vaccine efficacy.Future research should highlight the varied effects that different parasites (alone and in combination) can have on human vaccine-related immunity. To optimize vaccineeffectiveness in developing countries, better control ofchronic NTDs may prove imperative. Introduction Since the inception of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, many global partners, including the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, and the Gates Foundation, have joined to support mass global immunization projects that have resulted in a significant drop in child mortality worldwide [1]. Programmatic effectiveness has been primarily measured as the operational improvement in vaccine coverage, with the tacit assumption that average individual vaccine response (i.e., average vaccine efficacy) remains the same for all populations [2,3]. For example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines has improved the percentage of children receiving diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccinations from 71% in 1999 to 78% in 2004 [4]. Despitethese impressive attempts at mass vaccination coverage, vaccine- preventable diseases still kill an estimated 1 to 2 million African children each year [5]. Whereas efficacy is the measure of theimpact of treatment in an ideal (study) environment, effectiveness is the measure of impact in ''real-world'' settings [6]. Thesepreventable deaths contribute to the high infant and childhoodmortality rates experienced by these countries and, by definition, highlight the lapse in vaccine effectiveness in resource-poor areas. Vaccines are among the most cost-effective health interventions available for the prevention of life-threatening and disablinginfectious diseases. Even so, the overall effectiveness of vaccine strategies requires both adequate coverage among vulnerable populations and induction of a satisfactory protective immuneresponse in each susceptible individual. Although extensiveresources are now being committed to improve global childhoodvaccination coverage, in developing nations the response to standard vaccination often remains suboptimal [2,7-12]. The reasons for this poor vaccination response are undoubtedlycomplex, yet there are several causes that are likely to beamenable to intervention or preventive treatment (Figure 1). Inparticular, emerging clinical evidence suggests that chronic antenatal parasitic infection can significantly alter infant immune responses to standard childhood vaccinations [13-21]. Morelimited evidence also suggests that parasitic infections in the firstfew years of life can also impact immunity and response to vaccines [22]. In this review, our premise is that vaccine effectiveness will not be optimal among children of developingcountries until there is adequate treatment and prevention ofantenatal and early childhood parasitic infections. The reduced effectiveness of vaccination programs in develop- ing communities often has been blamed on cold-chain lapses and alack of support infrastructure [23-27]. However, as detailed laterin this review, chronic infections with neglected tropical diseases(NTDs) also appear to play a significant role in poor vaccine efficacy. Of special interest, maternal parasitic infections affect the unborn infant and appear to act as important immune responsemodifiers, although the mechanisms of the parasite-induced Citation: LaBeaud AD, Malhotra I, King MJ, Published May 26, 2009 Copyright: /C2232009 La Beaud et al.

Current evidence suggests that maternal parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis [28], filariasis [28-30], other helminths [31], and malaria [32] the period of gestation can suppress an infant's laterimmune responses to standard childhood vaccinations. Population-Based Evidence of Reduced Vaccine Effectiveness Several vaccination studies have shown that children from areas of sub-Saharan Africa are less responsive to standard childhoodvaccines than children from developed countries. These includevaccine trials of the antituberculosis vaccine [10,23], and polio vaccines [11,12]. For example, after receiving three oral polio vaccines, vaccinated children from industrializednations have 97%, 100%, and 100% seroconversion rates to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, whereas vaccinated children from developingnations show only 73%, 90%, and 70% protection, respectively [11]. What are the implications of this phenomenon? Recent outbreaks of polio in Africa show us that our ''control'' ofvaccine-preventable diseases is tenuous at best. A short-termfailure in vaccine coverage resulted in the rapid and seriousresurgence of a vaccine-preventable disease [34]. In recentNigerian polio outbreaks, the rapid spread to nearby Africancountries was in part related to low herd immunity caused bydecreased vaccine coverage (10 countries) [35]. Of specialimportance, however, polio also reemerged in well-vaccinatedAfrican countries such as Ghana, Botswana, and, now morerecently, Kenya, where the vaccine coverage rate was high (.90%) [35,36]. Vaccine programs in these countries were ineffective in preventing these outbreaks, despite high vaccinationcoverage, suggesting suboptimal vaccine efficacy among at-riskindividuals within well-vaccinated local populations. Potential Causes of Reduced Efficacy in Developing Countries Failure to respond appropriately to vaccination is most often associated with a suite of poverty-related conditions, including bothmalnutrition and chronic infection. Clinical features of povertyinclude protein-calorie and micronutrient undernutrition and recurring exposure to parasites (protozoa and helminths) that independently contribute to chronic anemia and poor physicalgrowth and development [37]. Chronic parasitic infections also have a substantial impact on cognitive and intellectual development and education [38-40]. Fortunately, many of these deleterious effects canbe reversed with antiparasite treatment [41-44]. However, reinfec-tion remains common in this setting, and the global burden ofparasitic infections remains unacceptably high [45]. Effects of Parasitic Infection on Host Immunity The deleterious effects of polyparasitism on host immunity may help to explain the poor response to childhood vaccination that isseen in the developing world. Both animal and human studiesindicate that parasitic infections can impair long-term responses tovaccination. In addition, multiple concurrent infections are likely tohave additive or synergistic effects on immune responses. Studies in both human and animal models have shown that trematode, nematode, and Plasmodium infections lead to decreased vaccine efficacy and an inability to ward off new infection [19,46-48]. Trematode Infections Elias et al. [15] compared the efficacy of BCG vaccine in mice with and without Schistosoma mansoni infection and determined that BCG-vaccinated, schistosome-infected mice have significantly lessvaccine-induced protection against virulent tuberculosis challenge than those without schistosome infection. In studies of humans with trematode infection, a decreased response to tetanus toxoidvaccination has been demonstrated in the presence of schistoso-miasis, associated with significantly altered Th1- and Th2-typeimmune responses to tetanus toxoid in vitro [18]. Nematode Infections Two studies performed in mice show that nematode infection impairs response to malaria vaccination and further illustrate thatcure of parasitic infection before immunization, and not after, increases host vaccine response [18,46,47]. Additionally, in humans, deworming with albendazole has been shown to improvethe effectiveness of vaccine response to BCG [16] and to oralcholera vaccine [13,14]. Protozoan Infections Chronic protozoan infections also have been proven to have harmful effects on vaccination response, with decreased levels ofresponse to tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b [5], and typhoid vaccines noted in the presence of concurrent malaria infection Figure 1. Theoretical mechanisms of reduced vaccine response in infants. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000442.g001 www.plosntds.org 2 May 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 5 | e442[17,20,21]. Whether or not treatment of malaria can improve vaccine response is controversial and appears to depend on whichvaccines are tested. No effect was observed on DTP and measlesvaccination [49,50], but malaria treatment has been found to beassociated with improved immunization response to meningococ-cal vaccines [51,52]. Evidence on the Impact of Antenatal Parasite Infection on Later Childhood Vaccine Responses ''Imprinting'' of the immune system during fetal development also may play a significant role in reduced vaccine effectiveness inparasite-endemic areas. In developing countries, women of child-bearing age are frequently infected with one or more parasites, as seen in our cohorts in coastal Kenya and others [53] (Figure 2). If left untreated, their chronic infections will persist throughout the period of pregnancy. As a consequence of persistent infection, solubleparasite-derived products cross the placenta, potentially priming ortolerizing the fetal immune system's response to these parasite-specificantigens and to unrelated antigens [31]. Many helminth-mediatedimmunoregulatory effects drive the balance of human host immunitytowards Th2-type reactivity, yet natural or vaccine-mediated immunity requires mainly Th1-type responses to provide vaccine- mediated protection [30,54]. On th e basis of emerging evidence from longitudinal maternal-infant coho rt studies, exposure to parasites in utero appears to induce an immunomodulatory phenotype thatpersists into infancy and later childhood, significantly affectingprotective responses to antigens included in standard childhoodvaccines (Figure 3). The treatment of helminthic infections duringpregnancy has been shown to have many beneficial effects, including the reduction of HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), low birth weight incidence, and infant mortality [55]. Data suggest manyother detrimental effects of chronic maternal parasitic infection oninfant outcomes [55-64]. Whether or not parasitic treatment ofpregnant women can impact infant immunization efficacy has notbeen adequately studied, although evidence suggests that treatment ofparasitic infections in pregnant women has significant immunity-modifying effects in their infants [28,65]. Evidence on the Impact of Early Childhood Parasitic Infection on Vaccination Responses Successful treatment of pregnant mothers for parasitic infections may prevent sensitization to parasitic antigens during pregnancyand may improve vaccination outcomes of the unborn child by diminishing parasite-driven fetal priming. Later primary exposureto parasitic infections during the first years of life also can affectsubsequent immune response to vaccination. Although malaria isthe most common parasitic infection in young children, schisto-somiasis, filariasis, and intestinal helminthic infections also havebeen shown to occur in infants [30,66,67]. Polyparasitism is knownto affect immune function and vaccination response[15,18,19,46,47]. The evidence that early childhood parasitictreatment yields improved response to vaccination is sparse anddeserves further study [16,51,52]. Figure 2.

Animal models suggest that exposure to parasites in utero may be either beneficial (by accelerating the development of protective antibodies and cellular immune responses) or detri- mental (by impairing the acquisition of a protective immune response and inducing immune tolerance) [71-74]. Immune tolerance may be due to clonal deletion of specific cell subsets, which leads to loss of antigen-reactive cells in utero and subsequent lack of recall response during antigen exposure later in infancy. Another possible tolerance mechanism is clonal anergy, which results from a lack of adequate costimulation by antigen- presenting cells to CD4 +cells. Finally, tolerance may be due to the de novo generation of populations of immunoregulatory cells. Prenatal exposure to malaria, schistosomiasis, and filariasis may lead to the acquisition of a subset of immunoregulatory CD4 +T cells. A distinct population of CD4 +regulatory-1 cells (Tr1) has been shown to be able to arise from CD34 +cells in the neonate [75] in response to IL-10 and IFN- a[76]. Specifically, IL-10 has been proposed to be responsible for modulating subsequent immune responses during subsequent exposure to new, unrelated antigens. Tr1 cells are antigen-specific CD4 +cells that are distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells in that they produce significant amounts of IL-10, variable IFN- c, TGF- b, and IL-5, but little or no IL-2 and no IL-4. The CD4 +CD25 +T cells represent another population of regulatory T cells whose development is partially mediated by IL-10 and TGF- b[77]. As with chronic helminth infections, exposure to maternal malaria leads to the generation of significant levels of malaria blood stage antigen-driven IL-10 in cord blood and infant lymphocytes. Presumably, this immuno- modulation may benefit the human host by limiting inflammation caused by chronic parasite infections in early childhood and later adolescence. However, the concomitant downside is a reduced ability to respond to acute bacterial and viral infections and to vaccination. In humans, ''tolerance'' (manifested by the generation of immunoregulatory populations of lymphocytes by prenatal antigenic exposure) is likely to contribute to the long-term persistence of many intravascular parasitic infections [30,54,78- 80]. In our studies, tolerance is defined as an altered or suppressed immune response to parasite antigens during infancy or childhood in the progeny of women infected during pregnancy. Maternal infection with lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, and the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and T. gondii have been shown to enhance the offspring's susceptibility to subsequent infection, and this phenomenon is associated with impaired or altered fetal immune response to parasite antigens. Children born to filarial-infected mothers, for example, have depressed cytokine responses in T cells and lymphocyte proliferation by peripheral blood mononuclear cells to filarial antigens compared to offspring from uninfected mothers. They are also significantly more likely to acquire filarial infection in the first 5 years of life and continue to show altered responses to parasite antigens years after birth [29]. Not all in utero exposure to maternal helminth infections results in tolerance. Instead, for some newborns, prenatal parasite exposure results in a constant state of antiparasite immune activation that is characterized by a Th2-dominant cytokine profile, high IgE levels, and eosinophilia. Such an immune profile also may have an adverse impact on the efficacy of vaccines by limiting Th1 pathways of immune response to vaccination. By altering the immunologic balance between Th1 and Th2 pathways, chronic parasitic infections appear to alter theimmunologic milieu and would also likely impair or suppress the ''normal'' responses to vaccines that have been described inparasite-free, developed countries. Other Implications of Parasite Infection for Infectious Disease Transmission Polyparasitism's effects on immunity are believed to be partly responsible for the increasing virulence of the world's most lethalinfections: HIV [81,82], malaria [83,84], and tuberculosis [85,86]. In addition, helminth infection is associated with an increased risk for MTCT of HIV [87]. Some studies of HIV-parasite coinfectionsuggest that antihelminthic therapy may reduce CD4 depletionand progression of viral load in HIV-infected patients [88].Parasite effects on immunity need to be highlighted as newvaccines against HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis are moving forward in clinical trials, because optimal vaccine efficacy may require effective antiparasite therapy to control for the immunesystem impact of these chronic pathogens [38,89-92]. Suggestions for Current Antenatal and Infant Care and for Future Research A growing body of evidence now demonstrates that antenatal and childhood parasitic infections both deleteriously alterresponses to routine vaccination. To truly optimize vaccinationcampaign effectiveness and vaccine efficacy in all areas of the world, parallel efforts are needed to control endemic parasitic infections. More data are needed to identify the multifactorialcauses of impaired vaccine efficacy, including research specificallyaddressing the impact of preventive antiparasite therapy onmaternal and infant health outcomes. The immune response to parasites can be beneficial or detrimental. Immune modulation makes it difficult to predict theimpact of intermittent parasite treatment. Perhaps a repeatingcycle of infection/treatment/reinfection may be worse for vaccine response than low level chronic infection. This area is worthy of further study and must determine the appropriate treatmentintervals for these infections. Also, more data are needed toobjectively define the optimal timing between deworming andvaccination. Ideally, pregnant women should be free of infection throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy, but perhaps reinfection in the last trimester is particularly detrimental withrespect to fetal priming. Ultimately, a carefully designed double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in infected pregnant women wouldprovide the critical evidence to support or refute the need forantenatal parasitic treatment. If antenatal and early child deworming are to be implemented as standard interventions, then the associated changes in vaccineefficacy and effectiveness should be concurrently documented in well-designed, prospective studies. Animal models suggest that the loss of cross-protective or immunomodulatory effects of polypar-asitism may mean that some parasitic diseases may becomeclinically worse before they are fully eradicated. So far, theavailable evidence indicates that deworming has clear benefits interms of birth outcomes [62,93]. If deworming is also found to amplify vaccination effects, then it is clearly time to intensively test and implement antiworm strategies and their ''indirect vaccina-tion'' effect on at-risk populations. Ultimately, because of the real-world roadblock that parasite infections present to vaccineeffectiveness, mass vaccination campaigns likely will not reachtheir full potential unless vaccines and antiparasite strategies are implemented together. www.plosntds.org 4 May 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 5 | e442References 1.
