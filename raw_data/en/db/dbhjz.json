Our doctors are graduates of prestigious Chinese medicine universities in mainland, China - namely, Beijing University of TCM and Shanghai University of TCM. These universities offer the finest training programs for Asian medicine in the world. Beijing and Shanghai's Oriental Medical programs involve extensive training in Western as well as Eastern medicine. The comprehensive programs offered by these universities, combined with their extensive internships and their many years of clinical experience, make our doctors uniquely suited to work with Western patients and their doctors. Treatments are explained in a clear and straightforward manner, and healing programs can be designed to complement Western diagnoses and medical care. The doctors' profound herbal knowledge prevents any negative interactions with prescription drugs. At the Traditional Chinese Medicine Healing Center, your health and safety is always paramount. Specializing in Infertility, Women's Health, Pain Management, Autoimmune Diseases, Herbal Medicine & Nutritional Counseling Infertility Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can greatly improve the probability of conception and a healthy pregnancy by enhancing the health and vitality of the whole body, balancing energy flow, and improving one's hormonal functioning. Our holistic approach to health and fertility is the key to our success in helping couples conceive, either naturally or with assisted reproductive methods such as IVF or IUI. Pain Management The ancient art of acupuncture has been used in Asia for centuries to treat many conditions and relieve pain. It's now being used in the United States and other Western countries to ease everything from low back pain, to nerve pain (such as painful shingles rashes), to headaches, fibromyalgia, and menstrual cramps \u2014 and more. Herbal Medicine At TCM Healing Center, we customize formulas for the individual using only the highest quality herbs which are GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified and contain no preservatives, sweeteners, and toxic heavy metals. Chinese herbal medicine helps to nourish and strengthen the body's defenses while simultaneously supporting the energetic transformations that occur during acupuncture treatments. Nutritional Counseling Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Using food as medicine goes back thousands of years. Chinese nutrition aims to bring balance to the body. At TCM Healing Center we integrate the ancient wisdom of TCM with labs and functional medicine tests to address current health concerns. Women's Health Traditional Chinese Medicine has been used for thousands of years to successfully treat symptoms related to female hormonal imbalance such as PMS, menopause, infertility, acne, or hormonal migraines. At our clinic, we take into account all aspects of a woman's health when devising a treatment plan - diet and nutrition, gastrointestinal health, lifestyle factors such as sleep and exercise, emotional and spiritual well-being, and stress related to work, family, or environmental factors. Facial Acupuncture This cosmetic treatment is an extension of traditional acupuncture. It's said to naturally help make the skin look younger, smoother, and all-around healthier. And unlike injection procedures, facial acupuncture addresses not only signs of aging, but also the skin's overall health. TCM Healing Center 12304 Santa Monica "}
