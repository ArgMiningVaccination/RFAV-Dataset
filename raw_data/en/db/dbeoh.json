Lin MD 2/12/2016Epidemiology of TB 9.6 million new cases in 2014 12% of them are in HIV positive patients 1.5 million deaths in 2014 ~646 million women are infected worldwide Kills more women than any other infectious disease Can be vertically or horizontally transferred Spread through the air by droplets Pregnancy does not alter courseTB in the United States Who is at risk? HIV positive patients Close contact with persons known or suspected to have tuberculosis Medical risk factors known to increase risk for disease if infected E.g. Immunocompromised, on TNF blockers Recent immigrants from TB endemic areas Low income IV Drug Use Alcohol addiction Residency in a long -term care facility (e.g. correctional institution, mental institution, nursing home) Health professionals working in high -risk health care facilitiesSigns/Symptoms of Active TB Cough (74%) Weight loss (41%) Upper medial retraction of hilar markings HIV infected patients can have normal CXRExtrapulmonary TB Occurs in 16% of cases Occurs in up to 60 to70% of AIDS patients with TB Can affect Lymph nodes Bone Kidneys Intestine Meninges Breasts Endometrium Rare in pregnancyLatent TB Positive PPD or blood test Asymptomatic Not infectious Negative CXR Negative Sputum Cultures Without treatment only 5 to 10% of HIV negative patients will progress to active disease (most likely to occur within 2 years of infection) 50% of HIV positive patients develop active disease within 2 years of infection 5-10% of patients with TB who acquire HIV will develop active disease each yearScreening Tests PPD ( Mantoux injected subcutaneously Delayed hypersensitivity reaction Must be read 48 to 72 hours later Requires two visits Measure induration (not erythema) Positive test is induration >5 to 15 mm depending on population www.mayomedicallaboratories.comCutoffs for Positive PPD 5mm 10 mm 15 mm HIV positive individuals Recent immigrants (< 5 years) from high -prevalence countriesConsidered positive in anyone Recent contact of a person with active TBInjection drug users Fibrotic changes on CXR consistent with prior TBResidents and employees of high-risk congregate settings Patients with organ transplants Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Persons who are immunosuppressed for other reasons (e.g., taking the equivalent of >15 mg/day of prednisone for 1 month or longer, taking TNF -aantagonists)Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk Children < 4 years of age Infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high -risk categoriesCauses of False Positive or Negative PPD False Positive False Negative Infection with non tuberculosis mycobacteriumWeakened immune system and impaired cellular reactivity Previous BCG Vaccination Recent TB infection within 8 to 10 weeks of exposure Technical Factors Improper Storage Improper placement Improper InterpretationVery old TB infection Very young age < 6 months Recent live virus immunization Overwhelming TB disease Some Viral illnesses Technical Factors Modified from: http ://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/articles/communique/2010/01.htmlInterferon Gamma Release test (T -Spot) Measure immune reactivity to M. tuberculosis Interferon gamma released from white blood cells in patients with M.
