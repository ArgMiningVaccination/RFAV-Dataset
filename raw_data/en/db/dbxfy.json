With over a decade of experience practicing both Zen and Tibetan Buddhism under Thich Nhat Hanh and Anam Thubten respectively, Asenath has the ability to lead beginners and seasoned practitioners alike in guided meditation. Often, beginners think that meditation will be difficult, because we are used to our minds running amok. But meditation is not about wrestling with or controlling your mind. It's about befriending it and allowing it to rest, which is actually quite pleasant, and allows us to gain more ease and a sense of freedom from the pressures of modern life. Come sit with us on Wednesdays and allow this practice to lead you into stilllness and appreciation of the wonders of life. 1 hour Donation Based, Drop-In Buddhist(ish) Book Study and Discussion Group Do you enjoy contemplating the deep questions that come with being human? Where we come from, what it all means, how we can live in a way that is meaningful and peaceful and joyful, how we can cope with the feelings and pressures and tragedies of life? Each Tuesday evening from 6:30-8, Asenath will facilitate a discussion based on Buddhist books from great teachers where we explore these issues and more. A discussion group such as this is one of the best ways to deepen your spiritual life. We will meditate together for half and hour, and then read a chapter together and discuss. Don't worry if you are dropping in during the middle of a book. Each discussion can be taken independently. You don't need to have the book or have done any homework. And don't worry if you think you won't have much to share. You can participate as much as you like, or just sit back and absorb. Either way will be very beneficial. 90 minutes Donation Based, Drop-In Guided BreathWork, Journaling and More Breathwork is a way to release old patterns quickly and effectively. Sunday evenings at 7:30, Join Margaret for guided breathwork sessions that incorporate lunar and solar cycles, card readings, Kundalini, journaling, and more. Margaret has studied around the world and is a trained midwife, birth & postpartum doula, Reiki master, Registered Yoga Teacher, and kinesiologist.
