It is a form of ancient Chinese medicine in which fine sterile needles are inserted into acupuncture points in the skin. The overall aim is to restore the body's equilibrium, reducing pain and illness.

It is believed that illness is experienced as a result of QI not being able to flow freely throughout the body.
