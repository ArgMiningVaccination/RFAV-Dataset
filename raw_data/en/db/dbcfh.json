If you are troubled by dust allergy, fret not. We got you covered! You can easily treat dust allergies at home. While pollen, food choices, weather, humidity, dust, and pollution can all lead to some allergic reactions, dust allergy often seems to get mistaken for frequent episodes of common cold and low immunity. To help you deal with dust allergy effectively, we have shortlisted some of the simplest home remedies that can help manage the symptoms. Read on. In This Article What Causes Dust Allergy? Dust mites are the main culprits behind dust allergy. Listed below are a few other causes: - Pollen - Pollen is a fine powdery substance that consists of pollen grains. It is a natural part of trees, flowers, and grasses. Different people may be allergic to different types of pollen. - Cockroaches - Cockroach droppings can cause dust allergy in some individuals when inhaled ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604733/)). These tiny particles often combine with household dust to cause allergy. - Mold - Mold is a kind of fungus that has spores that are capable of floating in the air. These spores can also cause dust allergy ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604733/)). - Yeast - Yeast is a cousin of mold, and you can have an overgrowth of yeast called Candida albicans in your intestines due to the overuse of antibiotic medication. Yeast can also colonize your nasal mucous membranes and sinuses, making them irritated and susceptible to dust allergies ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604733/)). - Animal Hair, Fur, And Feathers - Pets are another cause of dust allergy ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755411/)). Their skin flakes (called dander), urine, or saliva are potential allergens, especially when combined with dust. Dust allergy is often accompanied by non-stop sneezing and cold-like symptoms. The signs and symptoms are discussed below. What Are The Signs And Symptoms Of Dust Allergy? The most common symptoms of dust allergy are ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK447098/)): - A runny nose - Sneezing and sniffling [Itchy and red eyes](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-get-rid-of-eye-itching/) - Itching - Coughing and wheezing - Shortness of breath - Tightness in the chest While it is difficult to get rid of dust mites altogether, you can try some easy treatments that will help you tackle the allergens effectively. Listed below are a few home remedies for dust allergy. Home Remedies For Dust Allergy Eucalyptus Essential Oil [Eucalyptus essential oil](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-eucalyptus-oil-for-skin-hair-health/) was shown to have high activity against house dust mites. Its constituents act as ecofriendly biodegradable agents for the control of house dust mites ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1661675/)). You Will Need 3-4 drops of eucalyptus essential oil What You Have To Do Add a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil to a diffuser and inhale its vapors. How Often You Should Do This Do this 1-2 times daily. (B) Lavender Essential Oil Lavender oil has anti-inflammatory and analgesici [X]A type of pain reliever or painkilling drug used to relieve different degrees of pain ranging from headaches to joint pain. properties ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26247152)), ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909715)). It can also help you sleep better with its sedative nature ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/)). This may help manage the symptoms of dust allergy. You Will Need 2-3 drops of lavender essential oil What You Have To Do Put a few drops of lavender oil in your diffuser and inhale its vapors. How Often You Should Do This Do this once daily. 2. Local Honey Local and raw honey often contains small amounts of local pollen, which is believed to help with dust allergies. This is mainly useful for those who have seasonal allergies as regular consumption of small amounts of pollen via raw honey may make an individual less sensitive to it over time ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24188941)). You Will Need 2 teaspoons of raw honey What You Have To Do Consume two teaspoons of raw honey. How Often You Should Do This Do this 2 times daily. 3. Dehumidifier Dehumidifiers are devices that pull moisture out of the air, drying it out, thereby keeping mold triggers at bay ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11149998)). Dust allergy is often caused by dust mites and molds, both of which thrive in humid conditions. Hence, a dehumidifier is your best bet to relieve dust allergy and its symptoms. 4. Air Filter Air filters also play a major role in filtering and purifying the air around you. Studies show how these filters, especially those available today with advanced technologies, can improve indoor air quality ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587002/)). The finer the sieve of the filter, the smaller the particles it can trap. Using air filters can also help ease allergic respiratory diseases ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165134/)). 5. Apple Cider Vinegar The anti-inflammatory properties of apple cider vinegar, along with its expectoranti [X]A type of cough medicine that helps get rid of phlegm in the air passageways and clears congestion. nature, can help in treating dust allergy and the accompanying cold-like symptoms. ACV also has antimicrobial properties that can prevent aggravation of the allergy ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29224370)). It is a natural substitute for the store-bought antihistamines used for treating dust allergies. However, there is no scientific evidence to prove this effect. You Will Need - 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar - 1 glass of warm water - Honey (optional) What You Have To Do - Add two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to a glass of warm water and mix well. - You can also add a little honey for flavor. - Consume this solution. How Often You Should Do This Drink this solution 2-3 times daily. 6. Turmeric This golden spice is one of the best natural remedies for treating dust allergy. [Turmeric](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/turmeric-history-how-to-use-benefits/) contains an active constituent called curcumin that acts as a natural decongestant. It also acts as a natural antihistamine, i.e., it reduces the release of histamines in the body, which can otherwise trigger allergy ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18398870)). Additionally, turmeric also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can prevent your allergy from turning into an infection ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92752/)). You Will Need - 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric - 1 cup of milk - A pinch of pepper - Honey (optional) What You Have To Do - Add half a teaspoon of turmeric to a cup of milk. - Bring this just short of boiling in a saucepan. The boiled milk will curdle. - Add honey and allow the milk to cool. - Drink this mixture. How Often You Should Do This Do this at least 2 times daily. 7. Aloe Vera Aloe vera has natural anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12592663)), ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9121170)). It can help treat the swelling and pain caused by dust allergies. However, there are no scientific studies supporting its effect on dust allergy. You Will Need 1/4 cup of aloe vera juice What You Have To Do Drink one-fourth cup of aloe vera juice. How Often You Should Do This Do this 2 times daily. 8. Neti Pot Saline nasal sprays are an age-old method of relieving symptoms of nasal congestion and irritation. A neti pot not only rinses trapped dust and mold but also reduces congestion and helps control the inflammation and swelling caused due to the dust allergy ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2755042/)). You Will Need - A neti pot - Saltwater What You Have To Do - Fill your neti pot with saltwater. The ratio is \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of salt to two cups of warm water. Adding \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda per cup can keep the salt from drying the mucous membranes. - Bend over a washbasin with one ear parallel to the sink and insert the neti pot spout into one nostril. Pour half the solution into one nostril. - The saltwater will automatically flow from the other nostril. - Insert the spout in the other nostril and repeat the process. How Often You Should Do This Do this 2-3 times daily. 9. Vitamins [Vitamin C](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-vitamin-c-for-skin-hair-and-health/) is widely known for its antioxidant potential. Vitamin C supplementation can help treat dust and seasonal allergies ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7919130)), ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2221490)). This is because it not only prevents the release of histamines but also helps speed up their breakdown. An increase in the levels of histamines is known to cause extreme allergic reactions. A diet rich in citrus fruits and leafy green vegetables will increase your daily intake of vitamin C. You can also opt for additional supplements at a moderate dosage of 500 mg to 1,000 mg per day after consulting your doctor. 10. Peppermint Tea Rat studies show that peppermint has anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11201253)). It contains a volatile oil called menthol that rises to the sinuses and acts as a natural decongestant, providing immediate relief from sneezing, wheezing, and a runny nose ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12662469)). This can help in relieving the symptoms of dust allergy. You Will Need - 1 teaspoon of dried [peppermint leaves](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-peppermint-leaves-for-skin-hair-and-health/) - 1 cup of hot water - Honey What You Have To Do - Add a teaspoon of dried peppermint leaves to a cup of hot water and allow it to steep for 10 minutes. - Strain the tea and allow it to cool a bit. - Add honey to it. - Drink it up. How Often You Should Do This You can drink peppermint tea 2 times daily. 11. Nettle Leaf Tea [Nettle leaves](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-nettle-leaf-for-skin-hair-and-health/) are derived from the stinging nettle plant. This plant has natural anti-histamine properties that reduce the release of the allergy-causing histamines within your body ( [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19140159)). This, in turn, reduces the symptoms of dust allergy. The anti-inflammatory properties of this plant help reduce the inflammation and swelling of the airways that occurs as a result of the allergy ( [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2192379/)). It has been a go-to solution for dust allergies for decades. You Will Need - 1 teaspoon of dried nettle leaves - 1 cup of water - Honey What You Have To Do - Boil a teaspoon of dried nettle leaves with a cup of water in a saucepan. - Simmer for 5 minutes and strain the tea. - Allow it to cool for some time. Add a little honey and consume it. How Often You Should Do This You can drink nettle tea 2-3 times daily. 12. Green Tea Green tea has been found to help treat a wide range of allergies. It is abundant in a catechini [X]A naturally occurring chemical compound abundantly found in tea, cocoa, and berry plants rich in antioxidant properties. called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has antioxidant properties and helps treat dust allergy and its symptoms ( [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679539/)), ( [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23448449)). You Will Need - 1 green tea bag - 1 cup of hot water - Honey What You Have To Do - Steep a green tea bag in a cup of hot water for 5-10 minutes. - Make sure that your tea has cooled a little before adding some honey as required. - Consume it. How Often You Should Do This Drink green tea 3-4 times daily. 13. Ghee Pure ghee can help warm your nasal passage and relieve constant sneezing. Hence, it is widely used in treating dust allergy and its symptoms. This is mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties ( [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215354/)). However, there is a lack of scientific evidence to establish the efficacy of ghee in treating dust allergies. You Will Need - 1/4 teaspoon of ghee - Jaggery (cane sugar), optional What You Have To Do - If you are sneezing uncontrollably due to an allergy, suck on one-fourth teaspoon of ghee for immediate relief. - You can also mix ghee with a little jaggery for better results. How Often You Should Do This You can consume this whenever you get sudden allergy attacks. 14. Wasabi Wasabi is also known as Japanese horseradish. It contains a compound called allyl isothiocyanate, which acts as a decongestant and stimulates mucous flow, thereby helping to ease the symptoms of dust allergy. You can also consume the common horseradish if you are unable to get hold of wasabi ( [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11237192)). Note: Wasabi is very strong. Hence, start with an amount the size of a pearl. You Will Need 1/4 teaspoon of grated wasabi What You Have To Do - Consume grated wasabi whenever you experience allergy symptoms. - Alternatively, you can also consume wasabi paste. How Often You Should Do This Do this whenever you experience an allergy attack. 15. Homeopathic Remedies Homeopathy has developed many remedies for allergies. The top five are Arsenic alb, Sulphur, Natrum mur, Sabadilla, and Allium cepa. There are also combination homeopathic remedies. However, it is important to consult a homeopathic practitioner before trying out any of these. 16. House Plants You may also consider keeping a few allergy-friendly plants inside your home to combat dust allergy. Plants like dracaena can be quite useful in trapping allergens in their leaves. Other plants like bamboo and lady palm help keep insects at bay and also act as air purifiers and air filters ( [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258716/)), ( [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230460/)). 17. Herbal Tea This includes tea from herbs like tulsi, licoricei [X]A herb whose root bears a sweet aromatic flavor and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. , ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom. Studies show that ginger has anti-inflammatory properties. Ginger can help modulate the immune response that is associated with asthma and other related allergic conditions ( [30](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25420680)). However, ginger may interact with certain drugs, including Coumadin and aspirin. Hence, exercise caution. Cinnamon contains polyphenolsi [X]Naturally occurring compounds are found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages with antioxidant properties. that possess antiasthmatic and antiallergic potential ( [31](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29354299)). Licorice contains and antiviral properties ( [32](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.291.5172&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6273625/)). Ayurveda sure does have wonderful solutions for dust allergies. But make sure you check with an Ayurveda consultant for diagnosis and medical prescriptions. Medicines For Dust Allergy Your doctor might prescribe antihistamines to relieve sneezing and runny nose and nasal corticosteroids to combat inflammation. Decongestants are given to shrink stuffy nasal passages. However, though antihistamines can help lessen allergy symptoms, they can worsen the next attack. Corticosteroids can make your mucous membranes thinner and make things worse in the long run. Therefore, take these medicines only under medical surveillance. In addition to these remedies, you can also follow the tips mentioned below to reduce your exposure to indoor dust. Preventive Tips - Get rid of wall to wall carpeting, especially in your bedroom. - Try and keep your pets outside the bedroom and, if possible, outside your house. - Keep your indoors humidity-free. - Use mite-proof linens on your beds and pillows. - Use a high-efficiency filter in your air conditioning unit. - If your house is invaded by cockroaches, schedule regular visits by the pest control services. - Keep your house clean and dust-free by vacuuming.
