Featured Ingredients BLACK WALNUT HULLS A powerful herb that promotes normal yeast balance.* OLIVE LEAF EXTRACT A balancing, anti-oxidant, and immune-boosting the immune system.* Product FAQs Does Candida Balance get through the chitin that candida can grow? Candida Balance works more as an anti-fungal and immune balancing formula, while providing digestive support to ease symptoms. It helps fight the candida syndrome as a whole rather than addressing the cell wall by itself. Do I take Candida Balance on an empty stomach? This product is best taken with a small meal. There are digestive herbs that can help feelings of bloating or gas during the candida cleanse, but we never know the level of sensitivity for individuals. This blend is designed with herbs to help you feel better while you are taking the product. Is Candida Balance Vegan? The MCT Oil in Candida Balance formula is not vegan. What's the story on licorice and blood pressure? Licorice is a widely studied natural antiviral, female hormone balancer, and adaptogenic herb that can help address stress and adrenal fatigue. It's also commonly used as a complementary herb used in modest amounts in both Western and Eastern herbal blends. in very high doses, the licorice \"glycyrrhizin\" can cause elevated blood pressure. Since 1978 Crystal Star has focused on the functional benefits of whole herbs formulated with secondary and tertiary supporting ingredients. The amount of Licorice in Candida Balance is just a small part of the 23 whole herb formula. However, we don't recommend any form of licorice for people with a history of renal failure as well as people who are on heart medication or steroid drugs. Please discontinue if you become pregnant. Can phytoestrogens increase risk for diseases like breast cancer? While it's true that some herbs like Dong Quai, Red Clover, and Licorice contain natural phytoestrogens (estrogen-like compounds), there is no credible evidence that moderate intake of these herbs in their whole form will increase your risk for estrogen driven disease, like breast cancer. Dr. Linda Page combined numerous whole herbs in moderate amounts in the formulas. This type of traditional herbal approach reduces the potential for side effects or reactions, and is a primary reason many herbalists choose to blend herbs rather than use high doses of any one herb. The blended herbs in a moderate concentration act more like a food than a drug in the system. They go through normal digestion and elimination like a food, not building up in the system or burdening the body with potential toxicity. Still, if you have an estrogen-based health problem, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before using herbs that can affect hormone balance. Other products on the market use concentrated sources of phytoestrogens, or may be otherwise inappropriate for your unique health needs. "}
