Shingles can be very painful and is more common among older people. The older you are, the worse it can be. For some, the pain caused by shingles can last for many years. People who have a severely weakened immune system are also at higher risk of getting shingles and experiencing further complications from it. Every year in Scotland, around 400 people aged 70 and over will be hospitalised due to shingles and related complications. The shingles vaccine helps to build up your immunity to the virus.

Getting the recommended 2 doses of the vaccine will: - reduce your risk of developing shingles by over 70% - reduce your risk of experiencing long-term pain from shingles - reduce your risk of being hospitalised with complications from shingles What is shingles? Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella zoster. This is the same virus that causes chickenpox. When you recover from chickenpox most of this virus is destroyed, but some of the virus survives and lies inactive in your body's nervous system. The virus can then become active again later in life. This normally happens when your immune system has been weakened by: - age - stress - illness - certain treatments that can reduce your immunity The shingles vaccine helps to protect you by boosting your immunity.
