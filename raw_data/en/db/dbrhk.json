While the threat of COVID-19 is still very much at the fore of our daily lives, restrictions for both essential and leisure travellers have been imposed to combat and lessen the impact of the disease. Because of this, many people had a hard time managing additional requirements such as health declaration forms, permits, and swab test results.

On its [website](https://www.iata.org/en/youandiata/travelers/iata-travel-pass-for-travelers/), the IATA pass promises to do the following so international travellers could be relieved from stressful and hectic situations: - Global registry of health requirements - to find accurate information on travel, testing and vaccine requirements for journeys - Global registry of testing/vaccination centres - to identify testing centres and labs at departure location which meet the standards for testing and vaccination requirements of the destination - Lab app - to locate authorized labs and test centres to securely share test and vaccination certificates - Digital passport module - to enable passengers to create a 'digital passport', receive test and vaccination certificates and verify that they are sufficient for their itinerary, and share testing or vaccination certificates with airlines and authorities to facilitate travel. This app can also be used by travellers to manage travel documentation digitally and seamlessly throughout their journey, improving the travel experience.
