When I came across this podcast, I figured a review of the basics could be a good use of some downtime. I'm incredibly impressed and wish I had a resource like this when I was in school! I feel I'm even learning some new things I missed the first time around. I'm very grateful for all of the effort put into such a practical and helpful resource! Thank you for this podcast! Thank you for this wonderful podcast. It is clear & distilled, & so easy to take you on hikes with me so I can get the movement I sorely need while in crazy study mode for acupuncture school. This is a gift!! So helpful and thoughtful! Having spent a good portion of my Acupuncture education online (COVID), I'm finding lots of gaps in my knowledge. Dr.Lai's focused and easily listened to (on the go) podcasts help clear things up and out. Thank you.
