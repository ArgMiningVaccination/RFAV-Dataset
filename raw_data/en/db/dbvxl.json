Supervision Network - Students Students choose a supervisor from the Network - students work over Skype/Zoom so the geographical area is not important. However, every supervisor works differently so we recommend students contact at least 2-3 supervisors and Skype/Zoom with them before choosing one that suits. Please see the Supervision Guidelines for full details. UK, North American and Australian students are required to work with a supervisor from their home country. Students from other countries can approach any supervisors on the Network. Supervision Willing List - Graduates and Homeopaths We maintain a list of trained supervisors who can work with graduates and homeopaths.

Summary of methods Graduated from Purton House School of Homeopathy - 1996 Graduated as a Homeopathic Master Clinician (Lou Klein's post-grad programme) -2003 Registered with: The Society of Homeopaths (UK) North American Society of Homeopaths B.C. Association of Homeopaths. College of Homeopaths of Ontario 2014 - 2021 Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: In homeopathic practice full-time since 1995. I have also supervised since that time. I teach at the Ontario College of Homeopathic Medicine. Summary of methods used: I use Colours and Homeopathy (Ulrich Welte; Markus Kuntosch); the work of Louis Klein; Jan Scholten's Periodic Table and Plant System; Michal Yakir's plant system. I am cautiously adding in elements of Sensation Method, as taught by Jonathan Hardy and Annette Sneevliet. I keep on top of new provings and new remedies and use the entire Materia Medica when prescribing. I repertorize almost every case, using Complete Dynamics. Fees: (hourly rate) $100 Canadian Availability: Monday - Friday, by appointment. I offer any prospective supervisees a free 30 minutes to see if they are interested in working with me and Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Since graduation, I've been a regular lecturer at the School of Homeopathy since 1999 and a supervisor since 2005. I work from home, which is near Bath, in a practice is shared with my wife, a former GP who now practices Lifestyle Medicine. Appointments are face-to-face and online. Summary of methods used: Repertory, Periodic Table, Sensation Method, Joshis MAP, Scholten Plant theory, Yakir with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I have been in practice since 1988 and I have been a supervisor for 20 years. I enjoy supervising students and I like to think that my style of supervision is as varied as the students. I aspire to facilitating the student to find their own way of working, so as to fit with their particular skills, interests and lifestyle. Our priority when working together is, of course, always the patient's welfare. Second to that, I aim to facilitate the student finding their own way into casetaking and case analysis. My homeopathic practice is grounded in many years of classical philosophy, repertory and materia medica. I also use the tools that are most appropriate to the case, including sensation, Scholten's elements and Yakir's plant systems. I started supervising for the School after attending a few of Sheila Ryan's supervision courses and the went on to do a year long diploma in Supervision with CSTD in Bath. I was supervisor assessor for the School for seven years, so I am familiar with working with top sheets, reviews and the core criteria. I work online nowadays by Zoom, FaceTime or Skype. I like to have face to face online meetings to discuss each new case and any complicated follow ups and to spend some time at least once a month to have a general discussion about your progress and experiences as an exercise in self-care. Summary of methods used: See above Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a335 Availability: Mornings except (DSH). Registered with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Like many others, I came to study homeopathy after finding it helpful with my own health issues and those of my children and I graduated from the School of Homeopathy in 2012. I am practicing as a homeopath in Plymouth and my home village of Calstock, Cornwall. I am a member of the School of Homeopathy Core Team, I'm a tutor for the attendance and home study courses, teach on the attendance course and I'm a clinical supervisor for students setting out in practice in Years 3 & 4. In my own practice I use different 'tools', maps and methods to prescribe for my clients including repertory, thematic approach, SRP, kingdom, and sensation drawing on the firm foundation of my study at the School. I love the fact that my learning continues year in, year out! Not long after leaving the School I particularly benefitted from being part of a study group for 3 years focusing on the Joshis' approach to 'Sensation Method'. My approach is 'synergistic' and I feel my prescriptions are strongest when a number of different tools and maps point me to the same remedy. Above all I like to keep it simple and aim to find what's at the core of the patient and match that to the core of the remedy! My experience in education has spanned over 30 years and includes many different roles. My teaching career began in a wonderful, radical, successful and fairly unique mainstream secondary school that fostered the ethos of education that it should be individualised and personalised and that it should foster independence and creativity (recognise any similarities with homeopathy?!). I next worked in 'special needs education' and then as a mentor in an online education system for young people who were unable to access mainstream education. I've been working as a tutor for the School of Homeopathy since 2016 on both the Home Study and Attendance Courses and have recently also started teaching on the Attendance Course. I started supervising in 2019. I love all of my involvement in homeopathic education! I was fortunate, in my own training at the School of Homeopathy, to experience a system of learning that nurtured me and encouraged my creativity and learning. I endeavour to pass this on to the students I mentor, supervise and teach but continually find that I'm learning at least as much I'm giving! How I see myself as a supervisor: Moving into clinical practice is a challenge. After 2-3 years of study you are ready for it and have learnt everything you need to know to receive and take a case but it can still be a little bit scary (at least it was for me!). As a supervisor I'd like to walk your path with you: I'll give you support when you need it but will blend into the background and enjoy watching you when you're walking forward by yourself! My aim will always be to support you to develop your own style of case-taking and receiving and to grow confident with the tools of synthesis and analysis that suit you best. I see supervision as a collaborative process and will encourage you to explore your work reflectively. I like to think that I encourage my supervisees and enable them to build their confidence as independent homeopaths: I think that my previous supervisees would agree that I do. Finally, I'm happy to supervise either face to face in Devon and Cornwall or by Zoom further afield. Summary of methods used: A synergistic mix as appropriate to the client! I'm firmly rooted in 'classical' prescribing but use tools such as Sensation Method, Scholten's periodic table, Joshi's Mapping, Yakir's plant schema etc where appropriate. Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a340 Availability: Mondays and Thursdays are currently the main days I put aside for supervision but I do have some flexibility on other days. Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I have been practicing since 1993, and supervising students since 2003. It was through reading Vithoulkas's 'Medicine of the New man' and the Kents' Lectures on Homeopathic Philosophy that clinched it for me. I had signed up to the School Of Homeopathy's correspondence course without really knowing anything about homeopathy, (as my decision to study this form of healing was more of an intuitive leap rather than a cerebral decision!) But as soon as I read these two books, the penny dropped, the light went on, and I became completely obsessed. Studying at the School of Homeopathy was a life-transforming process for me and my work there continues to this day as a mentor, supervisor and teacher, which I totally love. I am available to supervise students both locally in Devon and also remotely via Zoom. My other passions include ceremony, and spending time in nature - often in a canoe! Summary of methods used: I am rooted in classical homeopathy and familiar with all methods, taking a diverse approach depending on the case in hand. Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a345 Availability: I am available most days except weekends, although less available during summer months. Physics BSc Diploma - School of Homeopathy DSH Diploma (Cascade Associates) in one-to-one and group supervision) Fellow of the Society of Homeopaths FSHom Registered with: Society of Homeopaths 1992 - 2014 Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Between the years 1992 - 2014 I began working individually from home in North London. In the millennium I also joined a group practice in Marlow, Bucks where I had the opportunity of working in a different geographical area as well as collaborating with colleagues. In 2011 I moved to Devon while still maintaining my London practice until 2014 when I decided to semi-retire. Since than I have kept up with developments through teaching, working collaboratively with the Joshis, editing their books and attending their workshops and seminars as well as supervision of practitioners and students. My formal supervision training began in 1990 with Sheila Ryan in a series of regular group supervision workshops over a number of years. I subsequently worked with Sheila to create opportunities for supervision workshops for the School of Homeopathy and the Society of Homeopaths. I have been in regular supervision ever since those early workshops when I established a formal supervisory relationship with a peer. My aim is to work alongside supervisees with fun, support as well as challenge. Summary of methods used: I use many supervisory as well as homeopathic techniques and take on many different roles (teacher, trainer, mentor, partner/collaborator, fly-on-the-wall to name but a few) according to appropriately changing individual needs and student interests with time. This is particularly relevant to the supervision of students where specific needs can change and evolve rapidly during clinical experience over the final two years. During this time students get to dynamically appreciate the meaning of homeopathic philosophy within a context; learn the art and craft of the therapeutic relationship and appreciate the truly dynamic pictures linking the patient with the remedy. The term 'supervisor' has unfortunate connotations arising from the context of the workplace where it is culturally perceived to be an authoritarian role. Yet the Latin origins of the word point to a more straight forward meaning - that of having the 'overview'. A major purpose in homeopathic supervision is to address the problem of achieving 'the unprejudiced observer' - developing the ability to step out of the therapeutic relationship and observe its interactions from a third position. This noble aim can be maximised using a number of different techniques, maps and models all of which require, in addition, the skill of reflection. Ultimately, the student needs to develop their own approach in the consulting room, provided it falls within the frameworks I have outlined. I believe my role as supervisor is to respond flexibly according to each individual's situation, needs and interests - student-centred in line with homeopathy, which is patient-centred. Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a330 Availability: My semi-retired status allows me great flexibility although this is seasonal in relation to the garden and growing. the School of Homeopathy 2005 Registered with: The Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: My clinic is in Topsham, near Exeter in Devon and I have been in continuous practice since qualifying in 2005. I love the learning that comes with being a homeopath - from my own and others' cases, studying at seminars and courses, reading and belonging to peer groups. Supervision is important to me and part of my practice - both giving and receiving supervision. In addition to being a clinical supervisor, I am a tutor for attendance students at the School of Homeopathy and greatly enjoy being connected to the School and its ethos of nurturing individual learning. I so value my own training there and all the School has given me. As a supervisor I aim to provide a place of safety where students can grow and develop as a homeopath. I \"walk alongside\" with support, reflection and, at the right moments, encouragement to take a step further. You will learn at your own pace and develop your own style whilst acquiring skills of analysis and synthesis. It's a process where I learn just as much as the student! Summary of methods used: I use a variety of methods and like to think that I approach a case from many angles and am homeopathic to the patient in how I respond to them: I particularly like Sankaran's methods and use the Superclass and Subclass (which is amazingly helpful) and the 8-box method and WISE processes. I love the work of the Joshis and of Jeremy Sherr who \"stands behind me\" while I examine what needs to be cured in the patient and refer to provings. All while feeling grounded in the Organon, Kent and other \"old masters\". Homeopathy, School of Homeopathy 2002 Post graduate diploma Dynamis School of Homeopathy 2006 Registered with: The Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Twenty years in full-time practice. Fifteen year's experience in Supervision. My interest and involvement with homeopathy began at the age 24 when I first visited a homeopath and subsequently started to use homeopathy for the animals on my family's farm in Devon. Ten years later I left my career in art and craft to train as a homeopath with the School of Homeopathy and I began practicing full-time in 2002. My approach embraces the traditional and classical methods of Hahnemann, Kent etc., which I combine with the latest thinking in the Sensation Method, Michel Yakir's work on the plant remedies and Mahesh Gandhi's Personal Evolution Model. I love working with students through supervision and am particularly interested in helping each student to develop their own flourishing and fulfilling practice. Summary of methods used: All traditional classical methods Sensation Method Mahesh Gandhi's Personal Evolution Model Fees: (hourly rate) Registered with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I've been practicing since 1999, treating wide range of patients. I trained in supervision with Jane Wood in 2007; supervising peers and students since and receiving supervision. It can be both daunting and exciting to start seeing patients as you get to the end of your training. If you are looking for support, encouragement, someone to watch your back and help you explore issues that arise from your practice in a constructive and positive way - that would be me. I've been in continuous practice since 1999 and completed the Dynamis two year advanced course with Jeremy Sherr. Over the years Sankaran, Scholten, Yakir and many others have influenced the way I practise. I trained in supervision with Jane Wood in London over 10 years ago. I am also a registered hypnotherapist and hypno-birthing antenatal teacher which complements my special interest in pregnancy and all things birth related but I enjoy treating a wide range of patients. Helping students into practice feels like giving something back to homeopathy which has given me so much. Summary of methods used: Classical, Sensation mainly but also an interest in use of combination remedies and Ton Jansen approach among others. Open minded. Use Radar Opus.

I am happy to work via Zoom or, locally, face to face. I was a core team teacher at the British School of Homoeopathy for twenty-three years and taught regularly in Ireland and Wales; my main subjects being philosophy and consulting skills. I am the author of Medicine Flows - Homoeopathic Philosophy, Homeopathy - A Rational Choice in Medicine and, most recently, Homeopathy - Hippocratic Medicine. Regarding supervision, I want you to be the best homeopath you can be and I will encourage you to find your own way, whilst walking alongside you. A microbiologist in a previous life and a poet by nature, I enjoy walking on Dartmoor and swimming in her rivers, playing with my grandchildren and enjoying food and wine with my family. Summary of methods used: Mainly inspired by Hahnemann, Kent, David Little, Lao Tsu and Jung, I had the same mentor as Ian Watson (Ken Metson). Fees: (hourly rate) of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: A full time homoeopath since 1995, I currently share The Homoeopathic Practice with my husband, Mo Morrish. In 1997 I undertook the Shelia Ryan supervision training and advanced course. My particular interest is in working with cancer and I worked on the inpatient and outpatient wards in palliative care at St Luke's Hospice Plymouth for 6 years. Previously I was Clinical Director and Head of Materia Medica for the South West College of Homoeopathic Medicine (formerly The British School of Homoeopathy), lecturing widely throughout the country. Having worked in Jungian analysis for over 20 years, I like to bring elements of this to my work in homoeopathy when appropriate. I have many years of experience working as a supervisor and I enjoy working with supervisees, taking a broad approach and encouraging students to develop their own style with confidence. I am happy to work remotely or face to face at my home practice based in Dartmoor, Devon. Summary of methods used: Broad approach but not sensation, although I am willing to work with students who use this method.

Professional Coach (C&G Level 3) Registered with: The Federation of Holistic Therapists Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I qualified from The School of Homeopathy in 2016 with the Practitioner Diploma and since then have practiced on a part time basis with an approximate caseload of between 8 to 10 patients at one time. A variety of complaints are being treated in my clinics, as expected in Homeopathy, but I find myself treating a large number of skin conditions, which I love treating and have a special interest in. I also work as a Head of Safeguarding for both children and vulnerable adults. As well as clinically advising, my role includes a large amount of supervisions, learning sets and reflecting workshops on a one to one and group basis. I enjoy the Gibbs cycle of reflection as a simple model to frame supervision learning and reflection. My coaching practice is within the GROW model of coaching relationships and this is also integrated into my approach to supervising registered professionals and students alike, as it facilitates a focussed model for learning within a reflective supervision framework, enabling the best for 'patients/ clients' and practitioners alike.

Availability: Weekday evenings and weekends as Registered with: Insured Homeopath Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Practitioner since 2012, Supervisor and tutor since 2016. \"To lead the people walk behind them\" Lao-Tzu This quote explains in a lovely way what Homeopathy and Supervision means for me. I am deeply interested in the underlying cause of any kind of disease, physical or mental/emotional. I learned through the years of practicing and being with patients and students under supervision or mentorship that unconditional interest and love is the most healing way to approach anything that is difficult or bothering us. Homeopathy shows us how mysterious life is and what disease tries to tell us and how to recognise the inner pattern that is written in our subconscious field and drives our lives. I like to be grounded in the classical principles of homeopathy and then venture out into the new and fascinating discoveries that explain the depth of homeopathy in all its complexities. Everything in homeopathy follows the law of similar, the law of individualisation and the law of holism. In this way I also approach the supervision process where I can mirror your unique gifts of how you think, approach, and see your patients and your cases to bring awareness of yourself and what is in front of you. I will adapt to your needs in this individual way. If you mainly need encouragement to find your own way, this will be the focus and if you like to be guided and mentored at times, this is what I can offer. The goal for me is to assist conviction and confidence in your own way and progress. With that I also will ensure to open doors for you to explore new thoughts and ideas. I am always happy to share my knowledge and experience. One big thing I have learned is that the quality of how we look at something transforms what we are looking at. This means that an unprejudiced and benevolent witness (the supervisor or the homeopath) can be a major factor in achieving growth and success. This is true for being a student or for being a patient in homeopathy. The power of being the witness and sharing witness consciousness is profoundly healing. As a homeopathic consultation, supervision is a space of love and will make amazing things happen. Summary of methods used: Covering all methods and based on the solid grounds of classical homeopathy and especially interested and working with Sensation and Systems of homeopathy. Fees: \u00a325/h for Supervision Availability: Most days according Dip Homeopathy from The School of Homeopathy (2007) Sea Change Supervision Course (2010) BA Person Centred Counselling and Psychotherapy (2021) Registered with: Society of Homeopaths, BACP Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Amanda runs a small practice based in The New Forest. At present she works online and F2F outdoors. In all the work she does her interest and motivation is with helping people to achieve their unique potential. After an extremely contrasting supervision experience with The School's 'proving' and her own supervised clinical practice she felt drawn to becoming a supervisor. She achieved this as soon as possible after graduating and has been enjoying working with supervisees since 2010. Amanda works with students from The School, F2F, and online and was invited to work as a supervisor with the Ghana Homeopathy project. She also works with qualified Homeopaths and Group Facilitation. Amanda conducts supervision each month for both her homeopathy practice and psychotherapy work. Summary of methods used: Amanda likes to make sure that students have a working knowledge of our classical roots - other than this, she doesn't have a fixed approach to case work. She prefers to walk alongside the supervisee while they explore, remembering to keep the patient at the center of all we do. Amanda has a broad general knowledge of a variety of methods. Fees:(hourly rate) \u00a345 Availability: Varies, depending upon current workload but can usually accommodate most days. Telephone: Overview of homeopathic experience etc. Supervision and reflective practice have always formed an invaluable part of my own homeopathic practice. This inspired me to train as a supervisor first with Sheila Ryan then at Revision and in 2011 at the Tavistock. I have been in practice since 1989 and have supervised students and CAM practitioners for many years. From 1996-2014 I taught supervision and reflective practice on a BSc and also an MSc programme at the University of Westminster, where I also ran supervision groups. I have taught supervision skills in different settings from hospital doctors and consultants in the NHS through to a varied range of complementary therapists from homeopaths to acupuncturists, herbalists and nutritional therapists. In 2004 I set up a supervision training scheme for the British Association of Nutritional Therapists (BANT) and trained Nutritional Therapists to run supervision groups. I still supervise a number of them. I also supervised students on a supervision module for the Northern College of Acupuncture. Together with Jane Wood I wrote the book Inspiring Creative Supervision. I am currently on the editorial board of the New Homeopath and write regular articles for it on different aspects of supervision. I believe that effective supervision needs to be collaborative, creative and fun. Do contact me if you would like more information about how I work. Summary of methods used: Kentian, some Sensation, layers, generally use what is appropriate to the patient's complaint and vitality, tissues salts, etc Fees: (hourly rate) Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I have been practicing Homeopathy in South London since graduating in 1996 from the London School of Classical Homeopathy, and completing Jeremy Sherr's Dynamis course.. Since 1999, I have taken a special interest in the work of the Mumbai group of homeopaths, led by Rajan Sankaran, now known as the Sensation method. I've attended a number of his intensive clinic seminars held in Mumbai, as well as regular UK seminars with other members of the group. In a further development of this method, since 2012 I have taken a special interest in the work of Drs Shachindra and Bhawisha Joshi who have pioneered their system of 'Mapping'. With two colleagues, we run courses on how to apply this method into daily practice. The course is titled Advanced Clinical Training in Homeopathy, Bridging the Map and the Patient. In addition, I coordinate a monthly study group to support homeopaths in their personal development of this method. In 2009 I completed an MSc in Homeopathy, as a distance learner with UCLan (University of Central Lancashire). My journey in this course took me deeply into the territory of critical investigation of our beloved Homeopathy, into its philosophy, science, therapeutic relationship, supervision and education. What I am most fascinated by is the nature of receiving the case, and what happens between the practitioner and the patient. My thesis focused on the homeopath's experience of the homeopathic consultation. I thoroughly enjoyed my teaching at Purton House (now closed) where I was module leader for Practitioner Development, and the College of Naturopathic Medicine. I love to work with students, share ideas, empower and encourage intellect and intuition. As a supervisor, I see the supervisory relationship as an extension of all the values of person-centred teaching and practicing, where the working alliance is at the core. I have supervised/mentored many students from the School of Homeopathy since 2008, and cherish the deep level of engagement we achieve. It is extremely rewarding to be part of the students' development at this most critical time of Clinical Practice, and to watch their growth and maturation into competent practitioners. Summary of methods used: Sensation Mapping (Drs Joshi), in addition to classical repertorisation as appropriate. Some experience with M Yakir plant theory. Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a340 Availability: Weekdays Monday-Thursdays, 9:30am - 6pm. Some late appointments The School of Homeopathy (DPH) Post grad diploma from British Institute of Homeopathy Registered with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I trained at the School of Homeopathy, qualifying in 1990, and attended the Sea Change supervision course in 2010. During the 1990s I lived for two years in Sarajevo and taught and supervised extensively during this time. I now have a busy practice online and in the Oxford area. My aim as a supervisor is to support you in finding your feet as a practitioner, keeping it simple and relevant, and always encouraging your own process to unfold. Please do contact me if you'd like to know more. Summary of methods used: Rooted in classical methods, having trained at the School of Homeopathy. Aware of other systems and methods, though not following any specific one. Familiar with detoxification methods. Fees: (hourly rate) Registered with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I studied homeopathy at the Northern College and have been in private homeopathy practice since graduating in 1985. Having completed the Society of Homeopaths supervision, assessor and mentoring trainings, I wanted to go deeper into supervision and went on to do a Diploma in Supervision at Iron Mill Institute. The Diploma is recognised by the European Association of Supervisors. I've run supervision workshops in the UK and internationally, and written on supervision for Therapy Today and Similia, the Australian Homeopathic Association journal. Summary of methods used: I work with patient's individual needs, consultation by consultation. I'm familiar with different methodologies and prefer a patient centred approach. Similarly, working very much on an individual basis, I see supervision as the space to open a window to enable exploration of the dimensions raised in day to day practice. I will work alongside you to see what's through that window, so you are more able to meet your patients. I offer supervision face to face or via Zoom, particularly useful for distance learning students. I've found Zoom offers a sense of connection and support that bridges the geography well. Fees: \u00a340 an hour University; DipHE, Italian, Cardiff. Registered with: Member of ARH Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I have been practising for over 30 years and currently work from home in west Somerset. I have supervised students for 25 years. In response to the perceived generally negative and fearful attitude of students to studying Medical Sciences, I wrote two courses - 'Anatomy and Physiology for Homeopaths' and 'Pathology and Disease for Homeopaths' in order to teach the medical information I have found most useful in homeopathic practise. I firmly believe that it is vital to be able to communicate with the medical profession without losing sight of our holistic model of health care. I really want homeopathy students to appreciate the wonders of the human body at the same time as integrating their other knowledge of materia medica and homeopathic philosophy in a meaningful and useful way to suit a homeopath's unique perspective of health. I feel I had a huge advantage when starting out on my homeopathy journey because I had studied Zoology, Botany and Microbiology at university in Scotland, and Fine Art, English & American literature in Virginia, so the essential strands of the Art and Science of Homeopathy were beginning to be woven into place when I arrived at the British School of Homeopathy. However, my greatest teachers have been my three children, my supervisor and faithful patients who have shown me the power of this beautiful, elegant form of medicine. I also learned a lot from working with the children of Chernobyl and witnessing their return to health and vivacity after homeopathic treatment. As well as supervision training I have recently completed CEASE training in order to work more deeply with people on the autistic spectrum. Supervising clinical work is probably my favourite interaction with students because it is a privilege to guide them to being confident practitioners who can continue to take homeopathy far and wide. My modus operandi is straight forward: my case taking provides the pieces of a puzzle which when assembled represents the whole person, including their medical condition, from birth to present. I find a time line invaluable. For me, finding the centre of a case is essential for understanding the whole. My favourite mentors would be George Vithoulkas and Jeremy Sherr. I often use the Vision computer programme, but mainly work with my vast collection of books! Summary of methods used: Kent, Murphy, Vithoulkas, supervision(hourly cases \u00a335.00 paper cases Patients (hourly rate): \u00a375.00 first appointment including treatment \u00a350.00 follow ups Anthropology Fellow of the Society of Homeopaths Registered with: Society of Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I have been in full time practice since I qualified from the School of Homeopathy in 1987. I see approximately 30 patients a week and love my work with them. I have practised in Swansea since I qualified and my practise continues to thrive. I have also practised in England, Ireland, USA, Ghana and Kenya. I have come to realise that Homeopathy is energy medicine and I allow the patient's dynamic process to dictate the interaction between us. I am particularly fascinated by the unexpected system that this interaction demands. I am open to the use of all potencies, single doses, nosodes, organopathy, acute remedies (when appropriate) and, indeed, whatever the disease process demands. I tend not to speculate about the meaning of the patient's disease process and prefer to use the repertory and materia medica to find a remedy that closely corresponds to the expression of the disease during the consultation. I have been supervising students since 1995. Summary of methods used: I was initially trained in classical Homeopathy and for the first few years in practice I studied extensively with Dr Vassilis Ghegas of the Athens School of Homeopathy. In 1989 I went to the US and ran a busy practice in Santa Barbara and L.A. After these early years of intense study and learning I began to formulate my own style of case taking, analysis and prescribing. This was increasingly influenced by Hahnemann and the Process work of Arnold and Amy Mindell, as I love the simplicity of their work. Homeopathy is essentially simple, although not always easy, and I have realised that disease is essentially a communication system and we simply have to respond to the signals in an open and flexible way. While respecting the methods of other Homeopaths; I am convinced that each of us must find our own natural style within the framework of clear Homeopathic principles. With the above in mind, my work as a supervisor is dedicated to assisting students to discover and develop their own natural gifts and their own style. If someone chooses to use a system such as sensation, kingdoms, mappa mundi etc., I am supportive and although I do not use these systems myself I encourage students to be clear in the case taking, analysis, prescribing and case submission. Case submission is important and we work together to formulate clear and cohesive cases write ups. What matters to me is student's individual development. Fees: (hourly rate) \u00a3120 pounds for initial cases. \u00a365 for follow ups if I am present or on line. This includes supervision and interaction between consultations. Paper cases: \u00a365 pounds for initial consultation \u00a345 for follow ups. All fees include my submissions and feedback to the school. Availability: I am available for case supervision Monday to Wednesday and for contact as arranged between ourselves. Telephone: N/A Email: Homeopathic Certification Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Through a career of over 30 years, Jo has studied with many teachers and is familiar with both traditional classical methodologies and contemporary approaches to homeopathic practice. Alongside her ongoing practice, Jo has taught and supervised in schools and study groups, including overseeing the supervision faculty during her time as Dean of The School of Homeopathy, New York. Summary of methods used: Jo's practice integrates contemporary methodologies into a classical homeopathic understanding. Her studies with Rajan Sankaran over many years have enabled her to become proficient in the Synergy/Sensation approach. In her own practice, Jo now concentrates on chronic pathologies, seeking for remedies that can unravel the complex issues presented by modern life. Fees: (hourly rate) $75 Availability: Weekdays, office hours Registered Homeopaths Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: I feel so very blessed that I've had the opportunity to delve into the mysteries of the natural world, that homeopathy found me, or rather I found homeopathy and that I've been able to help so many clients and students over the past 20 years. Having graduated from the SOH attendance program in June of 2002 and later from the Dynamis School I really enjoy mentoring students, the next generation of healers, passing on my passion, dedication, insights and experiences. These days my focus is on an online practice; I see clients and students via Zoom, Face Time and Skype. In the past I have worked in a number of settings. The Homeopathic Medical Clinic in Minnesota, at a holistic healing clinic in St Paul Minnesota, from several home based offices and even out on the road traveling to see autistic children in their home environment. However, My roots are in education, that's where I started in life. I have an honors degree in education and a UK teaching certificate so my practice is very much focused upon education both for my clients and my students. I believe that there are many paths to wellness but my deep love and passion for Bach flower therapy has taught me that mental and emotional wellbeing is key for a return to health. Although I have studied with a number of prominent teachers toting different methods of practice and becoming familiar and flexible with many forms of case taking and analyses my mindset is that we are forever students of the healing arts and holding a compassionate space for our clients is key. A safe place where our clients truly feel listened to. I do concentrate upon this with my students; I help them have the confidence and courage to stay in those uncomfortable places and then we witness together the magic that can happen in such a heart held space as case taking ensues. Good homeopathy depends upon assuming the role of a detective and leaving no stone unturned. I want my students to be the best that they can be and that doesn't involve taking short cuts. If I feel that more needs to be brought to the surface before a good remedy can be found then I will encourage my students to return to their clients, ask more questions, schedule another session etc. I can be a hard taskmaster but they have always thanked me for it! I like to help students sort out all the pieces of a case, find common themes and select appropriate rubrics that really sum up the totality. Of course I always emphasize and focus upon what really needs to be cured. Living and working in America since 1994 has taught me much about offering healing assistance in a country where people are used to calling a lawyer. I help students navigate difficult territory; we talk about the practicality and pitfalls of working without a medical license. I want my students to be safe in practice and wary of what they can and cannot do. With 20 years of experience I have plenty to pass on. For many years I have been a Board Member of National Health Freedom Action. I will be stepping down from that position this summer and hoping to free up more time so that I can join the boards of Minnesota and Florida Homeopathic Associations. As you can see homeopathy is always on my radar and helping in whatever way I can! Summary of methods used: I am flexible with case taking methods including Sankaran Sensation, Scholten, Mappa Mundi etc. As an educator I am very keen on sound Repertory work and choice of rubrics. Fees: I don't charge my students in supervision per hour BUT by case and i'm mindful that they have to work through 10 cases and two follow ups per case. I charge $100 for the initial case taking and that's for however long the case taking session lasts with their client and for all the follow up sessions with my student while they are working on a suitable remedy. I charge $50 for a follow up with their client again this covers observing their session when required and following up with the student as they analyze their case and what to do next. So students in supervision with me should budget $2,000 for their 18 months of supervision. Availability: I am flexible with working with students. I live in Florida and generally for two months every summer I'm based in the UK. I work via zoom or Face Time and I'm always available to consult with students outside of online scheduled sessions with them via email if something comes up. I notify my students if I am on family vacation but even then I'm available to answer emails of an urgent nature and that is always clearly conveyed to my students in advance.

Editor and writer for the Homeopathy Writers Group, this is the site we are connected with: [https://www.homeopathyconsumercouncil.com/](https://www.homeopathyconsumercouncil.com/) Chairman of the Board, Council for Homeopathic Certification (CHC). Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: My practice is home based, online, and home visits. I have one student, I sit in on all her cases and record them, client allowing. We go over each case either directly after the interview and/or after I have sat through the video and repped the case. I rep all her cases to be able to follow her repertorizing and offer suggestions on selecting remedies. She has had a good reaction on all her cases and some of the cases have had amazing results. I also overwhelm her with materials I have gathered in my practice to help her sit for the CHC exam. Summary of methods used: I consider Hahnemann, Hering, Kent, Margaret Tyler, John Clarke, George Vithoulkas, Farok Master, the many other Indian homeopaths, and many others not named, to be basically of the same mind and I learn from all of them. Margaret Tyler once said, \"if you would learn more than a little, learn from many.\" Fees: $60.00 U.S. Per Diploma, The School of Homeopathy, 2015 Clinical Supervision, The Canadian College of Homeopathic Medicine, 2020 Sea Change Supervision Course, Sheila Ryan, 2022 Registered with: Council of Homeopathic Certification (CHC) Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: Homeopathy is an extremely rewarding yet difficult profession. I believe sound supervision is needed to support and encourage each homeopath. In my own practice, I strive to adhere to Hahnemann's principles and Kent's standards for second prescription. Over the past few years, I have begun to closely follow Jeremy Sherr's approach to case analysis/use of the repertory. I utilize Mappa Mundi, TCM philosophy, the periodic table, Bonninghausen's approach, devotion to Materia Medica, interest in reading provings, but most of all, flexible thinking. For the past two years I have volunteered with Homeopathy Help Now, supporting viral cases since the pandemic. I have gained much confidence in this area, supporting viral acutes in all their stages, including convalescence and return to chronic. This group of volunteers has met weekly throughout this time, supervising each other's cases. The issues of potency, repetition and obstacles to cure being the prime areas of discussion in these acute cases. I am a Board Director with the Council of Homeopathic Certification. One of my aims is to see homeopaths in North America fairly compensated and recognized for their work in the medical community. Summary of methods used: Classical homeopathic approach. Mappa Mundi. TCM philosophy. Periodic use Materia Medica including Vithoulkas, Clarke, Phatak, Kent and Vermeulen. But, most of all, flexible thinking....each case needs something different. Fees: per hour $60 U.S. Availability: Mondays - for Homeopathic (CHC) Overview of homeopathy practice and supervision experience: David's interest in homeopathy began after more than 12 years of practice and teaching as a Physician Assistant and he has been in full-time homeopathic practice since 1999. He has taught homeopathy didactically and clinically for the past 15 years and has written a number of online articles for hpathy.com. He is also the author of \"Radiance, Resonance and Healing: The Homeopathic Periodic Table\". Its intent was to clarify recognition, matching and application of elements with homeopathic histories, with particular attention to the most common words and phrases used by clients. David works with adults and children of all ages and most physical, mental, and emotional conditions. Summary of methods used: David learned from a variety of teachers and approaches and he appreciates how they all hold value according to the shape and circumstances of different histories. He describes his style as honoring the spirit and intention behind classical prescribing, but remains open-minded to considering alternate potentials for homeopathic prescribing. Fees: For mentoring, the energy exchange is 80. per hour. David does not charge for reading history notes ahead of mentoring sessions, nor does he charge for brief e-mail exchanges. If there is a need to prescribe an intercurrent remedy between longer mentoring sessions, the cost for mentoring would accord with 15 minute increments of time required.

I'm a registered member with The Society of Homeopaths, a founder member of Thames Valley Homeopaths and the coordinator of the local Arnica group (Parent's Support Network) in Slough and Windsor. Since graduating from The College, I have travelled and worked in many different types of health clinics around the world e.g. The Maun Homeopathy Project in Botswana and since settling back in England I continue to volunteer whenever I can with local UK charities such as The Travelling Homeopaths Collective. Prior to being a homeopath I worked in mental health services development and advocacy. I also served as manager for a Women's Health Centre in which we employed a variety of therapists and health care practitioners to deliver complementary and alternative health treatments to a deprived inner city area for women on low income. Presently I live in Slough, Berkshire from where I see private clients from my home and also from neighbouring South Bucks and Uxbridge from The Lotus Wellbeing Clinic in Iver. Slough is a culturally diverse town with many different groups and ethnicities residing here both old and new.

I have been in uninterrupted practice for 12 years and I am registered with the Society of Homeopaths. My clinic is at home and works well with the other work I do as an antenatal teacher. I work as a homeopath about 2 full days a week. I have a general practice but I specialise in paediatrics and obstetrics. My current homeopathic influences - Repertory Murphy Materia Medica PRISMA one and two SYNOPTIC 10 years ago I gave up the academic work I was doing training antenatal teachers for the National Childbirth Trust/ University of Luton, working at degree level with students was too time consuming. I have been the carer for my mother-in-law until her death earlier this year. I now have more time and am very happy to expand my practice as a homeopath using the skills I developed as an antenatal teacher tutor for the NCT. I am still teaching but only a few courses a year. I taught the obstetric content on a homeopathic paediatric course for a couple of years and enjoyed that. When I gave up being a tutor for the NCT I carried on offering supervision to local students and teachers. My heart and training is with the support of students, that is my role in my local teaching support group. The supervision I offer to my fellow ante natal teachers is as follows. Biannual supervision for each member and any adhoc supervision that is needed due to crises. Supervision is an integral part of the course I was trained to deliver as an antenatal teacher tutor for the NCT University of Luton. During the 10 years I was a Tutor in the UK and Ireland in any one year I would have about 30 students each student had supervision from me twice a year and an observation of their teaching once from me and once from another tutor. Insured Homeopath with the Society of Homeopaths, qualifying in 1990. I trained at the old College of Homeopathy in Regents Park for 2 year and then went on to study in Stella Bergs 'Apprentiship college' in North London. My training was mostly Classical, and we also covered a range of adjunctive methods. Approximately 10 years ago, I did an advanced practitioner diploma in Naturopathic Nutrition which has proved to be very useful. Before starting Homoepathy I trained as a Registered nurse and was working p/t until two years ago in a small Centre for people living with HIV & AID's in a small community hospital unit in Brighton. Finally, I finished a diploma course in Psychological Astrology a year ago and am now into my first year of practice, reading peoples Natal charts. Apart from my private Homeopathic practice, my experience includes the following: - Working in a GP practice in NE London; which I set up with a fellow Homeopath - Providing Homeopathy for women with chronic & enduring mental health problems in a residential rehabilitation unit & weekly drop-in centre in Eastbourne, East Sussex - Working as part of an 'outreach' team of Practitioners in one of th old 'Sure Start Children and Family Centres' in Brighton, through the 'Dolphin Childrens Clinc', - Part of a multi disciplinary team of complementary health practitioners at Hoxton Health in Hoxton, London N1., until the end of 2018.

I currently have a small private practice in central Brighton, in Hanover close to Queens Park, I see clients face to face and online. Supervision has always been an important part of my Practice. I did a lot of training with Sheila Ryan in my first 10 years as a Homeopath, I was a part of the group she facilitated and then I'd assist her with her supervision training days. I was also part of a supervision group of Homeopaths facilitated by a psychotherapist for approximately 12 years in London, and part of a Supervision for Supervisors group also in London with Jane Wood, Mike Andrews and Graz Baran. Since moving to Brighton I have continued to have regular one to one 'peer' supervision.

It takes a lot to make it as a practitioner, including homeopathy skills, understanding of medical and psychological processes, business ability, people skills, general nous, life balance, and most of all a way of working that is yours, that you own. Nobody is perfect, so we have supervision with methods to help us tread that path towards our individual success. I completed the School of Homeopathy training in 1987. I first trained in supervision in 1995, and have worked with students and other homeopaths in supervision since then. From 1998-2005 I worked with the SoH on the Registration Development Programme including mentoring, supervising, assessing, as well as developing the programme and facilitating on the course days. My personal style of homeopathy is not important here, this is about you. I am open to the many ways in which people work and what their personal aims are. Helping a fellow homeopath keep all of that grounded, conscious and dynamic with my feedback and your reflection, are my aims within supervision. to work via skype if need be. Homeopathic Training: I attended the first \"full time\" course (3 full days) at the College of Homeopathy with Robert Davidson and Barbara Harwood. I received my Licentiate in 1988. Registration/insurance: I am registered and insured with The Society of Homeopaths. Years in Practice: Sinse 1988 (25+ years) My Mentors: Mainly the Joshis and Dr Sankaran. I attended the \"Sensation\" conference in Goa about 10 years ago and went to Mumbai to sit in with the Joshis 4 years ago. I regularly attend the Pinnacle seminars especially those of the Joshis and Dr Sankaran. Nature and Extent of Practice: My practice is not big since I moved to Cornwall (10 years ago). I have a part time job and practice homeopathy part time, seeing between 5 and 10 patients a week. I moved into practising the \"Sensation Method\" after going to the Goa conference. Over the past few years I have been more flexible and settled back into whatever method suits the case in front of me. My method is more synergistic now. Homeopathic Influences: Mainly the Mumbai group and their books but also very much Jan Scholten whose books I have and regularly use. Supervision experience: I never had much one on one supervision myself back in the old days. However I have attended tutorial groups over the 25 years and also for the past 10 years I worked very closely with my colleague Bill Watson and we have supervised each other to a certain extent. I have taught at a couple of colleges over the years (Gordon Sambidge's college in London and the New College) so have the experience of dealing with students. Training in role as Supervisor: I recently trained with Sheila Ryan - the 3 skype sessions with her - which I found very helpful . I have read her book and hope to have more training in this area in the future. Why do like Supervison: I really enjoyed supervising students and I learn a lot from doing this. I liked to give what I felt I lacked in my own homeopathic journey as a student (apart from the Joshis later on) which is nurturing and guidance. Also from my own point of view, sometimes it is difficult to realise how much one has learned over the last 25 years (if you are not currently teaching homeopathy) and this is mirrored back to one in the supervision process and also the areas where one is still shaky and unsure. So it is a very good mirror for my own practice. Telephone: 07962 318343 Email: completed Sheila Ryan's supervision course in 1996, I have supervised students and practitioners and continued to take part in my own supervision, reflective journal writing and supervision training workshops. I qualified as a homeopath in 1986 and since then I have practised part time in Cornwall. Registered with the Society, my Professional Development has continued for over 35 years. I worked for the Society of Homeopaths from 1999 -2016 as an Education Advisor and trained with them in registration assessment and mentoring. Therefore, as well as being an experienced practitioner, I am familiar with the requirements of many homeopathy courses and the leading professional body. I have a Certificate in Counselling from the University of Exeter, which I feel has helped enormously in homeopathy practice and in supervision. More recently, I have been focusing on personal development through Mindfulness and Compassion Based Living practice, and I am qualified through the Mindfulness Association to teach and facilitate these practices. trained at the first full time 3 year course graduating in 1988, and I have been in practice ever since. Since then I have taught in London, the Midlands, Iceland, Malta, Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne. I ran my own college from 1997 to 2006 in Eastbourne and I run supervision groups in Uckfield and Brighton. I love my job and really enjoy helping people reach their potential. I believe Homeopathy will bring people to a place they can see the choices they have in life. Healing/ counselling: I have a diploma in holistic counselling and am a healer trainer for the H.P.A.I. I enjoy facilitating meditation groups and I teach the healing module at the Holistic Training college.

I have been in practice since this time. My time is divided between my home practice in Crowborough, E. Sussex, and my work and practice at Helios Pharmacy in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. I have always been much inspired by Jan Scholten and by Sankaran, and other teachers who follow in the same vein. Over the years I have also been involved in many remedy provings.

It felt like a coat that had been waiting for me for years on a hook, and as soon as I tried it on it fitted like a glove. It's been my life ever since. I brought up four children on it and now help out with tips for my ten grandchildren. So I've been involved now for over 30 years. I now only run a practice from my home in Ketton, Rutland (4 miles from Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire). I am happy to do supervision by Skype once we have met once in the flesh. In 2002 I started my training in Supervision, part of this with Sheila Ryan, finding it a huge asset to my own professional work, and continue to go to as many training days as I can. I am a pragmatic homeopath, and work in rather the same way with students, and other homeopaths who come to me for a different angle with their cases or their work environment. One learns by doing, so not getting things right first time is part of the process, but help to see another way to get them right next time can be a great lesson learned. Listening to the variety of people's stories and helping them make sense of them is for me a great joy and privilege. I know how much one can benefit from supervision as a homeopath, and how helpful it can be to have another pair of eyes to help us see how we are looking at our work, at our cases, at our practice. Therefore helping you to find the best way for you to relate to your clients, and so get the information you need to process in order to get the desired outcome is integral to supervision. I just love helping homeopaths find what is important to them, and by doing so they become stronger, more efficient, and better graduated from the School of Homeopathy in 1990 (TG7) and have been in practice ever since. I have clinics in London and South Shropshire and worked in Madeira for a short while. I have been passionate about homeopathic supervision for many years now and supervised many students and practitioners over those years. In addition to supervising individual students I also run practitioner supervision groups. As homeopaths we so often talk about cases on an intellectual level, I have found that it can be very helpful to look at cases or practice issues in a more intuitive way. This can be done by using creative supervision techniques, working in this way can bring about deeper insights into the issue more quickly than conventional supervision techniques. I was a Clinical Supervisor at the University of Westminster on the BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Homeopathy degree course from 2001 to 2009. In the past I have taught at the London College of Classical Homeopathy and run college clinics there, and at Purton House Homeopathic Centre. I have been supervising homeopathy students since the early 90s from the above schools and also from The School of Homeopathy. As well as a classical approach to homeopathic case taking and analysis I have also supervised students working with the Sensation method and attended many workshops and seminars over the years with many great teachers. I have experience in both email and Skype supervision as well as face-to-face supervision. I have supervised students in Japan and worked with homeopaths on the Maun Project. I was one of the first homeopaths to complete the Principles of Dynamic Clinical Supervision for Homeopaths Modules 1 and 2 with Shelia and have also studied with Jane Wood and took part in a three year Supervision through Action Research project. Do give me a call or email me, if you do not already know me, I have some great testimonials from previous supervisees on my website.

My original background was in IT and for some years, I also worked in the NHS as a GP Practice Manager. I have studied a number of other therapies such as Reiki, EFT, NLP and, most recently, 3 Principles which has had a huge effect on how I practice. My supervision qualification was with Sheila Ryan's Seachange course in September 2013. I now work full-time as a Homeopath and Supervisor and am also involved in the South West Homeopathic Group putting on CPD events. As homeopaths, we never stop learning! I provide supervision on a face to face basis in Wellington, Somerset and Chudleigh, Devon or I work online with Homeopaths further afield. For me, supervision is a safe space to explore our feelings about all aspects of our practice and its place in our lives, in addition to the occasional technicalities of remedy selection etc. Supervision enables us to develop our practice, sometimes in surprising ways! Picking a supervisor to work with is like choosing a homeopath and I am happy to chat with you so that you can explore whether you are comfortable with me as part of making your choice.

I offer my therapies individually or integrated, taking the lead from the patient. I work in Suffolk from my home clinic and within an Osteopathy, Chiropractic and Physiotherapy clinic. I also run an online low-cost clinic with a colleague, Rachel Welsh, called Sapphire Natural Health which has students, graduates and experienced homeopaths all attending. I am a clinic supervisor and Personal Academic Tutor for the Betonica School of Herbal Medicine working for the online low-cost clinic. I qualified in Homeopathy in 2003 from the College of Practical Homeopathy in London with Robert Davidson, Hilery Dorian, Tony Hurley, Myriam Shivadikar and Mike Bridger amongst many others. I subsequently studied a post graduate course from 2008 to 2012 at The Shamanic School of Homeopathy with Dr Yubraj Sharma before studying at The University of Lincoln, gaining a First in BSc(Hons) Herbal Medicine. I qualified with the Institute of Functional Medicine in 2018 and a PGCE in CAM specialising in online learning from the University of Huddersfield in 2019. I have taught several post graduate courses including one for the Society of Homeopaths entitled Herbal Medicine for Homeopaths. I teach a masterclass on the use of CBD Oil to health professionals and the general public. I act as a mentor and supervisor for many people in several different modalities, offering sessions individually or for [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbbfae9bafbab7b0e9eaf5b8b4b6) Join date: 09/03/2017 I am delighted to be able to offer compassionate and empathetic supervision to students of the School of Homeopathy, either in person, from the comfortable and confidential clinic I have built above my health food shop here in Haslemere, Surrey, or at a distance on Skype or Google Hangouts. I have been professionally involved in the UK homeopathic community for more than 30 years, finally registering as a full-time homeopath with the Society of Homeopaths in 2014, with a Diploma from the School of Homeopathy. I live in nearby Hindhead with my wife Rachel and our two teenage children. The essential qualities we bring to our homeopathic practice, of observation, that is discovering what is present during our exchanges with patients; active listening, both to oneself and to others, as well as what is in between; reflection, without prejudice or attachment to an idea; and a clarity in communication, feeding back to our patients through our compassion and understanding, all are central to the process of supervision. And this is what I am able to offer in our supervision sessions, as you prepare to incorporate the skills you are developing into the professional practice that is forming before you! You can contact me by email, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#86e2f3c6f2e7eaedb4b7a8e5e9eb) and I will try to respond to you within 24 hours. Haslemere is an hour on the train from Waterloo Station in London, and Haslemere Health Foods is a 10 minute walk from Haslemere Station. If you prefer to travel by car, there is free parking right behind the shop, and the post code is GU27 1HN.

THC Moved to Scotland from Italy after a gap year in Glasgow working as Assistant Teacher of Italian in schools and completing my degree in Modern Languages. Before discovering homeopathy I worked for various international companies as Credit Manager, which I enjoyed very much. Once I had my first child, however, I decided to dedicate all my time to being a mother, which I enjoyed even more. My second child was diagnosed with autism in 2013 and that was the start of my journey into the medical field and, as I looked for answers, I stumbled into homeopathy. I enrolled at the School of Homeopathy in 2014 and I still remember the goose bumps the first time I heard Misha Norland's voice explaining the principles of philosophy in homeopathy. It felt more like \"coming home\" and remembering a long lost life than discovering something completely new. I also remember the comment of a homeopath, who was treating my son at the time on hearing that I was studying at the School: \"Misha Norland? Wow, you are studying with the big guys!\" I had no notion that Misha was such a \"big deal\", I am sure there are other great schools in the UK but I feel so lucky to have picked this one! I started practicing in 2018, while on supervision. Partly in order to help me pay for supervision, but also because I was really scared of practicing \"for real\" and I thought that the best thing would be to plunge in. Being supported by my supervisor made me (and my patients) feel safe. I started to put the word out locally and on my social media and the flood gates opened. Last year I decided to niche out, because, from a marketing point of view, it works better and of course I know quite a lot about autism and had already seen many cases, which is why I picked this particular niche. I am interested in auto-immune conditions in general (autism is one of them). I was registered with the SOH for a while, however, I really don't think they give adequate support to new starters, particularly when it comes to practice building and marketing. They also don't do enough to promote homeopathy (that is purely my opinion of course). There are many ways of spreading the word about homeopathy in a way that does not infringe any ASA or whatever rules if you are creative enough, without spending money on advertising but the SOH seems too scared and so I left. I have been working with a marketing company that coaches therapists and healers specifically for nearly a year. This has helped me a lot and has resulted in creating my own practice building course for homeopaths, that I hope to launch soon. In fact, I think that supervision should include practice building strategies (again, my opinion). Along the way I found out that I love teaching: before Covid I was doing a lot of workshops locally in health centres, churches, alternative medicine events, BMA talks, wherever they would have me. Students of homeopathy from other countries started to get in touch and even graduates who were just starting and that is how I started doing some \"Informal supervision\". This convinced that supervision is definitely something that I want to do. In terms of CPD, I have a subscription with the CHE (centre of homeopathic education) which is a great way to learn from a wide range of great homeopaths, plus any other webinars/books I come across through the School. Last year I completed a year online course in Nutrition which allows me to advise on diet and natural supplements as well. My future plans include (apart from doing Supervision) - collaborating with other homeopaths internationally on podcasts and online courses - launch my practice building course for homeopaths - create a Warrior Parents Academy online to empower parents of autistic children using homeopathy and other natural modalities am a Homeopath living and working in and near Edinburgh and in East Lothian. I offer Supervision sessions in person and by Skype for any students and Homeopaths in the UK and also internationally with appointments to fit with your time zone. Having first seen a Homeopath as a teenager, going along to a Homeopathy evening class 35 years ago sparked my interest some more. Homeopathy made sense to me immediately and I love the philosophy and ideas and ways to look at the world. Homeopathy is exciting. The potential to enhance our health both in acute situations and for deeper, long term well being fascinates me. Homoeopathy was my first choice for my three children. It was invaluable during pregnancy, though their baby and childhood years to teenage and adult life. I completed a 4 year Homeopathy training course in Edinburgh in 1998. I continue learning through attending a wide range of Continuing Professional Development seminars, courses and study days along with personal study and professional supervision. Regular consultations with my homeopath are vital to my own practice, learning and well-being. Studying with Louis Klein and Jan Scholten through seminars and webinars is invaluable to me and my practice. I attend Masterclasses run by the National Centre for Integrative Medicine with Elizabeth Thompson, Julie Geraghty, Jonathan Hardy, Geoff Johnson and Annette Sneevliet. I've learned from Bhawisha and Shachindra Joshi and Rajan Sankaran's work and am currently exploring and using Michal Yakir's Plant system and Mahesh Gandhi's work. With my clients I explore cases Homeopathically by whichever model or means of case analysis and exploration works best to find their remedy. I meet with clients in person or via Skype or my whereby.com meeting room. I previously trained as a Childbirth Educator and was involved in setting up and running the first Scottish Birth Teachers Course. Along with my constant explorations in homeopathy I spend as much time as I can singing, travelling, learning to grow food - using homeopathy in my gardening efforts - and spending time with my feisty grandchildren and getting to as many good plays and films as I possibly can. I am a Registered member of the Society of Homeopaths and have completed the Sea Change Supervision and Mentoring Course. I look forward to working through supervision is a joy and it's a privilege to see them develop into skilled practitioners. Em Colley, Clinical Supervisor "}
