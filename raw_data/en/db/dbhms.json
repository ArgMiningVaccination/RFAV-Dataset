Acupuncture is probably the first therapy that patients think of when they consider seeking Traditional Chinese Medical healing. As one of the commonest and certainly one of the oldest types of Chinese medical therapies, acupuncture has gained international recognition in recent decades as western scientific research increasingly corroborates what TCM practitioners have known for millenia - acupuncture is a technique that has provable therapeutic benefits. Acupuncture is actually a range of procedures all of which involve stimulating anatomical points or meridians on the body using different techniques. The most common and well known technique involves delicately piercing the skin with fine, metal needles by hand. However, acupuncture can also include electro-acupuncture in which the needles are stimulated by electrical current, ear acupuncture,cupping, and moxibustionin which the mugwort herb is burned on the end of the acupuncture needles. Acupuncture needles are so extremely thin and tiny that patients experience practically no discomfort when the needles are inserted. Although research is still ongoing to try to understand how acupuncture works, it appears on a physiological level that the insertion of the needles causes body processes and functions to physically change so that energy flows smoothly and balance is restored. The Best of Chinese Medicine offers targeted acupuncture treatments to help correct: joint and muscle pain, fertility and sterility problems, manage weight issues and for facial rejuvenation. Massage Therapy [Read More](3-description) What is Massage Therapy? Massage in all its various forms is an excellent, non-invasive, gentletherapy that aids relaxation, alleviates mental stress and can help to relieve the everyday discomfort of overworked muscles, strained joints and ligaments and different types of chronic aches and pains. If massage therapy starts soon after injury it can also help limit scar tissue and prevent other muscles from overcompensating for the trauma-affected joint.
