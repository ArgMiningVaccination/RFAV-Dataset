One such issue is that of plastic\u2014the most ubiquitous substance in our lives that fills up our land and oceans, polluting it and adding to our health stress. The current health emergency has normalised the use of plastic as we use more and more of it for protection measures against the virus. The plastic protection gear\u2014from gloves, masks to body suits\u2014so critical in this \"war\" against covid -19, will also contribute to the mountains of trash in our cities\u2014if it is not incinerated in properly- controlled and -managed medical waste disposal facilities. The politics of plastic is embroiled in a benign word called \"recycling\". The global industry has successfully argued that we can continue to use this highly durable substance because once we throw it, it will be recycled. Never mind that nobody knows what this means. When China came up with its 2018 National Sword policy to stop imports of plastic waste for \"re-processing\", the rich nations woke up to some harsh realities. Ships of plastic waste cargo were turned away from many other countries as well, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Nobody wanted this waste. They had enough of their own to deal with. It is reported that prior to the 2018 ban, 95 per cent of European Union's and 70 per cent of usa's plastic waste collected for recycling was sold and shipped to China. The dependence on China meant that recycling standards had become slack\u2014food waste was mixed with plastic and the industry had excelled in creating new products, design and colours of the waste. All this meant that waste was more contaminated making recycling difficult. So much so that even China\u2014which can create business from nothing\u2014found it unprofitable to reprocess it. India's plastic waste problem is not as huge as the rich world, but it is growing. The latest annual report of the Central Pollution Control Board on plastic waste tells it all\u2014while rich states like Goa produce as much as 60 grams of plastic per capita per day; Delhi is catching up with 37 grams per capita per day. The national average is around 8 grams per capita per day. In other words, as societies become more affluent, they will become more wasteful. This is the ladder of wealth we must not aspire to climb. However, given the huge litter of plastic we can already see in our cities, it is clear we cannot get sanguine about the fact that we will catch up\u2014collect more; recycle more. This will not work, unless we can think differently and act decisively. Something that is sorely missing today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a powerful statement on Independence Day in 2019 calling us to give up the habit of plastic and promising that his government would announce significant plans for reduction. But his government is doing pretty much the reverse. And again, the politics is about recycling. The industry has, once again, managed to convince policymakers that plastic waste is not a problem as we can recycle virtually everything. It's a bit like tobacco\u2014if we stop smoking, farmers will be affected. If we stop using plastic, the recycling industry\u2014run by small industry; work - ing often in the informal sector; and, using poorest people who work in the most abysmal conditions\u2014will col - lapse. Jobs will be lost. Let's first discuss as to what happens to the waste that cannot be recycled? All studies (limited as they are) show that the plastic waste in drains or in landfills comprises the least recyclable material\u2014this is multi-layered packaging (food stuff of all kinds), sachets (gutkha or shampoo) and plastic bags. The 2016 Plastic Management Rules recognised this and said that sachets would be banned and all multi-layered plastic use would be phased out in two years. In 2018, this was fatally amended\u2014now only waste that is non-recyclable, and if there is any of this at all, needs to be phased out. This is not to say that theoretically multilayered plastic or sachets cannot be recycled\u2014they can be sent to cement plants for energy recovery or used in road construction. But everyone knows that it is nearly impossible to first segregate, collect and then transport these empty, soiled packages. So, business continues as usual. Our garbage problem does not go away. The second issue is what do we really mean by recycling? The fact is that recycling of plastic needs careful segregation at the household level; this puts the onus on us and the local bodies. So, it's time we dismembered and took apart the world of recycling. I will discuss this further with you in the coming weeks..

India has been a developing country for many years now. But the only ones who seem to have developed are those in whom we had entrusted the protection of our common resources and hoped would work for the common good. In India, Kerala is particularly touted as a model for development, scoring high on all human development indices. But the report by the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, popularly called the Gadgil Commis - sion, has been comprehensively subverted by this fully literate and politically conscious state. Globally, we have the US, a \"developed\" nation and the leading economic power, whose president is in a total denial mode as far as climate change is considered. Is it merely Donald Trump's folly? To answer in the affirmative would be to question the US' democratic credentials. Our country, Bharat, had a great tradition of living with nature. Love and respect for nature was woven into our daily lives through religion and culture. Will we be able to redeem that culture and belief system and save the world from the looming disaster?

Can you please provide any case or instance where govern - ment officials brought out a notification or policy decision in haste that has affected the small and medium enterprises. Also, kindly elaborate how courts are blamed for taking arbitrary decisions, when authorities are not timely filing the documents. SIDDHARTH SINGH VIA EMAIL DTE response Take the case of Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) to monitor emissions/effluents from 17 categories of industries. The government introduced it in 2014, but the objective of using CEMS as a compliance monitoring tool is yet to be achieved. One of the primary reasons for this failure is the hasty execution of the decision. CEMS was introduced in 2014 but the guidelines came only in 2017. There was no categorisation of industries on the basis of scale, due to which many industries with small boilers invested in CEMS and ended up with faulty, useless installations even after investing crores of rupees. Regarding the second part of the question, a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order in April said: \"In absence of responsiveness of the statutory authorities who have to carry out the orders of this tribunal, mere passing of paper orders will not advance the purpose for which this tribunal has been constituted under the law\". This was just one case where NGT rapped the Delhi Pollution Control Committee for failing to prosecute, or recover compensation from, a factory for damaging the environment. NGT relies on government agencies for imple - mentation and this was one example of the authorities not performing their duties in time.

When the COVID-19 crisis deepened in April, we started receiving calls from the families living there for help, \" recalls Julekha Pervin, a third-year student with So Pervin, along with 30-odd students, started reaching out to individual households with food packages. Later, they started a community kitchen. They raised ` 60,000, primarily through contributions from professors. \"We soon realised that almost all the households in rural West Bengal had fami - ly members stuck in cities without jobs, \" she says. So they came up with a simple idea: start a forum with a helpline service where people could call up and inform distressed workers from West Bengal and then pass on the information to non-profits operating in the state where they are stranded. Pervin and two others, Tamonash Roy and Chandan Bhattarcharya, took the responsi - bility of the helpline service and popularised their phone numbers through social media and by word of mouth. The others started forg - ing associations with non-profits in different states. At the peak of the crisis, the students would receive over 120 calls a day, mostly from family members of workers stranded in other states. They created a network of 50-60 non-profits. \"There have been occasions when we were unable to immediately connect a migrant with a non-profit. We transferred money directly to them, \" says Pervin. For instance, a couple in Dharavi slums of Mumbai needed immediate help for their youngest child who suffers from thalassemia, which requires regular blood transfusion. Dharavi, at that time, was completely locked down due to high number of COVID-19 cases. \"We transferred some money. They eventually got their jobs back and are doing better now, \" she says. During the second phase of the lockdown, the students started sensitising families about various government schemes and initiatives. They rolled out small how- to videos on the Sneherparash mobile application, released by the West Bengal government to transfer ` 1,000 to rural beneficiaries and circulated it among the people. They created similar content on how to book tickets for shramik trains and apply for e-passes to enter West Bengal districts. While the migrant distress has eased ever since, Pervin thinks the lockdown hurt the illiterate population the most. \"We received several calls from groups of Bengali women who were working at construction sites in Jaipur. These groups were stuck in the city after the construction sites closed down because they could not speak Hindi, \" she says. The students have helped over 5,000 migrants and provided relief to many more households in the state. A group of students in West Bengal provide relief to 5,000 migrants across the country RAJIT SENGUPTA RELATED STORY BACK TO CONTENTDigest /IN FRONT-COVID WARRIORThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has set up an evaluation committee to check the record-breaking temperature reading on June 20. Randall Cerveny, the UN agency's rapporteur on weather and climate extremes, tells Down To Earth about its ramification on the region's climate How accurate is the reading at Verkhoyansk? Our preliminary analysis indicates that it is a good observation but we will examine the equipment, its calibration, the observation practices, the correspondence to surrounding stations' observations and other parameters. Is it unprecedented? Well, we do not have as many weather stations in the Arctic as we would want so it is possible that temperatures of that magnitude have occu- rred in the past but were not measured. But in terms of our records, it is likely that we have not seen tempera - tures like the 38oC value in the Arctic over the length of our observed temperature records of ab out 150 years. Siberia and the Arctic region have been recording extreme temperatures for quite some time now. What is the reason?The Arctic is one of the more climatically sensitive regions. As warmer temperatures create lesser snow cover for the area, the feedback re - sponse (less white to reflect sunlight) can continually increase the temperatures. Because the global tempera - ture increase is primarily the result of human activity, we have to take responsibility for these extremes. What are the chances of such extremes in the future? Unless governments change their policies, the likelihood remains high and more frequent extremes of this type will be observed.THE SIBERIAN town of Verkhoyansk, known for the largest temperature range in the world from -67 oC to 37 oC, got scientists worried when on June 20 it recorded the highest temperature in the Arctic circle in the last 140 years at 38 \u00b0C. This is around 18 \u00b0C higher than the normal for this time of the year for the place. \"The new high shows temperature swings may be increasing,\" says Raghu Murtugudde, climate scientist at the University of Maryland, US. The region, warming at twice the rate as the rest of the world, has faced repeated heat waves in the last few months, with Siberia recording some 10\u00b0C more than the normal in May 2020. Arctic warming increases the north-south migrations of the polar jet stream, a permanent band of winds over the region. \"The jet stream is like the fence between the cold high pressure air of the Arctic and the warm low pressure air of the subtropics. If this fence swings north-south then the cold and warm air follow the jet stream,\" says Murtugudde. The impacts of a warming Arctic can be felt as far as in India in various ways. For instance, Western Disturbances respond to the pressure variations associated with the jet stream swings. Western Disturbances are extra-tropical storms that originate in the Mediterranean and are responsible for rainfall in the northwest, northern and northeastern India during the winter and spring months and snowfall in the high altitude regions.This year, they were particularly active and caused heavy rainfall in March, April and May over northern and northwestern India. These rains, moisture and the vegetation they produced were partly responsible for the early locust attacks in Rajasthan which has spread as far east as Chhattisgarh for the first time in decades. Why India should worry about a warming Arctic AKSHIT SANGOMLA 'WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EXTREME' Verkhoyansk in Siberia is one of the coldest towns in the world BACK TO CONTENTQUERY\\DigestIndia stares at a locust plague BLAME IT on the weather unusually favouring locusts for the past three years or the inability of the international community and the governments to control their growth, the global upsurge of locusts is on its way to reach plague levels. After taking Delhi and the National Capital Region by surprise on June 27, which as per some estimates is for the first time since the locust plague of 1926-31, and spreading across Bihar, locust swarms are causing mayhem in Nepal. By July 2, locusts have spread to almost a dozen districts in the Himalayan country where kharif crop cycle is underway. As per its Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Management Center, located in Lalitpur, locusts have caused some damage to transplanted rice fields, maize, fodder grass, vegetables and other perennial crops in the districts, with severe damage reported from Dang and Pyuthan districts. While some groups have stayed in Kathmandu valley, others have headed further north towards Ramechaap. In the past, locusts have invaded Nepal on rare occasions and only during plagues. Over the next four weeks, alerts the June 27 update of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( fao) on desert locusts, India should remain on high alert as swarms developed in Somalia will cross the Arabian Sea to reach Gujarat and Rajasthan from early July. These are second generation swarms that have developed in the Horn of Africa, despite aggressive control operations. In the past, such spectacular migrations have occurred during upsurge and plague periods. For example, immature swarms crossed the Atlantic Ocean from West Africa to the Caribbean in October 1988, covering 5,000 km in 10 days. Swarms migrated from West Africa to the British Isles in 1955. From time to time, they have crossed the Red Sea to reach from northeast Africa to the Arabian peninsula or vice versa; the Gulf of Aden to reach from Yemen to Kenya; the northern Africa to reach from Sudan to Morocco; the Sahel to reach from Guinea to Ethiopia; and the Arabian Sea to reach from the Horn of Africa to Indo-Pakistan border. fao describes the current spread of infestation as an \" upsurge \" and says a plague is declared when widespread and heavy infestations occur in one or more years.

But this year, their migration may not be uni-directional. In years of exceptional breeding, says a 2014 fao document , monsoon swarms may move from the source areas eastwards over northern India from September onwards. Between 1950 and 1961, monsoon swarms on several occasions moved east to reach western Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and south to reach Gujarat, Mumbai in Maharashtra and Kerala in the months of October, November and December. These years coincide with the plague years of 1949-1955 and 1959-1962. With the monsoon rains sweeping across all five states\u2014Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar\u2014that currently have locust presence as per fao, they might breed in pockets where the soil is just right and undisturbed. 14 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INForest fires reach 13-year high in Amazon in June THIS JUNE Amazon rainforest in Brazil recorded a 20 per cent increase in fires, a 13-year high for the month. The alarming spike in forest fire incidents during the dry season has raised concern that the year's total incidents could be higher than last year's. Activists suggest the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced surveillance in the forests, leading to the sharp increase. The South American country has the world's second-highest coronavirus cases and death toll, just behind the US. In June, the country's National Institute for Space Research recorded 2,248 fires using satellite imagery, as opposed to 1,880 fires in June 2019. The burning usually increases in July, August and September. Last year's fires peaked in August, with 30,901, three times the number for the same period the previous year. The 2019 fires led to worldwide protests, with threats of trade sanctions by developed countries even as President Jair Bolsonaro bulldozed with his anti-environmental policies, which includes slashing the conservation funds to encourage business activities in the rainforests.FOR MORE CARTOONS, SCAN SORIT GUPTO CROSS HAIRS BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 15 IN AN open letter to the World Health Organization, 239 scientists in 32 countries have outlined the evidence showing airborne transmission could be a significant factor for coronavirus.

After the Central government ann-ounced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 and the school received orders to hold classes online, the principal, Rohni Pathak, organised a door-to-door survey to assess its feasibility. \"We found that house- holds of only eight of the 31 students had mobile phones, and just two were active,\" Pathak says. Hakki Bai, a daily wage labourer belong-ing to Gond tribe, whose son Brij Kumar, 13, studies in the school, says the family does not have a phone. \"Even if we buy one, there is no power supply to charge it. I don't know how will he catch up with the studies once the classes start,\" she says. \"The situation is the same in other villages,\" adds Pathak. Education is just one area that has highlighted the digital divide between India's rural and urban areas during the lockdown. The trend is evident everywhere\u2014telemedicine, banking, e-commerce, e-governance, all of which became accessible only via internet during the lockdown. The divide exists despite the rise in the number of wireless subs-cribers in India over the past few years. As per the monthly report released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( trai) on June 29, the country had over 1,160 million wireless subscribers in February 2020, up from 1,010 million in February 2016. This is a rise of 150 million subscribers in five years, or 30 million per year. The growth has been evenly distributed in urban and rural areas, with the number of urban subscribers increasing by 74 million (from 579 million to 643 million) and rural subscribers by 86 million (from 431 million to 517 million). But this growth only indicates the rise in basic telecommunication facility. Services such as online classrooms, financial transactions and e-governance require access to internet as well as ability to operate internet-enabled devices like phones, tablets and computers. Here the urban-rural distinction is quite stark. As per the 75 th round of National Sample Survey conducted between July 2017 and June 2018, just 4.4 rural households have a computer against 14.4 per cent in urban areas, with just 14.9 per cent rural households having access to internet against 42 per cent house-holds in urban areas. Similarly, only 13 per cent people of over five years of age in rural areas have the ability to use internet against 37 per cent in urban areas (see 'Network strength' on p 20). \"Urban areas have over 104 internet subscriptions per 100 people (many have dual sim cards with internet connectivity), while the figure for rural areas is a little over 27. Such numbers confirm the extent of India's rural-urban digital divide,\" says Apar Gupta, executive director of Delhi-based charitable trust Internet Freedom Foundation. Clearly, the internet penetration is not deep enough. \"At one level, we all recognise that internet has become indispensable. On another level, it still doesn't have adequate attention of the decision makers,\" says Aruna Sundararajan, former secretary in the Union government's telecommunication department and member of Kerala's covid-19 task force. The first thing we recommended was to ensure uninterrupted internet services, she says. \"We put in suggestions that people who normally don't have access to internet need to be given access because they are the ones who require it most,\" she says. There is another dimension to the problem. Smriti Parsheera, a lawyer and policy researcher with Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy , who interacted with several students in Himachal Pradesh government schools during the lockdown, says that most students are from families that have only one mobile phone. \"The earning member of the family has to carry the phone while going out to work. In a family that has, say, three children, how does one decide who gets to attend classes, assuming the phone is accessible,\" says Parsheera (see 'Make handsets affordable' on p 21). There is also a gender divide. The Mobile Gender Gap Report 2020 released in March by gsma , an association of industry organisation representing interests of mobile network operators worldwide, says that while 79 per cent men own a mobile phone in the country, the number for women is 63 per cent. The gender gap in mobile internet users is a huge 50 per cent, it states. Access to phone and internet is not just an economic factor but also social and cultural. If one family has just one phone, there is a good chance that the wife or the daughter will be the last one to use it, says Parsheera. States too greatly differ in terms of people that have access to computer or in the know-how to use internet. Himachal Pradesh leads the country in access to internet in both rural and urban areas. Uttarakhand has the most number or computers in urban areas, while Kerala has the most number of computers in rural areas (see 'Regional disparity' on p 20). Over- all, Kerala is the state where the difference between rural and urban areas is the least. BACK TO CONTENTOVER THE past decade, governments have been trying to improve internet access in the country. In 2011, the BharatNet project was launched to connect 0.25 million panchayats through optical fibre (100 MBPS) and connect India's villages. Its implementation began only in 2014. The initial deadline was March 2019 but since only 0.12 million panchayats had been connected by then, the deadline was extended to August 2021. In 2014, the government launched National Digital Literacy Mission and the Digital Saksharta Abhiyan. The Standing Committee on Information Technology in January 2019 said that both these schemes were similar in design as well as implementation with sufficient scope for creating confusion among beneficiaries. In 2015, the government launched several schemes under its Digital India campaign to connect the entire country. This includes the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan, launched in 2017, to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 60 million households. Its outlay is R 2,351 crore, but R 500 crore have been allocated so far. The Standing Committee on Information Technology in January 2019 concluded that the digital literacy efforts of the government are far from satisfactory.

The schemes, say critics, overlapped and were only partially successful (see 'Official push for digital' on p 19). Internet traffic saw a big jump after the launch of Reliance's Jio phone in 2017, which provided free voice calling facility and data packs in the initial period after its launch. This is corroborated by the Nokia mbit Index 2020, which shows that data traffic in India has increased by 44 times in past four years. Still, there is a huge population on the wrong side of the divide, lack-ing access to a technology widely considered a fundamental right. \"Most of them belong to the most vulnerable sections of society,\" says Parsheera. DTE @kundanpandey158Make handsets affordable Despite cheap data packs, why the huge digital divide in India? BY SMRITI PARSHEERA WHY IS it that despite boasting of the world's second largest internet user base and the cheapest data prices India still has a vast digital divide? What can be done about this in the short to medium term? Adoption of internet is shaped by many factors, including availability and affordability of internet services and the social and cultural norms around its use. Yet, most conversations on the digital divide tend to focus on network availability or other supply-side factors. This includes important questions about the government's obligations to ensure universal coverage, commercial incentives to reach under-served areas and overall state of telecom infrastructure. However, in many cases, the lack of digital access stems from a much more immediate barrier, namely the absence of an Internet-enabled handset or device. As per The Mobile Gender Gap Report 2020 by GSMA, 42 per cent of women and 31 per cent men who did not have a mobile phone in India reported that the main reason for this was the cost of the handset. Until a few years back, the common practice in India was to sell only unbundled mobile phones \u2014 where the device is not tied to any particular network, especially in the low cost segment of the market. The launch of the Jio Phone in 2017 changed this trend leading to the rapid adoption of bundled \"smart feature phones\". While this has certainly helped in addressing the affordability issue, these phones do not support that same functionality as a full-fledged smartphone. This can lead to practical as well as aspirational barriers, particularly given the limited selection of devices available in this range. One way to marry affordability and choice for consumers could be through the promotion of micro lending schemes to facilitate the purchase of mobile phones by low income users. For instance, in 2017, Vodafone had tied up with the non-profit Hand in Hand to facilitate micro finance loans for the purchase of smartphones by rural women entrepreneurs. With the COVID situation far from being resolved, the relevance of being online will only grow. Placing mobile devices into the hands of as many users as possible has to be the first step bridge the digital divide. This will require the cooperation of stakeholders at all levels, including the government and device manufacturers. The government should revisit its decision to increase GST on mobile phones to 18 per cent, at least for low-end devices. (The author is a lawyer and technology policy researcher.

In Gurugram, bio - medical waste generated due to covid -19 has increased from 500 kg a day in April to 3,000 kg a day in June, as per Biotic, the company responsible for collecting biomedical waste in the district. News reports esti - A transfer station in northwest Delhi exclusively for waste generated from quarantined households and testing centres 22 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INmate close to 500 per cent increase in biomedical waste generation due to the outbreak. This explains why the Central Pollution Control Board, despite an existing biomedical waste guideline, decided to issue separate covid -19 biomedical waste guidelines in April, and revised it thrice to keep up with the growing burden. The guidelines broadly suggest that biomedical waste needs to be disposed in yellow packets which will be collected and transported separately to common biomedical waste treatment facility for incineration. It also suggests guidelines on waste handling and precautions for sanitation workers. While most urban local bodies are following the cpcb guidelines, some are innovating ways to im - prove the sanitation coverage while reducing costs. Hyderabad, for in - stance, has roped in 300 members of the disaster response force who are using modified vehicles with jetters to disinfect the entire city. The vehicles are sourced on a tem - porary basis from the waterworks department. \"We are pooling in all available resources with different departments to reduce expenditure and ensure effective sanitation coverage,\" says Viswajit Kampati, director of the Enforcement, Vigi - lance and Disaster Management wing of Greater Hyderabad Munici - pal Corporation. In Vijaywada, the municipal corporation has employed drones to disinfect containment zones and trained sanitation workers to han - dle biomedical waste with zero con - tact. Surat Municipal Corporation is regularly testing samples from sewage treatment plants for traces of covid -19 virus. The Bruhat Ben - galuru Mahanagara Palike has gone ahead and set up a command centre to attend civic complaints and monitor effective waste collec - tion, cleaning of streets and other common places. The centre is also checking unauthourised dumping and burning of garbage in the city. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Cor - poration has created the real-time Covi Guard dashboard and the Co - vi Care mobile application to iden - tify areas from where biomedical waste needs to be collected. The app uses remote sensing tools to track quarantined individuals and iden- tify containment zones. In Port Blair, the municipal corporation has started a WhatsApp group where people can request essential services. The platform is also being used to train people in composting of regular waste and other good waste management practices. The city has also started transportation facilities and refreshments for sani - tation workers. In Bhopal, sanita - tion workers have been provided insurance and those working in high-risk zones are being adminis - tered chloroquine doses to reduce infection risk. The municipal corpo - ration has also installed foot-oper - ated wash basins at public places and at waste transfer stations. The wash basins are made from dis - carded tanks. The situation is not equally promising across the country though. Chennai has had to halt its 162 decentralised composting cen - tres because \"all its staff are now engaged in disinfection activities\". Similarly, the city's resource recov - ery and material recovery facilities used for recycling waste are also not operating properly. Several ur - ban local bodies in West Bengal are yet to separately collect waste from quarantined households. The other challenge is that In - dia has over 57,000 unauthorised healthcare facilities in 2017, as per the 2017 estimate released by cpcb in May 2019. In contrast, the country has nearly 85,000 authour - ised hospitals.

The 55-year-old farmer from Kothe Amberhar village of Punjab's Ferozepur district did not need to hire labourers to sow rice. He had been doing it himself for the past five years with minimal help. It was in 2015 that Singh ex- perimented with direct seeded rice ( dsr), also called broadcasting seed technique\u2014an alternative way of sowing rice. The traditional and the prevalent way across India is transplanting rice ( tpr) seedlings from a nursery to waterlogged fields. But tpr is extremely labour- and water-intensive, unlike dsr. Inspired by a fellow farmer of his village, Kewal shifted part of his 16 hectare (ha) farmland to dsr in the first year. The yield in - creased and the input cost reduced by R7,000 per ha. He kept bringing more land under dsr every year and this year, when the labour shortage was extreme, he used dsr on his entire farmland. Sowing by direct seeded rice method is practised only on 10 per sent of land under paddy in India 24 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INThere is no nationwide official data on how much rice in India is grown through dsr. M L Jat, prin - cipal scientist with Mexico-based cimmyt (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre), esti - mates that about 10 per cent of In - dia's 44 million ha under rice cultivation is through dsr. In the past few decades, many state governments have been en - couraging farmers to move to dsr because it is easier on the environ - ment, but without much success. Most recently, the Punjab govern - ment, on April 16, issued a state-ment citing a Punjab Agricultural University ( pau) study asking farm - ers to shift to dsr (see 'Overall gains' ). Since June, when kharif sowing started, 0.7 million ha has been brought under dsr in Punjab, says the state government, as per media reports. \"The government did not try hard enough to popular - ise dsr all these years. But covid -19 has done the trick,\" says B S Ra - jewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union's Rajewal unit in Punjab. So are Pradesh, in Madhya Pradesh,\" says Jat. A study by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Indian Institute of Rice Re - search in 2016-17 says dsr is gain - ing popularity among the farmers of Raichur, Koppal and Bellary districts of Karnataka where wa - ter shortage is acute. Globally, around 23 per cent rice was directly seeded in 2007, as per the study 'Weed Management in Direct Seeded Rice', published in Advances in Agronomy in 2011. Countries have been gradually shifting to dsr. In south Asia and southeast Asia, which produce, supply and consume a large proportion of the global rice, the shift to dsr started in the late 1980s and 1990s, mainly in grow - ing economies such as Malaysia and Thailand as well as in coun - tries where rapid intensification of rice production took place, for ex - ample Vietnam, says the study. China shifted to dsr in the 1980s, Korea in 1991, and experiments on direct seeding in Bangladesh started in the 2000s. Much of the shift was due to rising wages and labour shortages. WHY ISN'T DSR POPULAR? Ever since rice cultivation started, farmers across the world followed the practice of broadcasting seeds directly on dry or puddled soils, says Jat. The shift to tpr happened only in the past century primarily for two reasons\u2014seed rate and weeds. \"The seed rate was high, with farmers using 100 kg seed per ha under dsr while transplant - ing rice needed just 15 to 10 kg per ha. Another major factor was the emergence of weeds and the lack of effective weedicides,\" ex - plains Jat. In transplanting, since the field is waterlogged, weed growth is minimal. Even in India, the practice of transplanting started only after the Green Revolution. \"All the rice grown in the country a hundred years ago was through dsr,\" says Jat. When Punjab and Haryana shifted from their tradi - tional crops (maize, mil - let, pulses and oilseeds) to the wheat-paddy cultivation cycle, the change in cropping pattern was to ensure food se - curity for the country and, therefore, neither the Centre nor the states showed concern for the sustainability of the resources. \"Rice comes from wild plant spe - BACK TO CONTENTOverall gains The direct seeded rice (DSR) technique of sowing has a clear advantage over the prevalent way of transplanting rice (TPR) Cost of field preparation and sowing Yield Water required to produce 1 kg of rice Cost of weed and nutrient management`11,312 per ha 8 tonnes per ha 3,000 litres `625 per ha`5,312 per ha 7.8 tonnes per ha 2,100 litres `2,450 per ha Transplanting rice Transplanting Transplanting TransplantingDirect seeded rice Direct seeded rice Direct seeded rice Direct seeded rice `6,875 per ha Total savings in DSRSource: Comparison of Direct Seeded Rice and Normal Transplanted Rice report by Punjab Agricultural University 25 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INAGRICULTURE /RICE CULTIVATION cies and its cultivation was adopt - ed in naturally flooded areas. So when farmers adopted it in non-naturally flooded areas, they flood - ed the fields themselves,\" says Surinder Singh Kukal, dean, Col - lege of Agriculture, pau, explain - ing how tpr became prevalent even in regions that are not rich in water resources. DSR BENEFITS Rice is the major kharif crop of India and is grown in all the major agrarian states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Since groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these states, rice cultivation by tpr has depleted the water table. In Punjab, for instance, the ground-water declined in about 85 per cent of the state between 1984 and 2016, shows Central Ground Water Board data. In such a scenario, dsr can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35 per cent, says the 2011 study in Advances in Agron-omy. The study was an analysis of 77 published studies from across the globe. It also stated that dsr can reduce labour needs by 60 per cent and the cost of production by US $30 to US $51 per ha. The transplanting technique is also a major source of methane, a greenhouse gas. The study found that methane emissions were reduced by 6 per cent to 92 per cent in the dsr method , depending on the type of variant used. There are dsr variants that can be practised as per the agro-climatic and soil conditions. The two main methods are\u2014dry dsr (in which rice seeds are sown by drilling in dry soil) and wet dsr (in which sprouted seeds are sown in wet soil). pau, which first recomme- nded dsr in 2010, has now suggested a few refinements and called it tar wattar (optimum moisture) dsr. This is a modification of wet dsr. In tar wattar dsr, the field is laser- levelled and a pre-sowing ( rauni ) irrigation is done. The field is prepared to optimum soil moisture condition and rice is seeded immediately. Herbicides to control weeds are sprayed simultaneously with the help of drill machine. The first irrigation is done 21 days after sowing, which is a major departure from the dsr being tried earlier in Punjab. \"The delay in first irrigation promotes deep root penetration and minimises nutrient deficiencies. The three-week post-sowing period covers most of the driest month of June in which no irrigation is done and hence water is saved,\" says M S Bhullar, principal agronomist, pau. pau's recommendation for dsr in 2010 was only for medium to heavy textured soils, but demonstrations last year showed the refined dsr technology can work even in sandy loam soils. This has increased the area suitable for dsr in Punjab from 45 per cent to 85 per cent. However, there are a few draw- backs with dsr. Rain immediately after seeding can reduce availability of soil nutrients and damage the crop. \"Germination stopped on at least 30 per cent of my field after the untimely rain on June 4,\" says Gurbinder Singh Bajwa, a farmer from Punjab's Gurdaspur district, who had sowed rice on 0.8 ha through dsr on June 2. \"A crust got formed and to break that I irrigated before the recommended 21 days. It didn't work,\" he says. Jaskarana Singh Khosa, a farmer of Kothe Amberhar, planted rice through dsr in 8 ha this time, but the crop was destroyed since the machine was faulty and the sowing was too deep. With dsr, farmers and resear- chers will also have to work on weed management. \"The intensity and diversity of weeds keep increasing. New weeds emerge; so it's likely that the same medicine won't work next time,\" warns Kukal. Bhullar, however, is optimistic. \"Next year will be better. It will take some time for farmers to fully adapt.\" DTE @shagun_kapil BY 2025, ABOUT 20 MILLION HA UNDER RICE IN ASIA WILL FACE WATER SHORTAGE.

Let's make this an everlasting reality ANUMITA ROYCHOWDHURY with contributions from DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 29 COVER STORY /GOVERNANCE BACK TO CONTENTTHE REACTIONS were bewildering. During the 70 days of nationwide lockdown , when people were forced to stay indoors, business shutdowns froze the economy, raising the spectre of job losses and pay cuts, and yet the novel coronavirus ( covid -19) continued to tighten its grip over India , many places across the country revelled in clear, blue skies and clean air. With a lot less traffic on road and closure of factories and industries, suspended particles thinned out from the air within a few days of the lockdown. People were able to see the moon, the stars and sharp contours of trees, hills and monuments without the usual barrier of smog, and breath easier. Places like Delhi and exurbs, where people had become accustomed to intermittent closure of industry, construction cites, suspension of schools and the use of N95 masks to battle winter pollution even before covid -19 originated in Wuhan, witnessed history. The lockdown, imposed in phases from March 23, did not help much to flatten the covid -19 infection curve, but it did bend the pollution curve . And there is hard evidence for this change. During the lockdown, the levels of part- iculate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) declined drama- tically across the country. PM2.5 are fine particulates, smaller than 2.5 microns, that can go deep into the lungs and cause respiratory illnesses, heart diseases and even cancer. During the lockdown, their levels in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru dropped by a phenomenal 45-88 per cent. The drop in Delhi and the National Capital Region ( ncr) was 66-79 per cent, shows a study by Delhi-based Centre for Science and Env- ironment ( cse), which conducted granular analysis of real-time air quality data recorded by the monitoring stations of the Central Pollution Control Board ( cpcb) in these cities. PM2.5 levels were at their lowest possible range at several regions (see 'PM2.5 drops by 45-88%'.). Air cleaned up so much that the impact of pre-monsoon burning of crop residues during April in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh on the air quality of Delhi- ncr went unnoticed by the general public, though it showed up in the air quality data. Similarly, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which comes primarily from road transport and is linked to chronic obstructive pulmo- nary disease, asthma and hypertension, plummeted with the onset of the lockdown. Bengaluru saw a 55 per cent drop in NO2 levels, Delhi 49 per cent, Hyderabad 30 per cent, Kolkata 65 per cent and Mumbai 70 per cent from the week preceding the lockdown 1.0 (see 'NO2 drops by 50-70%'). The most dramatic evidence of traffic off the roads was flattening of the hourly change in NO2 levels, which is present in high concentrations during the peak hour traffic periods. cse analysis shows morning peak for NO2 collapsed in Mumbai and Delhi by 78 per cent and 60 per cent. Kolkata and Bengaluru saw 53 per cent drop in morning peak, while it was 29 per cent for Hyderabad. Likewise, evening peak for NO2 dropped in Mumbai by 77 per cent and in Bengaluru by 71 per cent. Delhi, Kolkata and Hyderabad saw a drop of 60 per cent, 55 per cent and 50 per cent respectively (see 'NO2 peak flattens', p 32). BUT THE CHANGES DIDN'T LAST Pollutants returned as the country opened up during lockdown 4.0. cse analysis shows that PM2.5 levels increased by two to four times in all the six mega cities during these 14 days compared to the previous three phases. Delhi- ncr alone experienced a rise of PM2.5 levels by four to eight times. The NO2 levels increased in Chennai by 77 per cent, in Delhi by 41 per cent, in Mumbai by 21 per cent and in Hyderabad by 16 per cent. Kolkata, however, registered a drop of 10 per cent due to cyclone Amphan that hindered reopening of the city. Overall, the trend established the impact of traffic on the build up of air pollutants in our cities. Yet, air pollution remained a complex story to narrate as certain disturbing tren- ds continued. One is the increased levels of ground-level ozone, which irritates the air- ways and can worsen respiratory diseases like bronchitis and asthma. It is not directly emitted by any source but is produced when pollutants, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (vocs), react with each other under the influence of sunlight and temperature. It exceeded the eight-hour average standard in several cities during the lockdown (see 'Ozone Daily trends through the lockdown in six mega cities show PM2.5 levels were at their lowest range at several regionsPM2.5 drops by 45-88% 01 February 2020 24 March 2020 31 May 2020200 180 160 140120 100 80 60 40 20 0PM 2.5 (ug/m3) Janta Curfew Lockdown 1.0 Lockdown 2.0 Lockdown 3.0 Lockdown 4.0 Unlock 1.0 Daily trends through the lockdown show a massive reduction in this road-transport related pollutant across six mega cities NO2 drops by 50-70% Delhi 24hr Standard Lowest recorded Aggregated 2020 Aggregated trend 2019Bengaluru Mumbai Kolkata Chennai Hyderabad Source: Pandemic and Mobility, a Centre for Science and Environment paper01 February 2020 24 March 2020 31 May 2020100 80 6040 20 0NO2 (ug/m3) Janta Curfew Lockdown 1.0 Lockdown 2.0 Lockdown 3.0 Lockdown 4.0 Unlock 1.0 BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 31 COVER STORY /GOVERNANCEanomaly', p33). However, its levels were largely lower than the levels recorded during the spring and summer of 2019. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE The lockdown provided an otherwise improbable opportunity for studying the influence of key sources of pollution on the BACK TO CONTENTambient air quality of a city. So, in Delhi- ncr, cpcb rushed to estimate how different pollution sources may have contributed to the clean up of the region's air immediately after lockdown began. Based on the availa- ble studies on source apportionment and pollution inventory in Delhi, cpcb has estimated an overall reduction of 35-40 per cent in particulate pollution during the period. It says 10 per cent of the reduction was due to closure of industries, 15 per cent due to reduced transportation and 10-15 per cent due to less dust generated by road traffic. Other activities like burning of less refuse and reduced activities at the airport have also contributed to Delhi's clean air. cse conducted an in-depth study to assess this scale of change made possible in Delhi- ncr by industries and vehicles. On an average, key industry clusters of Sonipat, Panipat, Gaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, Alwar and Bhiwadi that surround Delhi- ncr consume 1.41 million tonnes of coal annually, whereas their dependence on cleaner fuel like natural gas is limited to just 0.22 tonnes. Sonipat is in fact the largest coal-consuming district and has the highest overall pollution load among all the seven regions. Some of its hotspot areas contribute between 35 and 80 per cent of the pollution load of the district. This pollution was nearly eliminated during the lockdown. But power plants remained a challenge. While all coal-based power plants have been shut down in Delhi, those in ncr did not meet the initial 2019 deadline to install pollution control devices. These are not expected to meet the extended deadline of 2022 either. It is thus clear that to sustain this temporary reductions in noxious emissions, dirty fuels in industry, including coal, will have to be replaced with cleaner natural gas. But the problem is dirty fuels have outpriced clean fuels. Coal is under the lowest slab of 5 per cent under the good and services tax ( gst), which benefits industries. It is also under the open general licensing so that coal can be imported. But clean fuel like natural gas, which is outside GRAPHIC: SANJIT / CSEPeak pollution collapsed during the lockdown in all mega cities, except Kolkata where cyclone Amphan hindered reopening NO2 peak Some pollution that continued from power plants, burning of solid waste and vehicles kept churning out the pollutantOzone remained above standard Delhi 8hr Standard Aggregated trend 2020Bengaluru Mumbai Kolkata Chennai Hyderabad Aggregated trend 2019 Source: Pandemic and Mobility, a Centre for Science and Environment paper01 February 2020 24 March 2020 31 May 2020200 200 180 160 gst so that state governments can earn revenue from it, is heavily taxed at over 40 per cent. Similarly, the gains made from reduc- tion in vehicular emissions is not that straightforward. While a large number of vehicles disappeared from the roads, a major change was in the number of trucks entering Delhi every day. With radio frequency identification ( rfid) systems at 13 key entry points for cashless collection of environment compensation charge, it was possible for the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority to track the number of trucks entering Delhi on a real-time basis. They say there was a 91 per cent drop in trucks and commercial vehicles that entered Delhi during April compared to December-January. This is a dramatic reduction keeping in view that in 2015 cse found that unregulated entry of trucks was responsible for 30 per cent of the vehicle-generated particulate load in Delhi. Moreover, nationwide introduction of Bharat Stage-VI emisisons standards and fuels that make vehicles 70-90 per cent cleaner coincided with the lockdown phase. Additionally, during the lockdown, most people worked from home. It is estim- ated that 40 million travel trips made daily in Delhi came to a near halt. This led to a massive decline in emissions. With slacken- ing of lockdown, emissions are rising again. While regional experiences with pollu- tion sources are expected to vary, Delhi- ncr mirrors the change. covid -19 outbreak and the lockdown have disrupted lives and lifestyles across India at an unbelievable scale and speed. But to ensure that our skies remain blue, we continue to breathe easy and our lungs remain clean, we need to implement some action agenda on a priority basis and at a similar scale and pace. First, curb vehicular pollution. The government must ensure there is no slip in the ongoing implementation of the BS-VI emission norms due to the pandemic. It should in fact use this opportunity as a double-win strategy, and scrap old heavy vehicles and replace them with the BS-VI-compliant ones. It must introduce cleaner battery vehicles for paratransit and public transport; mandate and pay for their revival starting with autorickshaws, taxis, buses and trams. It must use global best experiences of ensuring safety and financial stimulus to augment public transport in cities\u2014bus, metro and light-rail. Cycle and walk must also be part of the \"new-normal\". So, incentivise people to reduce travel and take cycles to work. Second, to curb industry and power plant pollution, the government must urgently bring natural gas under gst to reduce tax burden on those using it and to incentivise clean fuel over dirty. Remove coal from open general license so that imports can be regulated and its use can be monitored. Ensure that power plants across the country meet the 2015 emission standards\u2014introduce \"First-Run\" policy to allow only those plants that meet the new standards to sell electricity first, so that only clean plants get the priority to sell electricity. Third, speed up action on solid waste management to stop its burning and eliminate solid fuels for cooking.DESPITE THE clean up, summer air quality during the lockdown remained complex as some pollution continued from power plants, burning of solid fuels, reduced number of vehicles and waste burning. Volatile organic compounds also have natural origin. These toxic and volatile gases together contributed towards ozone build up, though at reduced rate. All mega cities except Hyderabad exceeded the ozone 8-hour standard at least on one day at one of its stations during the lockdown. The city-wide average exceeded the standard on four days in Delhi and eight days in Kolkata. But Delhi and Kolkata had 67 days (every day of lockdown 1.0-4.0) and 17 days when at least one station exceeded the standard. Not acknowledging this can massively undercount the problem. Almost all stations that exceeded the standard did so for at least two continuous days. Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range station in Delhi exceeded the standard for 41 contiguous days.OZONE ANOMALY BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 33 COVER STORY /GOVERNANCE BACK TO CONTENTMobility redefined The pandemic offers probably the last chance to reform our public transport and make way for walking and cycling 34 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INFEAR OF infection and the need for social distancing have altered the way we used to move around just a few months ago\u2014in the pre- covid times. Since then our activity and mobility patterns have changed dramatically, so much so that it has led to a near-collapse of the public transport in cities. cse's analysis of Google Mobility Data for the period between February 15 and May 16 shows that activities in residential areas have increased by 29 per cent but visits to workplaces have reduced by 60 per cent and to retail and recreation by 84 per cent. Grocery and pharmacy visits also indicate a drop, though marginal. (see ' covid -19 has altered our activities'). The data also shows a massive drop in visits to transit stops and nodes as the use of public transport has plummeted across the country. covid -19, it seems, has stigmatised the public transport. And this has provoked more worries. Since opening up of the economy is not possible without transport, the fear is it might lead to an increase in the number of cars and two-wheelers on the roads, making the cities even more congested and polluted. Clearly, there is an urgent need to organise mobility services. Here are a few steps that can help the authorities do this in a prudent manner. REINVENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT Public transport ridership came to a halt due to complete lockdown in India. Other countries that did not impose a lockdown and kept their public transport functional have also faced drastic reduction in ridership\u2014by as much as 70 to 90 per cent. This calls for an urgent need to rebuild confidence in the public transport. State transport corporations in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Bhubane- swar and other cities have already begun adopting covid -19 guidelines on hygiene and sanitisation and physical distancing through reduced occupancy, cashless transaction, separate boarding and alighting, health checkup and commun- ication. But this has added to the cost of operation as earnings have plummeted due to low occupancy. Besides, several state transport corporations are already facing bankruptcy.

In Kerala, 70 per cent of private bus owners are reportedly reluctant to resume operations with a low occupancy. In Kolkata, private bus associations have proposed three times the fare to compensate for the loss in ridership. Those offering intermediate transport and shared mobility services have already started to repurpose their vehicles for emergency health services, delivery of groceries and essentials and courier service, or are offering fixed route services. The pandemic situation has dealt a major blow to the country's precarious public transport system. There is already a huge shortfall in the number of buses needed in urban India. There are only 48,000 buses against the requirement of 188,500, as estimated by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs ( mohua). Even this capacity has now been reduced by more than half, and has also led to equity concerns over commuting needs of lower income groups who are in an urgent need of livelihood security. But helping the public transport sector recover from the current crisis cannot be done in a business as usual manner. Estimates by German development agency, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Intern- ationale Zusammenarbeit ( giz), show that while the overall cost of operations of bus transport has reduced by 4 per cent during the lockdown, the traffic revenue has reduced by a massive 48 per cent. This has created a 69 per cent increase in the annual viability gap funding requirement of bus transport agencies (see 'Bus transport too bears the brunt', p35). Poor bankability of state transport corporations, limited revenue sources with urban local bodies and disproportionate share of transport-related funding for road infrastructure further aggravates the challenge. While an immediate bailout package is needed to tide over the crisis, well-designed investment plans in the public transport infrastructure, its digital MASS TRANSPORT GETS A BOOST Governments worldwide are working on specific fiscal packages to revive public transport systems HONG KONG government has designed the most extensive relief package for public transport. According to Alok Jain, managing director of Hong Kong-based Trans- consult Asia Ltd, transport businesses in Hong Kong experienced a drop of 40-60 per cent in fare incomes due to the pandemic. Its package benefits both customers as well as public and private operators. This includes 20 per cent fare subsidy to commuters for six months, employment support scheme for operators with the government providing 50 per cent of their wages, fuel subsidy to franchised buses, ferries, trams, taxis, and public light bus operators; and one-time subsidy to private buses, school buses and hired car owners.

The authorities can also learn from the experience of other countries (see 'Mass transport gets a boost', p36) SUPPORT WALKING, CYCLING To maintain physical distancing norms, the demand for contact-free transport\u2014walking and cycling\u2014has caught the public imagination. Estimates show that over the past few months, the share of walking trips has increased and is more than driving trips. This is also evident from the survey conducted by cse, which found an increased preference for walking and cycling immediately after the lockdown was imposed and also in the long run (see 'Changing facet of travel' on p39). This is an opportunity to scale up micro-mobility for shorter trips. Cycling and walking infrastructures for shorter trips can thus make a big difference in cities across the country. As per the Census 2011, some 47 per cent of daily trips in urban India are by walking and cycling. In ncr, the share is 40 per cent and for the National Capital Territory ( nct) of Delhi, it is 37 per cent (or more than one-third of daily trips in the region). In fact, across urban India almost 60 per cent of the daily trips are within five kilometres. The share is almost 47 per cent for ncr and 48 per cent in nct. Another estimate from mohua report shows that the share of walk and non-motorised transport trips is 41 per cent in Delhi, while 80 per cent of all trips is made within six kilometres. Yet, actual public funding remains narrowly focused on the construction of car-centric roads and highways. Data on the setting up of smart cities, accessed from mohua in February 2019, shows that footpath and non-motorised transport infrastructure accounted for only 7 per cent of the funds spent; public transport accounted for 17 per cent of the funds, whereas 50 per cent of the funds was spent on road and highway infrastructure. This needs to be reversed to prioritise micro-mobility on a neighbourhood scale and at a network scale across the cities (see 'Walking, cycling gets space', p 40). PLAN WELL, PLAN COMPACT Fear of contagion has made many weary of crowded cities. There is a growing anxiety that high population density will increase human contact and lead to more infections and deaths. Some new studies on the contrary have reinforced that well-planned cities with high population density and with walking and cycling connectivity are needed to secure economic wellbeing as well as environmental and health protection, especially during the times of a pandemic. A recent report by Tod Litman of Victoria Transport Policy Institute, Canada, states that the risk is actually associated with \"crowding\" in terms of the number of people per unit of space and not \"density\", which is the number of people per unit of land. Many dense and highly urbanised places such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea have been more successful at reducing covid -19 transmission and deaths. A compact city with walking and cycling and public transport access can save 10-30 per cent of the transport cost, reduce travel time, increase productivity, reduced traffic casualty rates, use up less land for parking and allow energy savings and emissions reduction. A 2016 World Bank study estimates that an extensive sprawled urban development model in India would impose an additional cost in the range of US $330 billion to $1.8 trillion per year by 2050, or 1.2-6.3 per cent of the gdp, as compared to a better managed urban development model. Compact cities perform economically better than sprawled city.A 2019 ESTIMATE SHOWS THAT STRUCTURES FOR FOOTPATHS AND NON- MOTORISED TRANSPORT ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 7% OF THE FUNDS SPENT; PUBLIC TRANSPORT ACCOUNT FOR 17% OF THE FUNDS, WHEREAS 50% OF THE FUNDS IS SPENT ON ROADS AND HIGHWAYSBACK TO CONTENT 38 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INThe Centre for Science Environment carried out a rapid perception survey in Delhi and the National Capital Region on the changing commuting choices of middle- to high-income groups because of the pandemic. This is what it has found: HEALTH SAFETY TOPS THE RANK: Health safety is of top concern followed by road safety, availability of mode options, comfort, distance of trips, cost of journey and environmental consciousness. Only high-income group ranks comfort above all else. GREEN SIGN FOR MASS TRANSPORT, WALKING, CYCLING: Within six months of lockdown, preference for metro ridership will decline to 16 per cent from 37 per cent during the pre-lockdown level. The share of cars and two-wheelers will increase to 47 per cent from 35 per cent, while that of walking and cycling will increase to 12 per cent from 4 per cent. However, over the next one to two years, the preference to use bus and metro services will regain and the share of ridership will increase to 47 per cent from 44 per cent. Intent to use personal vehicles shows an arrested trend and will reduce to 31 per cent from 35 per cent. The share of walking and cycling will however increase to 9 per cent in the long run from 4 per cent during the pre-lockdown period. CAR OWNERSHIP TO INCREASE ONLY IN SHORT-RUN: Only about 23 per cent of the respondents have said they may buy a vehicle for safety reasons in the near future. Some 36 per cent of the 43 per cent who do not own any vehicle said they do not wish to own any vehicle in near future. PREFERENCE TO RISE FOR HIGH-QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSPORT: Most respondents, as many as 73 per cent, say they would prefer to move to the public transport if it offers high quality services. About 38 per cent prefer public transport for easy connectivity, 23 per cent each for cost effectiveness and sustainability, and 16 per cent to avoid traffic. TRAVEL DISTANCES TO INFLUENCE CHOICE: For those living within 5-10 km of their workplaces, the use of cars is expected to increase to 32 per cent from 20 per cent at pre-lockdown level; the use of Metro to decline to 10 per cent from 30 per cent; and the use of paratransit vehicles to increase to 15 per cent from 10 per cent. For those living within 5 km, car usage will reduce to 16 per cent from 23 per cent; Metro usage will reduce to 5 per cent from 16 per cent, while the interest in walking and cycling will increase to 43 per cent from 14 per cent. PUBLIC TRANSPORT NODES WILL INFLUENCES CHOICE: Most in NCR do not have convenient access to public transport. Close to 40 per cent do not have access to bus stops within 500 m and 69 per cent do not have access to Metro within 500 m. Only 34 per cent have access to a bus stop within 200 m and 11 per cent have access to Metro within 200 m. Only paratransit vehicles like autos are available widely and closely.

To practise physical distancing, institutions and offices have maximised the use of digital platforms. There are also several other benefits of wfh, which include saving of rent for office spaces, reduction in associated operational costs and increase in productive time due to less commuting. Some companies have already expressed their intent to move to wfh permanently. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart, telecommunications compa- nies like at&t; software firms like sap; management consultants like PwC and life insurance companies like Guardian Life Insurance have all announced their plans to re-skill their employees for digital working. Infosys is setting up a \"digital economy aspirations\" lab. Google and Facebook are planning to allow employees to wfh. Tata Consultancy Services is planning to allow 75 per cent of its employees to wfh by 2025. Professional services network Deloitte has reported that wfh has in fact boosted individual employee productivity. As per data available with Census 2011, some 24 per cent of Indians already work from home. In 2016, the Department of Information Technology of the Government of India launched a scheme as a part of its business process outsour- cing promotions to incentivise wfh for tier- 2 and tier-3 cities in the country. However, studies such as the one by the cept University, Ahmedabad, carried out in Bengaluru indicate that wfh does not necessarily reduce the number of total trips in a day. It changes the peak time travel, but increases overall social trips after work. This means along with reducing work trips, it is important to price automobile trips through measures like hiked parking price. Models like low emission zones where polluting vehicles are restricted or deterred from entering should also be replicated to maximise the gains from this initiative. A new study from giz shows that post the pandemic the current dominant idea of having office hubs in central business district with large concentration of office spaces will change substantially. There will be less demand for office spaces due to growing wfh culture. In fact, the demand for larger homes will increase to accommodate work stations. This will transform urban form, travel and the real estate industry. India is reopening the economy to secure jobs and livelihoods to end the human misery unleashed by the pandemic. Public transport and safe access are non-negotiable. The pandemic has indeed re-emphasised the need for equity in transportation systems, public spaces and street spaces for safety and accessibility for all. DTE @down2earthindiaMayor of London has rolled out the \"London Streetscape\" programme to accommodate a 10-fold increase in cycling and five-fold increase in walking during the pandemic. This includes wider footpaths and cycle tracks, pedestrianisation of streets and reclaiming parking spaces to make cycle tracks. An extensive cycling network has been mapped out and newer car-free zones have been identified. Congestion charges are scheduled to increase. Work-from-home is the supportive strategy to restrain auto-mobility. Several cities are seeing a boom in the use of cycling amid the lockdown. Rapid increase in usage and sale of bicycles has been reported in the UK, other European countries and the US. City bike counts have increased by 74 per cent to 470 per cent in cities including Melbourne, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Shenzhen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Wuhan.

In August 2010\u2014when the last pandemic struck us, the h1n1\u2014 world's apex agency declared: \"The world is no longer in Phase 6 (full-fledged pandemic) of the influenza pandemic\". The h1n1 virus had largely run its course.\" But as we enter the eighth month of the covid -19 pandemic, a similar decla- ration seems a far cry. Unlike h1n1, the current one is far from over; it is setting records in terms of spread. So, how will the world will handle such pandemics in the future.The h1n1 pandemic lasted 15 months, and arguably, it is the shortest pandemic spell in recent history. The covid -19 pandemic, by far, has turned out to be unbridled and deadly, and has given no hope of a slowdown. It could beat historic records, as daily record cases show. As of July 8, 2020, more than 180 countries reported new cases by the thousands every day. But no fresh academic articulation of the end of the covid -19 pandemic has caught people's attention. Rather, there seems to be a certain feeling that many more such pandemics will be striking us. But are we prepared? Purely on medical terms, the 42 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INcurrent situation is no different from previous pandemics. In 2009-10, there was utter confusion over the development of vaccines and medicines for the h1n1 pandemic. After that, the world realised the grievous slow process of vaccine development. The current situation is stalking us now. But the response to the current pandemic has only reiterated the fact that the world is still sleeping, including the scientific establishment, and ignoring that these outbreaks are outbursts of our already misaligned relationship with nature. This issue is fast getting global recognition. We were already warned that pandemics were just round the corner, and like the covid -19, it would also originate from animal sources. Last fortnight, the United Nations Environment Programme ( unep) released a report Preventing the Next Pandemic: Zoonotic Diseases and How to Break the Chain of Transmission . This is the first such report that focused on the environmental side of the zoonotic dimension of disease outbreaks \u2014about 60 per cent of known infectious diseases in humans and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature. covid -19 may have killed over half a million people, but around 2 million people die each year due to zoonotic diseases. \"Most of these deaths occur in poorer countries,\" says the unep report. Zoonotic diseases have resulted in loss of more than US $100 billion of economic activity in the past two decades. \"Pandemics are devastating to our lives and our economies, and as we have seen over the past months, it is the poorest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most. To prevent future outbreaks, we must become much more deliberate about protecting our natural environment,\" says unep executive director Inger Andersen. The planet is brewing under a deadly cocktail of many environmental ills. \"Pandemics such as the covid -19 outbreak are a predictable and predicted outcome of how people source and grow food, trade and consume animals, and alter environments. Like, climate change is facilitating spread of zoonotic diseases. Climate change is a major factor in disease emergence. The survival, reproduction, abundance and distribution of pathogens, vectors and hosts can be influenced by climatic parameters affected by climate change,\" says the unep report. The unep assessment authoritatively argues that climate change would particularly affect diseases transmitted by insects, ticks and other arthropod vectors. Warmer temperatures will increase the vector population size and distribution, along with the season duration when infectious vector species are present in the environment. Erratic weather events will have an impact on the transmission of diseases as well. For instance, in 2010 in Africa, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever, a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease, occurred with higher than average seasonal rainfall. The report stated that emerging diseases in Brazil showed a relationship between infectious diseases outbreaks with extreme climate and human-induced events. The melting of permafrost in the Arctic and sub-arctic region can significantly transform soil structures, vegetation and habitats. \"Degradation of the permafrost can expose historic burial grounds, enabling the revival of deadly infections from the past. Rising temperatures increase the risk of zoonotic diseases in the vast Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), which makes up a fifth of Russia's territories,\" says the report. \"Humans are changing zoonotic disease systems and increasing their impacts in many different inter-linked ways through habitat encroachment, human population pressure and settlement, intensive agriculture, forest loss and degradation, global trade and travel, climate change,\" says Bethan Purse, an ecologist with the UKs Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, an independent not-for-profit research institute.

For decades, India has made much of the fact that it sets great store by its achievements in different fields of science, but that reputation has taken a thorough drubbing in recent weeks. In the time of covid -19, the Indian government has shown an embarrassing readiness to cut corners by allowing teacher Ramdev to launch a medicine for covid -19 and, more worryingly, by seeking to push through a vaccination by conducting clinical trials at breakneck speed. It's true that the world over, governments are feeling the public pressure to develop vaccines to fight the covid -19 pandemic. In turn, there is tremendous political pressure on drug companies to bring a vaccine to market as quickly as possible, not to mention the market pressure from investors who have been throwing money at research firms. That funding came in the wake of premature claims that vaccines would be ready in next to no time, some of the claims coming from top-notch research outfits. In this spiral of hope, hype and anxiety, scientists have been cautioning that there is the risk of releasing therapies and vaccines without due process and care. The scramble over hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir illustrate high-profile instances where governments, primarily the US Administration, have rushed heedlessly when science would have advised caution. At home, there is complete disbelief over the order issued to a dozen hospitals and research institutes by the Indian Council of Medical Research ( icmr), which controls biomedical research in the country, to complete clinical trials on a new vaccine in flat 38 days! The vaccine has been developed by Bharat Biotech of Hyderabad in collaboration with icmr and the National Institute of Virology ( niv), Pune, by taking an inactive strain of sars CoV-2 which cause covid -19 to develop antibodies in those vaccinated. The absurd timeline of completing thousands of clinical trials for safety and efficacy in humans, collating and evaluating the data in just five weeks so that the vaccine can be launched on 15 th August, has provoked many scientists to question the ethics of it. There is much anger and there is criticism of the choice of Independence Day as the vaccine launch date because of its nationalistic overtones. Admittedly, the pandemic has changed many things worldwide, most noticeably in the speed with which vaccines are sought to be developed. Vaccines normally take years to develop, sometimes as long as a decade, but now the pharma industry is hoping to crunch this dramatically to 12-18 months. The US, for instance, has launched Operation Warp Speed which aims to deliver 300 million doses of \"a safe, effective vaccine for covid -19 by January 2021\". The fast-tracking of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is of a piece with the global trend but expecting clinical trials to be completed in just a few weeks for its immunity booster vaccine is clearly an impractical goal that is fraught with risk since it throws scientific norms to the winds. Besides, Bharat Biotech has a penchant for publicity and making tall claims. In February 2016 it announced that it had developed zikavac against the zika virus and that it was the first in the world to file for a global patent for its vaccine candidates. Nothing further has been heard of the vaccine.

Their ability to navigate and fly in darkness has inspired many Batman stories popular among children.

This is far less than the similarity between chimpanzees and humans. The two species of BtCoVs that Indian Council for Medical Research found in Indian Pteropus and Rousettus bats have little similarity to sars-cov-2. Bats are the largest mamma- lian group after rodents, with over 1,300 species making up a quarter of all mammals. They occur on all continents except Antarctica and are particularly diverse in South Asia, with 114 species of insect-eating bats and 14 fruit bats, also known as \"flying foxes\", occurring in India. They roost in large colonies on trees, tree hollows, caves, rock crevices and abandoned man made structures. Bats are diverse in their food preferences, foraging on insects, nectar, fruits, seeds, frogs, fish and small mammals. They play a unique role in maintaining ecosystem structure, making a singular contribution to our food production, economy and well-being. BOON FOR AGRICULTURE Bats are long-distance dispersers; often their feeding ranges up to 20 km from their roosting sites. The diet of fruit-eating bats consists largely of flowers and fruits such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, custard apples, figs, tamarind and many species of forest trees. Therefore, bats play a vital role in seed dispersal and forest regeneration. Studies have shown that seedlings raised from bat dispersed seeds show higher germination and vigorous growth. A study by T Ganesh and Soubadra Devy of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Bengaluru, showed that bats played a significant role as seed dispersers for 21 forest trees in the southern Western Ghats, particularly for trees like Syzigium cumini (commonly known as Malabar plum). Studies have found that bats play a vital role in pollination, mainly of large flowered plants, and in crop protection. Fruit bats (Megachiroptera) being large, require big flowers with copious amounts of nectar. About 29 per cent of all bats depend upon plants for food. Nectar-feeding bats are major pollinators for 528 species of ecologically and economically important plants. Being arboreal mammals, bats are major pollinators of rainforest trees in the Western Ghats, as well as 141 species of fruit trees in the tropics, including economically important species like mahua, neem, wild banana and palms. In Asia and Africa, about 300 economically important plant species rely on bats for pollination and dispersal. Bats are major pollinators for many species of mangroves which are important for coastal ecosystems and local livelihoods. Unfortunately, there have been few quantitative estimates of the contribution of bats to pollination services in agriculture and forests across India, but they are likely to be incalculable. Insects are a major problem for agriculture, destroying up to 26 per cent of the annual production of crops worldwide every year, roughly amounting to $470 billion. Insectivorous bats, which make up 70 per cent of all bat species, are voracious predators of nocturnal insects and crop pests, thus their diversity contributes directly to enhancing crop productivity with tremendous economic impact. For example, a single colony of 150 insectivorous bats in the US has been estimated to eat nearly 1.3 million insects each year, BACK TO CONTENT n Bats are the largest mammalian group after rodents n They are diverse in their food preferences, foraging on insects, nectar, fruits, seeds, frogs, fish and small mammals n Their feeding can range up to 20 km from their roosting sites n They roost in large colonies on trees, tree hollows, caves, rock crevices and abandoned man made structuresspecies of plants depend in nectar-feeding bats for pollination 141 economically important plant species in Asia and Africa rely on bats for pollination and dispersal300 mosquitoes can be consumed in one night by a small bat, which can reduce mosqiuito-borne disease incidence5,000BATS PLAY A UNIQUE ROLE IN MAINTAINING ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE, MAKING A SINGULAR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR FOOD PRODUCTION, ECONOMY AND WELL-BEING BITS ON BATS DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 49 contributing significantly to agricultural pest control. In the Western Ghats, 46 species of bats are insectivorous and forage actively for insects throughout the night, especially along rivers and streams where a number of insects breed. Some large insectivorous bats are also reported to feed on small rodents. Studies have found that bats enhance crop yield consistently across landscape gradients in crops such as corn and cocoa by suppressing crop pests. In the US, the economic value of insectivorous bats connected to the agriculture sector is about $22.9 billion a year. Another study estimates between $3.7 and $53 billion per year in agricultural losses without bats in North America. Bats contribute significantly to soil fertility and nutrient distribution due to their large numbers, high mobility and varied habitats for roosting and foraging. Bat guano (droppings) provides organic input to soil and facilitates nutrient transfer, contributing to soil fertility and agricultural productivity. The practice is harmless vis-a-vis human health. Several species of bats, in fact, contribute to human health by reducing populations of mosquitoes and other insect vectors that spread malaria, dengue, chikungunya and other diseases. It is reported that a small bat may feed on almost 5,000 mosquitoes each and every feeding night far more than other measures adopted to eliminate them. DON'T RESENT BATS Understanding the role played by bats helps us appreciate how their absence can greatly affect all facets of our lives. Viruses don't jump directly from bats or other animals to humans. Rather, illicit trade in wildlife, high levels of hunting of bats for consumption of wild meat, and destruction of natural habitats is responsible for this pandemic by bringing host animals into close contact with humans and amplifying the risks of spillovers. As per the International Union for Conservation of Nature, about 5 per cent of bats are categorised as endangered and another 11 per cent are data deficient. Many more species may be threatened, while a large proportion may be of least concern as far as health risks are involved. Perhaps because of this, all conservation plans ignore bats. Further, some species of fruit bats are categorised under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1973, along with other vermin species like rats, making it difficult to legally conserve them. Bats originated in the early Eocene period of the Earth's history, around 52 million years ago. During this long evolution, their bodies have gained resistance to viruses and other microbes. This immunity derived through co-existence has helped them safely live with pathogens. Hunting and wildlife trade in bats, therefore, ultimately jeopardise our own safety. A more prudent approach is to avoid eating fruits partially eaten by bats and not venturing into caves and closed spaces laden with bat excreta to minimise risks of cross-contamination. However, killing or harming bats diminishes the critical ecological services that they perform for us. The pandemic has demonstrated that conservation of biodiversity and natural habitats is absolutely essential to prevent such events from arising again. A world without bats would not just be poorer, but also unlivable.

In summers it becomes highly erratic. Voltage drops so low that we cannot use any electrical appliance, be it mixer or refrigerator,\" says Ranjesh Kumar, a resident. For Vijith Kumar, who owns a cloth store, such poor power supply means heavy losses. \"Customers usually throng the shop towards evening. That's the time when we face long power outages or low volt - age,\" he adds. Like most other shops and commercial centres in the vil - lage, Vijith initially hired a diesel-run generator for power backup. \"In Lighting the gaps A HYBRID MINI POWER GRID GENERATES HOPE FOR STEADY AND ROUND-THE-CLOCK POWER SUPPLY IN RURAL AREAS PRATHA JHAWAR and KOTI REDDY WEST CHAMPARANBiomass gasifier power plant at the Chanpatia unit of Husk Power ensures steady supplyRELATED STORYBACK TO CONTENT 52 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN Palette /INITIATIVEthe beginning, the owner charged `80 a day as rental. But soon, he raised it to ` 100,\" he says. That's when he decided to break away from the national power grid and join a mini-grid set up in the village by Husk Power Systems, an off-grid utility that generates power entire - ly from renewable energy sources. Though Husk Power has been operating since 2007 and has a net - work of 85 mini-grids across the country and in Tanzania, it set up the utility at Chanpatia in 2017 and with a difference. Unlike most of its other plants that run on solar ener - gy, the Chanpatia plant is a hybrid one that uses a combination of biomass along with solar power. \"Solar photovoltaic is, of course, the cheapest source of energy,\" says Manoj Sinha, co-founder and chief executive officer of Husk Power. However, one can use it only during the day. Some energy can be stored in the battery, but it might not be enough. Besides, batteries are ex - pensive, and one can never get 365 days of sunshine. This gives rise to the need for a second source of pow - er, Sinha explains. So, along with a 40-kW solar PV plant, Husk Power has set up a 25-kW biomass gas power plant that kicks in after sun - set. Engineers at the plant say since the biomass plant can be operated on an as-need basis, it helps the utility provide a steady output and reduces the need for batteries for storage of electricity. Batteries are primarily used for ensuring constant voltage. As of now, Husk Power's bio - mass plant uses rice husk as raw material. Since the village falls in the rice belt of Bihar, where paddy is grown twice a year, feedstock is available in plenty. Husk Power buys it from threshers for ` 1 to ` 4. It, however, says the plant can use other raw materials like wood pallets with slight changes to it.Over the past three years, its consumer base has increased to 100, which includes 60 per cent commercial establishments, 30 per cent households and 10 per cent in - dustries. Though Sinha does not divulge the tariff he charges for the hybrid power, he acknowledges that it is higher than the tariff set by public utilities. Yet, most consum - ers Down To Earth spoke with find it reasonable. Vijith says he now saves over ` 1,000 a month on elec - tricity bills as well as on generator rental. His business runs smoothly due to no power outage. Aman Ku - mar, who also depended on diesel generator for running his welding shop, says his monthly electricity bill has reduced from `5,000 to `3,200 ever since he joined the mini-grid. Besides, says Aman, unlike public utilities Husk Power does not charge extra for providing commercial connection. Primary school Vivekananda Academy is another commercial consumer of Husk Power. Nikhil Kumar Pandey, caretaker of the school, says, it is still connected to the national grid. \"But Husk Power is our major supplier. We do not experience power outages even during the worst monsoon.\" Husk Power has a smart prepaid meter - ing system which reduces electrici - ty theft and helps consumers monitor and manage their electric - ity consumption. Such decentralised solutions play a great role in bridging the gap between the government sup - ply of electricity and customer de - mand. In 2019, the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy, a pro - gramme at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, US, conducted a survey in Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar and Ut - tar Pradesh and found that almost 16 per cent of the 10,000 rural households and 40 per cent of the 2,000 commercial establishments depend on decentralised sources of electricity like diesel generators due to unreliable supply by the national power grid. These are the consumers who can benefit from Husk Power-like mini-grids.

Bitter gourd or Momordica charantia is part of the diet regime suggested to diabetics as it can lower blood sugar levels. Usually, the juice of the raw gourd is used for the purpose. However, the gourd could counteract with diabetes medication and reduce blood sugar levels to dangerously low levels. Pregnant women, too, are advised to avoid it as it can lead to abortions. While most Indians love the bitter taste of this vegetable, some cannot understand why it should be consumed. They use recipes to reduce the bitterness. They boil the gourd and squeeze out the bitterness. Or they peel the gourds and apply salt on them so that it releases the water which can be then squeezed out. It is then prepared whole or stuffed with a mixture of spices. Usually, raw mangoes and dried mango powder are used liberally in these recipes. Chips prepared by frying thin slices of bitter gourd with a sprinkle of chaat masala are very popular. These methods manage to reduce the bitterness a bit, but it cannot be removed completely. It is better to just embrace the bitter - ness and enjoy it. These gourds flood the market during summer season. This is the time to con - sume them as the seeds are soft and don't have to be removed before cooking. Other than the gourd itself, the leaves too are bitter and useful to control blood sugar levels. As the leaves are not as bitter as the gourd, this may be more palatable to people who do not like the taste of the vegetable. Tea prepared from both fresh and dry leaves are quite popular among diabetics. VERSATILE INGREDIENT Its medicinal properties do not take away the fact that the leaves are a versatile ingredient for perking up the plate. In Odisha, the leaves are added to saut\u00e9ed onions and then cooked rice is added to it. The mild bitterness works well with starchy rice. In West Bengal, the leaves are added to the traditional shukto dish when the vegetable is not available. Simi - larly, there are recipes where the leaves are used along with potatoes. The leaves can also be used as stuffing for a paratha . They complement chicken and fish recipes too, and can be used raw in salads or added to boiled dal. I like them with eggs too (see recipe ). The leaves are nutritious and rich in minerals like potas - sium, sodium, calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, manganese and copper, and vitamins like caro - tene, tocopherol, folic acid, cyano - cobalamin and ascorbic acid along with some traces of vitamins B3, B6, D and K. Bitter gourd belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumber, melon and pumpkin. Although the exact origin of Momordica genus is unclear, most experts agree that the centre of domestication was in eastern Asia, possibly eastern India or southern China. Many species of Momordica are endemic to different parts of the country but Momordica charantia is distributed across India, except in the northeast region. Despite the fact that the bitter gourd has been extensively described in Ayurvedic texts, the health benefits have attracted many biopirates who have pat - ented products prepared from this vegetable from our backyards. In 1999, a case of a company run by non-resident Indians patenting the extracts of the gourd for its anti-diabetic properties strength - ened the government's resolve to document the medicinal proper - ties of indigenous plants and share with patent offices around the world. Before this, the US patent office had also given a patent on the wound healing properties of turmeric, which too is prior knowledge as this has been used in India for centuries for this purpose.

The concept that has taken shape over the past decade and is now being jointly promoted by the World Health Organization ( who), Food and Agriculture Organization (fao) and the World Organisation for Animal Health ( oie), recognises that we live in a shared ecosystem. It acknowledges that human health and animal health are interdependent and linked closely to the health of the environment they live in. Thus, there is a need to break down the interdisciplinary barriers that separate human and veterinary medicine from ecological and environmental sciences. However, over the past one decade, with the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases such as h1n1, sars, Ebola, Zika and Nipah that have the potential to cause widespread outbreaks or pandemics, the focus of the One Health approach seems to have been more on the study of zoonotic pathogens, their niche adaptation, epidemiology and transmission. Although One Health recognises the importance of plant pathogens, they somehow remain sidelined. This can be gross negligence as plants are directly and indirectly related to human and animal health. While on the one hand they provide energy and essential nutrients, on the other hand they harbour pathogens like fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes that risk food safety and bio-security. Evidence shows plant diseases often cause large-scale damage 56 DOWN TO EARTH 16-31 JULY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INPalette /OPINION to human health and well-being. Towards the late 19th century, infestation by fungus Phytoph-thora infestans in potato crops led to starvation and deaths of millions of Irish citizens. Though such large-scale infestation has been to a large extent managed with the advent of fungicides, nematicides and other chemicals, contamination of fruits and leafy vegetables by bacteria like Salmonella and Escherichia coli are still a cause of worry. Estimastes show food and water contaminated with these bacteria cause infectious diarrhoea among 3 to 5 billion people across the world every year and are respon-sible for the deaths of nearly 1.5 million people, most of them young children. However, what is important at this juncture is to ask if these pathogens merely exist in plants or do they have a wider host? Is there a possibility of these pathogens to jump from plants to animals? The answers are not straight forward. For a pathogen, the mechanisms involving adaptation, colonisation and virulence are common across hosts, whether it belongs to the plant or the animal kingdom. They overcome the host defence system by disrupting its cell and by producing virulence factors such as toxins or enzymes. The virulence factors then go on to trigger expression or repression of host genes. Plant pathogens have evolved to breach the plant cell wall, a significant physical barrier which the human and animal pathogens have never encountered. Yet, a number of examples exist of pathogens crossing kingdoms. For example, Burkholderia cepacia , which causes pink rot of onions, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which causes bacterial leafspot of tobacco, are reported to cause human cystic fibrosis. Several E coli and Salmonella strains are recently seen to be interacting with plants irrigated with sewage water. One study in the US, published in Frontiers in Microbiology in May 2020, links four multi-state food-borne disease outbreaks between 2013 and 2016 to consumption of fresh cucumbers infested with Salmonella . Though the number of pathogens shared between plants and humans are much less compared to those between animals and humans, many a time plants indirectly play a role in the spread of pathogens harboured by animals. For example, mass flowering of bamboo in India often results in rapid multiplication of rodents that feed on bamboo seeds. Once the seeds are exhausted, they enter human habitations and carry with them bacteria Yersinia pestis that gets easily transmitted to humans and causes plague. The other major concern is the genetically modified (GM) crops, particularly GM food crops, which are developed by biotech companies by the genes of engineered microbes into plants. Increasing numbers of studies point out that people are reporting allergic reactions to some of these GM foods. Besides, there is a possibility that some of the GM dna might move into the human gut bacteria through horizontal gene transfer\u2014movement of genetic material from a bacteria into plants or vice versa as opposed to vertical gene transfer, where the genetic material is transferred from parent to offspring. While there have been limited studies regarding this, increasing amounts of genomic data reveal some cases of horizontal gene transfer not only between the bacteria and the host plant but also between the bacterium and other eukaryotes (organisms such as animals that possess complex cells). A 2019 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science and University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, shows a cross-kingdom transfer of Salmonella from rodents' faeces in the soil to the roots of rockcress (Arabidopsis ) plants. A number of studies show that viruses could act as vectors in this process and also provide the genetic material for horizontal gene transfer to eukaryotic organisms. There is also evidence that GM food and micro rnas can survive digestion, enter the human body and affect gene- expression patterns. While more studies are required to understand the gene transfer systems, it is important to be cautious about the potential ecological impacts. With shared genes, the transmission and sharing of diseases across plant and animal kingdoms will likely become more prevalent in the foreseeable future. Understanding the disease processes and outcomes would help us stay prepared to contain an outbreak just as the current one.

Some decades ago, when farmers spoke of \"disappearances\" of insects and pollinators, they were labelled as anecdotal stories. But they stand confirmed as mass extinction of these useful creatures are already impacting agricultural production negatively. At present, we are hearing some anecdotal stories from farmers in India. Indian villages are presently alive with unusually more residents. It is because millions of informal workers have come back to villages due to the lockdown that caused cessation of economic activities. What are the points of conversation in the villages now? Mostly, they are talking about future livelihoods. And whether they could return to the daily wage jobs in urban areas. If not, then what would they do? From across the country, particularly from states with high informal workers working outside like in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, anecdotal stories are pouring in about people wanting to join back farming. These stories are heartening for the distressed farm sector in the country. It is for a decade now that we have been living with the fact that farmers are quitting agriculture\u20142,000 farmers a day going by the last Census. The latest bulletin on the kharif season from the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare says that coverage area has almost doubled as compared to last year, which was 43.3 million hectares (ha). In the current season, paddy coverage has gone up\u2014 from 4.9 million ha last year to 6.8 million ha this season. States with high returnee worker population like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh besides others are reporting high increase in coverage areas. While this piece of data can't be attributed to people joining back farming with certainty, it does indicate that people have increased acreage due to certain reasons. It may be due to better rainfall, but it could also be due to the availability of labour to take up cultivation in more areas. Conversations with farmers unveil another story. Many say it is just a risk-adoption phenomenon. Farmers who had family members supplementing income by migrating out are now back. And to compensate earning, they are just deploying extra labour. But whether it would lead to a trend of more people joining back farming depends on the results of the current extra deployment of resources on agriculture? It means if they get remunerative returns from farming, people may just stick to it. It is an opportunity; particularly at a time when India has become non-agrarian not only in terms of economic opportunity but also in contribution to the national income. But the opportunity has many challenges; and those are the known ones that have crippled the sector till now. One of them is: how to make farming economically lucrative? Producing more is not an issue anymore as farmers have been giving us our historic bumper foodgrain production for many years now. The problem is to ensure a fair price for them. The idea that a free market would enable a fair price has also helped. This leaves us with the sole solution of giving farmers access to markets with favourable safeguards to trade. Here, the government must stand as the guarantor for farmers. It has to procure, ensure fair price, and assure the market for farmers. This is the opportunity to revive farming in India. The government must declare a new deal for farmers. Farmers need the government more than ever, today. DTE @richiemahaFarming is back The current kharif acreage is impressive.

Certainly not. Countries will now have to wake up to fresh challenges of disposal of the massive quantities of solid and liquid waste generated by the new toilets we have built. How do we prevent this waste from turning into an unmanageable health hazard by seeping into our groundwater and water bodies like lakes and rivers. These challenges are intensified in rural areas, where on-site containment is the only solution. Out-of-the-box thinking on safe containment and management is needed in such areas. The recent Joint Monitoring Progress report flags issues of safely managed sanitation services. The report stresses the need for hygienic toilets and safe management of excreta at each step of the sanitation trajectory\u2014from containment and emptying to conveyance, treatment and, most importantly, reuse. BACKGROUND ABOUT THE TRAINING PROGRAMME Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is organizing a training programme to educate participants on the key topics of faecal sludge management in rural areas. The course comprises of self-study, learning tools such as presentations, audios and videos, featuring case studies. Wherever required, the training will provide online forums for discussion.
