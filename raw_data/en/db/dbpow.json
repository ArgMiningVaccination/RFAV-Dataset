The Solocarbon 3-in-1 is the only sauna heater on the market that can provide all three infrared wavelengths in one place. The infrared spectrum consists of near (NIR), mid (MIR), and far (FIR) waves, each with distinct characteristics and frequency ranges. It's impossible to deliver these three peak wavelengths at one time from a single source. That's why Sunlighten developed a unique technology that combines three heating elements in one sauna heater. All heaters must be covered as a standard safety hazard precaution. Sunlighten provides non-toxic and highly emissive carbonized bamboo as a protective cover on our Solocarbon\u00ae heating technology, having our customer's ultimate comfort & safety in mind! what are the benefits?
