Goldstein, MA, MD, PhD, FAAP Vice Chancellor for Health AffairsDistinguished Professor, Departments of Pediatrics, Physiology & Biophysics, and Pharmaceutical Sciences The Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences, UCI Health, and the UCI Centers and Institutes of Health - all together UCI Health Affairs - spearheaded an extraordinary response to the pandemic. Reaching across the county and the country, our basic and translational research, work with public healthcare agencies, and clinical trials were at the forefront, for example, leading the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to share our AI-driven optimal patient care model for the \"101st patient\" nationwide. Our physicians, nurses, pharmacists, population health, and integrative health providers mobilized to confront the health and societal impacts of COVID-19. From speedily advancing diagnostics and treatments at the molecular level into practice, partnering with the local community to mitigate the spread of disease and support of the most vulnerable, and standing up robust telehealth offerings across almost all specialties, we acted as one to protect and serve. At the same time, our pioneering plans for growth continued. We broke ground on the new UCI Medical Center - Irvine that will bring world-class care to south Orange County, recruiting more top talent and creating great jobs. Anchors of this complex on the north edge of the main campus on Jamboree Road are the Chao Family Ambulatory Surgery and Cancer Center, the Center for Advanced Care, and a 144-bed hospital, which will open in phases between 2023 and 2025. These state- of-the-art facilities are designed with sustainability in mind to support the wellbeing of humans and the planet. And in the first quarter of the 2021- 22 year, we announced exciting new initiatives, including a $30 million naming gift from Prof. Robert A. Mah and Dr. Adeline Yen Mah for the 200,000 square foot Falling Leaves Foundation Medical Innovation building. To open in 2025, it will empower the cross-disciplinary basic and translational research achievements that keep UCI Health Affairs at the innovative cusp of discoveries that improve lives. It is my pleasure - on behalf of UCI Health Affairs - to share this annual impact report to highlight just a few of the marvelous array of pioneering breakthroughs transforming wellness and healthcare for our loved ones and generations to come. This year has shown how the virtuous cycle of discovery, teaching and healing in a university-based health system has no peer. I could not be any prouder of the passion and achievements of the people who are UCI Health Affairs.

Leopold chair in the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, Krzysztof Palczewski, PhD, the Department of Ophthalmology and UCI, led a new study showing the restoration of retinal and visual functions of mice models suffering from inherited retinal disease. The study used CRISPR technology and will serve as foundation for the new therapeutic modality for a wide range of inherited ocular diseases caused by different gene mutations. UCI researchers work on preemptive vaccine for all coronaviruses Through a multimillion-dollar grant from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Lbachir BenMohamed, PhD, School of Medicine Professor and Director, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Ophthalmology, and his colleagues are developing a preemptive vaccine that could thwart a new coronavirus before it got a chance to spread to humans. BenMohamed's lab examined more than 20 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that the immune systems reacts to each one of them in different ways. Their pan-coronavirus vaccine focuses on epitopes \u2014 parts of viral proteins that evoke immune responses \u2014 from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, four of the most typical viruses that produce the common cold, as well as several animal coronaviruses, including those in bats. Results have been promising, showing that laboratory animals have produced T-cells and antibodies in reaction to the many prototype pan-coronavirus vaccine candidates. If the vaccine is successful in providing preemptive protection against all coronaviruses, this multi-epitope method may be a useful approach for a variety of illnesses.UCI researcher Lbachir BenMohamed and team are exploring alternative distribution methods for a pan-coronavirus vaccine, including a patch which could reach more of the public. Immune organoids can be produced from human tonsil tissues, spleen, and lymph nodes. These organoids respond appropriately to influenza vaccines and viruses.UCI researcher wins Wellcome Leap grant to improve vaccine design Lisa Wagar, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Physiology & Biophysics at UCI School of Medicine, was awarded a grant by the Wellcome Leap Fund to study human tonsil organoids. The focus of her lab is translational human immunology and using organoids to understand the complex interactions that occur between immune cells upon vaccination and infection in humans.Therapeutic effects of cilantro A new study led by Professor Geoffrey Abbott and published in FASEB Journal uncovered the underlying science of herbs, including cilantro, in delaying seizures common in epilepsy and other diseases. Cilantro has traditionally been used as an anticonvulsant treatment, and now we understand the molecular mechanisms behind this. UCI scientists found that the molecular action of cilantro is a potent KCNQ potassium channel activator that reduces neuronal excitability that leads to seizure activity. Dodecenal, a specific component of cilantro, binds to a part of the potassium channels to open them and this opening reduces cellular excitability. This discovery has the potential to drive new treatments. 14 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 15 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Digital model of community- centered care, collaboration with Computer Science UCI Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing Assistant Professor Amir M. Rahmani, PhD, has been awarded a National Science Foundation planning grant to establish a model of digital community-centered care. Current community-centered care models are inefficient, costly, and are not scalable. Community-centered care models rely on caregivers to provide crucial services to the elderly, disabled, and other vulnerable populations. Registered nurses supervise the caregivers. The goal of this research is to transform the current system into one that is efficient, automated, and scalable. This grant will help fund much needed community-focused research, establish a community advisory board, conduct focus groups to identify concerns and barriers, and conduct feasibility workshops and need assessments to evaluate progress. Having affordable technology allows health systems to better serve vulnerable or rural populations and connects healthcare providers to communities in most need. Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing Nurse moral injury study, collaboration with Department of Psychological Science Faculty and one student within the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing received research grants from the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTS) as part of its Campus-Community Research Incubator Program to study how COVID-19 has impacted nurses. Assistant Professor Candace Burton, nursing PhD student Danisha Jenkins, and Alyson Zalta, assistant professor in the UCI Department of Psychological Science, are using this grant to study the impact of moral challenges nurses are facing during the COVID pandemic and their potential contribution to professional turnover. The pandemic has taken a tremendous toll on frontline nurses, and many are directly involved in caring for COVID patients. Issues of insufficient supplies, illness among staff, and increased acuity in patient populations have all taken their toll. Burton, Jenkins and Alta's study aims to uncover the differences between the core responsibilities of the school nurse before COVID and their additional COVID functions, better understand moral injury linkages, and help establish the infrastructure for joint nursing research. Graduated our first cohort in the Doctor of Nursing practice (DNP) program, Pat Patton and Ashley Plummer The inaugural cohort of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program graduated this summer, prepared to continue their impactful leadership and work. Included in this cohort is Ashley Plummer, DNP , WHNP , who studied the impact of a text-based partner notification service designed to slow the spread of adolescent chlamydia in Denver, where it is the most common sexually transmitted infection. When a person is diagnosed with chlamydia in her clinic, their partners are notified via text message and provided with resources for treatment. Pat Patton, DNP , has a storied career as a nurse, from serving in the armed forces to executive nursing positions. That experience helped him understand the value of nursing to patient care and outcomes, and the human element nurses bring to healthcare. A top nursing executive at the University of California, San Francisco, Patton's dedication to patient care has brought him to the pinnacle of his nursing career and serves as a model example of leadership in nursing. Center for Nursing Philosophy Associate Professor Miriam Bender is bringing together an international community of nursing philosophers in a quest to define nursing practice, in her role as director of the Center for Nursing Philosophy, the first in the United States. It is no easy feat. \" Ask any nurse to define nursing. They'll tell you an amazing story, but you won't get a definition,\" she says. By developing concepts and discourse, Bender hopes the community can contribute to the understanding of nursing's unique potency. A firm believer in empowering nurses to take aim for the highest of aspirations, Patton is always looking for ways to push nurses beyond what they thought could be possible.16 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 17 2020/21 Annual Impact Report School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences UCI launches School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences The University announced the establishment of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, as part of its prescription to change 21st-century health. This is the first public pharmacy school in the Los Angeles-Orange County region and a pillar of UCI's expanding Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. The school spans a continuum, from discovery, development, and delivery of new drugs, devices, and diagnostics, all the way to optimizing medication therapy in patients and patient populations.$1.25 million gift leads to unexpected discoveries in cancer therapeutics Professor Young Jik Kwon was introduced to the Research and Development team at PharmaResearch through a mutual friend in 2015. Until then, PharmaResearch was focused on exploring DNA as biomaterials for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications, mainly with the goal of advancing regenerative medicine. In what came as a surprise to Kwon, PharmaResearch expressed commitment to this new research direction with a $1.25 million gift. A five-year research collaboration with UCI's BioTherapeutics Engineering Laboratory (BioTEL), led by Kwon, quickly ensued. The collaboration resulted in a potentially effective, manufacturing-enabled nanoscale formulation of one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics, based on the company's DNA and BioTEL 's nanomedicine technology. Schizophrenia: nurture cannot overcome nature UCI research led by Amal Alachkar, associate professor of teaching in pharmaceutical sciences, found that too much of a certain amino acid in utero caused schizophrenia in mice despite the quality of postpartum caregiving. The study suggests that the same would be true with humans. The pups with excess methionine showed signs of schizophrenia, and those without it did not. The results undermine the idea that nurture can avert schizophrenia. The results also noted that the offspring that did not receive the extra amino acid were not endangered. These findings may open the door for scientists to develop a drug to stop these genetic changes from happening early in life. The goal would be to create pharmaceuticals to treat, cure or - ideally - prevent schizophrenia. The translational science possibilities are also being considered for other mental health diseases such as Alzheimer's and autism. The early intervention aspect of this research study will certainly inform future studies that go beyond treating schizophrenia to preventing it all together. This is the first public pharmacy school in the Los Angeles-Orange County region and a pillar of UCI's expanding Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. 18 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 19 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Program in Public Health Future School of Population and Public Health Antibody screening finds COVID-19 nearly 7 times more prevalent in O.C. than thought In October 2020, data from a UCI-based COVID-19 antibody screening study showed seven times the amount of COVID-19 was present among Orange County residents than previously thought. To conduct the screening UCI partnered with marketing firm LRW Group to recruit a representative sample of residents, as well as with the Orange County Health Care Agency. The screenings were conducted using the UCI-developed imaging platform, highly sensitive technology that allowed researchers to identify whether participants had contracted COVID-19. Doctoral student Anqi Jiao selected as one of seven UCI Solutions that Scale Graduate Fellows for work on impacts of heat exposure on pregnancy outcomes Leading the way on linking climate science with health, PhD student Anqi Jiao, was chosen as the Solutions that Scale Graduate Fellow from Public Health. Her PhD advisor is Jun Wu, a professor of environmental and occupational health. Her study: \"Impact of Heat Exposure on Pregnancy Outcomes: Climate Adaptation by Modifiable Built Environment Factors,\" focuses on extreme heat events due to climate change and their association with health outcomes including preterm birth and severe maternal morbidity. It also looks at the impact of climate adaptation factors such as green space and the potential for them to reduce preterm birth and severe maternal morbidity incidences. UC Irvine workshop trains residents in COVID-19 hot spots to do contact tracing To address barriers in access to care and critical health information among OC residents, UCI partnered with Orange County Health Care Agency and community organizations to host a four-week contact tracing workshop. Designed with a fundamental focus on health equity, the workshop worked directly with community members to train a workforce of OC residents, students, and public health practitioners to conduct contact tracing. The result was an increase in the number of contact tracers and a better understanding of the spread of the virus across the community. Additionally, this workshop was the foundation for the current campus contact tracing program that continues to serve the UCI communityCalifornia wildfires disproportionately affect elderly and poor residents, UCI study finds As California's wildfire burn area has increased by more than 23,000 acres per year over the past two decades, the number of people who have been adversely affected has nearly doubled, according to a paper published recently in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health . UCI researchers show that elderly and low-income residents have suffered a disproportionate share of the fires' impacts. UCI scientists analyzed the fire frequency and areas burned by wildfires across all census tracts in California over the last 20 years. Between 1980 and 1999, catastrophic wildfires happened an average of 1.5 times per decade. From 2000 to 2019, incidents increased to seven per 10-year period. Cumulative costs jumped from $10 billion to $75 billion over the two-time spans, as noted in the study. A large portion of these expenses have fallen on people who can least afford them, and victims have often suffered from smoke-related health problems, psychological stress and direct physical injury. Rural areas sustained more wildfire damage than other parts of the states, while these areas also happen to be characterized by higher poverty rates, unemployment, and a greater proportion of low-income residents without college degrees. While lower proportions of minority residents tended to reside in high-impact census tracts, an exception was for Native Americans, who were over three times more concentrated in such areas. This work sheds light on the state's most vulnerable and bolsters calls for enhanced aid and recovery efforts in regions hardest hit by wildfires, as well as it highlighting the importance of forest management and other fire-prevention strategies. It also underscores the effects of climate change coming into direct contact with environmental injustice that touches socioeconomically vulnerable communities and emphasizes the necessity for policymakers and officials in state agencies to consider elderly and low-income individuals when allocating funds for wildfire prevention resources.20 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 21 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute Wellbeing Initiative Integrative NursingWith nurses now trained at the hospital, patients have reported 42% less nausea, 20% better sleep and 12% less anxiety. When the COVID-19 outbreak first surfaced, UCI Health was at the forefront in providing cutting-edge care for patients while actively advancing research. The Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute (SSIHI) responded by launching the Wellbeing Initiative, which was developed to provide support to UCI Health frontline healthcare workers. Soon after the program launched, it was expanded campuswide, and offered to all UCI faculty and staff. In the first year, SSIHI hosted more than 4,400 virtual visits including topics on one mindfulness, mindfulness-based stress reduction courses, nutrition consults, guided acupressure, yoga and massage, stress management, and educational livestream webinars \u2014 all at no cost to the faculty and staff. With the success of the program, in July 2021 SSIHI extended the Wellbeing Initiative Program to offer services to UC Care Members (more than 45,000 individuals) across all 10 of the University of California campuses through a partnership with the University of California Office of the President. UC Care members will be able to participate in virtual wellbeing services such as acupressure, nutritional counselling, biofeedback, yoga, massage, mindfulness meditation, and other services.Empowered by the wealth of health information around them, patients now expect more from their health providers and treatment options. Founded in September 2020 and the first of its kind nationwide, the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute's Integrative Nursing program aims to address the growing patient demand for tailor-made therapies and treatment, empowering nurses with new tools for integrative nursing care designed to promote nursing acts of compassion and the utilization of gentle, non-pharmacologic approaches to symptom management. The broad adoption of integrative clinical aromatherapy, acupressure, mind-body therapies (such as guided imagery, meditation, breathwork) into nursing practice at UCI has enhanced the patient and family-centered, relationship-based model of nursing care at UCI. Documentation tools for capturing healing practices and patient responses to integrative nursing care have been implemented, and real-time analysis of patient outcomes and cost of nursing care is creating a pathway to develop new knowledge about evidenced-based integrative nursing practices and disseminated what is learned in nursing literature and at professional nursing conferences. With nurses now trained at the hospital, patients have reported 42% less nausea, 20% better sleep and 12% less anxiety.22 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 23 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Research Centers and Institutes of Health Precision Health Institute UCI's Precision Health through Directed AI, led by Professor Leslie Thompson, provides a platform of cross-disciplinary teams dedicated to solving specific health needs. Using new technologies, vast amounts of individual health data, and deep clinical and research expertise - powered by artificial intelligence - UCI experts are working to develop individualized treatments for a myriad of diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. This program aims to have a truly transformational impact on integrating artificial intelligence in providing next-level healthcare. Priority areas include developing clinical tools and funding pilot projects for clinicians and patients, using machine learning to identify disease markers to develop patient-specific brain and cancer therapies, and training the next generation of health-directed science and medical leaders. The initiative also provided support during the coronavirus crisis. Using UCI Health electronic patient data with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, experts are creating predictive models to estimate disease progression and identify individuals who might need escalated care. Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center UCI-Led multidisciplinary team develops transplant biomaterial for Type 1 diabetes that doesn't trigger immune response Using stem cell technology, UCI scientists were able to create a biomaterial for pancreatic islet transplants for long-term treatment for Type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune reaction that destroys pancreatic islets' beta cells. The treatment is especially notable for its ability to avoid producing an immune response in the body. This hybrid alginate will potentially offer a long-term treatment for Type 1 diabetes. Development of the treatment was led by Jonathan Lakey, PhD, professor of surgery and biomedical engineering at UCI. Lakey also co-developed a method of pancreatic islet transplant for Type 1 diabetes called the \"Edmonton protocol,\" which this new promising treatment builds off. Institute for Clinical and Translational Science This year UCI's Institute for Clinical & Translational Science (ICTS), led by Dr. Dan Cooper, was pivotal in keeping staff and students safe throughout the pandemic. By turning real-time science into medical best practices they were able to disseminate clear and accessible guidelines. The ICTS was responsible for creating guidance in partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics Orange County Chapter, and Children's Health of Orange County for mask exemptions for children. As well, the ICTS put together a \"Symptom Decision Tree\" to help decide whether their symptomology was indicative of COVID-19 and if so what steps to take. Aside from protecting the Orange County community, ICTS also publicized their research on the implications of vaccine testing and trials in children, which was published in the International Pediatric Research journal. This research was critical to helping the world understand what was needed to successfully vaccinate children in 2021. 24 Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences 25 2020/21 Annual Impact Report Research Centers and Institutes of Health Groundbreaking Research The Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, led by Dr. Richard Van Etten, offers the most advanced patient care, including a bench-to-bedside approach to translating the research of Cancer Center scientists into the clinic, where new treatment approaches and devices are tested in patients. These early-phase clinical trials offer Orange County patients access to the very latest advances in cancer care. A key part of this translation process are the Cancer Center's Disease-Oriented Teams, multidisciplinary groups of cancer specialists who partner with cancer scientists to move discoveries through the pipeline. Vice Dean for Clinical Research and neuro-oncologist Dr. Daniela Bota's multipronged attack against the aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multiforme reflects the Center's comprehensive approach. Dr. Bota's work on the experimental drug marizomib has generated significant national attention and hope. Unlike traditional chemotherapy drugs, marizomib can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and inhibit brain cancer growth, and is currently being evaluated in an international clinical trial.

Innovation in basic and translational research where UCI advances discovery to improve knowledge and care, and create the diverse workforce of the future. II. Health Equity Our approach to equity demands that we identify, rectify and prevent health disparities, and educate a diverse healthcare workforce to serve diverse communities. Achieving this priority requires advances in discovery, teaching and healing. III. Precision Health We create healthcare that is optimal for individuals and for communities through the collection, analysis and use of data in an ongoing manner. In this way, the outcome for every patient is the best possible while advancing the quality of care for the next patient.UCI Health Affairs ONE HEALTH Vision These strategic priorities are being carried out through our Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences, our UCI Health medical care system, and our research centers and institutes. UCI will continue to strive for excellence and advance integrated patient care, discovery and education to benefit Orange County, the region, state and nation.\"Our first-of-its-kind model of collaboration across health disciplines throughout the whole of UCI Health Affairs, and the UCI campus, powers our ability to carry out our mission to Discover.
