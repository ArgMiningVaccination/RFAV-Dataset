Sources for Additional a committee of practitioners and others involved with drug court program operations was established under the leadership of the National Association of DrugCourt Professionals (NADCP). The committee wasauthorized to identify the critical elements of drug courtprograms to serve as the foundation for later drug courtprogram development. As a result of the committee'sefforts\u2014 Defining Drug Courts: The Key Components \u2014 was published by the Drug Courts Program Office (now part of the Bureau of Justice Assistance [BJA]) in 1997and has served as the framework for drug courtdevelopment and operational activities in state courts.This document focused primarily on the development ofadult drug court programs. As tribal drug courts (known generally as \"Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts\" or simply \"wellnesscourts\") have developed, it became clear that therewasaneed to adapt this 1997 publication of the Key Components for state courts to more specifically addressthe critical issues and challenges faced by Tribal Healingto Wellness Courts. Consequently, this publication\u2014 Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts: The Key Components \u2014 was designed to provide suggested \"key components\" and recommended practices needed for Indian Nationsand tribal justice systems to consider as they design,develop, and implement adult drug courts that meet theneeds of their individual communities. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts: The Key Components was developed by the Tribal Law and Policy Institute in close collaboration and consultation with the TribalAdvisory Committee for the Tribal Healing to WellnessCourts and with the funding and support of the U.S.Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. TheTribal Advisory Committee is a diverse group of Tribal Healing to Wellness court practitioners and othersinvolved with Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts (a list ofTribal Advisory Committee members is provided at theend of this publication). The primary developers of this publication were five members of the Tribal AdvisoryCommittee\u2014Cindy Haro, Judge Joseph Flies-Away,PatSekaquaptewa, Jerry Gardner and Janna Walker. Tribal Law & Policy Institute consultant Kristen Law provided extensive editorial assistance. This publication is organized around ten key components, adapted for Indian Nations and tribal justicesystems, which describe the basic elements that defineTribal Healing to Wellness Courts. The purpose of each key component is explained, followed by several recommended practices that give guidance forimplementing each component. The Tribal Advisory Committee intends for the key components and recommended practices presented inthis publication to be aspirational, generally describingthe best practices, designs, and operations of wellnesscourts. The committee acknowledges, however, that localfunding and resources, political, operational, and otherissues will not permit every Native communityestablishing a Tribal Healing to Wellness Court to adoptall aspects of these guidelines. Moreover, tribal customand tradition may also guide an individual community todevelop a wellness court that does not strictly followthese guidelines. Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor the Tribal Law & Policy Institute intends that the recommendedpractices offered here serve as a certification orregulatory checklist for tribal grantees. Because wellnesscourts will be implemented differently in eachcommunity, the recommended practices are meant toserve as a practical, yet flexible framework fordeveloping effective wellness courts in vastly differentjurisdictions and to provide a structure for conductingresearch and evaluation for program accountability andeffectiveness.PrefaceviiIntroduction The drug court movement began in the late 1980s in response to the growing number of drug-related court cases, the higher rates of recidivism for drug involveddefendants, and the resulting overcrowded jails andprisons. The standard law enforcement and correctionspolicies alone were not having the impact on drug supplyand demand that the proponents of the \"War AgainstDrugs\" had hoped. The drug court approach departedfrom the standard court approach for disposing of thesecases by systematically bringing drug treatment to thecriminal justice population entering the court system.While in the past, courts had referred selected offenders\"out\" to treatment as a condition of probation, in thedrug court, treatment is anchored in the authority of thejudge who holds the defendant or offender personallyand publicly accountable for treatment progress. A drug court is a special court docket to which cases involving alcohol and other substance abusing offendersare assigned for intensive supervision and treatment.Drug court programs bring the full weight of allinterveners (judge, prosecutor, defense counsel,substance abuse treatment specialists, probation officer,law enforcement and correctional personnel, educationaland vocational experts, community leaders and others) tobear, forcing the offender to confront his or hersubstance abuse problem. The drug court conceptinvolves leveraging the coercive power of the criminaljustice system to achieve abstinence and alter criminalbehavior through the combination of intensive judicialsupervision, treatment, mandatory drug testing,incentives, escalating sanctions, case management, andstrong aftercare programs. The design and structure of drug court programs are developed at the local level, to reflect the uniquestrengths, circumstances and capacities of eachcommunity. Many sectors of the community areintegrally involved in the planning and implementationprocess of a drug court system, including: criminaljustice, substance abuse treatment, law enforcement,educational and vocational entities and community anti-drug organizations.The drug court concept is not new to Indian Nations and tribal justice systems. In fact, it is very much in keepingwith the traditional justice process in many Nativecommunities. Major efforts to develop tribal drug courtshave been underway since 1997. According to the Officeof Justice Programs Drug Court Clearinghouse andTechnical Assistance Project, there are currently thirty operational Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts. Fiftyadditional Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are in theplanning stages. 1 In July 1999, the Tribal Law and Policy Institutedeveloped a publication with the funding and supportof the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of JusticePrograms entitled Healing to Wellness Courts: A Preliminary Overview of Tribal Drug Courts. The Preliminary Overview provides a description of TribalHealing to Wellness Courts and addresses critical issuesand challenges relevant to the implementation of TribalHealing to Wellness Courts. These include: the role ofthe Native community, the role of tribal custom andtradition, addressing specific alcohol and drug issues,and addressing jurisdiction and resource issues. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) with the funding and support of the U.S.Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs alsodeveloped a publication in 1999 entitled Tribal Mentor Courts that describes the initial three Tribal Healing to Wellness mentor courts. These tribal mentor courts are as follows: Poarch Creek Indian Drug Court AlternativeCourt in Fort PeckCommunity Wellness Program in Poplar, Montana.The Hualapai Tribal Wellness Court in Peach Springs,Arizona has since been added as a fourth tribal mentorcourt. A Tribal Healing to Wellness Court is not simply a tribal court that handles alcohol or other drug abuse cases. It is,rather, a component of the tribal justice system thatincorporates and adapts the wellness court concept to meet the specific substance abuse needs of each tribalIntroductionviiiTribal Healing to Wellness Courts community. It therefore provides an opportunity for each Native community to address the devastation of alcoholor other drug abuse by establishing more structureand higher level of accountability for these cases andoffenders through a system of comprehensivesupervision, drug testing, treatment services, immediatesanctions and incentives, team-based case management,and community support. Tribal wellness courts face a number of unique issues and challenges not generally encountered by state drugcourt systems. Consequently, the development of tribalwellness courts has required special strategies that haveemerged during the course of program planning andimplementation. Because tribal wellness courts arerelatively new and evolving, they are continuallyadapting to meet the needs of their target populationsand their communities. Healing to Wellness Courts, in effect, contribute to the on-going community and nation building process ofIndigenous tribal governments. As each Tribal(Indigenous) Nation can only be as strong and steadfastas its citizens and families, Healing to Wellness Courtshelp to put misguided individuals back on track, on to ahealing to wellness journey. Each tribal community andnation must define and describe the nature of thishealing journey. Its direction and pathway must beguided by each Indian Nation's culture, tradition,common practices and vision.Key Component 1 Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts bring together community-healing resources with the tribal justice process, using a team approach to achieve the physical and spiritual healing of the participant and the well being of the community. Healing to Wellness Courts bring the collective impact of the Healing to Wellness Court team with thecombined efforts of community leaders compellingthe participant to confront his or her substance abuseproblem. Once the participant is accepted into theprogram (through plea agreement or other means), theteam's focus is on the participant's healing journey torecovery and law abiding behavior. Each team member performs an essential role in a participant's healing and in promoting wellness inthe community. In this cooperative\u2014rather thanadversarial\u2014process, the court may choose to drawfrom local traditional restorative, reparative, orpeacemaking concepts of justice to promote individualand community wellness. For example, some Healingto Wellness Courts have the assistance of communityelders or other community dispute resolution authoritiesin the judicial role, as part of a judicial panel, or as ateam member. A typical court team may include, but is not limited to, the judge, a case manager, an alcohol and other drugtreatment provider, a human services provider, andprobation or other law enforcement officer. SomeHealing to Wellness Courts function successfullywithout regular involvement of prosecutors or defensecounsel. A key to successfully implementing a Healingto Wellness Court is developing a plan that identifieswho will perform essential tasks based on existingand/or emerging community resources and local tribalnorms and customs. Recommended Practices 1. Planning should be carried out by a broad-based group, including persons representing all aspects ofthe tribal criminal justice system, the local treatmentThe overall goal of Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts is the healing of individuals, families, and communities by directing participants onto a healingjourney. Specifically, wellness courts aspire to reducethe abuse of alcohol and other drugs and drug relatedcriminal activity in a tribal community. Wellness courtspromote recovery through a coordinated communitybased response to an individual offender's dependenceon alcohol and other drugs. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are developed at the local level to reflect the unique strengths, circumstancesand capacities of each community. Many individualsand organizations are integrally involved in the planningand implementation process of a drug court system,including: criminal justice, substance abuse and mentalhealth treatment, police, social services, schools,traditional healers, elders, education and employmententities, and other community organizations. Thecombined energies of these individuals andorganizations can assist and encourage offenders toaccept help that could change their lives. Tribal justice systems and tribal treatment providers have historically worked independently from oneanother and with different target populations. TheHealing to Wellness Court provides an opportunity forthem to come together to meet the specialized needs ofoffenders with alcohol or other drug abuse issues. The criminal justice system has the unique ability to influence a person shortly after a significant triggeringevent such as arrest, and thus can convince that person to begin his or her healing journey through a structuredtreatment process. Research indicates that a personcoerced to enter treatment by the criminal justice systemis likely to do as well as one who volunteers fortreatment. 2 12Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts programs, tribal leaders, elders, and other local community policymakers. 2. Traditional healing and dispute resolution authorities should be included in the decision making process andtraditional values should be carefully considered in thedevelopment and ongoing modification of the Healing toWellness Court. 3. The team members should work collectively to develop and implement a holistic approach to thephysical and spiritual healing of the offender and thewell being of the community. 4. Tribal justice and healing departments and agencies should maintain ongoing communication, includingfrequent exchanges of timely and accurate informationabout the participant's overall program performance. Inmany Healing to Wellness Courts, the teams havemeetings (often called case staffings) just before aparticipant's court appearance (referred to as a statushearing or compliance hearing) to ensure that the neededinformation is available. The case manager, probationofficer, or another team member may have theresponsibility to collect information from serviceproviders working with each participant prior to thismeeting. 5. For consistency and stability in the early stages of Healing to Wellness Court operations, it isrecommended that the core planning and implementationteam members remain with the wellness court programfor a sufficient period of time to build a sense ofteamwork and to reinforce a nonadversarial atmosphere. 6. In order to ensure mutual respect, prompt andconsistent meeting of responsibilities, and communityrecognition of the professional integrity of the court andits team members, methods of shared decision makingand conflict resolution among Healing to Wellness Courtteam members should be established such as writtenprotocols, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), andinter-agency agreements. 7. Regularly scheduled meetings should be established to evaluate and modify the healing to wellness processbased on past experiences. 8. Documents defining the Healing to Wellness Court's mission, goals, eligibility criteria, operating procedures,and performance measures should be collaborativelydeveloped, reviewed, and agreed upon by the planninggroup. Planning groups may choose to keep theirgoverning bodies informed by including tribal leaders onthe team or by making regular presentations to the tribalgovernment about the progress in developing thewellness court. 9. Ongoing interdisciplinary education should be provided for every person involved in planning andimplementing the wellness court to develop a sharedunderstanding of the values, goals, and operatingprocedures of both the treatment and justice systemcomponents. This should include familiarizing teammembers with community customs and traditions foraddressing an individual's behavior when it is not inaccordance with local standards.3Referrals of potential participants into the Healing to Wellness Court may take place at different points in the legal system. The referral may be made: Before charges are filed in a criminal matter or for violation of a tribal ordinance (pre-trial); After charges are filed but before any plea is entered or finding of guilt is made (pre-adjudication), or After the plea or finding of guilt (post-adjudication). If there is a pre-adjudication referral, the Healing to Wellness Court may require the participant to sign a statement admitting to the facts which support thecriminal charges (often referred to as an \"admission offacts\"). This admission assists in a later prosecution of the participant if the requirements of the Healing toWellness Court are not completed. If the referral is post- adjudicatory, typically a Court will set aside, or vacate,any sentence that has been imposed and dismiss thecharges if the participant successfully completes thewellness program. In determining the eligibility of an offender for the Healing to Wellness Court, the team balances: Improving the chance of eliminating future criminal behavior and substance abuse by fast entry into thewellness court process with; The practical problems of postponing or delaying a prosecution in their regular court process. Police officers, probation officers, social workers, counselors or others may submit \"referral forms\" to a court intake officer, clerk, or case manager requestingthat an individual be placed in the Healing to WellnessCourt. Defense attorneys, prosecutors or presentingofficers may submit \"motions to admit and transfer\" a defendant into the Healing to Wellness Court. A judge onhis or her own motion may also issue a \"general courtorder\" ordering an individual to be admitted into the Wellness Court. Tribal criminal courts may accept a \"stipulated agreement\" signed by the parties by issuing a \"stipulated order\" admitting a defendant into the Healing to Wellness Court. These are orders based on anagreement between the defendant and prosecutor wherethe defendant admits to the facts underlying thecharges\u2014in essence pleading guilty. The parties agree tothe continued jurisdiction of the criminal court while thedefendant participates in the Healing to Wellness CourtProgram, and in the event that such person is terminatedfrom the Wellness Court, the prosecutor may pursue theoriginal charge in the criminal court. Alternatively, wherethe person successfully completes the Wellness CourtProgram, the defendant is allowed to withdraw his or herguilty plea and the prosecutor will dismiss the charge. Healing to Wellness Courts use a variety of written notices, agreements, waivers, questionnaires and forms togather information, to protect participant rights and toallow for the sharing of information about the participantto assist in his or her successful treatment. Thesedocuments also serve the crucial purpose of documentingthe requirements of federal and tribal law. Some of thesedocuments may include \"information collection forms or commercial treatment questionnaires\" that gather basic information such as a participant's full name,contact information, family history, employment history,financial background, criminal history, and the nature and extent of the individual's substance use and abuse; awellness court \"participation agreement\" where the participant agrees to report for a clinical assessment, tosign and participate in the individualized treatment plan,to attend required status or compliance hearings, classes,counseling sessions, groups and other activities, to bealcohol and drug tested, to sign a release of informationform, and that the agreement was undertaken freely andvoluntarily without being under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and a \"release of information form\" to allowKEY COMPONENT 2 Participants enter the wellness court program through various referral points and legal procedures while protecting their due process rights.4Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts wellness court team members to share information about the participant in order to assist him or her in thesuccessful completion of the wellness court process. Some tribal wellness teams have found it useful to enter into \"tribal inter-agency agreements\" specifying each agency's commitment to the overall goals of the Healingto Wellness Court Program and the specific obligations,duties, and funding commitments of each agency in thefurtherance of successful wellness program operations. In many communities, tribal members are often prosecuted for offenses committed off-reservation.Consequently, a Healing to Wellness Court may allow forentry into the process based on charges and referral fromanother jurisdiction. In these cases, formal agreements or \"Memorandums of Understanding\" (MOUs) are often entered into between the jurisdictions specifying whatinformation is shared and how the referral process iscoordinated. A tribe's constitution, laws, and court rules will also be important sources for the team in designing Healing toWellness Court policies and procedures consistent withexisting tribal law and values. For tribes that are concurrently developing criminal courts and courts ofgeneral civil jurisdiction, the wellness court planningprocess may include additional tasks such as drafting atribal code or ordinance to define the power andauthority of the wellness court, to adopt special policiesand procedures, to define which behaviors by offendersfall within the scope of the wellness court, and to identify any particular individual rights protected byexisting tribal and applicable federal laws. Recommended Practices 1. Prosecutors, presenting officers and defense counsel, if available, should participate in the design of screening, eligibility, and case processing policies and procedures toguarantee that due process rights and public safety needsare served. The continuing role and the nature of the roleof prosecutors, presenting officers and defenders in thedaily operations of the Healing to Wellness Court shouldbe discussed with all team members and mutually agreedupon.

Team members should perform the following range of tasks: review particular cases and determine if the defendant or juvenile is eligible for the drug court program(legal screening); determine if the defendant or juvenile will benefit from the treatment and other therapeutic activitiesavailable (clinical screening); file all necessary legal documents; review the arrest warrant, affidavits, charging document, and all other relevant information, andprogram documents (e.g., waivers, writtenagreements); advise the offender as to the nature and purpose of the drug court, the rules governing participation, theconsequences of failing to abide by the rules, and howparticipating or not participating in the drug court willaffect his or her interests; explain all of the rights that the offender will temporarily or permanently relinquish, whereapplicable; provide advice on alternative courses of action, including legal and treatment alternatives availableoutside the drug court program, and discuss thelong-term benefits of sobriety and a drug-free life;and explain that because criminal prosecution foradmitting to alcohol and other drug use in open courtwill not be pursued, the defendant is encouraged to betruthful with the judge and with treatment staff, andinform the participant that he or she will be expectedto speak directly to the judge, usually without anattorney or advocate present; participate in a coordinated strategy for responding to positive alcohol and other drug tests and otherinstances of noncompliance; agree that a positive alcohol or other drug test or open court admission of alcohol or other drug possessionor use will not result in a referral for or the filing ofadditional drug charges based on that admission; make decisions regarding the participant's continued enrollment in the program based on performance intreatment rather than on legal aspects of the case,barring additional criminal behavior. 3. All communication about an individual's participation in treatment must be in compliance with the provisionsof 42 CFR, Part 2 (the federal regulations governingconfidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patientrecords), and with similar tribal regulations. 37Atraumatic event in a person's life, such as an arrest, creates an immediate crisis and can force substance- abusing behavior into the open therefore decreasing thelikelihood of denial. The period immediately followingan arrest, an apprehension for a probation violation, or acharge under a tribal ordinance violation, provides acritical window of opportunity for intervening andemphasizing the value of alcohol and other drugtreatment. Judicial action, taken promptly after thetraumatic event, uses this crisis period to stress theconsequences of the substance abusing behavior andsuccessfully promote the offender's participation in the healing journey through the Healing to Wellness CourtProgram. Legal Screening refers to the process by which participants are identified as appropriate based onguidelines such as the nature of the offense (for example,many programs are limited to handling non-violentoffenders under federal drug court fundingrequirements), jurisdictional limitations (for example,tribal courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Key Component 3 Eligible substance abuse offenders are identified early through legal and clinical screening for eligibility and are promptly placed in the Tribal Healingto Wellness Program.

Clinical Screening refers to an intake interview conducted by a trained intake officer or treatmentprofessional to determine the participant's level ofchemical dependency and suitability for wellness courtgiven existing treatment services and therapeuticactivities. Clinical Assessment & Phased Treatment Plan refer to the completion of a detailed clinical assessmentundertaken by a treatment professional who thendevelops an individualized treatment plan based on theparticipant's identified needs. Timing\u2014 Prompt placement of a participant in the wellness program increases the effectiveness of treatmentand the community's confidence in the tribal justice andtreatment systems. Participants are immediatelyimmersed in a therapeutic regimen and the public sees ameaningful response to the offender's behavior and seesthe eventual success of the program in reducing alcoholand other drug use and related criminal behavior. Recommended Practices 1. Eligibility screening should be undertaken using written legal criteria and tested clinical screening tools.Program coordinators, case managers, tribal prosecutors, or other qualified team members are designated tolegally screen cases and identify potential participants.Trained intake officers or treatment professionals should also conduct initial clinical screening to determinewhether the individual's treatment needs will be met bythe available treatment services. 2. Promptly advise eligible participants about the requirements, benefits and consequences of participatingin this healing journey. 3. Assess the participant's need for substance abuse services, diagnose any mental health issues, andformulate an individualized treatment plan. 4. Schedule an initial appearance before the Healing to Wellness Court judge immediately after arrest, apprehension, or referral, to improve the likelihood ofsuccess for the participant. 5. Once the participant agrees to placement in the Healing to Wellness Court, the court should require theparticipant to begin active involvement in treatmentservices and other therapeutic activities or supplementalservices (such as educational, and job skills programs)immediately.9The Healing to Wellness Court concept is generally viewed as being consistent with traditional Native justice concepts and methods. Traditional methods ofjustice for Indian people created an environment thatfocused on the problems underlying the criminal actrather than the act itself and stressed family, extendedfamily, and community involvement in the healing process. The Healing to Wellness Courts are a modernrevitalization of guiding Native principles of justice,truth, honor, respect, harmony, balance, healing,wellness, apology or contrition, restitution, andrehabilitation, using a holistic approach. The Healing toWellness Court concept can be adapted by tribes to restore harmony and balance to individuals, the family,and the communities that have been devastated byalcohol and drug abuse. In a Healing to Wellness Court Program, a \"Phased Treatment Plan\" provides the therapeutic environment for participants and their families. This plan may includea year or more of tightly scheduled required therapeuticand other activities for the participant and his or herfamily. The Healing to Wellness Court provides weekly or bi-monthly legal pressure, in the form of requiredcompliance hearings, to keep participants and theirfamilies involved, while treatment professionals engage in therapeutic and other activities to provide positivelifestyle changes. Each Wellness Court Program is unique. Many have pre-set schedules for group sessions and/or othertreatment related activities. Many programs match theirtreatment schedule and treatment plan to the completionof phases. For example, Phase I may focus on detoxingthe participant and gathering information, getting theparticipant to understand why he or she is in theWellness Court and educating the participant in the nature and impact of alcohol and drugs on his or herbody and the family. Phase II may have goals of gettingthe participant to admit that he or she has a substanceabuse problem and to accept responsibility for hurtinghim or herself and others, including a focus on increased self-care and the development of healthy, balanceddecision-making skills. Phase III might focus on theparticipant's resolution to be clean and sober and to actas a peer role model. Phase IV is often designed as anaftercare phase which focuses on preparing a participantto face the challenges of re-connecting to the community,and developing an external support system. The most successful phased treatment plans include a combination of individual counseling, alcohol andsubstance abuse education and other topical classes,cognitive-behavioral group therapy, experiential (outdooror wilderness) therapy, group therapy, relapse preventioncounseling, and support groups. Participants are requiredto attend group or individual counseling, courses, andactivities on a frequent (often weekly) basis. Participantsare also required to be frequently and randomly alcoholand drug tested throughout the required phases. Recommended Practices 1. The team including justice, treatment, and social services professionals and traditional healers andpeacemakers or elders, should work together tounderstand and design the standard elements, therapeuticgoals, and scheduling requirements of a standard phasedtreatment plan. The phases may include, for example,alcohol and drug education classes, individual and groupcounseling on a number of topics, cognitive-behavioraland experiential therapies, relapse prevention counseling,and support groups. A standard phased treatment planshould take into consideration existing tribal financialand treatment resources. 2. Teams should also encourage additional training for treatment providers in the specific therapies andmodalities used by therapeutic courts (for example,cognitive-behavioral therapy, experiential therapy, andrelapse prevention counseling).Key Component 4 Tribal Healing to Wellness Programs provide access to holistic, structured and phased, substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation services that incorporate culture and tradition.10Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts 3. Teams should also plan to cross-train justice and treatment professionals and traditional healers,peacemakers, and elders in existing and new treatmenttherapies, modalities, and other therapeutic activities. 4. Treatment plans should be tailored to the individual participant's needs based on the conclusions derivedfrom the clinical assessment. Treatment providers andtraditional healers may recommend a certain number ofcounseling sessions or activities per week (frequency),certain types of therapies or activities (\"modalities\"including individual, group, family or sweat lodgesessions), specifying the length of sessions or activities(duration), tasks or assignments to be completed(objectives), or sessions focusing on specific topics (suchas anger management). The clinical assessment may alsoreveal a need for mental health counseling provided by apsychologist or psychiatrist in addition to standard drugand alcohol abuse counseling. 5. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts also incorporate a wide range of traditional healing, peacemaking, andcleansing activities into their programs. Traditionalhealing practices have proven particularly effective in addressing Native alcohol and substance abuse problems.Involvement in traditional, cultural, religious, andcommunity activities have also proven effective. Thefollowing activities may be integrated as requirements ofa phased treatment plan: cleansing ceremonies, talkingcircles, peacemaking, sweat lodges, Native AmericanChurch activities, visits with a medicine man/woman,and elder-participant mentorships, (The specificpractices, ceremonies, and activities vary substantiallyfrom tribe to tribe and from participant to participant). 6. The team should ensure that case management is undertaken with each participant. Case managementmeans that someone is officially responsible forcoordinating the services need by the participants such asjob training, money management skills, parenting skills,educational advancement, medical or dental services, andtransportation and other basic necessities such ashousing, water, gas and electricity. This assistance willprovide participants with the additional supportnecessary to succeed in the Healing to Wellness Court.11The Healing to Wellness journey is not accomplished alone. Rather, the process or journey is taken with the support and encouragement of the Healing to WellnessCourt staff, extended family, friends, and othercommunity resource personnel. While the choice tobecome healthy and well remains solely with theindividual, it becomes a group venture to help reach andsustain this goal. Many people join together to assist inmonitoring and supervising the participant's progress onthe healing journey. Drug testing plays an integral role in the healing journey of the individual. Without random and frequent alcoholand other drug testing, there is no reliable method ofknowing that a participant is receiving the full benefitsfrom services. Drug testing helps ensure that theparticipant is making progress in the healing journey. Modern technology offers highly reliable testing to determine if an individual has recently used specificdrugs. Further, it is commonly recognized that alcoholuse frequently contributes to relapse among individualswhose primary drug of choice is not alcohol. Frequent, random, and observed court-ordered alcohol and other drug testing is essential to document theparticipant's compliance with program requirements.This assures that the participant is allowing the healingprocess to begin. Alcohol and other drug testing resultsare objective measures of treatment effectiveness, as wellas a source of important information for periodic reviewof treatment progress. Testing helps shape the ongoinginteraction between the court and each participant.Timely and accurate test results promote frankness and honesty among all parties. It also gives the participantimmediate information about his or her own progress,making the participant actively involved in the healingprocess and journey rather than a passive recipient ofservices.Recommended Practices 1. Testing should be administered frequently and randomly in order to assure participant accountability.Testing should occur a minimum of three times per week during the early phases of treatment, with reducedfrequency thereafter. 2. The scope of testing should be sufficiently broad to detect the participant's primary drug of choice as well asother potential drugs of abuse, including alcohol. Sincethe drug of choice in most indigenous communities isalcohol, the frequent and random use of a breathalyzershould be incorporated into the testing regime. 3. The drug-testing procedure must be reliable. Elements contributing to the reliability and validity of a urinalysistesting process include, but are not limited to: Direct observation of urine sample collection; Verification of temperature and measurement of creatinine levels to determine if water loading hasoccurred; Specific, detailed, written procedures regarding all aspects of urine sample collection, sample analysis,and result reporting must be developed and availablefor review by participants, team members and otherconcerned parties; A documented chain of custody for each sample collected; Quality control and quality assurance procedures for ensuring the integrity of the process; and Procedures for verifying accuracy when drug test results are contested.Key Component 5 Participants are monitored through intensive supervision that includes frequent and random testing for alcohol and other substance use.12Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts 4. Alcohol and other drug testing policies and procedures should be based on established and tested guidelines. If aprogram uses contracted laboratories to analyze urine orother samples, these laboratories should be held toestablished standards. 5. Ideally, test results should be available and communicated to the court and the participant within oneday. The wellness court functions best when it respondsimmediately to noncompliance. The time between sample collection and availability of results should beshort. The court should be notified immediately when aparticipant has tested positive, has failed to submit totesting, has submitted the sample of another, or hasadulterated a sample. Wellness Programs should developa coordinated strategy for responding to positive tests,missed tests, and fraudulent tests.13As the Healing to Wellness journey is a difficult and complicated endeavor, participants are closely supervised throughout their participation in the Healingto Wellness Court program. Even the slightest progress isrecognized and encouraged by way of praise and otherrewards or incentives. Similarly, noncompliance withprogram requirements is detected promptly by way ofreprimand or more severe consequences or sanctions.Both incentives and sanctions in Healing to WellnessCourts support the participant's effort to move forwardon his or her healing journey, away from substance abuseand addiction. An established principle of alcohol and other drug abuse treatment is that addiction is a chronic, relapsingcondition. A pattern of decreasing frequency of usebefore sustained abstinence from alcohol and other drugsis common. Becoming sober or drug free is a learningexperience, and each relapse may be used to teach the participant about the recovery process. Treatment aimed at preventing the return to alcohol and other drug use is imperative in the early stages andemphasized throughout the process. It helps participantslearn to manage their ambivalence toward recovery,identify situations that stimulate cravings, and developskills to cope with high-risk situations. Participants may exhibit a pattern of positive alcohol and/or drug tests within the first several monthsfollowing admission. While wellness courts recognizethat individuals have a tendency to relapse, continuinguse is not condoned. Healing to Wellness Courts mustimpose appropriate graduated responses for anycontinuing use. Providing a written copy and explainingthese responses to the participants when they enter theprocess emphasizes the predictability, certainty, andswiftness of the Court's response to their behavior. Punishments, or sanctions, can be imposed for a participant's noncompliance with other Healing toWellness Court requirements, in addition to positive drug tests. Participant behavior calling for a response mightinclude missing a court appearance, a positive alcoholand/or drug test, or missing a group therapy session.Sanctions might include: requiring the participant tomake extra court appearances; wait until last to be calledat the regular court appearances; increased time in theprogram; return to a prior phase; and/or to do additionalcommunity service. A participant's progress through the wellness court experience is measured by his or her compliance with the treatment plan. Certainly cessation of alcohol and/ordrug use is the ultimate goal of treatment. However,there is value in recognizing incremental progress towardthe goal, such as showing up at all required courtappearances, regularly arriving at the treatment programon time, fully participating in the treatment sessions,cooperating with staff, and submitting to regular testing.Small rewards for incremental successes have animportant effect on a participant's sense of purpose andaccomplishment. Recommended Practices 1. Treatment providers, the judge, and other program staff should maintain frequent, regular communication toprovide timely reporting of progress and noncomplianceand to enable the court to respond immediately.Procedures for reporting noncompliance should beclearly defined in the wellness court's operatingdocuments. 2. Responses to compliance and noncompliance should be explained verbally and provided in writing to wellnesscourt participants before, or during their orientation, andas necessary during program participation. 3. The responses for compliance should vary in intensity. They can include:Key Component 6 Progressive consequences (or sanctions) and rewards (or incentives) are used to encourage participant compliance with program requirements.14Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Encouragement and praise from the bench; Ceremonies and tokens of progress, including advancement to the next treatment phase; Involvement in community or cultural activities; Community recognition of participant success; Traditional gifts (such as Pendleton blankets) in recognition of participant success; Reduced supervision; Decreased frequency of court appearances; Reduced fines or fees; Dismissal of criminal charges or reduction in the term of probation; Reduced or suspended incarceration; and Graduation. 4. Responses to, or sanctions for, noncompliance might include: Warnings and admonishment from the bench in open court; Demotion to earlier program phases;Increased frequency of alcohol and other drug testing and court appearances; Community service (such as providing services for tribal elders); Required appearances before traditional forums or to be instructed by tribal elders; Confinement in the courtroom or jury box; Increased monitoring and/or treatment intensity; Fines; Increased community service or work programs; Escalating periods of jail confinement (However, wellness court participants remanded to jail shouldreceive treatment services while confined and familymembers should continue to receive ancillaryservices); and Termination from the program and reinstatement of regular court processing. 5. Progress toward reducing the abuse of alcohol and other drugs and drug related criminal activity is markedby specific and measurable criteria such as compliancewith program requirements; no repetition of alcohol ordrug related criminal activity and alcohol and other druguse; participation in treatment; and restitution to thevictim or to the community.15The judge, or whoever serves in a judicial role (elders, elders panels, and traditional dispute resolution authorities), serves as the leader or guide of the Healingto Wellness Court Team. This position is the linkbetween the criminal justice system and the community'shealing and wellness resources. The Court's early andfrequent interaction with the participant throughout thehealing process during court appearances (often calledstatus hearings) increases the likelihood that a participantwill remain in treatment and improves the chances for asuccessful healing journey to sobriety and law-abidingbehavior. A Healing to Wellness Court judge must be prepared and have the authority to encourage appropriate behavior andto discourage and penalize inappropriate behaviorthrough the imposition of incentives and sanctions.Ongoing judicial supervision also communicates toparticipants\u2014often for the first time\u2014that someone inauthority cares about them and is closely watching whatthey do. Healing to Wellness courts require judges to step beyond their role in other courts and participate as part of theteam. An effective Healing to Wellness Court judge isknowledgeable about treatment and how treatment andthe tribal justice process interact. Their participation incase staffings ensures team members share and discussinformation and conflicting views in a timely mannerthat allows the judge to effectively respond to eachparticipant. Recommended Practices 1. Judicial participation at case staffings promotes consistency in a team's prompt response to theparticipant's conduct and assures that the judge is fullyprepared for the status hearings. 2. The judge must have a basic understanding of alcohol and other drug treatment and be able to discuss thetreatment plan with trained professional treatmentproviders. 3. Regular status hearings are used to monitor participant performance and progress: Frequent status hearings during the initial phases of the participant's program establish and reinforce thedrug court's policies and promotes effectivesupervision. Time between status hearings may be increased or decreased based on compliance with treatmentprotocols and observable progress. Having a significant number of drug court participants appear at a single session gives the judge theopportunity to educate both the participant at thebench and those waiting as to the benefits of programcompliance and consequences of non-compliance. 4. The court applies appropriate incentives and sanctions in response to a participant's progress in his or herhealing journey. 5. Payment of fees, fines and/or restitution may be part of the participant's healing journey. The court supervisessuch payments and takes into account the participant'sfinancial ability to fulfill these obligations. No one should be denied participation in drug courts solelybecause of inability to pay fees, fines, or restitution. 6. The judge plays an active role in the treatment process, including frequently reviewing treatmentprogress. The judge responds to each participant'spositive efforts as well as to noncompliant behaviorthrough a consistently applied set of rewards andpunishment (incentives and sanctions) developed duringthe team planning process.Key Component 7 Ongoing judicial interaction with each participant and judicial involvement in team staffing is essential.17Successful Healing to Wellness Court Programs carefully monitor, collect, organize, and analyze information from the beginning of the planning stages ofthe program and regularly throughout programoperations. There are two primary purposes for thecollection and management of wellness courtinformation. First, it is important to frequently monitorinternal program operations in order to make changes toimprove the existing process. Second, over time, it willbecome necessary to demonstrate to tribal and federalpolicymakers and funders that the wellness court isworking\u2014that it is reducing repeat offenses and substance abuse. Certain types of information should be formally collected and organized in a wellness court database: An explanation of the target population for the Tribal Healing to Wellness Court Program followed bydocumentation of the particular types of charges, priorrecords, nature and severity of alcohol or substanceabuse, tribal membership, age, sex, etc. of eachparticipant;Document the nature of alcohol and drug use while in the wellness court by keeping statistics on thefrequency and results of alcohol and drug testing ofeach participant; An explanation of the available treatment modalities for alcohol and/or substance abuse, followed bydocumentation of the treatment services and otheractivities provided to each participant; Document the wellness program completion rate by keeping statistics on how many people are accepted into the program, how many people graduate from theprogram, how many people are currently active in theprogram, what is the average length of time thatpeople are active in the program, and how manypeople have been terminated from the program; Document the re-arrest rate while in the wellness court by keeping statistics on what types of chargesare filed, how many times after graduation, and towhat extent people remain arrest free. Document the impact of the wellness court on the participant's life circumstances by keeping statisticson each participant's enhanced education level,acquisition of job skills, employment, improvedphysical health, the re-uniting of families, and thenumber of drug free babies born during participationin the wellness program. In addition to collecting and managing information to improve internal program operations, it is also importantto have formal wellness court evaluations done todemonstrate to policymakers and funders (present andpotential) that the wellness program is reducing re-offenses and substance abuse.Key Component 8 Monitoring and evaluation measure the achievement of program goals and gauge effectiveness to meet three purposes: providing informationto improve the Healing to Wellness process; overseeing participantprogress; and preparing evaluative information for interested communitygroups and funding sources. WELLNESS COURT DATABASE Law Enforcement Records Court Records P robation Records Selected Treatment Records Selected School Records W ellness Court Intake Information Alcohol & Drug Test Results18Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Evaluation is the process of gathering and analyzing data to measure the effectiveness of the program and theaccomplishment of the program's long-term goals. Thereare generally two types of evaluations useful for Healingto Wellness Courts: process evaluations and outcomeevaluations. A process evaluation appraises progress in meeting operational and administrative goals (e.g., whethertreatment services are implemented as intended). An outcome evaluation assesses the extent to which the program is reaching its long-term goals (e.g., reducingcriminal recidivism). An effective design for an outcomeevaluation is one where data is collected on a comparison group that does not receive Healing toWellness court services and then it is compared to the data collected on wellness court participants. Outcomeevaluations should be planned at the beginning of a wellness court program as these evaluations require atleast a year to compile results including contacting andinterviewing individuals in a comparison group and thosewho participated or graduated from the wellness courtprogram. Recommended Practices 1. The collection and management of information, and the effective evaluation of such data, should begin in theinitial planning stages. As part of the comprehensiveplanning process, team members should establishspecific and measurable goals that define the parametersof data collection and management. At this point in theprocess an evaluator can be a useful member of theplanning team. 2. Data needed for internal program monitoring can be obtained from records maintained for day-to-dayprogram operations, such as the numbers and generaldemographics of individuals screened for eligibility; theextent and nature of alcohol and other drug problems among those assessed for possible participation in theprogram; and attendance records, progress reports, drugtest results, and incidence of criminality among thoseaccepted into the program. 3. Team members should gather and organize data in useful formats for regular review.4. Ideally, much of the information needed for monitoring and evaluation is gathered through anautomated system that can provide timely and usefulreports. If an automated system is not available, manualdata collection and report preparation can be designed tofit the available record keeping system. Additional monitoring information may be acquired by observationand through program staff and participant interviews. 5. Automated and manual information systems should adhere to written guidelines that protect againstunauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal informationabout individuals. 6. Internal program monitoring reports should be reviewed at frequent intervals by team members. Theycan be used to analyze program operations, gaugeeffectiveness, modify procedures when necessary, andrefine goals. 7. Process evaluation activities should be undertaken throughout the course of the drug court program. Thisactivity is particularly important in the early stages ofprogram implementation. 8. If feasible, a qualified independent evaluator should be selected and given responsibility for developing andconducting an evaluation design and for preparinginterim and final reports. If an independent evaluation isunavailable the program may design and implement itsown evaluation, based on guidance available through the field. Judges, prosecutors, the defense bar, treatment staff, and others may design the evaluation collaborativelywith the evaluator. Ideally, an independent evaluator will help the information systems expert design and implement theinformation management system. The Healing to Wellness Court should ensure that the evaluator has access to relevant justice system and treatment information. The evaluator should maintain continuing contact with the court and provide information on a regularbasis. Preliminary reports may be reviewed by teammembers and used as the basis for revising goals,policies, and procedures as appropriate.19Key Component 8 9. At least six months after participants begin exiting a Healing to Wellness Court, the differences betweenwellness court graduates and members of the comparisongroup (which should have been defined during theplanning stages of the wellness court program) should beexamined to determine the long-term outcomes of the wellness program. Follow-up evaluation should includethe collection and analysis of the following types ofinformation (please refer to the U.S. Department ofJustice's Office of Justice Programs \"Drug Court GranteeData Collection Survey\" as a beginning): Who is eligible to participate in the drug court program? Characteristics of program participants Number of participants Number of graduates from the drug court program Number of people admitted to the program Number of people who completed the program Number of people who failed the program Number of people currently enrolledAge of participants Gender of participants Number of drug-free babies born to participants Number of participants of different racial or ethnic descent Number of participants who gained a GED or vocational training credential while in the program Number of participants employed at graduation Number of persons for whom bench warrants were issued, who have not been picked up, and have beenin bench warrant status for over 60 days Number of participants arrested or convicted while in the drug court program Number of clients who re-entered the drug court program, after court/self termination or graduation Number of participants arrested or convicted after graduation Number of participants who remain drug free after graduation21All Healing to Wellness Court team members and staff should be involved in interdisciplinary education and training before the first case is heard. Interdisciplinaryeducation exposes judges, court and probation staff totreatment issues, and treatment staff to criminaljustice process and issues. It also develops sharedunderstandings of the values, goals, and operatingprocedures of both the treatment and the justice systemcomponents. Judges and court personnel typically needto learn about the nature of alcohol and other drugproblems and the theories and practices supportingspecific treatment approaches. Treatment providerstypically need to become familiar with criminal justiceaccountability issues and court operations. All need tounderstand and comply with drug testing standards andprocedures. One method of educating new wellness court staff about wellness court operations is to visit an existing court toobserve its operations and ask questions. On-siteexperience with an operating wellness court provides an opportunity for new wellness court staff to talk to theirpeers directly and to see how their particular rolefunctions. Recommended Practices 1. Key personnel should have attained a specific level of basic education, as defined in professional jobdescriptions and in the written operating procedures. Theoperating procedures should also define requirements forthe continuing education of each team member. 2. Team member from justice, treatment and social services agencies should cross-train each other beginningwith the wellness court design and planning process andcontinuing throughout wellness court operations. Itshould never be assumed that professionals from the legal discipline or the treatment or social servicesdisciplines know the purpose, processes and limitationsof each other's agencies. 3. Attendance at educational and training sessions by all team members is essential. Regional and national drugcourt training sessions provide critical information aboutinnovative developments across the nation. Sessions aremost productive when team members attend as a group.Credits for continuing professional education should beoffered, when feasible. 4. Continuing education institutionalizes the Healing to Wellness Court and moves it beyond its initialidentification with the key staff that may have foundedthe program and nurtured its development. 5. An education syllabus and curriculum should be developed describing goals, policies, and procedures.Topics might include: Goals and philosophy of the Healing to Wellness courts; The nature of alcohol and other drug abuse, its treatment and terminology; The dynamics of abstinence and techniques for preventing relapse; Responses to relapse and to noncompliance with other program requirements; Basic legal requirements of the program and an overview of the local criminal justice system's policies, procedures, and terminology; Key Component 9 Continuing interdisciplinary education promotes effective wellness court planning, implementation, and operation.22Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Drug testing standards and procedures; Sensitivity to racial, cultural, ethnic, gender, and sexual orientation as they affect the operation of thedrug court; Interrelationships of co-occurring conditions such as alcohol and other drug abuse and mental illness (alsoknown as \"dual diagnosis\"); and Federal, State, and local confidentiality.23Healing to Wellness Courts contribute to community and nation building among indigenous tribal peoples. Not only do Healing to Wellness Courts help to redirectlost community members back into a more positive wayof life, but the bringing together of the community'shealing resources requires the tribal leadership, staff, andcitizens to communicate, coordinate and cooperate morebeneficially with one another and have an understandingof each other's roles and responsibilities. By workingtogether on a shared vision of health and wellness, thecommunity and nation as a whole can make plansregarding how this vision can be attained with both thewisdom from the past and the resources presentlyavailable. Consequently, Healing to Wellness Court staff and others involved in the Court must receive specificand focused education and training that supports theCourt's goals and objectives. Moreover, it is importantthat all community members are made aware of theHealing to Wellness Court's purpose, place, and meaningto the future of the Tribe and Nation so that everyone inthe community is actively thinking and working towardsthe same goal. Because of its unique approach in the criminal justice system, a wellness court is especially well suited todevelop coalitions among private community-basedorganizations, public criminal justice agencies, andtreatment delivery systems. Forming such coalitionsexpands the continuum of services available to wellness court participants and informs the community about thehealing journey of wellness court programs. The wellness court is a partnership among organizations\u2014public, private, and community-based\u2014dedicated to a coordinated and cooperative approach tothe alcohol and other drug offender. The wellness courtfosters system wide involvement through its commitmentto share responsibility and participation of programpartners. As a part of\u2014and as a leader in\u2014the formationand operation of community partnerships, wellnesscourts can help restore public faith in the criminal justice system. Recommended Practices 1. Representatives from the court, community organizations, law enforcement, corrections, prosecution,defense counsel, supervisory agencies, treatment andrehabilitation providers, educators, health and socialservice agencies, and the faith community should meetregularly to provide guidance and direction to the drugcourt program. 2. The court plays a pivotal role in linking community groups and the criminal justice system. The linkages area conduit of information to the public about the drugcourt, and conversely, from the community to the courtabout available community services and local problems. 3. Partnerships between courts and law enforcement and/or community policing programs can build effectivelinks between the court and offenders in the community. 4. Participation of public and private agencies, as well as community-based organizations, should be formalizedthrough a steering committee. The steering committeeaids in the acquisition and distribution of resources. Anespecially effective way for the steering committee tooperate is through the formation of a nonprofitcorporation structure that includes all the principal courtpartners, provides policy guidance, and aids in fund-raising and resource acquisition. However, an informalsteering committee may be just as effective. 5. Healing to Wellness court programs and services provide opportunities for community involvementthrough forums, informational meetings, and othercommunity outreach efforts.Key Component 10 The development of ongoing communication, coordination, and cooperation among team members, the community and relevant organizations are critical for program success.25Jerry Gardner, Executive Director Pat Sekaquaptewa, Associate Director Elton Naswood, Program Manager Tribal Law and Policy Institute (TLPI) 8235 Santa Monica Blvd., of Justice Assistance Office of Justice ProgramsU.
