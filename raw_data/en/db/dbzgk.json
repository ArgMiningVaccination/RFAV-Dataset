Plants ha ve been the main source of medicines since ancient times. Despite tremendous advances in medicinal c hemistry, synthetic drugs have not provided cures to many diseases due to their adverse side effec ts or diminution in response after prolonged use. Medicinal mushrooms have been used traditionally as an anti-diabetic food for centuries especially in countries such as China, Japan, India a nd Korea. These are source of natural bioactive compounds. The bioactiv e constituents compounds which have various health benefits. This review will focus on recent examples of diverse types of m ushrooms that have been validated by scientific evaluation as having promising activity for the p revention and/or treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus. D ietary components and plant-der ived molecules can be used in the future to complement current tr eatment strategies for gestation al diabetes mellitus. Keywords: compounds; anti-diabetic 1. Introduction Gestational diabetes is a form of hyperglycemia. It is a common metabolic disorder during pregnancy. According to 'World Health Organization' (WHO), gest ational diabetes is defined as hyperglycaemia that is first recognised during pregnancy and is observed to precedes to type 2 diabetes in up to one third of women later in life [1]. Series of endocrine, metabolic and vascular 50 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. changes take place during pregnancy to fulfil the demand of ene rgy and nutrient needs of the foetus. GDM develops when pancreatic -cell is not sufficient to compen sate for the decreased insulin sensitivity and due to which there is increase in post-prandial free fatty acids, hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance and glucose production [2]. Alth ough, glucose homeostasis is restored after delivery but there is high risk of development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in future. Gestational diabetes indicates the underlying frequency of type 2 diabetes for any ethnic and population group with incidences rising globall y needing huge health care and ec onomic costs [3]. GDM is clearly a major public hea lth issue internationally, esp ecially among those of non-European descent and data from previous studies also reveal ed that GDM was more prevalent in women with family history of diab etes, women who were obese and parous [4]. 2. Pathophysiology During pregnancy, there is an increase in oestrogen and progest in concentration which further leads to decrease fasting glucose, delay in gastric emptying an d increase in appetite. Tissue sensitivity to insulin decreases as gestation progresses and th erefore, post-prandial glucose concentration increases. To count eract this, pancreatic -cell of the mother have to increase insulin secretion to regulate glucose c o n c e n t r a t i o n s a n d G D M f e m a l e s a r e unable to produce sufficient insulin (Figure 1). Insulin resistance is also caused by defect s in receptors of insulin -signalling cascade. The down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (I RS-1) decreases insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscles. Genetic variations have als o been associated with greater risk of developing gestational di abetes (Figure 2) [5]. Figure 1 . Onset of GDM in pregnant females. 51 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. Figure 2. Factors which increase the onset of GDM in females. 3. Management of gestational diabetes mellitus Blood glucose monitoring is very important to manage GDM. Diet and nutrition must be carefully monitored, and exercise can effectively regulate the blood glucose concentrations and can reduce the risks of complications f o r a m o t h e r a s w e l l a s h e r b aby due to hyperglycaemia [5]. Maintaining healthy body weight, abstinence from cigarette smok ing, restricting refined sugars and Trans fats, consumption of low glycaemic foods, soluble fibres and calorie restriction are the preventive measures in blood gl ucose regulation [6]. Plants have been used historically for medicinal purposes world wide. Plants are the rich sources of fibres, vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients and have shown beneficial effects in management of diabetes, cardiovascular disor ders, obesity and some cancers [7 ]. In recent years, mushrooms and seaweeds have gained an interest of many researchers and now th ey have moved on to explore mushrooms to control and manage post-prandial hyperglycemia [8] . Mushrooms have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and as functional foods in n utraceuticals for their anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects [9]. The worldwide mushroom industry h as grown, and rate of consumption has been increased at a rapid r ate since the late 1990s [10]. Mushrooms have been part of culinary culture across the globe a nd have been valued for their unique flavor. More than 2000 mushroom species exist in nature but only 25 species have been accepted as food [11]. Eighty five percent of the world's mushr oom supply is from five main genera such as Agaricus (A. bisporus and 30% world's cultivated mushrooms. Pleurotus , second one with 5 to 6 cultivated species, constitutes about 27% of world's output and then Lentinula edodes (Shiitake) only 6% and 5% respectively [10]. 52 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. Mushrooms belong to phylum Basidiomycota and order, Agaricales. They have a fruiting body of a stipe pileus (cap) and anti-diabetic effects in various studies [13]. Several beneficial nutritional effects of mushrooms have been identifie d (Figure 3) [14]. Figure 3. Nutritional effects of mushrooms. The aim of this article is to r eview the relevant literature on use of different mushrooms in managing diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus. 4. Medicinal mushrooms with potenti al anti-diabetic activities 4.1. to the family Ganoderm aceae which is widely used for l ongevity and health promotion. It is commonly known as 'Ligzhi' in China and 'Reishi' in Japa n. The bioactive are polysaccharides, - germ steroids, amino acids, lignins, mycins and vitamins. Ganoderma is considered as golden medicinal fungus [15]. Ganoderma lucidum is often combined with another mushroom, Cordyceps sinensis which is thought to 4.2. Lentinus edodes (Shiitake mushrooms) Shiitake mushrooms have been used to treat common cold for hund reds of years. These mushrooms contain high fibre, hi gh levels of -glucans, protein s, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, 53 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. vitamin B1, B2 and C, ergosterol, lectins and lentinans. Studie s have shown that shiitake mushrooms could alleviate the damage of pancreatic -cells, promote insul in synthesis and lower plasma glucose levels. An ex-polymer of L. edodes reduced plasma glucose and increased insulin synthesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats compared to normal rats [8 ]. 4.3. Ophiocordyceps sinensis Ophiocordyceps earlier known as Cordyceps sinensis has been used historically as a medicinal mushroom. It has only been found growing at high altitudes in Q inghai-Tibetan plateau and due to high demand and declining harvest, this has become the one of t he most expensive mushrooms used in oriental medicine. This mushr oom is only found in co-habitat ion with larvae of an insect, needs rarefied atmosphere, mineral rich soil and low temperature whic h makes artificial cultivation challenging. Cordyceps has a unique profile of secondar y metabolites and thus, consid ered as world's most costly medicinal mushroom [17]. Various animal and human s tudies have shown antihyperglycemic, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-hypertensive, ant ioxidant [16]. 4.4. Agaricus blazei Murill ABM is native to Brazil and widely grown in Japan. This mushroo m is traditionally believed to fight physical and emotional stress, stimulate immune system, m anage diabetes, cholesterol, digestive issues. Ergosterols, lignins and polysaccharides constituents The polysaccharides, -glucans, -glucans have been shown posses s immune-modulatory and anti-mutagenic activity in both in-vitro as well as in-vivo studies [8]. The natural polysaccharides of this mushroom have shown to be effective in regulating diabetes by the mechanisms given below [19]. (a) Elevation of plasma insuli n and decrease of pancreatic gluc agon (b) Increase in insulin sensiti vity and improvement of insulin resistance (c) Inhibition of -glucosidase enzyme (d) Increase of hepatic glycoge n and inhibition of sugar dyspla sia (e) Increased use of glucos e from periphe ral tissues (f) Scavenging free radical and lipid peroxidation 4.5. Grifola frondosa Grifola frondosa , also known as Maitake mushrooms has varied medicinal properti es and is popular in Korea, China and Japan. Chinese people have been con suming Maitake mushrooms for hundreds of years for it's enticing taste. These mushrooms poss ess anti-tumour, immune-regulatory, anti-diabetic, beneficial effect s against hepatitis and HIV/AID S [20]. 4.6. Pleurotus pulmonarius (Grey Oyster Mushroom) This type of mushroom is an excellent anti-diabetic food. It co ntains polysaccharides, vitamins and minerals, dietary fibres and rich in essential amino acids. Oyster mushroom is consumed all over the world due to its high nutritive value and flavour. It can b e cultivated within wide-range of 54 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. temperatures and possess wide range of health be nefits [21]. 4.7. Antrodia cinnanomea This mushroom is native to Taiwan with various medicinal proper ties. This has mainly used to treat diarrhoea, abdominal p ain, hypertension, can cer and toxicities caused by various food s and drugs [11]. 4.8. Panellus serotinus (Mukitake) This mushroom is the most delicious edible mushroom in Japan. T his mushroom has found be very beneficial for liver and helps to prevent the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [11]. 4.9. Auricularia auricular Auricularia species are widely cultivated in China, Taiwan, Tha iland, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia [10]. Most species of Auricularia are edible and possess medicinal properties. A. polytricha (Woodear mushrooms) and A. auricula-judae (black fungus) are anti-tumour, anti-coagulant and cholesterol lowering, A.auricula-judae has also shown hypoglycemic properties [11]. 4.10.Flammulina velutipes This mushroom is traditionally us ed for soups in China. Bioacti ve constituents are dietary fibre and polysaccharides. Flammulina is hypoglycemic, cholesterol lowe ring and anti-oxidant [11]. 5. Hypoglycemic effects of mushrooms There have been numerous investigations conducted on rats to un derstand effect of different variety of medicinal mushrooms on underlying biomarkers of diab etes; some of these studies are summarized in Table 1. All these studies have either used polys accharides, protein complexes, or compounds extracted from fruiting bodies, cultured mycelium, or cultured broth of medicinal mushrooms. This section includes most of the medicinal mushroom s that have been investigated for their potential in Diabetes along with the demonstrated mechani s m o f a c t i o n . T h e m e d i c i n a l mushroom extracts are invaluable source of a variety of: (1) enzymes such as laccase, superoxide chel ating agents [19]. These components have been demonstrated to target various deran ged carbohydrate metabolic pathways thereby lowering blood glucose and insulin concentrati ons in type 2 diabetics as shown in Table 2 and 1. Efforts are currently underway to quantify these compounds for their therapeutic usage in diabetes and other conditions.AIMS Medical Science V o l u m e 6 , I s s u e 1 , 4 9 - 6 6 . Table 1.

Acts as an insulin sensitizer in glucose tolerance tests and re duces hyperglycemia [57,58] polysaccharides. Reduced p ostprandial blood glucose levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. One of such studies experimented with the mycelia powder extrac ted from Agaricus brasiliensis and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Wistar outbred white male rats. The st udy demonstrated hypoglycaemic e ffects when compared to control group as evidenced by lowered bl ood glucose and g lycosylated he moglobin concentrations [22]. This study also demonstrated that when the mushroom preparations wer e orally administered at a dose of 1 g/kg for 14 days to diabetic rats, the physiological balance between sialylation and desialylation processes was restored and integrity of erythrocyte membrane su rface glycoconjugates strengthened. Thus, mushrooms extract prevented dysregulation of iron homeost asis erythrocyte membranes thereby strengthening nd causing hypoglycemic and anti-an emic action [22]. Another animal experiment tested the polysaccharides and -glucans extracted f rom the body of Grifola Frondosa and reported decreased concentra tions of fasting plasma glucose , triglycerides, cholesterol and increased serum insulin in diabetic mouse [20]. Another study u tilized Maitake mushrooms ( Grifola frondosa ) and reported lowered blood glucose concentration. The fall in blood glucose may be attributed to Vanadium and an alpha-glucose inhibitor present i n this variety of mushrooms. [8]. Vanadium complexes have been demonstrated to have insulin-mimet ic as well as insulin potentiation properties [59] as observed in in vivo , animal and human studies. It f acilitates regulation of glucos e metabolism in diabetics as it plays a pivotal role being a cofa ctor for enzymes that participate in insulin signalling leading to G LUT4 translocation [60-62]. Further, a study reported reduction in hyperglycaemia induced o xidative-nitrative stress on rats with gestational diabetes [gestational diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (80 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally] when medicinal mushroom powder was orally administered at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight [26]. Another experiment of daily dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg of lyophilized and reconstituted Lentinus edodes to diabetic rats on 1st to the 19th day of gestation, observed reduced plasma catalase, glucos e, urea, triglycerides, and aspa rtate aminotransferase [23]. Ingestion broth of Maitake (Grifola frondosa) has also been demonstrated to alleviate the increase in 2 h postprandial bloo d glucose. The experiments showed significant improvement in innate immunity by modulating levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor-, macropha ges productions of IFN- from the T-leukocytes, IL-4, and IL-6 from the monocytes and IL-4 fro m the 2 Pleurotus ostreatus and P . cystidiosus ingestion has also been shown to reduce blood glucose level, improved serum lipid pr ofile, liver glycogen, liver func tion enzymes, and enzymic antioxidants activities in pancreas, liver, and kidney in STZ-induced diabet ic rats [27]. Another mushroom Phellinus rimosus has been shown to increase anti oxidant status in pancreas, liv er, and kidney tissues with concomitant decrease in level s of thiobarbituric acid- rea ctive substances thus showcasing significant hypoglycemic and hypolip idemic activities that may be related to its insulinogenic and antioxidant effect of medicinal mushrooms [25]. Studies by Huang et al. [63,64] demonstrated that polysaccharid es from Pleurotus tuber-regium mushrooms have antihyperglycemic properties and they reduce oxi dative stress in diabetic rats that were fed a high fat diet. Another interesting compound-Tern atin (a highly methylated cycl ic heptapeptide) isolated from mushroom Coriolus versicolor was reported to inhibit fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and suppressed the development of hyperglycemia via decreasing the SREBP-1c mRNA level in hepatocytes [65]. Another experimental study was conducted on p regnant rats (diabetes was induced by streptozotocin) in which the effects of reconstituted lyophi lized powder and dehydrated 60 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. mushrooms powder Ganoderma Lentinula edodes at daily dose of 100mg/kg were investigated from gestation day 1 to 19. Mushroom s G. lucidum and L. edodes reduced glucose levels in glycemic curve in response to glucose tolerance test thereby suggesting potential of mushrooms as functi onal foods in management of dia betes [66]. In a clinical study, oral hypoglycaemic effect of freeze-dried suspensions and powder prepared from Pleurotus ostreatus and Pleurotus cystidiosus on both healthy and type 2 diabetic humans was investigated. A dose of 50mg/kg/body weight was administered to both groups while on a diet control, followed by a glucose load. A significant reduction ( P < 0.05) in fasting and postprandial serum glucose levels of healthy volunteers and decreased postpr andial serum glucose levels and increased the serum insulin levels ( P < 0.05) of type 2 diabetic p atients was observed. The researchers simultaneously conducted animal study to understand the mechanism of action using same dose. The medicinal mushrooms demonstrated possible increa sed glucokinase activity and insulin secretion that improved the utilization of glucose by p eripheral tissues, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase and promote d glycogen synthesis [67]. A clinical study on 71 participan ts with type 2 diabetes evalua ted the safety and efficacy of Ganopoly (polysaccharides extracted from G. lucidum ) for 12 weeks at 1800mg thrice a day. Significant decrease in the mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1 c) was observed with decrease in post-prandial glucose. The study found Ganopoly to be efficacio us and safe in lowering blood glucose concentrations [68]. A double blind, randomised, placeb o-controlled trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Ganoderma lucidum extract was used with or without Cordyceps sinensis in dose of 3 grams/day for 16 w eeks. Eighty four, 18 years and older participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome were randomised to one of three intervention groups - Ganoderma lucidum , Ganoderma lucidum w i t h Cordyceps sinensis or placebo. The HbA1C and fasting plasma glucose were measured and the results were not f ound to be clinically significant or statistically significant on hyperglycemia, hypertension, or li pid profile in adults with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes [16] . The effects on metabolic prof ile could be attributed to the presence of polysaccharides that are mainl y classified as -glucan polym ers [owing to -(1 3) linkages with some -(1 6) branches along with presence of chitin, mannans, galactans, and xylans]. Pancreas enzymes are not equipped to hydrolyze the -glucosidic bond, th ereby allowing for prebiotics action of glucans that modulates gut microbiota, improves utilization, dietary energy, gene expression and gut permeability. Further polysacchar ide glucan content of medi cinal mushrooms [69,70]: (1) Reduces serum glucose and lipoproteins; (2) Enhances serum insulin; (3) Improves liver PPAR- expressi on and mRNA expression of protein levels; (4) Provides structural suppor t to pancreatic -cells; (5) Antioxidant and anti-in flammatory action. Thus, medicinal mushrooms may have multiple metabolic actions t hat may cause improvement in insulin response and glucose homeostasis at cellular levels. It may also reduce underlying inflammation and strengthen epithelial and hepatic cells to pre vent damage from any type of diabetes including GDM. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of individual medicinal mushrooms for Gestational diab etes unless human randomized trials are completed. 61 AIMS Medical Science V olume 6, Issue 1, 49-66. 6. Discussion There is association between ges tational diabetes and type 2 di abetes and it has been observed that women who have had gestational diabetes have at least seve n-fold risk of developing type 2 diabetes in future compared to those women who have had a norma l pregnancy. The risk factors are family history of diabetes, ra ised body-mass index, increased a ge, Asian ethnicity [3]. There are currently few clinical studies that have investigated the effec ts of mushrooms on diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus in humans. The sample size of the s e s t u d i e s w a s s m a l l , a l l d i e t a r y factors were not evaluated for confounding effects, various ins ulin and glucose control functions were not assessed consistently in all the studies which makes i t difficult to formulate guidelines. Furthermore, there is not enough evidence on the dose, dosage f orm and side-effects of medicinal mushrooms that may be effective for pregnant females. According to American Herbal Products Association Botanical Safety Handbook, both mushrooms Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis are listed as safest drug cla ss (Class 1 Dr ug) with no known h erb-drug interactions. However, there is lack of scientific data on a safety and efficacy of Ganoderma dosage but 1.5 gms to 9 gms of dried extract per day is recommended by Chinese medicine expert s [16]. There is immense scope to investigate the duration of suppl ementation to manage glucose i rregularities in females with gestational diabetes. Studies a re also required to investigate whether maternal supplementation of medicinal mushrooms influences growth and physiology of infants . There is also lack of consistency of clinical data for long term consumption to demonstrate the e fficacy and safety in GDM females and also the quality control and standardisation data for the p roduction of mushroom supplements is needed for its nutraceutical use [70]. 7. Conclusion The current review highlights the potential of medicinal mushro om in management of Gestational diabetes: a diseas e with serious, long-term consequ ences for both baby as well as mother. The heterogeneity of the data f rom animal and human study preve nted a statistical analysis/meta-analysis, hence a qualitative review was conducte d. GDM is a growing health concern and evidence now suggests that s creening, early detection and m anagement can greatly improve outcomes for both baby and a mother. There is no uniformity in the screening and diagnostic methods around the world which leads to underdiagnoses and unde r management of gestational diabetes. The present review has shown that polysaccharides, -glucan, va nadium and other nutrients in mushrooms may address deranged metabolic profile in diabetics t hereby improving immune responses, liver and pancreatic enzyme functions and exert preb iotic effect and improve gut permeability. Dietary source is always a popular and economical choice to manage a metabolic disorder in a community. Therefore, future research on mushroom species among humans is required that could assist in testing dosage and form of consumption for better health outcomes among gestational diabetic women.
