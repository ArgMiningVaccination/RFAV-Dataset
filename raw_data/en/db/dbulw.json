If You Forget to Give a Dose If you forget to give a dose of aspirin, give it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, do not give the missed dose at all. Do not double the next dose. Instead, go back to your regular dosing schedule. If you have any questions about this, check with your child's doctor or pharmacist. If a Dose is Vomited Even if the medicine is vomited right after it is given, some of the medicine may still be in the stomach. Do not repeat the dose unless you can see that the whole tablet was vomited. If vomiting occurs again with future doses, call your child's doctor before you give more medicine. Medicine Storage Store aspirin and all medicine out of the reach of children.
