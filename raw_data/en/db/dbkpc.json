Steiner viewed the human body as having the capacity to heal using gifts from nature and he called his approach Anthroposophy - meaning \"a wisdom of man\", Weleda grew out of his work. It is this understanding of the connections between man and nature which makes Weleda's skincare unique. When you use a Weleda product you can see, smell, and feel this for yourself. Weleda's potent all-natural ingredients give targeted support to the body's own processes. They enhance the body's ability to heal and bring the skin into balance. Weleda products promote the vitality of the skin, rather than simply replacing what it lacks. "}
