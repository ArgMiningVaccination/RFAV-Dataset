CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA Final 31-OCT -2017 8SYNOPSIS Detailed Title A phase III, open -label, single -group, multi -centre study to assess the immunogenicity, safet y and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' combined reduced antigen content diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccine, Boostrix , administered as a booster dose in healthy Russian subjects aged four years and older. Indication Booster immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases of individuals from age of four years onwards. The study population for this study will include individuals aged four years and older . Rationale for the study and study designRationale for the study In Russia, DTP vaccines have been indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases in infants starting at the age of three months. Recent data show sthat the coverage rate for DTP vaccine is 97% i n Russia [ WHO , 2015a ]. However, like man y developing countries, the DTP vaccination programme does not include older children, adolescents or adults and it is likely that a majority of the population will remain unprotected against such diseases in the fut ure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of pertussis disease in Russia was estimated at about 4,705 cases per 100,000 population in 2014 [ WHO , 2015b]. Studies have shown that childhood pertussis burden can be significantl y redu ced b y vaccination of adolescents and adults [Ward, 2005; Ward, 2006]. Hence, boosting with reduced - antigen -content diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa) instead of dTmay prolong immunity against pertussis infection. GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals has developed a dTpa vaccine for booster vaccination of children, adolescents and adults against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases, known as Boostrix . Boostrix vaccine contains 0.5 mg Al (as aluminium phosphate and aluminium h ydroxide) per 0.5 millilitre ( ml) dose . Boostrix is currentl y not registered in Russia .This study will assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Boostrix in healthy Russian s ubjects aged four years and older. The data obtained from this study will be used to support the registration of Boostrix in Russia for individuals aged four years and older . Rationale for the stud y design The study is designed as an open -label, single group trial in which all the study subjects will receive a single dose of CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 9Boostrix vaccine . An equal number of subjects are expected to be recruited in the following age categories : 4-9years (children), 10-17 years (adolescents), 18-64 years (adults) and 65 years(elderl y population). Pertussis outbreaks have occurred in a number of European and non- European countries. This resurgence is observed across the age range with a notable increase in cases now being detected in adolescents and older age groups. It is also now recogni zed that immunity following either natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not long lived, and the acellular pertussis vaccines that have been widel y used since the 1990s may be mor e prone to such waning. Consequently , adults and adolescents with pertussis are a potential source of infection for infants too young to have been fully vaccinated. Many countries recommend 'cocoon ' strategy, i.e. vaccination of family members and close c ontact of newborn (i.e. grandparents usually above 65 y ears old), in order to protect infants from acquiring pertussis. The 65 y ears (elde rly population) have therefore been included in the study . Objective Primary To assess the immune response to the dTpa vaccine in terms of seroprotection status for antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus antigens and in terms of seropositivity status for antibodies against the pertussis antigens [pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN)], one month after vaccination. Secondary To assess the immune response in terms of booster response to diphtheria, tetanus, PT, FHA, and PRN antigens, one month after vaccination. To assess the immune response in terms of antibody concentrations to diphtheria, tetanus, PT, FHA, and PRN antigens, one month after vaccination. To assess the reactogenicity and safet y of Boostrix in terms of solicited sy mptoms (local and general), unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Study design Experimental design: Phase III, open -label, non- randomised, multi- centric , single -country study with a single group.

failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when used consistently and correctl y and when applicable, in accordance with the product label fo r example: abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when this is their preferred and usual lifesty le, combined estrogen and progesterone oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel, contraceptive vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device or intrauterine s ystem, male partner sterilisation prior to the female subject's entry into the study , and this male is the sole partner for that subject, The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel's review of the subject's medical records; or interview with the subject on her medical history . male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ),and/or progesterone alone oral contraceptive . Adequate contraception does not apply to subjects of child bearing potential with same sex partners, or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis, when this is their preferr ed and usual lifest yle. Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered re lated to the medicinal product. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Final 31-OCT -2017 22Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when required in case of a serious adverse even t. In an open -label stud y, no blind is used. Both the investigator and the subject know the identity of the treatment assigned. Child in care: A child who has been placed under the control or protection of an agency , organisation, institution or entity by the courts, the government or a gover nment body , acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by law or regulation. The definition of a child in care can include a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls within the definition above. The definition of a child in care does not include a child who is adopted . Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Background Universal immunisation of infants with multiple doses of paediatric diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTPa) vaccine, followed b y a booster vaccination in the sec ond y ear of life, and at school age is widely practised worldwide and has controlled the occurrence of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in infants. Boostrix is a vaccine indicated for active booster immunisation against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. It is approved for use in the European Union as a single dose in individuals four years of age and older. Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highl y infectious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis bacterium. The most common complication seen in young infants for pertussis -related deaths is secondary bacterial pneumonia [ CDC , 2015a]. Worldwide, around 16 million cases of pertussis [ CDC , 2015b] and about 195,000 deaths per year have been reported [ CDC , 2015a]. Pertussis continues to be a serious problem among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants [ Forsyth, 2015]. As the vaccine -induced immunity to pertussis wanes with time, adolescents and adults may serve as a source of infection for neonates and infants too y oung to be immunised [ de Greeff, 2010; Kowalzik, 2007]. Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure for information re garding the pre- clinical and clinical studies andthe epidemiological information of Boostrix. 1.2. Rationale for the study and study design 1.2.1. Rationale for the study In Russia, DTP vaccines have been indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases in infants starting at the age of three months. Recent data shows that the coverage rate for DTP vaccine is 97% in Russia [ WHO , 2015a]. However, like many developing countries, the DTP vaccination programme does not include older children, adolescents or adults, and it is likely that a majority of the population will remain unprotected against such diseases in the future. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of pertussis disease in Russia was estimated at about 4,705 cases per 100,000 population in 2014 [ WHO , 2015b]. Studies have shown that childhood pertussis burden can be significantly reduced by vaccination of adolescents and adults [ Ward, 2005; Ward, 2006]. Hence, boosting with reduced -antigen -content diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa) instead of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids ( dT) may prolong the immunity against pertussis infection. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed a dTpa vaccine for booster vaccination of children, adolescents and adults against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases, known as Boostrix . Boostrix was first licensed for use in German y in 1999 and is indicated for booster vaccination in individuals aged four years and older [Mertsola , 2010]. Boostrix vaccine contains 0.5 mg Al (as aluminium CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 ml) dose. Boostrix is currentl y not registered in Russia. This study will assess the immunogenicit y, reactogenicity and safet y of Boostrix in healthy Russian subjects aged four years and older. The data obtained from this study will be used to support the registration of Boostrix in Russia for individuals aged four yearsand older . 1.2.2. Rationale for the study design The study is designed as an open -label, single group trial in which all the study subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix vaccine . An equal number of subjec ts are expected to be recruited in the following age categories : 4-9years(children), 10-17 years (adolescents) , 18-64 years(adults) and 65 years (elderl y population) . Pertussis outbreaks have occurred in a number of European and non -European countries. This resurgence is observed across the age range with a notable increase in cases now being detected in adolescents and older age groups. I t is also now recogni zedthat immunity following either natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not long lived, and the acellular pertussis vaccines that have been widely used since the 1990s may be more prone to such waning. Consequently , adults and adolescents with pertussis are a potential source of infection for infants too y oung to have been full y vaccinated. Many countries recommend 'cocoon ' strategy , i.e. vaccination of family members and close contact of newborn (i.e. grandparents usually above 65 years old), in order to protect infants from acquiring pertussis. The 65 years (elderl y population) have therefore been included in the study . 1.3. Benefit: Risk A ssessment Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure (IB) for thesummary of the potential risks and benefits of Boostrix . CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA Final 31-OCT -2017 28The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this study protocol: 1.3.1. Risk A ssessment Important Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Strategy Investigational study vaccine ( Boostrix ) Hypersensitivity including allergic reaction such as anaphylaxisAcute allergic reactions such as a rare case of anaphylactic event may occur with any vaccine administration. These are serious, but rare occurrences estimated in the range of 1 to 10 cases per million of vaccinations, depending on the vaccine studied [ R\u00fcggeberg , 2007].Anaphylaxis following vaccine administration is an exclusion criterion for study participation and a contraindication to vaccination. The onset of vaccine -related allergic symptoms is typically quite prompt. In order to treat subjects with a serious allergic reaction to vaccination, all subjects will need to remain under observation (i.e. visibly followed; no specific procedure) at the vaccination centre for at least 30minutes after vaccination. Syncope As outlined in the Reference Safety Information (RSI), syncope (fainting) can occur following or even before any vaccina tion especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection.It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting. All subjects will need to remain under observation (i.e. visibly followed; no specific procedure) at the vaccination centre for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Study P rocedure Risk from blood sampling. Blood sampling associated risk of discomfort, syncope, infection at the site after or during venipunctureBlood samples will be obtained by a trained professional and medical assistance will be available. The potential risk of feeling faint, or experiencing mild local pain, bruising, irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is mentioned in the ICF. The amount of blood to be taken for sampling will not be harmful to the subject's health. 1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis are common causes of diseases in children worldwide, with significant morbidity and mortality . A dramatic decline in the incidence of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis has been evidenced in countries in which infants are routinely immunised against these diseases. Clinical trial and post-marketing data demonstrate the substantial benefit of Boostrix vaccination worldwide. By receiving the Boostrix vaccine, the subjects may be protected against diphtheria, tetanus and pertu ssis diseases. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA 31-OCT -2017 291.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Based on the assessment of the extensive safet y database following Boostrix vaccination and t aking into account the measures taken to minimi serisk to subjects participating in this study , the potential or identified risks identified in association with Boostrix vaccination , are justified by the potential benefits (prevention ) that may be afforded to subject(s) receiving Boostrix vaccination . 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary objective To assess the immune response to the dTpa vaccine in terms of seroprotection status for antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus antigens and in terms of seropositivity status for antibodies against the pertussis antigens (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN)], one month after vaccination. Refer to Section 10.1 for the definition of the primary endpoint . 2.2.

Regulatory and ethical considerations, including the informed consent process The study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. The study will be conducted in accordance with the I CH Guideline for GCP , all applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study has been designed and will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideli ne for clinical investigation of medicinal products in the paediatric population (I CH E11) and all other applicable ethical guidelines. GSK will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency , in accordance w ith applicable regulatory requirements, prior to a site initiating the study in that country . CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Final 31-OCT -2017 35Conduct of the study includes, but is not limited to, the following: Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and favourable opi nion/approval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments. Subject /subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) informed consent and subject informed assent, as appropriate. Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol. GSK will provide ful l details of the above procedures to the investigator, either verbally , in writing, or both. Freely given and written or witnessed informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or each subject's parent(s )/adoptive parent (s) and subject informed a ssent , as appropriate, prior to participation in the study . GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly recommended that this model I CF is to be followed as closely as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not intended to pre- empt an y local regulations which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y effective. Clinical judgeme nt, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local version of the ICF. In accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, those subjects who can only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject's parent(s)/adoptive parent(s) (e.g. minors), should be informed about the study tothe extent compatible with the subject's understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and personall y date a written informed assent form (IAF). It is required that the assent be signed b y each subject, if capable, in addition to the informed con sent that is to be signed b y his/her legal representative. It should be assessed whether an assent is required depending of the age of the study popula tion and the local requirements (Amended 31 October 2017). GSK Biologicals strongly recommends that if th e subject reaches the age of consent during the stud y the y will be asked to provide consent at the next study visit (if applicable). This procedure should be applied according to local laws and regulations. The investigator has the final responsibility forthe final presentation of the ICF and IAF , respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF and IAF generated by the investigator with the assistance of the sponsor's representative must be acceptable to GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and an y other necessary documentation) b y the IRB/IEC.

Biological sample handling and analy sis Please r efer to the SPM for details on Biospecimen M anagement (handling, storage and shipment). Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number). Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related to the improvement, develo pment and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality of these tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods, as well as making sure that n ew tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably . It is also possible that future findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, all subjects will be ask ed to give a specific consent to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future research will be subject to the laws and regulations in Russia and will only be performed once an IEC or IRB has approved this research. Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK Biologicals. Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject/subj ect's parent(s) /adoptive parent (s). Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot perform an y other biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its amendment(s). If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given in Section 5.7.4 may be changed. Collected samples will be store d for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall y to and discussed and agreed with GSK Biologicals. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA Final 31-OCT -2017 445.7.1. Use of specified study materials When materials are provided by GSK Biologicals, it is MANDATORY that all clinical samples (including serum samples) be c ollected and stored exclusively using those materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the subject from the per protocol (PP) analysis (See Section 10.4 for the definition of cohorts to be anal ysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. However, when GSK Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, appropriate materials from the investigator's site must be used.

The vaccine s are labelled and packed according to applicable regulatory requirements. Table 10 presents the details of the study vaccine and administration. Table 10 Study vaccine Treatment nameVaccine name Formulation PresentationVolume to 5. 6.2. Storage and handling of study vaccine The study vaccine must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authori sedstudy personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study activities under the responsibility of the sponsor study contact. The storage temperature should be continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on storage of the study vaccine . Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 Final 31-OCT -2017 48Any temperature excursion outside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C(for+2 to +8\u00b0C/+36 to +46\u00b0F label storage condition) or above -15.0\u00b0C (for -20\u00b0C/ -4\u00b0F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (IMPs) must be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ( ATEAM ). Th e impacted I MPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor . In case of temperature excursion below +2.0\u00b0C down to 0.0\u00b0C impacting IMP(s) there is no need to repo rt in ATEAM, but adequate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to +8\u00b0C/+36 to +46\u00b0F label storage temperature conditions. The impacted I MP(s) may still be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on actions to take. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and instructions on the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and accoun tability of the study vaccine . 6.3. Dosage and administration of study vaccine The vaccine will be administered as detailed in Table 11. The vaccine will be administered as a nIMinjection into the deltoid muscle of the non - dominant arm , i.e. in the left arm if the subject is right- handed or in the right arm if the subject is left -handed. In case it is not possible for a valid reason to inject in the non-domi nant arm, an injection in the dominant arm may be performed. Boostrix should in no circumstances be administered intravascularly . In orde r to ensure proper IM injection of th e vaccine, a needle of 1 -1\u00bdinch length, 25 gauge will be used [Zuckerman , 2000].

Contraindications to vaccination Since this is a single dose study , contraindications to va ccination are included in the exclusion criteria. Refer to Section 4.3. The following events constitute contraindications to administration of Boostrix at that point in time; if any of these events occur at the time scheduled for vaccination, the subject may be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specified in the protocol (see Section 6.7.1), or the subject may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 6.7.2). Acute d isease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Fever is defined as temperature 38.0\u00b0C. The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the axilla . Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infec tion) without fever can be administered the study vaccine. 6.6. Warnings and precautions As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readil y available in case of anaphy lactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 mi nutes after vaccination. Boostrix vaccination should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocy topenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular (IM) administration to these subjects. Boostrix vaccination should under no circumstances be administered intravenously . 6.7.

SAFETY The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol. Each subject/subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they /the subject manifest any signs or s ymptoms t hey perceive as serious. 8.1. Safet y definitions 8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. Examples of an AE include: Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under study . Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine administration even though they may have been present prior to the start of the study . CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol sy mptoms, or clinical sequelae of suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE). Signs, sy mptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration. Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject's previous therapeutic regimen). AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs. Examples of an AE DO NOT include: Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. soci al and/or convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Pre-existing conditions or s igns and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF. 8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: a.Results in death, b.Is life-threatening, Note: The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe. c.Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, Note: I n general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician's office or in an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalisation' occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA Protocol 3 Final 31-OCT -2017 53Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT considered an AE. d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject . Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation. 8.1.3. Solicited adverse events 8.1.3.1. Solicited local (injecti on-site) adverse events The following local (injection- site) AEs will be solicited: Table 12 Solicited local adverse events All age groups Pain at injection site Redness at injection site Swelling at injection site Note: If the subjects or the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) observe a ny large injection site reaction (for subjects <6 years of age defined as a swelling with a diameter of> 50 mm and for subjects 6 years of age swelling with a diameter of >100 mm, noticeable diffuse swelling or noticeable increase in limb circumference) during the 4 - day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after vaccination , they will be asked to contact the study personnel and to visit the investigator's office for evaluation as soon as possible. The investigator or delegate will record detailed information describing the AE on a specific large injection site reaction sheet in the eCRF. 8.1.3.2. Solicited general adverse events The following general AEs will be solicited: CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol 13 general adverse events Toddler/Child Drowsiness Fever Irritability/Fussiness Loss of appetite Adult/Child ( 6 years) Fatigue Fever Gastrointestinal symptoms Headache Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain. Note : Temperature will be recorded in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day, the highest temperature will be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects/parent(s)/adoptive parent (s) will be instructed to measure and record the body temperature by axillary route in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day, subjects/parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) will be instructed to record the highes t temperature in the diary card. 8.1.4. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry , haematology , urinal ysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g . vital signs) that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Section s8.1.1 and 8.1.2). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal a ssessments that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as AEs or SAEs. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.

Pregnancy Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination may continue the study at the discretion of the investigator. While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any adverse pregnancy outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE. Note: The pregnancy itself should alway s be recorded on an electronic pregnancy report. The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.3: Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including: spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 weeks of gestation) ectopic and molar pregnancy stillbirth (intrauterine death of foet usafter 22 weeks of gestation) Note: T he 22 weeks 'cut-off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the EMA Guideline on pregnancy exposure [ EMA , 2006].

Any congenital anomal y or birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ] guidelines) identified in the offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy , at birth or later) regardless of whether the foetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified b y prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy andconsidered b y the investigator to be reasonably related to the study vaccine will be reported to GSK Biologicals as described in Section 8.4.3.

In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study participation (i.e. protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the study . The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the receipt of stud y vaccine and will end 30 day s following administration of the dose of study vaccine. All pregnancies recorded during this period will be followed up as detailed in sections 8.2.1, 8.4and8.5.2. An overview of the protocol -required reporting periods for AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies is given in Table 14. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 Final 31-OCT -2017 57Table 14 Reporting periods for collecting safety information TimepointPre-Bst (consent obtained)Vaccination (Day 1)Post Bst (Day 1-4)Post Bst (Day 1-31) Solicited local and general AEs Unsolicited AEs AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study SAEs SAEs related to study participation or concurrent GSK medication/vaccination Pregnancies * Pre-Bst: Before the administrati on of study vaccine; Post -Bst: A fter the administration of study vaccine. *This refers to collecting information on pregnancy as an event and not as an outcome, which will be collected after the end of the study. 8.3.2. Post -Study adverse events and serious adverse events A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period defined in Table 14. Investigator (s) or delegate(s) is/arenot obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE at an y time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the investigationa l vaccine, the investigator will promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs. 8.3.3. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events 8.3.3.1. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) should be asked a non -leading question such as: 'Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine (s)/product (s)or since the previous visit? ' 'Has your child acted differently or felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine(s)/product(s) or since the last visit?' When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator or delegate will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the eCRF . The investigator or delegate is not allowed to send CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 rec ords instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF . However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK Biologicals. I n this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. 8.3.3.2. Assessment of adverse events 8.3.3.2.1. Assessment of intensity The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described: Table 15 Intensity scales for solicited sy mptoms in children less than six years of age Toddler /Child (<6 years) Adverse Event Intensity grade Parameter Pain at injection site 0 None 1 Mild: Minor reaction to touch 2 Moderate: Cries/protests on touch 3 Severe: Cries when limb is moved/spontaneously painful Redness at injection site Record greatest surface diameter in mm Swelling at injection site Record greatest surface diameter in mm Fever* Record temperature in \u00b0C Irritability/Fussiness 0 Behaviour as usual 1 Mild: Crying more than usual/no effect on normal activity 2 Moderate: Crying more than usual/interferes with normal activity 3 Severe: Crying that cannot be comforted/prevents normal activity Drowsiness 0 Behaviour as usual 1 Mild: Drowsiness easily tolerated 2 Moderate: Drowsiness that interferes with normal activity 3 Severe: Drowsiness that prevents normal activity Loss of appetite 0 Appetite as usual 1 Mild: Eating less than usual/no effect on normal activity 2 Moderate: Eating less than usual/interferes with normal activity 3 Severe: Not eating at all *Fever is defined as temperature 38.0\u00b0C.

The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the axilla . The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling for toddlers andchildren <6 years of age will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: 0 : Absent 1 : 5 mm 2 : >5 mm and 20 mm 3 : >20 mm The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling for adults and children 6 years of age will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: 0 : Absent 1 : 20mm 2 : >20mm and 50 mm 3 : >50 mm CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Final 31-OCT -2017 60The maximum intensity of fever will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: 0 = <38C 1 = 38.0C 39.0C 2 = >39.0C to 40.0C 3 = >40.0C The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment will be based on the investigator's clinical judgement. The intensity should be assigned to one of the following categories: 1 (mild) = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. 2 (moderate) = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. 3 (severe) = An AE which preve nts normal, everyday activities. In a y oung child, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at school/kindergarten/a day -care centre and would cause the parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) to seek medical advice. In adults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work /school and would necessitate the administration of corrective therapy. An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 3 is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2 . 8.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality Theinvestigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y vaccine and the occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify if the AE could be causally related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate t he AE to be related to all products. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study vaccine will be considered and investiga ted. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or SmPC for marketed products to determine his/her assessment. There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologica ls. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 31-OCT -2017 61update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, it may not b e possible to determine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccine administered. The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines. All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the i nvestigational vaccine? YES : There is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine contributed to the AE. NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the administration of the study vaccine. There are other, more likely causes and administration of the study vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the AE. If an event meets the criteria to be determined as 'serious' (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL possible contributing factors for each SAE. Possible contributing factors include: Medical hist ory. Other medication. Protocol required procedure. Other procedure not required by the protocol. Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable. Erroneous administration. Other cause (specify ). CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Final 31-OCT -2017 628.3.3.3. Assessment of outcomes The investigator will assess the outco me of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study as: Recovered/resolved. Recovering/resolving. Not Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae. Fatal (SAEs onl y). 8.4. Reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other events 8.4.1. Prompt reporting of seri ous adverse events and pregnancies to GSK Biologicals SAEs that occur in the time period defined in Section 8.3will be reported promptly to GSK within the timeframes described in Table 17, once the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a SAE. Pregnancies that occur in the time period defined in Section 8.3will be reported promptly to GSK within the timeframes described in Table 17, once the investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy .

Contact information for reporting serious adverse events, pregnancies and pIMDs Study Contact for Reporting SAEs and pregnancies Refer to the local study contact information document. Back-up Study Contact for Reporting SAEs and pregnancies 24/24 hour and 7/7 day availability: GSK Biologicals Clinical Safety & Pharmacovigilance & Canada sites: Fax: or Email address: 8.4.3. Completion and transmission of SAE reports to GSK Biologicals Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator or delegate does not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the SAE causality by ticking the 'reviewed' box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 hours of submission of the SAE. 8.4.3.1. Back-up system in case the electronic reporting system does not work If the electronic reporting system does not work, the investigator (or designate) must complete, then date and sign a paper Expedited Adverse Events Report and fax it to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor Information ) or to GSK Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours. This back-up system should only be used if the electronic reporting system is not working and NOT if the system is slow. As soon as the electronic reporting system is working again, the investigator (or designate) must complete the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 24 hours. The final valid information for regulatory reporting will be the information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system. 8.4.4. Completion and transmission of pregnancy reports to GSK Biologicals Once the investigator becomes aware that a subject is pregnant, the investigator (or designate) must complete the required information onto the electronic pregnancy report WITHIN 2 WEEKS. \u0003 CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] 31-OCT -2017 64Note: Conventionally , the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cy cle in which a woman conceives. If the LM P is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated date of delivery (EDD) should be estimated by ultrasound examination and recorded in the pregnancy report. 8.4.5. Updating of SA E and pregnancy information after removal of write access to the subject's eCRF When additional SAE and pregnancy information is received after removal of the write access to the subject's eCRF, new or updated inf ormation should be recorded on the appropriate paper report , with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated report should be faxed to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor I nformation ) or to GSK Biologicals Clinical Sa fety and Pharmacovigilance department within the designated reporting time frames specified in Table 17. 8.4.6. Regulatory reporting requirements for serious adverse events The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly notify , as appropriate, both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agen cies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subject s are met. Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccine and unexpected. T he purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the product under investigation. 8.5. Follow -up of adverse events, serious adverse events, and pregnancies 8.5.1. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events 8.5.1.1. Follo w-upduring the study After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject's condition to GSK Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 17). All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until t he end of the stud y. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol 31-OCT -2017 65All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until 30 days after the vaccination. 8.5.1.2. Follo w-up after the subject is disc harged from the study The investigator will follow subjects: with SAEs or subjects withdrawn from the stud y as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper /electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy report as applicable. GSK Biologicals may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, GSK Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including histopathology . 8.5.2. Follow -up of pre gnancies Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK Biologicals using the pregnancy report and the Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period doesn't need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery. Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study , if the pregnanc y outcome is a SAE, it should alway s be reported as SAE. 8.6. Treatment of adverse events Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current good medical practice . Any medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject's eCRF (refer to Section 6.7). 8.7. Subject card Study subjects/ subjects' parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study . The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a \"subject card\" to each subject /subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s).In ency situation this card serves CONFIDENTIAL 201532 3 31-OCT -2017 66to inform the responsible attending ph ysician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator. Subjects/ subjects' parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s) must be inst ructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during the study duration . 9. SUBJECT COMPLETION A ND WITHDRA WAL 9.1. Subject completion A subject who returns for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol is considered to have completed the study. 9.2. Subject w ithdrawal Withdrawals will not be replaced. 9.2.1. Subject w ithdrawal from the study From an anal ysis perspective, a 'withdrawal' from the study refers to any subject who did not come back for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol. All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for the anal ysis. A subject is considered a 'withdrawal' from the study when no study procedure has occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has bee n collected for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact. Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for scheduled visits or follow -up. Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF .The investigator or delegate will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made b y the subject himself/herself, b y the subject's parent(s) /adoptive parent (s), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: Serious adverse event. Unsolicited non- serious adverse event. Solicited adverse event Protocol violation (specify ). Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*. Moved from the stud y area. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA Protocol to follow -up. Othe r (specify ). *In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject's parent(s) /adoptive parent (s)has withdrawn consent, the investigator or delegate will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified b y the subject /subjec t's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s), in the eCRF . Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the stud y as result of a SAE/AE until resolution of the event (see Section 8.5.1.2). 10. STATISTICA L METHODS 10.1.

Determination of sample size The primary objective of the study is to assess the immunological response to the study vaccine in terms of seroprotection status for diphtheria, tetanus and in terms of seropositivity for the pertussis antigens, one month after vaccination. According to Russian regulations, for the purpose of product registration, the minimum sample size required is 100 subjects in each age group. Therefore, the total number of evaluable subjects is 400 [ 100 subjects in each age group, 4- 9 years(children), 10- 17 years (adolescents), 18-64 years (adults) and 65 years(elderl y population )]. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, to compensate for subject attrition due to earl y withdrawal, a total of 448 subjects (112 in each age group) will be enrolled in to the study in order to obtain the desired number of evaluable subjects for anal ysis. Table 18, Table 19, Table 20present the exact two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a sample size of 400 subjects, according to the value observed for the seroprote ction status for diphtheria and tetanus, seropositivity for the pertussis antigens and booster response to all antigens.

Derived and transformed data A seronegative subject is a subject whose antibody concentration is below the assay cut-off value. A seropositive subject is a subject whose antibody concentration is greater than or equal to the assa y cut-off value. A seroprotected subject is a subject whose antibody concentration is greater than or equal to the level defining clinical protection. The following seroprotection thresholds are applicable: Anti-dipht heria antibody concentrations for Vero -cell antibody concentrations 1.0 IU/ ml. Anti- tetanus antibody concentrations 1.0 IU/ ml. Booster response to D iphtheria and T etanus antigens is defined as: for subjects pre-vaccination <0.1 IU/ ml(i.e. below the seroprotection cut -off), antibody concentrations at least 0.4 IU/ ml, one month after vaccination, and forsubjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration 0.1 I U/ml(i.e. equal or above the seroprotection cut -off), an increase in antibody concentrations of at least four times the pre -vaccina tion concentration, one month after vaccination. Booster response to PT, FHA and PRN antigens is defined as: for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cut-off, post-vaccination antibody concentration four times the assay cut-off, for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration between the assay cut- offand below four times the assay cut-off, post -vaccination antibody concentration four times the pre -vaccination antibody concentration, and for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration four times the assay cut-off, post -vaccination antibody concentration two times the pre -vaccination antibody concentration. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) calculations are performed b y taking the anti-log of the mean of the log 10concentration tr ansformations. Antibody concentrations below the cut- off of the assay will be given an arbitrary value of half the cut -off for the purpose of GMC calculation. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol of missing data: Immunogenicity: For a given subject and a given immunogenicit y measurem ent, missing or non- evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Reactogenicity and Safety: For a given subject and the anal ysis of solicited sy mptoms during the 4- day post- vaccination follow -up period, missing or non-evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore , the anal ysis of the solicited sy mptoms based on the TVC will include only vaccinated subjects and doses with documented safet y data (i.e. symptom screen completed). For analy sis of unsolicited AEs, such as SAEs or AEs by primary MedDRA term, and for the anal ysis of concomitant medications, all vaccinated subjects will be considered. Subjects who did not report the event or the concomitant medication will be considered as subjects without the event or the concomitant medication, respecti vely. For summaries reporting both solicited and unsolicited AEs, all vaccinated subjects will be considered. Subjects who did not report the event or the concomitant medication will be considered as subjects without the event or the concomitant medication , respectively . 10.6. Analysis of demographics Demographic characteristics (age at vaccination visit in y ears, gender and geographical ancestry ,body mass index in kg/m2), cohort description and withdrawal status will be summarised using descriptive statistics: Frequency tables will be generated for categorical variable such as centre. Mean, median, standard deviation will be provided for continuous data such as age. The distribution of subjects based on age stratification will be tabulated (as seen in Table 23). In addition, the above analy sis will also be done for sub- groups based on ageas an exploratory anal ysis.

If, the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the PP cohort for anal ysis of immunogenicity is 5% or more, a second analysis based on the TVC will be performed to complement the PPanalysis. For all subjects and each antigen: Seropositivity /seroprotection rate at pre- vaccination and one month post -vaccination will be calculated with exact 95% CI s. GMCs at pre -vaccination and one month post -vaccination will be tabulated with 95% CI s. Booster response rate one month post-vaccination will be calculated with exact 95% CIs for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens. In addition, the above analy sis will also be done based on agestratification (Refer Table 23) as an exploratory analy sis. Finally , antibody concentrations distribution at pre -vaccination and one month post - vaccination will be display ed using reverse cumulative curves (RCC). 10.8. Analysis of safety The anal ysis will be based on the TVC. The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general symptom during the 4 -day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after booster vaccination will be tabulated. The same calculations will be done for each individual solicited symptom rated as grade 3 in intensity and for each individual solicited sy mptom assessed as causall y related to vaccination . Occurrence of fever during the 4 -day follow -up period after vaccination will be reported per 0.5\u00b0C cumulative increments . In addition, the above analy sis will also be done for sub groups based on age stratification (Refer Table 23) as an exploratory analy sis. The percentage of subjects with at least one local symptom (solicited or unsolicited), with at least one general symptom (solicited or unsolicited) and with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) during the 4 -day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after booster vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95% CI after booster vaccination. The same calculations will be done for s ymptoms (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity , for symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) leading to medical consultation and for symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) assessed as causall y related to vaccination. The percentage of subjects who started to receive at least one concomitant medication (i.e. an y medication , antipy retic medication, prophy lactic (Day 1-4) and 31- day (Day 1-31) follow -up period after vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95% CI. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA 31-OCT 76The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs will be revie wed b y a clinical research and development lead and the signs and symptoms will be coded according to MedDRA. Every verbatim term will be matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects with unsolicited AEs occurring within the 31-day (Day 1-31) follow -up period after booster dose with its exact 95% CI will be tabulated by Preferred Term. Similar tabulation will be done for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3 and for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination. Any large inj ection site reaction (for subjects <6 years of age defined as a swelling with a diameter of >50 mm and for subjects 6 years of age swelling with a diameter of >100 mm, noticeable diffuse swelling or noticeable increase in limb circumference) onset during the 4- day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after vaccination will be described in detail. SAEs and withdrawal due to AEs and SAEs will be described in detail. 10.9. Interpretation of analy ses All analy sis will be conducted in a descriptive manner. 10.10. Conduct of analy ses Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the final study report. 10.10.1.

Synopsis Indication Booster immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases of individuals from age of four years onwards. The study population for this study will include individuals aged three four years and above older . \u0003 CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] and Section 1.2.1 Rationale for the study Boostrix vaccine contains 0.5 mg Al (as aluminium phosphate and aluminium h ydroxide) per 0.5 millilitre ( ml) dose . Boostrix is currentl y not registered in Russia .This study will assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Boostrix in healthy Russian subjects aged three four years and older. The data obtained from this study will be used to support the registration of Boostrix in Russia for individuals aged 34years and older above . Although Boostrix is indicated for individuals aged 4 years onwards, in this study , individuals aged 3 y ears and above have been selected with the intention to increase the coverage rate of the vaccine which may also help reduce the pertussis burden in Russia. Synopsis and Section 1.2.1 Rationale for the study design The study is designed as an open -label, single group trial in which all the study subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix vaccine . An equal number of subjects are expected to be recruited in the following age categories : 43-9 years(children), 10-19 17years (adolescents), 2018-64 years (adults) and 65 years(elderly population) .in order to support the registration of Boostrix in Russia The 65 years (elderly population) has been included in the study to ensure cocooning effect. Pertussis outbreaks have occurred in a number of European and non -European countries. Whilst this resurgence is observed across the age range with a notable increase i n cases now being detected in adolescents and older age groups. It is also now recognized that immunity following either natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not long lived, and the acellular pertussis vaccines that have been widely used since the 1990s may be more prone to such waning. Consequently, adults and adolescents with pertussis are a potential source of infection for infants too young to have been fully vaccinated. Many countries recommend 'cocoon ' strategy, i.e. vaccination of family me mbers and close contact of newborn (i.e. grandparents usually above 65 years old), in order to protect infants from acquiring pertussis. Section 1.3. Benefit: Risk Assessment Important Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational study vaccine ( Boostrix ) Temperature of 40.0C within 48hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable causeAs outlined in the RSI from clinical trials and post- marketing safety data, this AE/SAE is recognised as well - characterised identified risks for Boostrix.Subjects/Subjects' parents/ legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)] adoptive parent should report any untoward symptoms experienced, after receiving the vaccine immediately to the investigator. Hypotonic -hyporesponsive episodeAs outlined in the Boostrix RSI from clinical trials and post -marketing safety data, this AE/SAE is recognised as well-characterised identified risks for BoostrixAll SAEs should be reported immediately to GSK. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faintin g. All subjects will need to remain under observation (i.e. visibly followed; no specific procedure) at the vaccination centre for at least 30 CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy minutes after vaccination. Convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days of vaccinationAs outlined in the Boostrix RSI from clinical trials and post -marketing safety data, this AE/SAE is recognised as well-characterised identified risks for the vaccine.Subjects/Subjects' parents /legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)] adoptive parent should report any untoward symptoms experienced, after receiving the vaccine immediately to the investigator. Extensive swelling of vaccinated limbGiven that the active ingredients of Boostrix are conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier protein, an exaggerated local (Art hus-like) reaction are occasionally reported following receipt of a diphtheria -or tetanus -containing vaccine. These reactions present as extensive painful swelling, often from shoulder to elbow. They generally begin from 2 to 8 hours after injections andare reported most often in adults, particularly those who have received frequent doses of diphtheria or tetanus toxoid.Subjects/Subjects' parents /legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)] adoptive parent should report any untoward symptoms experienced, after receiving the vaccine immediately to the investigator. Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccineAs outlined in the Boostrix RSI from clinical trials and post -marketing safety data, this AE/SAE is recognised as potential risk for BoostrixSubjects/Subjects' parents /legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)] adoptive parent should report any untoward symptoms experienced, after receiving the vaccine immediately to the investigator. Adequate human data on use during pregnancy/lactation are not available.

Description of Study vaccine Boostrix is indicated for booster immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases of individuals aged four years and above. However, in this study , the study population will include individuals aged three years and above. This age has been selected with the intention to increase the coverage rate of the vaccine which may also help reduce the pertussis burden in Russia which was estimated at about 4,705 cases per 100,000 population in 2014 [ WHO , 2015b]. Section 6.2. Storage and handling of st udy vaccine Any temperature excursion outside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8\u00b0C/+36 to +46\u00b0F label storage condition) or above -15.0\u00b0C (for -20\u00b0C/ -4\u00b0F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (IMPs) must be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ( ATEAM [e]TDF ). The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor . In case of temper ature excursion below +2.0\u00b0C down to 0.0\u00b0C impacting IMP(s) there is no need to report in ATEAM , but adequate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to +8\u00b0C/+36 to +46\u00b0F label storage temperature conditions. The impacted I MP(s) may still be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on actions to take. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol medications/products and concomitant vaccinations At each stud y visit/contact, the investigator or delegate should question the subject and/or the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s) about any medications/products taken and vaccinations received b y the subject.

Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s) should be asked a non -leading question such as: Section 8.3.3.2.1 Table 15 Intensity scales for solicited symptoms in children less than 6 years of age Toddler /Child (< 6 years) Adverse Event Intensity grade Parameter Pain at injection site 0 None 1 Mild: Minor reaction to touch 2 Moderate: Cries/protests on touch 3 Severe: Cries when limb is moved/spontaneously painful CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA 31-OCT -2017 95Table 16 Intensity scales for solicited symptoms in adults and children of 6 years of age or more Adult s/Child ( 6 years) Adverse Event Intensity grade Parameter Pain at injection site 0 None 1 Mild: Any pain neither interfering with nor preventing normal every day activities. 2 Moderate: Painful when limb is moved and interferes with every day activities. 3 Severe: Significant pain at rest. Prevents normal every day activities. The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling for toddler and children < 6 years of age will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: The intensity should be assigned to o ne of the following categories: 3 (severe) =An AE which preve nts normal, every day activities. In a young child, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at school/kindergarten/a day-care centre and would cause the parent(s)/adoptive parent LAR (s) to seek medical advice. In adults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and would necessitate the administration of corrective therap y. Section 8.7. Subject card Study subjects/ subjects' parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s) must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study . The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a \"subjec t card\" to each subject /subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s). I n an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending ph ysician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator. Subjects/ subjects' parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during the study duration . Section 9.2.1. Subject withdrawal from the study Information relative to the withdrawa l will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y the subject himself/herself, by the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s), or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] 31-OCT -2017 96*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by the subject/subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent LAR (s), in the eCRF. Section 10.3. Determination of sample size According to Russian regulations, for the purpose of product registration, the minimum sample size required is 100 subje cts in each age group. Therefore, the total number of evaluable subjects is 400 [100 subjects in each age group ,43-9 years(children), 10-19 17 years(adolescents), 2018- 64 years (adults) and 65 years(elderly population )]. Assuming a drop -out rate of 10%, to compensate for subject attrition due to earl y withdrawal, a total of 448 subjects (112 in each age group) will be enrolled in to the study in order to obtain the desired number of evaluable subjects for analy sis.

Synopsis: Rationale for the study and study designStudies have shown that childhood pertussis burden can be significantly reduced by vaccination of adolescents and adults [Ward, 2005; Ward, 2006]. Hence, boosting with reduced-antigen-content diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa) instead of DT dTmay prolong the immunity against pertussis infection. The 65 years (elderly population) has been included in the study to ensure cocooning effect. Pertussis outbreaks have occurred in a number of European and non-European countries. Whilst t This resurgence is observed across the age range with a notable increase in cases now being detected in adolescents and older age groups. It is also now recognised that immunity following either natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not long lived, and the acellular pertussis vaccines that have been widely used since the 1990s may be more prone to such waning. Consequently, adults and adolescents with pertussis are a potential source of infection for infants too young to have been fully vaccinated. Many countries recommend 'cocoon ' strategy, i.e. vaccination of family members and close contact of newborn (i.e. grandparents usually above 65 years old), in order to protect infants from acquiring pertussis. The 65 years (elderly population) have therefore been included in the study .

In case i t is not possible for a valid reason to inject in the non-dominant arm, an injection in the dominant arm may be performed. Boostrix should in no circumstances be administered intravascularl y. Section 6.5: Contraindications to vaccination Since this is a single dose study , contraindications to vaccination are included in the exclusion criteria. Refer to Section 4.3. The following events constitute contraindications to further administration of Boostrix . during the stud y, the subject must not receive additi onal doses of vaccine but may continue other stud y procedures at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 8.5). The following events constitute contraindications to administration of Boostrix at that point in time; if any of these events occur at th e time scheduled for vaccination, the subject may be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specified in the protocol (see Section 6.7.1), or the subject may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 6.7.2). Section 6.6: Warnings and precautions Refer to the package insert of Boostrix . As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reaso n, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. Boostrix vaccination should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular (IM) administration to these subjects. Boostrix vaccination should under no circumstances be administered intravenously. CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] 6.7.2: Concomitant medications/products/vaccines that may lead to the elimination of a subject from per protocol analyses In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a pandemic) is organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunisation program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that va ccine provided it is licensed and used according to its Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or PIand according to the local governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of the Sponsor is obtained.

Section 8.2.1: Pregnancy Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy andconsidered b y the investigator to be reasonably related to the study vaccine will be reported to GSK Biologica ls as described in Section 8.4.3. While the investigator or delegate is not obligated to actively seek this information from former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting. Section 8.3.1: Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse events and pregnancies All AEs starting within three 30days following administration of the dose of study vaccine ( Day 1-4 Day 1-31)must be recorded onto the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of i ntensity or whether or not they are considered vaccination-related. Section 8.3.2: Post -Study adverse events and serious adverse events A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period defined in Table 14. Investigator (s) or delegate(s) is/are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE at an y time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the investigationa l vaccine, the investigator will promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs.

The investigator or delegate will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator or delegate is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject's medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF . However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK Biologicals. I n this instance, all subj ect identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals. Section 8.3.3.2.1: Assessment of intensity The maximum intensity of fever will be scored at GSK Biologicals as follows: 0 = <37.5 C 1 = 37.5C to 38.0C 2 = >38.0 C to 39.0C 3 = >39.0 C 0 = <38C 1 = 38.0C to 39.0C 2 = >39.0C to 40.0C 3 = >40.0C Section 8.3.3.2.2: Assessment of causality Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study vaccine will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consu lt the IB and/or SmPC and/or PI for marketed products to determine his/her assessment. Section 8.4.3: Completion and transmission of SAE reports to GSK Biologicals Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a stud y subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will alway s be completed as thoroughl y as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator or delegate does not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated WI THIN 24 HOURS. Section 9.2.1: Subject withdrawal from the study Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator or delegate will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made b y the subject himself/herself, b y the subject's parent(s)/adoptive parent (s), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] 31-OCT -2017 107*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator or delegate will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified b y the subject/subject's parent(s)/ adoptive parent (s), in the eCRF. Section 10.5: Derived and transformation data A seroprotected subject is a subject whose antibody concentration is greater than or equal to the level defining clinical protection. The following seroprotection thresholds is defined as: forinitially seronegative subjects seroprotection cut- off)(pre-vaccination concentration below assay cut-off), antibody concentrations at least four times the assay cut-off 0.4 IU/ ml, one month after vaccination, and forinitially seropositive subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration 0.1 IU/ml (i.e. equal or above the seroprotection cut- off), an increase in antibody concentrations of at least four times the pre -vaccination concentration, one month after vaccination. Booster response to PT, FHA an d PRN antigens is defined as: for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration bel ow (i.e. <) the assay cut-off, post -vaccination concentration four times the assay cut-off, for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration between the ass ay cut- offand below (i.e.) four times the assay cut-off, post- antibod y conce ntration four times the pre -vaccination antibody concentration ,and for subjects with pre -vaccination antibody concentration four times the assay cut-off, post -vaccination antibody concentration two times the pre -vaccination antibody concentration. Section 10.7: Analysis of immunogenicity Booster response rate one month post-vaccination will be calculated with exact 95% CIs for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens. Section 10.8: Analysis of safety The overall incidence percentage of subjects with at least one local symptom (solicited or unsolicited), with at least one general symptom (solicited or unsolicited) and with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) during the 4 -day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after booster vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95% CI after booster vaccination. Any large injection site reaction (defined as a swelling with a diameter of >50 mm for subjects <6 years of age and >100 mm for subjects 6 years of age for subjects <6 years CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] 31-OCT -2017 108of age defined as a swelling with a diameter of > 50 mm and for subjects 6 years of age swelling with a diameter of >100 mm, noticeable diffuse swelling or noticeable increase in limb circumfe rence) onset during the 4 -day (Day 1-4) follow -up period after vaccination will be described in detail.

CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-050] Protocol Amendment 3 Final Vaccines R &D Protocol author: , Scientific Writer Rationale/background for changes: This protocol amendment was developed in order to accommodate older adults (approximately 58 years old and older) who were born before national recommendations in Russia for infant DTP vaccination. The protocol amendment will also clarify inconsistencies present in the Protocol Amendment 2, between the English version and the Russian version. Following which, adjustments to the text were made in the inclusion criteria to clarify the enrolment of subjects for age group eight years and above. Amended text has been included in bold italics and deleted text in strikethrough in the following sections: Protocol Amendment 3 Investigator Agreement To ensure that no clinical samples (including serum samples) are retained onsite or elsewhere without the approval of GSK Biologicals and the express written informed consent of the subject and/or the subject's legally acceptable representative parent(s)/adoptive parent(s) . Section 4.2: Inclusion criteria for enrolment Subjects eight years of age and older who can report previous diphtheria, tetanus and with or without pertussis vaccination - documented or to the best of their/subjects' parent(s)/subjects' adoptive parent(s) knowledge - and did not receive an additional diphtheria, tetanus with orwithout pertussis vaccination within five years prior to enrolment in the study will be enrolled. Section 5.1: Regulatory and ethical considerations, including the informed consent process In accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, those subjects who can only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject's parent(s)/adoptive parent(s) legally acceptable representative (e.g. minors), should be informed about the study to the extent compatible with the subject's understanding and, if \u0003 CONFIDENTIAL 201532 [DTPA 31-OCT -2017 110capable, the subject should sign and personally date a written informed assent form (IAF). It is required that the assent be signed b y each subject, if capable, in addition to the informed consent that is to be signed by his/her legal representative. It should be assessed whether an assent is required depending of the age of the study population and the local requirements. Section 5.6.4: Medical history and vaccination history Review the subject's* childhood diphtheria, tetanus, with or without andpertussis , vaccinations to collect information on the vaccine name, route of administration, dose number and date of administration. This information should be recorded in the eCRF. *For subjects eight years and older, with no documented previous diphtheria, tetanus , with or without andpertussis ,vaccinations, details are to be recorded to the best of their/subjects' parent(s)/subjects' adoptive parent(s) knowledge. Section 5.7.3: Laboratory assays (Table 8: footnote) ELISA's Assays for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were re -developed and re -validated as per most recent CBER recommendations (Guidance for Industry \"Bioanalytical Method Validation\" from September 2013). The new assay cut - off's that apply a re listed in the table. The neutralisation assay for Diphtheria is still under re -development and the assay cut -off might be subject to change during the course of the study. In this case, it will be documented in the clinical study report. Section 5.7.5: Immunological correlates of protection The cut -off of neutralisation assay <0. 1 IU/ ml) is 0.004 IU/ ml. Antibody concentrations 0.01 IU/mlare considered as protective [WHO, 1994 Camargo, 1984]. Both, the ELI SA test (antibody concentrations 0.1 IU/ml) and Vero -cell test (antibody concentrations 0.01 IU/ml) will define the seroprotection status for the primary endpoint.
