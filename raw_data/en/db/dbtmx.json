The Department's attorneys and agents make up our front line in stopping those criminals, and I want to thank you for all that you do. Attorney General Michael Mukasey May 28, 2008 Dear United States Attorneys: America leads the world in quality health care. Each year our government spends billions of dollars to make that care available to individuals who might not otherwise be able to afford it, including veterans, children, the elderly and the poor. But with such expansive government spending for health care comes the potential for fraud and abuse. When I was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, I saw, as you see, how health care fraud and abuse can badly hurt the intended beneficiaries of government health care programs and drain resources we need to help the truly deserving. The efforts of the Department of Justice to fight this fraud and abuse, led by your hard work in this area, are necessary to maintain the quality and integrity of our nation's health care system. Ensuring that abuses in the provision of health care are appropriately addressed is an important priority of the Department of Justice and its components, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Working with your law enforcement partners throughout federal and state enforcement agencies, you work tirelessly to bring to justice those who would prey on the vulnerabilities of government programs intended to help our most vulnerable citizens .I speak on behalf of the Attorney General and the leadership offices within the Department when I express our sincere gratitude for your efforts. Keep up the good work. I, and your country, thank you.

With Medicare Part D now covering a wide array of pres cription drugs, pros ecutors can expect to see more and more of these cases. Gener ally speaking, pharmaceutical companies can violate the FCA in two basic categories: m arketing and pricing. This article discusses cases in the mar keting category and offers some views on the factors that can make a compelling FCA case. II. Lega l bac kground Marketing fraud cases can i nvolve ki ckbacks and/or off-label marketing, and the two often go hand in hand. A com pany off-label markets when it prom otes a drug for an i ndication or dosage not approved b y the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe and effective. Promoting a drug in this way can render it adulterated an d misbranded under the Food , Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FDCA), 21 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301- 3991( 2000) . Paying doctors in order to induce drug pres criptions may violate th e Medicare Anti-Kickback Act (A KA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b (1990). Either type of violation can result in the submission of false claims to feder ally-funded programs, thereby potentially violating the FCA.2 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009The FCA imposes treble damages and civil penalties on, inter alia, any person who knowingly presents, or causes to be p resented, to the Fed eral Gover nment a false or fraudulent claim for payment or ap proval, or w ho kn owingly makes, uses, or c auses to b e made or used, a false re cord or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim approved or paid by the Federal Government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1 ), (2) (1994). A. Falsity Generally, the federal health care programs will pay for a drug only if it is prescribed for the FDA-approved indication (i.e., on label), but will pay for off-label uses if they are suppo rted by one of the three pharmaceutical compendia listed at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8(g)(1)(b)(1) (1984) (i.e., DRUGDEX, America n Hospital Formulary Service, or U.S. Pha rmacopeia-Drug Information). See 42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(k)(6) (1984) (M edicaid ); C.F.R. \u00a7 423.100 (2005) (M edicare Part D ). The rules for Medicare Part B are slightly different: Part B will cover an outpatient drug administered incident to a physician's services if it is used for the FDA-approved indication, or if the Medicare carrier determines that the use is medically accepted, taking into account the compendia, authoritative m edical literature, and/or accepted stan dards of medical p ractice. See Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chap. 15, \u00a7 50.4.1 & .2, available at http://www.cms.hhs. gov/Manuals/downloads/bp102c 15.pdf. When a federal health care program does not cov er an off- label use of the drug, but a claim is submitted for that off-label use as if the claim is proper and shou ld be p aid, the claim will gener ally be f alse. This analysis is really no different from the analysis in the mor e familiar contract fraud context, for example. When a government contractor performs work that is n ot allo wable unde r the contract, but subm its an invoice to the government for that wor k as if it is allowabl e and should be paid, the claim is generally false. Similarly, fe deral health care programs will not pay claims that were i nduced by kickb acks. The AK A prohibits knowing and wi llful payment of remuneration to induce anot her to refer or arrange f or a health care item or servicereimbursable under a federal health care program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b) (1990). The courts have gener ally agreed w ith the United S tates' posi tion that compliance with the AKA is a prerequisite to payment of federal health care funds , and therefore that claims induced b y kickbacks can constitute false c laim s under th e FCA. See, e.g., United States ex rel. McNutt v. Haleyville Medical Supplies, 423 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir. 2005); United States ex rel . Schmidt v. Zimmer, Inc., 386 F.3d 235, 244-45 (3d Cir. 2004); United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 125 F.3d 899, 902-03 (5th Cir. 1997); cf. United States v. Rogan , 517 F. 3d 449, 451- 53 (7th Cir. 2008) (case involved AKA and Stark Ame ndment to the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395nn, but opinion relied on \"the fact that the Stark Amendm ent forbids federal reimbursement for services that stem from com pensat ed referrals\"). It should be noted, however, that in a criminal case, the Elevent h Circuit found that kickbacks alone did not establish criminal health care frau d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347; the court stated that a knowing false or fraudul ent misrepresentation to Medicare woul d also be required for c riminal liability. United States v. Medina, 485 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2007). B. Claims Improper marketing by a pharmaceutical company does not automatically violate the FCA. As the First Circuit has explained, \"FCA liab ility does not attach t o violations of feder al law or regulations, such as marketing of drugs in violation of the FD CA, that are indepen dent of any false claim.\" United States ex rel. Rost v. Pfizer, 507 F.3d 720, 727 (1st Cir. 2007) (Rost I). In pharmaceutical fraud cases, it is u sually someone othe r than the drug company (such as a health care provider or beneficiary) w ho submits the claims to the government. Accordingly, to establish an F CA violation by the pharmaceutical company, the government should tie the company's cond uct to claims that were submitted to federally funded programs. Id. at 732 (dismissing relator's complaint for lack of particularity u nder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b); allegations of drug company's illegal prac tices were not a sufficient basi s forJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 3FCA a ction because they did not involve claims for government reimbursement); United States ex rel. Rost v. Pfizer, 2008 WL 4293642 at *5 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2008) (Rost II) (on remand, permitting am ended com plaint which al leged specific false claim s to g o forw ard). C. Defend ant's state of m ind FCA liab ility attaches conduct, and the statute def ines \"know ingly\" to mean t hat the defendant has actual knowledge of the falsity at issue, acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity, or acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsit y. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(b) (1994). In addition, the Supreme Court recently held that a plaintiff pursuing an action under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(2) (making or using a false record or statement to get a false or fraudul ent claim paid) \"must prove that the defendant intended that the false record or statement be mat erial to the Government's decision to pay or ap prove the fal se claim.\" Alliso n Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 128 S. Ct. 2123, 2126 (2008). Allison Engine also imposes a similar requirement on actions brought unde r Section 3729( a)(3) (conspiracy to defraud the government by getting a false o r frau dulent claim paid). See id. at 2130- 31 (plaintiff must sh ow that th e conspirators \"intended 'to defraud the Government,'\" and in consp iracy cases involving false records or statements, plaintiff mus t show that the consp irators \"agreed t hat the false record or statement woul d have a mat erial effect on the Gover nment's decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim \"). Thus, an F CA case against a pharmaceutical company should include evidence that the company was at least reckless or deliberately ignorant in engaging in the offending conduct, rather than, for example, negligently mistaken. In addition, in cases brought under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(2) or (3), we should be prepared to show that the company was aware that false claims would be sub mitted to the United S tates based on the company's marketing conduct. III. Some key fac tors in e valuating pharm aceutic al fraud cases A pharmaceu tical market ing fraud case typically comes to us in the form of an FC A qui tam action brough t by an em ployee or former employee (known as the relator) who has some knowledge of the com pany's market ing practices. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b). However, the relator often lacks a full picture of the company's conduc t and may not know the relevant government agencies' view of that conduct, including whether the off-label use at issue is specifically covered by any of the federal health care programs. Moreover, the relator has a built- in bias, since he or she is gener ally entitled to a percentage of the United States' recovery. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d). Accordingly, as is th e norm in qui tam cases, it is the government's responsibility to gat her and assess the evidence and determine whether the def endant's cond uct violates the FCA, and whether the FCA case i s a strong one to pursue. While there is certainly no set formula for evaluating the strength of an FCA case, several key factors are offered for consideration below. A. Government agencies' involvement Allegati ons of off-label market ing for a use supported by the compendia, or specifically covered by a state M edicaid agency or M edicare carrier, may not make the most compelling FCA case. Cf. Rost, 2008 WL 4293642 at *6 (\"if a state know ingly chose to reimburse for a drug, even f or an of f-label use, after a prior authorization review, liability would not attach\"). On the othe r hand, if the drug company used false or m isleading inform ation to get the off -label use cover ed, that can be good evidence of know ledge and misconduct, making a potentially strong FCA case. Of course, even if an off-label use is supported by the compendia or specifically approved for payment, a com pelling FCA case can be made if t he claim s to fed eral health care programs were caused by kick backs. See id. The company's interactions with the FD A can also be relevant . For exam ple, drug com panies are required to submit their promotional materials4 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009to the FD A's Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications (DDMAC) for review. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.81(b)(3)(i) (2007). A recent report by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) calls this \"[t]he primary mechan ism FDA uses to over see off-label promotions.\" U. S. GEN. ACCOUNT ING OFFICE, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS : FDA'S OVER SIGHT OF THE PROM OTION OF DRUGS FOR OFF-LABEL USES , GAO-08-835, July 2008, at 1 3, available at http://www.gao.gov /new.items/d08835.pdf. Thus, if a company used a brochu re to market a drug for an off-l abel use, but failed to su bmit the brochure to DDMAC, that failure might serve as evidence that the company kn ew it w as improperly marketing the drug. However, the opp osite is not necessarily true; DDMAC's mere failure to object to off-label information in mat erials subm itted by the company does not constitute approval of the company's off-label marketing. As explained in the GAO report, D DMAC receives substantially more materials than it has c apaci ty to review. Id. at 16 (annual number of items received h as been increasing and reached over 68,000 in 2007). Therefore, th e government is often unaware of a company's improper marketing practices until a qui tam suit is filed. B. Defendan t's conduct Just as in any other FCA case, the more egregious the defendant's conduct, the more compelling the case is likely to be. In a drug marketing case, some of the mor e egregious cond uct might include the company's sales representatives providing false information to doctors or paying a quid pro quo for the doctor's prescriptions. If the direction to engage in this cond uct com es from high- level managem ent, that makes the case all the more compelling. It is also important to look for a nexus between the defendant's conduc t and the subm ission of the false claims to the government program. As discussed above, typically the drug company does not subm it claims to the government. In an FCA case against a pharmaceutical com pany, it is important to show that the company caused the false claim to be submitted to th e government. See United States exrel. Franklin v. Parke-Davis, 147 F. Supp. 2d 39, 52-53 (D. Mass. 2001); Rost I, 507 F. 3d at 732- 33 & n. 9. Of course, the closer and clearer the nexus between the company's conduc t and the subm ission of the claim to the government, the more compelling the case will be. For example, in an off -label marketing case, it would appear impossible to find a nexus between the company's cond uct and the false claim if the doct or prescribed a drug for an of f-label use base d on legitimate in dependent studies su pporting the off- label use, without ever hear ing abou t the use from the company's employees or company-paid speakers. On the other hand, it sh ould be easy to show a nexus in a case where the doct or obta ined all of the off-label information from the company's sales representative and the doctor's prescriptions increased af ter hear ing the sales representative's off-label pitch. Naturally, the evidence in most cas es will fall som ewhere between these two extremes and it w ill sometimes be a judgment call whe ther the evidence is sufficient to tie the defendant's conduct to the su bmission of the fal se cl aims. In cases under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(2 ) or (3 ), it should be shown that th e company was aware that claims woul d be subm itted to the United States based on the company's mar keting conduct. See Allison Engi ne, 128 S. Ct. at 2126. As the Allison Engine opinion is new, it is not entirely cle ar what type of evidence the courts will require in this regard. In the pharmaceutical fraud arena, possibilities might include: Evidence that the company was aware that a feder al heal th care progr am paid for substantial am ounts of the drug at issue; The company provided assistance to patients and doct ors seeking reimbursement from federal health care programs; or The company atte mpted to get state Medicaid agenci es, Medicare contractors, or similar entities to cove r the off-label use of the drug. C. Dam ages It goes without saying that the amount of monetary harm to the government is an important factor in assessing any FCA case. In the off-labelJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 5arena, it should be r emembered that the dam ages do not necessarily include all of the mone y that the government has paid for off-label sales. Again, it is important to show a nexus between the defendant's conduc t and the subm ission of the claim. For example, the evidence may show that a certain amount of off-l abel prescriptions were written completely independent of the company's marketing prac tices. However, just because a company's off-label marketing prac tices stopped at a certain point does not mean t he dam ages stopped at the same time. If su pported by the evidence, it can b e argued that cont inued cl aims to feder al programs for off-label uses were the residual result of past marketing practices. Additional concerns apply in Medicare Part A cases. Since Part A pays a set price for inpatient stays under the diagnosis-related grouping (DRG) system, it is unlikely that the typical off-label case will include damages to the Part A program. On the othe r hand, it is important to check for f alse claim s to v arious programs, an d not just M edicare and M edicaid. The Department of Veterans Affairs, TRICARE (military health plan), and the Feder al Employee Health Benef its Program can have sign ificant damages in p harmaceu tical cases. In kickback ca ses, calculating dam ages can present a challenge. It is certainly possible to argue that the government was damaged by the total amount of paid claims that were achieved by kickbacks , even if medically neces sary services were rendered. The Seventh Circuit's opinion in Rogan , although predicated mainly on the Stark Amendment rather than the AKA, supports this damages methodology. See Rogan , 517 F.3d at 453 ( \"The g overnment offers a subsidy (from the patients' perspective, a form of insurance), with conditions. When the conditions are not satisfied, nothing is due. Thus the entire amount that Edge water received on these 1,812 c laims mus t be paid back.\") This methodology is co nsistent with longstanding FCA law in other ty pes of h ealth care fraud cases. See, e.g., United States v. Mackby, 339 F.3d 1013, 1017 (9th Cir. 2003); Peterson v. Weinberger, 508 F.2d 45, 49 (5th Cir. 1975); see generally United States v. Woodbury, 359 F. 2d 370, 379 (9th Cir. 1966) (\"O rdinarily the measure of the government's damages woul d be the amountthat it p aid out by rea son of the false statements over and above wha t it woul d have paid if the claims had been truthful.\") However, in a criminal case, the Eleventh Circuit found t hat the amounts paid on cl aims arising from kickbacks were not a loss to th e Medicare program. Medina, 485 F.3d at 1 304 (11th Cir. 2007). D. Saf ety Finally, all of the other factors can be overshadowed by the potential for patient harm. For example, in an off-label case, safety concerns with the off -label use at issue can make a case extremely compelling. On the other end o f the spectrum, if th e drug has no safety issues and is actually effective for the off-label use, that does not provi de a legal defe nse but it probab ly makes the case much less compelling. A similar analysis can b e applied to kickback ca ses. For exam ple, the pharmaceutical company may be paying doctors to write prescriptions at a d angerously high rate or in patient populations that implicate safety issues. While the absence of safety concerns does not negate the kickbacks, their presence would generally make the case more worthwhile to pu rsue. It goes without saying that when a case brings serious safety concerns to the government's attention, it is incumbent upo n the government to address the safety issues in some way, whether via the FC A or otherwise.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091Sara W inslow is a Deputy Chief of the Civil Division in the Northern District of California. She special izes i n False C laims Act cases, including pharmaceutical and other health care fraud matters.a6 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009The Office of Cons umer Litigation and Recent Pha rmaceutical Com pany Settlements Eugene Thirolf Director Office of Consumer Litigat ion I. Introduct ion Over the last 3 years, the pharmaceutical indus try has paid mor e than $2 bi llion to the United States to settle Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and False C laims Act (FCA) charges. The c riminal fines and civil settlements resulting in these large sums of money have gener ated an important public heal th debate and raised significant interest in the media and Congress. The publicity can be h ighly favor able or significantly skep tical of the govern ment's act ions. Simply put, these Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cases involve a mix of scientific, medical, and public health issues. Unlike m ost fraud cases, the interplay of those considerations can create disagreement among concer ned parties and draw the spotlight of the media and Congress. Like wise, because t hese crimes can directly affect the public health, the failure to aggressively investigate and prosecute may lea d to unacceptable risks to the public. The Of fice of Consumer Litigation (OCL) deals with FDA cases every day and its attorneys can help assess these types of cases and hi ghlight many of the factors that may not be immediately apparent when a ca se is initially referred to a United States Attorney's office. This article responds to numer ous requests by Assistant United S tates Attorneys (AUSAs) to pu blicize OCL and these pharmaceutical industry recoveries. II. Backg round OCL is in the Civil Division of the Department of Justice (Department). The attorneys in this section are directed to prosecute both crim inal an d civil cas es. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.45(j). The office is both a resource for AUSAs faced with cases arising un der a variety of feder al consu mer prot ection statutes and a reviewer of proposed enforcem ent actions under those statutes. A substantial number of AUSAs have worked with OCL but many others a re not aware of the section's services. This article shows how United S tates Attorneys' offices can achieve significant results wor king with OCL. OCL has been the component of Main Justice with responsibility for civil and criminal litigation unde r the FDCA. OCL wa s established in 1971 and has per formed its consu mer prot ection functions since 1984 in the Civil Division. OCL works closely with the FD A, the Depar tment of Health and Human S ervices Office of Inspect or General, United States A ttorneys' offices across the country, and the Civil Frauds Section of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division. The settlements discussed below involve so- called off-label mar keting activities by drug companies. OCL typically becomes involved in these off-label marketing investigations either because a m atter is referred to it by the FDA or a qui tam complaint includes an allegation that the FDCA was violated . Thes e large civil and criminal prosecutions involving violations of the FDCA are approved by the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division, who oversees both OCL and the Civil Frauds Section.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 7III. Off-label violations What is an off-label marketing violation? In 2005 a t the Second A nnua l Pha rma, Biotech and Device Colloquim at Princeton University, then- Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, discussed wha t off-label drug promotions could be violations. The framework that the Associate Attorney Gener al set forth in his speech cont inues to guide t he Depar tment's enfor cement activities in this area . FDA approves drugs for sp ecific uses. A doctor in his or her own medical judgment may prescribe a drug for a use not approved by the FDA. That does not, however, mea n that a drug company or manuf acturer may mar ket and promote i ts products for suc h unapproved uses. While the Department does not have the authority, nor does i t seek it, to regul ate the pra ctice of medicine, it d oes have the responsibility to enfor ce the laws involving the distribution of pharmaceutical drugs i n interstate commerce. The di fficult question from a law enforcement perspect ive is: What activity regarding off-label claims constitu tes ille gal promotion and merits enforcement action? It is a very important practical question with implications for: What drugs w ill be p rescribed for what illnesses; What uses the taxpayers will pay for; How the govern ment will safeguard patients; and How the government will mai ntain the integrity of th e drug approval process. The question of w hat co nstitutes il legal off- label promotion is also one that the Department believes m ust be answered on a case- by-case basis. There are no si mple formulas that can govern enforcement decisions in this area and there i s no substitute for caref ul, case- by-case consi deration of all relevant information. That said, one w ay to illustrate what cond uct may result in Depar tment enfor cement action is to look at the facts of matters that have resulted in prosecution. Several of the major settlements of the last few years are described below todemonstrate how cases were evaluated an d what the settlements entailed. IV. Cephal on, Inc. In September 2008, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Cephalon, Inc., pled guilty and paid $425 million to resolve criminal and civil char ges in conn ection with the company's illegal promotion of three drugs\u2014Actiq, Gabitril, and Provigil. United States v. Cephal on, Inc., 2:08- CR-00598 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 29, 2008). Actiq is an extremely potent pain-killer that is d elivered in the form of a lollipop. The FDA approved Actiq for use only in opioid-tolerant cancer patients and only for patients with so-called \"b reakthrough pain.\" The Information alleged t hat Cephalon improperly p romoted Actiq for noncancer pain uses such as injuries and mi graines. The Information alleged that Cephalon's mana gement directed its sa les force to visit d octors who, due to the nat ure of their prac tices, norm ally would not prescribe Cephalon's drugs. The visits were designed to convince the doctors to prescribe the drugs for off-label uses. For example, the Actiq label indicated that the drug was for opioid tolerant cancer patients with brea kthrough cancer pain, to be prescribed by on cologists or pain speci alists familiar with opioi ds.

V. Serono Laborat ories In Janu ary 2006, in the District of Massachusetts, S erono Laboratories pled guilty and paid $704 million to resolve criminal and civil charges in connection with illeg al schemes to promote an d sell S erostim. United States v. Serono Laboratories, Inc., 1:05-CR-10282- 001- RCL (D. Mass. Oct. 1 8, 2005). In 1996 the FD A granted acce lerated ap proval for Serostim solely for use i n treating Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) wasting, which at the time was one of the leading causes of8 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009death among AIDS pa tients. Serostim came on the market at the same time as protease inhibitor drugs. When protease inhibitor drugs were used in combination with one another as an \"AIDS cock tail,\" they dramatically curtailed the progress of AIDS. As a result, the incidence and preva lence of AIDS was ting began to mar kedly decline and the demand for Serostim dropped significantly immediately following its launch. Serono Labs then began engagi ng in a marketing and sales campaign to redef ine AIDS wasting to create a market for Serostim. Serono Labs pled guilty to charges that the company conspi red w ith medical devi ce manufacturer, RJL Sciences , to market bioe lectrial impedance analysis (B IA) computer so ftware packages for use in calculating body cell mas s and diagnosing AIDS was ting. The BIA device and accompanying software devi ces had not been cleared by FDA for these uses. In fact, full premarket approval would have been required before the devi ces coul d have been marketed as tools for mea suring body cell mas s or diagnosing a disease. Serono Labs conspired with RJL to increase the market for the devices/software in order to in crease the market for S erostim. Serono Labs employees also directly adm inistered B IA tests to pat ients to induce doctors to prescribe Serostim and to get Medicaid agencies and o ther payers to reimburse for the drug. Additionally, S erono Labs pled guilty to kickback violations resulting from offering physicians an al l expense- paid trip to a medical conference in Cannes, France. In return, the doctors were to write up t o 30 ne w pr escriptions of Serotism, which cost $21,000 per cours e of treatment, for a total value to Serono of $630, 000 per doctor. Finally, in 2008 the former Medical Director of Serono Laboratories pled guilty to three counts of causing the dissemination of the adulterated computer software devices used to interpret the BIA test results in order to diagnose AIDS wasting and to increase sales of an AIDS was ting drug. United States v. Muurahani an, 1:08-CR- 10182-JGD (D. Mass. Jun. 19, 2008). However,four oth er fo rmer Serono executives were acquitted in Boston on various conspiracy and kickback charges. VI. Other cas es Bristol-Meyers Squibb's drug, Abilify, was approved for treatment of adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Purdue Ph arma's drug, OxyContin, was approved for management of severe pain in speci fic instances . In the Western District of Virginia, in May 2007, Purdue pled guilty to felony misbranding charges relating to misrep resentations it made to h ealth care provide rs that OxyContin was less ad dictive, l ess subject to abuse and diversion, and less likely to cause withdrawal problems than other pain medications.

Pe\u00f1a Assistant Unit ed States Attorney and Criminal Health Ca re Fraud Co ordinator District of C olorado I. Introduct ion This arti cle fo cuses on factors p rosecutors must consider whe n charging and pr osecuting manufacturers, importers, distributors, corporate entities, pharmacies, pharmacists, sales repre sentatives, and doct ors of criminal offenses associated wi th illegal human growth ho rmone (hGH). II. Backg round s urroundi ng legal and illegal uses of hGH Hardly a week goes by that the new s is not riddled with stories involving the misuse of hGH by athletes, bodybuilders, actors, and people just seekin g a \"fou ntain of y outh.\" In recen t years, antidoping scan dals have affect ed the way almost all p rofessional an d amateur ath letic endeavors are viewed. Athletes look to performance enhancing drugs in an effort to gain an edge over their competition. They weigh the benefit of athletic accolades f avor ably against the shame associated with getting caught in a doping scand al. Many of these athletes face criminal pros ecution for cond uct associated w ith the illicit use of performance enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids and hGH. Body builders often use hGH becau se competitors believe that, when combined with anabolic steroids, it w ill ra pidly build muscle mass and reduce the amount of time needed for the bod y to heal itself. Athletes, such as bodybuilders, who are subject to antidoping testing have been keenly aw are that prior to this year no accurate test existed to confirm its use. Itis, therefore, an ideal substance to escape oversight and scrutiny from antidoping offi cials. In recent years, participants in the antiaging movem ent have em braced the use of hGH to slow the affects of aging on t he human body. Claims of decreased pain and increased strength and stamina are not uncommon. Users typically try to retrofit hGH's antiagin g qualities into a very narrow use that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved relatin g to th e trea tment of rare p ituitary tumors. Despite the claims of legitimacy fro m this sector of users, however, a generalized antiaging application for hGH is not recogni zed as safe or FDA approved. As discussed below, any \"off- label\" or unapproved u ses of hGH violate feder al statu tes. While hG H may benefit user s, its improper or unregu lated use al so carr ies numerou s risks. Clinical research has not identified all of the side effects, as researcher s have completed on ly a few studies into the long-term effects of hGH on the body. Researchers have linked the use of hGH with an increased chance of d evelop ing diabetes, arthritis, and carpal tu nnel sy ndrome. M ore dramatically, authorities fear an i ncreased ri sk of stimulating the g rowth of can cer cel ls. Additionally, hGH is known to ca rry cont aminants. Those who dis pense un approved and unt ested hG H may also be dispensing bacteria, yea st toxins, or other substances to which a pat ient may show coun ter indication. For this reason, the FDA inspects manuf acturing facilities as part of its oversight authority.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 11III. Common sources of hGH A. FDA approved m anuf acture rs and legal uses of hGH Ther e are legitimate manuf acturers and distributors of hGH operating in th e United States. Some domestic manufacturers produce a synthetic hGH called re combinant hGH, which act s just like the hG H produ ced n aturally in a healthy human body. Thes e companies comply with the application and approval process manda ted by the Food, Drug, and C osmetic Act (FDCA), Pub. L. No. 110- 243, ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040 (codified in scattered sections of 21 U.S.C.). The FDA regulates th e approval process fo r the manufacture and use of hGH in the United States pursuant to the FDCA, and recognizes only six narrowly defined indications for hGH in this cou ntry. Those indications are for the following genet ic or medical conditions: Hormonal deficien cy that ca uses short statu re in children; Long-term treatment of growth failure due to lack of exogenous growth hormone secretion; Long-term treatment of sh ort statu re associated with Turner syn drome; Adult short bowel syn drome; Adult deficien cy due to ra re pituitary t umors or their treatment; and Muscle-wasting disease associated with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the \"off-label\" or unapproved u ses of hGH, such as b odybuilding or a ntiaging, are illegal. B. Overseas m anuf acture rs not approved by FD A A significant regul atory and safety probl em arises when hGH is produced over seas in places such as China. Foreign manufacturers of hGH must obta in FDA approval prior to their produ ct becoming legal for distribution in the United States. To date, there are no FDA- approved Chinese m anufacturers of hGH becau sethere have been no inspections of manuf acturing facilities in China, and no new dr ug applications by any Chinese hG H manufacturers have been filed w ith and approved b y the FD A. Therefore, any Chinese hGH that enters the United States is imported and distributed \"contrary to law,\" as it constitutes contraband ab initio. Any prac titioner who dis penses Chinese hG H, even for approved uses, violates several feder al criminal statutes, as discussed herein. IV. Target defendants : Prosecut orial considerations Prosecutions of illicit distribution of hGH may range f rom an i ndividual distributor at a local gym to mass disb ursal facilitated by business entities and pharmacies. Cases centered on sophisticated distribution scen arios w ill almost always to uch upon both the complex and simple case scenarios. A prosecutor w ill likely discover a vertical chain of distribution from the manufacturer down t o the eventual end us er of the product. Typically, an over seas manufacturer produces the hGH and then ships it to d istributors in the United States. The distributor then sells the hGH to its customers, including pharmacies. The pharmacies then advertise and market the hGH to doctors an d patien ts domestically. Profit is substantial in every step of the distribution chain, because the markup on hGH is so great and the dosages involve such small amounts. An end us er can expect to pay around $55,000 for one gram of hGH, a profit m argin exceeding that of c rack cocaine. The stan dard dosage of hGH for children is higher than that for an ad ult, abou t 60-100 micrograms per kilogram of bod y weight per day. The standard dosage of hGH for adults is 7-8 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. The appropriate dosage decreases as a user ages, however, because of the poten tial side eff ects. A. The overse as m anuf acture r Due to its limited resources and the complexity of the global marketplace, the FDA rarely inspect s foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers. As mentioned in section III.B of12 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA the FD A has of any Ther efore, any drugs manuf actured in China that are subject to the application and approval process of the FDCA are not FDA approved and constitu te contraband when they are brought into the United States. This circumstance is particularly tro ubling given that counterfeit pharmaceuticals from fore ign countries are flooding the U nited States m arket . Many of these drugs have no active ph armaceutical ingredients at all. O verseas manufacturers often contract with importers from the United States to deliver cheap, unapproved, and uninspected pharmaceuticals to distribution point s inside the United S tates or directly to users through Internet orders. B. Th e importer /distributor As with traditional com merce, importers play a significant role in the distribution chai n of pharmaceuticals in the United S tates. Internet commerce enables importers to contract with more potential manuf acturers throughout the world. Because of the prof it motive associated with this business, an i mporter will often look f or the cheapest product on the market. Some importers intentionally mislead authorities as to the true nature of the substance in order to avoid detection by im port officials. To the untrained eye many pharmaceu ticals look iden tical to oth erwise legal substances . These substances are mislabeled to avoid confiscation as they enter the United States. Coupled wi th the obvious overwhelming amount of co mmerce that en ters the United States every day, it is not surprising that so much international, uninspected hGH enters the United States illegally. C. The phar macy-corporate criminal, civil, and ad ministrative liabil ity Pharmacies , including Internet pharmacies , act as legitimate retailers of FDA-approved hGH that they dispense l egally. Many such on line or catalog ph armacies cond uct themselves in an ethical and responsible way, but others choose to skirt th e law in order to bring a cheaper product to the market. These rogue pharmacies are motivatedby greater prof it, not the safety of the produ ct they sell. Prosecutors mus t unde rstand the hierarchy within a target pharmacy in order to determine who makes the contractual decisions relating to the sources of hGH, whether from over seas or importers in the United States. Pha rmacies in the United States co me in all different sizes and vary in terms of corporate complexity. They range from the nat ionally recogni zed chai ns to Internet pharmacies to the local mom a nd po p storefront pharmacies. Regardless of their size or structure, all pharmacies have someone within their structure directly responsible for obtaining the pharmaceuticals they sell . That person, whether a pharmacist or not, is a critical link in the evidence necessary to prove the know ledge ot hers may have abou t the legality of the substances dispensed, including hGH. V. The pharm acy as a b usiness organi zation A. Corporat e criminal expos ure Like the manuf acturer and importer, both the pharmacy that sells illicit hGH and its owners may have criminal, civil, and adm inistrative exposur e. Corporate criminal exposure is subject to the Principles of Federal Prosecu tion of Business Organi zations that was incorporated into the Unites States Attorneys' Manual (USAM) in August 2008. Section 9-28-300 of the USAM enum erates a nonexhaustive list of considerations for prosecu tors of business en tities: The nat ure and seriousnes s of the offense, including the risk of harm to the publ ic, and applicable policies and priorities, if any, gover ning the pros ecution of corporations for particular categories of crime; The pe rvasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation, including the complicity in, or the condoning of, the wrongdoing by corporate management; The corporation's history of similar misconduct, including prior criminal, civil, and regulatory en forcement actions against it;JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 13The corporation 's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate in the investi gation of its agen ts; The e xistence and effectiveness of the corporation's pre-existing com pliance program; The c orporation's remedial actions, including any efforts to implement an ef fective corporate compliance progr am or to improve an existin g one, to replace responsible management, to discipline or terminate wrongdoers, to pay res titution, and to cooperate with the relevant government agen cies; The c ollateral consequences, including whether there is disproportionate harm to shareholders, pension ho lders, employees, and others not proven personally culpable, as well as impact on the publ ic arising from the prosecution; The adequacy of the pros ecution of individuals responsible for the corporation's malfeasance; and The adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory enforcement action s. Prosecutors must apply these considerations, as well as the other guidance provided by the USAM, whe n determining whe ther to subject the pharmacy under investigation to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. The consequences of a criminal pros ecution could be cat astrophic to a p harmacy or b usiness entity. Aside from a potential fine, the Drug Enforcement Administration may bar a pharmacy convi cted of a felony offense f rom further dispensing controlled substances. The entity could also be subject to exclusion from participation in feder al progr ams like M edicare that are financial mainstays of the business. If the business i s a publicly-traded entity, the pros ecution will impact shareholders who may not have been aware of any wrongdoing. In short, a criminal pros ecution may be a de facto death penalty to a b usiness entity. B. Pharmacists\u2014indiv idua l criminal and profession al liab ility In relatively small pharmacy operations, the pharmacist in charge may also be the owner of the business entity. In larger opera tions, the pharmacy under investigation coul d be a s mall subsidiary of a much larger business entity. Under either scen ario, pharmacists are subject to the ru les, regul ations, and ethical responsibilities promulgated by state licensi ng boards. In addition to a one-time fine or imprisonm ent, a convi ction may also result in sanctions from their licensing board. Because pharmacists are a necessary component to the large scale distribution of cont raban d hGH, their pros ecution is a key choke point to deter the distribution of illicit hGH and steroids. The deterrent effect of prosecuting professional, lic ensed pharmacists is substantial, and criminal and adm inistrative exposur e may compel these p rofes sionals to cooperate again st other m ore cu lpable act ors. Pharmacists are key to illicit hGH distribution cases because t hey are in the best posi tion to stop the distribution of h GH for off -label, illegal u ses. They are familiar with the rules and regulations relevant to dispensing drugs; They are in a position to examine the dispensing histories for patients; They rev iew prescriptions and are often able to determine whe ther they are valid; and They deal directly with physicians or patients. Most pharmacists are able to d eterm ine off- label usage by reviewing the dispensing history for patients. In an h GH case, a pharmacist can determine if a patient's dispensing history is within the approved uses. Further, a pharmacist usually has the ability to contact physicians to confi rm the validity of pres criptions that appear suspect. Like other professionals, p harmacists are acutely aware of the manner in which users abuse the drugs they dispense. The massive profit potential of off-label hGH distribution should not taint their professional judgment.14 UNITED S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009C. Sales repre sentatives Sales representatives are often paid on a commission basi s or have an i ncentive-structured compensation package. Thei r mot ivation in selling the company's product is almost entirely based on selling as much as possible in order to maximize their income. The representations they make to potential customers may bind the company and may constitu te admissions. Advertising materials the sales rep resentatives use to attract b usiness are often, but not always, sanctioned by officers of the distributor. The repre sentations used to induce new cust omers are valuable evidence i n framing a fraud theory of criminal liability. Additionally, sales representatives are well trained and k now the approved u ses for hGH. Last ly, because s ales representatives rely on guidance from persons with technical expertise, like pharmacists, the information they provide regarding communications with person s in the business entity will help establish the knowledge and intent elements of federal violations by both individuals and businesses. D. Legitimate customers: doc tors and patients Physicians are unique in the distribution chain because they can dispense hG H, or direct that pharmacists do so, via pre scriptions. Doctors have criminal liability if they know ingly dispense or aid the dispen sing of unapproved h GH for unapproved uses or without a valid prescription. Like their patients, however, they may be victims of misrepre sentations by the pharmacy or distributor if the hGH dispensed is not FDA approved. Patients are rarely the focus of feder al prosecution. If they are usi ng the hG H for any of the six approved purposes, they are unlikely to possess the sophistication to dis tinguish between legal and illegal hGH. The end user usually relies on the expertise of professionals lik e pharmacists and doct ors to provi de legal, approved pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, patients who unwi ttingly use illegal hGH will not realize the benefits of th e leg itimate su bstance if they are taking a subpotent, contaminated, or counterfeitdrug. The dan ger that the unapproved sub stance they are taking may actually cause them harm is substantial. E. Illegitimate customers: Athletes, body build ers, and t he antiaging movement Off-label use of hGH is rampant in the United States. Illegitimate users obtain their seemingly unlimited suppl y via domestic and foreign Internet distributors, d omestic im porters and distributors, and otherwise legitimate pharmacies. T he prescriptions that illegal users obtain may be invalid for a vari ety of reason s. Physicians m ay not issue pre scriptions without an examination or valid phy sician-patient relationship. Forgery an d fraud are also rife within this sector of user s. Although they assume a greater risk than the pat ients who use hG H for legitimate on-label purposes, illeg itimate custom ers a re victims if they believ e they are buying FDA-approved h GH, when in truth they may rec eive unapproved hGH that is contaminated, subpoten t, or cou nterfeit. These customers are valuable sources of information regarding the mar keting and representations made by salesmen and distributors. Of course, these types of victims are less sympathetic to a jury and will be subject to great scruti ny on cross- examination. VI. The indictment: Charging the ca se A. Distribution and po ssession wit h the intent to distribute hGH (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(e) ) There are a number of similarities between controlled substances cases an d hGH cases. Most obvious is the fact that steroid use and illicit hGH use go hand-in-glove in the athletic arena. A prosecutor may see both substances intertwined in the facts of a particular case. It is im portant to note, however, that while anabolic steroids, including testosterone cypionate and testosterone prepionate, are Sch edule III cont rolled sub stances subject to the Controlled Subs tances Act, Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1242 (1970) (codified in scattered sections of 21 U.S.C.), hGH is not a listed controlled substance, and the FDCAJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 15primarily gov erns its illegal d istribution. A close examination of the provisions of each Act dealing with illegal distribution of the respective substances revea ls striking similarities between the provisions. Suc h similarities are important because the case law relative to the Controlled Substances Act is well devel oped in com parison to that of the relevant portions of the FDCA. Both provi sions recogni ze a felony criminal violation for either the distribution or posse ssion with the intent to distribute their respective illicit substance. The main distinction between the two is in the defenses for a violation. Whereas the Controlled Subs tances Act has separate provisions that legitimize distribution by approved persons (doctors and pharmacies) pursuant to valid prescriptions, the FDCA incorporates its \"sa fe harbor\" within the same provisions defining the violation. Prohibited D istribution of Human Growth Hormone, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(e) (2 003), provides that: [W]hoever know ingly distributes, or possesses with intent to dis tribute, human growth horm one for any use i n humans ot her than the treatment of a disease or other recogn ized medical condition, where s uch use has been authorized b y the Secr etary of Health and H uman Se rvices unde r section 355 . . . a nd pursuant to the order of a physician, is guilty of [prohibited distribution of human growth hormone]. . . . The t erm \"hum an mea ns somatrem, somatropin, or an anal ogue of either of them. The elements of distribution or posse ssion with the intent to distribute hGH are: First: the def endant know ingly or intentionally distributed or possessed wi th the intent to dis tribute human growth h ormone for use in humans ; and Second: the distribution or possession with the intent to distribute human growth hormone in humans was (a) not for the treatment of a disease or other recogni zed medical condition as authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human S ervices, or(b) was not approved b y the Secr etary of Health and Human Services (or the FDA) pursuan t to the application and approval proces s of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355, or was not (c) pursuant to a valid order of a p hysician . With the exception of the defenses already discussed, this provision tracks the same statu tory langu age of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841-843 (2006) of the Controlled S ubstances Act. The elements of the two offe nses are nearly identical. B. The safe ha rbor requirements as a defense There are three conditions that must be met in order fo r a d efendant to avail h imself of the \"safe harbor\" provision of th e statu te. First, he mus t possess the hGH for one of the six approved uses; Second, the FDA mus t have approved the specific hGH in que stion, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 ( relating to the application and approval of new dr ugs); and Third, the defendant mus t have dispensed the hGH pursuant to the order of a p hysician . As discussed above, any off-label use of the hGH bars the application of the safe harbor provision. The second condition requires that the FDA approve the particular kind of hGH at issue. This means that the prosecutor must investigate its origin to determine whe ther it complies with the FDCA application and approval proce ss for new drugs. Many overseas manuf acturers, including Chinese manufacturers, produce and distribute unapproved hGH that is n ot in compliance with the FDCA's application and approval proce ss. The third prong of the safe har bor provi sion requires an \"order of a physician,\" i.e., a valid prescription. In order to be val id, a prescription must include a license d doct or's order for medicine that an actual patien t really needs. A prescription is not valid if th e doctor fails to examine or consult with the patient. The exam ination or supervision must involve active, good-faith participation in the doctor's professional capacity. A prescription that fails to16 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009meet this standard is merely \"a phony piece of paper sig ned by a doctor for d rugs.\" United States v. Nazir, 211 F. Supp. 2d 1372, 1375-77 (S.D. Fla. 2002). Open purchase agreements, often re ferred to as stocking agreements, are not valid prescriptions and cannot in good fa ith be an \"ord er of a physician\" as t he statute envisions. C. The \"compound ing\" defense In recent years, com pounding ph armacies have attempted to rely on st ate def initions to carve out defenses to the FDCA. They assert that the Act excludes compounde d drugs from the application and approval process of the Act. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(a) (2004). They als o turn to broad state definitions that equate compoundi ng to, among other things, \"labeling\" or \"repackagi ng.\" However, the United S tates Supreme Court ruled on what const itutes \"compoundi ng\" unde r the FDCA in Thompson v. Western States M ed. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357 (2002). The Court explained that [d]rug compoundi ng is a process by whi ch or doct or com bines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Compounding is typically used to p repare medications that are not commercially available, such as medi cation for a patient who is allergic to an ingred ient in a m ass- produced product. Id. at 360-61; see also M ed. Ctr. Pharmacy v. Mukasey , 536 F.3d 383 (5th The Livdahl court dismissed a pharmacy's argument that state laws should define the compounding process. Id. at 1264. In the Med. Ctr. Pharmacy v. Mukasey case, the Fif th Circuit recogni zed t hat com pounded drugs are new drugs, subject to the application and approval proce ss of the FD CA. In prac tice, prosecutors mus t examine whe ther the final drug product is compounded pursuan t to the feder al definition. If it is not com pounded, no further analysis is necessary. Compounde d concoctions are subject to the new dr ug provisions in the FDCA, how ever, and may prom pt furtherprosecutorial action . Med. Ctr. Pharmacy, 536 F.3d at 3 95-97. D. Facilitation of the sale of sm uggled goods or receiving smuggled goods (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545) ( 2006) In order to fu lly asse ss th e criminal ex posure of persons in the chain of d istribution, prosecutors must be wary of the country of origin of the hGH at issue. If the hGH violates provisions of the FDCA, including \u00a7\u00a7 331( a) (prohibiting the introduction into in terstate co mmerce of a misbranded drug), 352( f)(1) (relating to causing the introduction into in terstate co mmerce of a misbranded drug in that it faile d to bear adequate directions for use), 331( d) (prohibiting the introduction into interstate commerce of an article that is in violation of \u00a7 355) , and \u00a7 355 (prohibiting the introduction into interstate commerce of a new drug w ithout proper application and approval), then its importation into the United S tates is \"cont rary to law\" under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 (2006). The introduction of merchandise in to in terstate co mmerce is \"c ontrary to law\" when it is \" illegal merchandise\" by its very n ature. See United States v. Garcia-Paz, 282 F.3d 1212, 1214 (9th Cir. 2002); see a lso United States v. Mitchell, 39 F. 3d 465, 468- 69 (4th Cir. 1994) . Merchandise is \"illegal\" whe n the merchandise itself violates state or federal law, including 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 3 52(f)(1 ), 331(d), or \u00a7 355, as se t forth previously. Defendants violate the smuggling statute when they facilitate the sale of a smuggled good or receive a smuggled good that has been brought into th e United States \"c ontrary to law .\" It is hard to imagine how any of the individuals in the distribution chai n of cont raban d hGH would not have some criminal exposure if they knew the hGH they distributed w as from a coun try of origin, like C hina, that has no m anufacturers that make FDA-approved hGH. The elements of Facilitating the Sal e of Smuggled Goods (or R eceivi ng Smuggled Goods) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 (2006), are as follows:JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 17First: hG H was imported or brought into the United States contrary to law in that it violated one or more of the federal statutory provisions noted above; and Second: the defendant received, bought, sold, or facilitated the sale of hGH knowing that it had been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law. E. Entry of goo ds by means of fal se state ments (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 542) ( 1996) Prosecutors should also investigate the mea ns by whi ch contraband hG H is imported. Manufacturers and importers of foreign-made hGH may have brought the hormone into the United S tates by means of false decl arations or statements. Additionally, persons in the distribution chain mak e false statements about the true nature of drugs and pharmaceuticals to avoid detection and confiscation of their contraband by Immi gration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) inspector s and FDA inspector s. Section 542 also provides that defe ndants who know ingly receive smuggled goods that entered the United States by means of false statements are subject to criminal liability. Similar to narc otics cases, a prosecutor will establish a con tinuing cri minal business relationship between suspects, and thus will lik ely develop evidence of know ledge as to the manner in which hGH was brought into th e country. A thorough investigation wi ll reveal defendants who receive contraban d hGH with know ledge of how it was brough t here at each st ep of the distribution chain. The e lements of Receiving Smuggled Goods that Entered by Means of False Statements in violation of T itle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 542 are as follows: First: The defendants received hG H in the United States; Second: The defendants knew that the hGH should have been declared or reported to customs authorities as required by law; Third: The defendants acted knowingly; and Fourth: The def endants did something which was a substantial step toward receiving the hGH. F. Mail fraud , wire fraud, and health care fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 (2008) , 1343 (2008) and 1347 (1996)) Prosecutors should consider the federal fraud statutes to establish cr iminal liability in most large scale distributions of hGH, especially if the distribution chai n includes established businesses like corporate distributors and pharmacies. When considering whe ther to charge any of the fraud statutes in an indictment, a prosecu tor sho uld ask some pre liminary questions before making a final decision about the use of th e mail fraud, wire fraud, or h ealth care frau d statu tes. P relim inary determinations should include the hGH's origin, entry, and FDA approval status, as discuss ed above. Spe cific to \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343, and 1347, the represen tations distributors m ade to customers, the FDA, or health care benefit programs regarding the legality of the particular hGH, and a determ ination if any of th e statem ents were patently false or contained mat erial omissions may rev eal additional wrongdoing chargeable under these provisions. Any investigation should also include how defendants used mail or w ire systems to execute the scheme and whe ther the alleged vi ctims were par ticipants in the schem e. Cases involving large, established corporate entities or ph armacies will likely revea l false representations to customers, such as phy sicians and their patients. Usually, the persons who devise and implement the scheme to defraud profit the mos t from the fraudul ent conduc t, and representations made on behalf of corporate entities by officers or sales representatives may be imputed to the b usiness en tity. In such cases, evidence of profit mot ive will explain the relationships betwee n the individuals and the business entity. G. C onsp iracy ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) (1994) The tute found in Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 is an ideal prosecutorial tool in multidefendant prosecutions involving individuals and businesses along a vertical chai n of distribution of hGH. In all but the Tenth Circuit, the elements of the offense of conspi racy are as follows:18 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009First: The defendant agreed wi th at least one other person to violate the law; Second: One of the conspirators engaged in at least one overt act furthering the consp iracy's objective; Third: The def endant knew the essential objective of the conspiracy; and Four th: The defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated. In the prosecution of hGH cases involving multiple targets or defe ndants, pros ecutors can apply the general conspiracy statute to the offenses discuss ed in this article, including: The Di stribution or Possession wi th the Intent to Distribute Human Growth Hormone (Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(e)) (2 003); The Faci litation of the Sal e (or Receipt) of Smuggled Goods (Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 545) (2006); The Ent ry of Merchandise into the United States by Means of False Statements (Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 542) (1996); Health Care Fraud (Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1347) Mail F raud \u00a7 1343) (2008). However, the maxi mum statutory penalty for the conspiracy charge, 5 years imprisonment, may be substantially less than the underlying substantive charges. Becau se hGH is not cl assified as a cont rolled sub stance, the specific conspiracy statute in the Controlled S ubstances Act, found at Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1998), does not apply to these types of c ases. H. Other off enses: Theories of crim inal liabi lity Aiding and ab etting. Similar to the general consp iracy statute, the underlying criminal offenses discuss ed ab ove go hand in glove with the aiding and abetting statute found in Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 2 ( 1951) . Simply stated, thelaw extends criminal liability to those who help in the commission of a substantive offense. Accessory after the fact. A target may also incur crim inal liability by being an accessory after the fact, pursuant to Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 3 (1994) , if he obstructs justice by assisting another person who committed the unde rlying crime, in order to hind er or preve nt that person's apprehension or p unishment. Misprision of a felony. Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 4 (1994) recogni zes an of fense of conceal ing or failing to noti fy authorities of the commission of a federal felony. Individuals, given the opportunity, must rep ort the commission of a federal felony to an appropriate authority. Pharmacies and their pharmacists cann ot simply bury their head s in the sand and not report federal criminal vio lations. Money laund ering. Title 18 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956 (2008) and 1957 (2006). Many of the above- discussed st atutes const itute specified unlawful activity (SUA) that may giv e rise to criminal liability pursuan t to the money laundering statutes. Charging money launde ring facilitates criminal forfeiture of the proceeds from criminal activity, as well as any property, real or personal, involved in the offense. Also, a finding of guil t on a m oney laundering coun t coul d provi de an enhancement at sentencing. Because of recent developments in money laundering law, prosecutors mus t be prepared to prove the proceeds from the SUA were profit. United States v. Sant os, 128 S. Ct. 2020 (2008). Other provisions of the FDCA. Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331 (2007) cont ains a list of violations that attach criminal liability, including \u00a7\u00a7 331( a) (prohibiting the introduction into in terstate co mmerce of a misbranded drug) and 331( d) (prohibiting the introduction into interstate commerce of an article that is in violation of \u00a7 355) (2008) (relating to the application and approval process fo r new drugs). T hese are misdem eanor offenses unless they involve anJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 19\"intent to defraud or m islead,\" in which case the additional element makes them 3-year maximum felonies. Title 21 U .S.C. \u00a7 333 (2003). VII. Criminal and ci vil forfeiture Most of the criminal statutes discuss ed ab ove have associated forfe iture provisions. However, because some substantive offenses offer only limited forfeiture, prosecutors mus t ensure that the criminal char ges address the entire criminal activity and that th e criminal forfe iture encompasses both \"facilitation property\" and \"proceeds\" of the criminal activity, along with the forfeiture of any cont raban d. Although criminal forfeiture may create joint and several liability, codefendants are entitled to credit for the amounts paid by others, n ot to exceed the tota l forfeitu re award. See United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Cleveland, 1997 WL 602186 * 3 (E.D. La. Sept. 29, (\"the United S tates . . . may not recover the full amount of the forfeiture proceeds from both defendants, although it may recover the entire amount from eith er of them.\"); United States v. McCarroll, 1996 WL 355371 *9 (N.D. Ill. June 25, 1996) (unpublished ) (\"although the government may only collect once on a forfeiture order, it may collect the entire amount from anyone who is held jointly and severally liable.\"); United States v. Loren-Maltese, 2003 WL 291910 * 2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 2003) (unpublished ) (\"the def endant will be gi ven an appropriate credit for amounts recovered from any jointly and severally liable co defendants.\"). Prosecu tors m ust also be prepared to address civil forfeiture as an alternate mea ns of obtaining a just result. Civil forfeiture allows the gover nment to add ress business organi zation misconduc t short of a criminal indictment and felony conviction that may close t he business doors. VIII. Sent encing The United States Sentencing Guidelines [hereinafter G uidelines] do not dir ectly address the computation of a sentence f or the distribution or possession with the intent to distribute hGH because hGH is not a cont rolled sub stance s ubject to the comput ations in the Gui delines. U.S. SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2D1.1 (2006) . If smuggling crimes are part of the theories o f crim inal liability, however, p rosecutors should argue that th e applicable ca lculations are those associated wi th smug gling crimes. U.S. SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2T3.1 (2006). Although hGH does not have a duty associated wi th it, U.S. SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2T3.1 cmt. n.2 ( 2006), allows for an alternate mea sure of the \"duty\" evaded to be computed by assessing 25 percent of the fair market value of the smuggled items. In United States v. Dall, 918 F.2d 52, 54 (8th Cir. 1990), the Eighth Circuit upheld a sentence calculated unde r Note 2. In that case, the defendant pled guilty to smuggling an animal drug (chloramphenicol, an antibiotic) into the United States in violation of th e FDCA. Id. at 53. The defendant declared the drugs and paid a duty on them, but he vi olated the law because, under the FD CA, the drugs were classified as adulterated. Id. The court did no t address the defendant's argument that the drugs were not harmful, but it held that his sentence, based on Note 2, was reasonable. Id. at 54. The fair market value of the hG H, an extr emely high- priced substance, w ill result in a su bstantial base off ense level under th is theory. As with other offenses , the Guidelines adju stments to the base offense l evel apply. For exam ple, if the crimes of convi ction involve multiple entities with different roles in the offense, a role adjustment to the base offense l evel may be warranted. See U.S. SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2T3.1 (2006). Similarly, a money launde ring conviction results in a 2-point offense level increase pursuant to U.S. SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2S1. 1(b)(2) (2006). The final sentence i n the pros ecution of these cases will be driven in large part by the20 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009offenses of conviction, whi ch in turn are driven by the offenses of indictment. IX. Concl usion Prosecutors must use e very available criminal theory of p rosecu tion to combat the mass distribution of illegal hGH. The criminal organi zations that distribute hG H, like those of traditional drug prosecutions, vary in size and complexity. These criminal organizations often involve otherwise legitimate businesses and individuals to dis tribute illicit hGH for huge profits. The charging decisions in these prosecutions will greatly influence t he sentences in these cases and the det errent effect on society.\u0098ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091Jaime A.

Roth Assistant U.S. Att orney District of Maine I. Introduct ion When prosecuting drug cases or health care fraud cases, the confidentiality of the unde rlying medical record s can be one of t he thorniest problems. In that regard , perhaps the most overlooked issue involves the unique confi dentiality rules for substance abu se medical records, which are governed by 42 C.F.R. Part II. The danger of noncompliance is particularly ac ute since violations may be p unished by criminal fines. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.4 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290ee-3(f), 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3(f)).The o ne thing to remember about the confidentiality of substance abuse medi cal records is that they are \"double secret;\" in other wor ds, the unique confidentiality rules are in addi tion to those prom ulgated as part of the Health Insurance Portability and A ccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 45 C.F.R. Part 164. Over t he past several years, pros ecutors have been l ulled into a false se nse of se curity because grand jury subpo enas, Inspector General (IG) subpo enas, and search warrants are routinely used to trump HIPAA's requirements. 45 C. F.R. \u00a7 164. 103. Those time-honored techn iques, how ever, will not succeed wi th substance abuse records. Instead, grand jury subpoenas and search warrants are typically the beginning, not the end, of the process.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 21For those who prosecute drug and health care fraud cases, anot her important devel opment is that substance abuse treatment medi cal records are no longer lim ited to methadone clinics and pain specialists. I nstead, as a re sult of re cent statutory and regul atory amendments, gener al prac tice doctors may treat substance abu se patients in an office-based set ting with drugs s uch as Suboxone/Buprenorphine, which are typically used for heroin addiction. 21 C. F.R. Parts 1301 and 1306. The growing use of office-based substance abuse treatment mea ns that the unique confidentiality rules apply in settings that, until recently, were only protected by HIPAA. Strategic considerations are also important because the confidentiality protections attach to the records themselves, which trigger s compliance consi derations every time there is a redisclosur e. Indeed, the records must be accompanied by a form al notice that prohibits redisclosure un less specifically authorized by the regulation. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.32. That requirement can com plicate an investigation as access to (and us e of) the records necessarily expands. See, e.g., 42 U .S.C. \u00a7 290dd- 2(d) (the substance abuse confidentiality restrictions apply even after the individual ceases to be a substance abuse patien t). This article provi des an over view of when you shou ld worry abou t the confidentiality of substance abuse records, how you may solve the problem, and what strategies you may employ. The art icle con cludes w ith a step-by-step case study of a parallel crim inal an d civil h ealth care fraud case that illustrates how the regulations apply at each stage of an investigation and prosecution. The case study is based on the parallel investigation and prosecution in United States v. Shinderman, 2006 W L 522105 (D. Me. M ar. 2 , 2006) (Recommended Decision), affirmed, 432 F.Supp.2d 149, affirmed, 515 F. 3d 5, 11-13 (1st Cir. 2008) , and United States v. CAP Quality Care, Inc., 486 F. Supp.2d 47 (D. Me. 2007).II. When y ou shoul d worry Since the substance abu se confi dentiality rules are challengi ng and only apply in a limited num ber of cases, you should begin by considering whether, in you r particular case, you can rule them out. It is best to begi n by consi dering that the substance abuse confidentiality rules only apply to tw o categori es of m edical record s. Accordingly, as a prosecutor, if the records you seek do n ot fall within either categor y, you do n ot have to worry about 42 C.F.R. Part II. The f irst category involves medi cal records for \"alcohol abuse,\" whi ch the regulations define broadly to include \"the use of an alcoholic beverage which impairs the physical, mental, emotional, or social well-being of the user.\" 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.11 (definition of a lcohol abuse). Practically speaking, that cove rs a wide variety of treatment for al cohol-related problems. Fortunately , however, fed eral drug and health care prosecutions rarely involve requests for alcohol abuse treatment record s. For mos t prosecutions, the far mor e important categor y involves medical records for drug ab use, which the regulations define as the \"use of a psychoact ive substance f or other than m edicinal purposes.\" 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 11 (definition of drug abuse). That definition is sufficiently broad to cover a wide variety of cases that are routinely prosecuted in federal court. Moreover, the definition creates somewhat of a Catch-22 for the prosecutor since it defi nes drug ab use in terms of the purpose behind the patient's use of drugs but that purpose is virtually impossible to d iscern without access t o the req uested record s. Accordingly, you need to err on t he side of caution and begi n your case with the assumption that the pat ient abused drugs f or a reason other than medicinal purposes. Even i f the requested re cords fall within either of those two categor ies, the confidentiality rules only apply if the practitioner or facility \"holds itself out as provi ding, and provi des, alcohol or drug abu se diagnosis, treatment or referral for treatm ent.\" 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.11 (definition of a program). Thus, the records of a p rimary care doctor who does not hold himself out as providing22 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009alcohol or drug abuse treatment woul d no t be cover ed. Similarly, the confidentiality rules do n ot apply to h ospitals (d efined as g eneral care facilities) except as to an identified uni t within the hospital that has a primary function of providing substance abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.11 (definition of program); Ctr. for Legal Advocacy v. E arnest, 320 F.3d 1107 (10th Cir. 2003) (the substance abuse confidentiality rules would not normally apply to an em ergency room). It is also helpful to remember that the confidentiality rules only ap ply to patient- identifying records. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.11. Medical records where pat ient nam es have been replaced with confidential patien t identification numbers are not cove red. As a result, depending on h ow your case proce eds and what information you truly need, you may be able to avoid the regulations by requesting records with the patient names redacted. One caution, however, is that the confi dentiality rules apply if there is information in the records from which the patient's identity may be determined, directly or indirectly, \"w ith reasonable accuracy and speed.\" 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 11 (definition of patient identifyin g). Relatedly, in the absence of consent or a court order, discuss ed below, the regu lations prohibit a su bstance ab use treatment facility from even acknowledging that a particular individual is a patient. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.13(c). You should also be on t he lookou t for cases that involve a crime by a patient on t he pre mises of the faci lity or a cr ime by a patient again st program personnel. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.12(c)(5). In those circumstances, the confidentiality rules do not apply. T he exception is lim ited, however, to allow communication wi th law enforcement regarding the circumstances of the incident and the pat ient's whereabou ts. Beyond that narr ow categor y access is not permitted by \u00a7 2.12(c)(5 ). III. How you can sol ve the probl em Having worked t hrough the various categor ies when the confidentiality rules do n ot apply, you are pre sumably faced with a situation in whichyou need to obta in access to confi dential substance abuse medical records in order to further your investi gation. When that happens, you need one of two things: compulsion or permission. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.3(b)(1). Either alone is insufficient. The most co mmon form s of compulsion are search w arrants and subpoenas. You do n ot necessarily need a grand jury subpoena\u2014an IG subpoena will do. A HIPAA subpoena is equally effective. In terms of perm ission, the regul ations offer three options. The first is patient consent. But even in cases whe n you have a cooperative patient who is willing to provi de a signed con sent, do n ot make the mistake of relying on a generic consent form. Instead, under the regulations, you need to use a very specific consent form that includes details about the purpose of the disclosure, the documents to be disclosed, and the individuals who will have access. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.31. In short, you must foll ow the sample co nsent form provided in the regulations. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.31(b). One twist is that the substance abuse consent form, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.31 (b), was prom ulgated before HIPAA imposed additional requirements for medi cal consent forms, 45 C. F.R. \u00a7 164. 508. The following are the elements of a substance abuse consent form: The name of the patient providing consent; The per son or entity making the disclosur e; A description of the information to be disclosed; The name of the person (or entity) th at is authorized to receive the information; The purpose of the disclosure; The date the consent form is signed; The signature of the pat ient or guardi an or authorized representative; and A noti ce that the consent may be r evoked at any time except with respect to dis closur es already made in reliance on the consent form.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 2342 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.31. The more recent HIPAA regulations include those same core elements, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164. 508( c), but the following should be added: A notice regarding the prohibition, in certain circumstances, of conditioning treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on the provision of a consent form; A notice regarding the potential for the information to be re-disclosed; The r equirement that the authorization be written in plain language; and The requirement of providing the patient with a copy of th e sig ned authorization . 45 C .F.R. \u00a7 164. 508 c)(2). In terms of the poten tial for re-disclosure of substance ab use records, the best language is found in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.32, which generally prohibits re -disclosure in the absence of c onsent or a co urt order. The second type of permission is a court order. D epending on the purpose for you r reco rd request, different regulatory sections apply. Compare 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66 (criminal investigation or prosecution of a program); 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 65 (crim inal in a patient); and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64 (noncriminal matters). However, regardless of the applicable section, you wi ll need to establish, in general, the following: That you have a legally-recognized interest in the records; That there is no other way to obtain the information; and That th e public interest in disclos ure outweighs the confidentiality of the patient- physician relation ship. Your access will also be limited to the essential records, and access will only be al lowed to th ose with a need to k now. See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.13 (\"Any disclosure m ade under these regul ations must be l imited to that information which is necessary to carry out the purpose of the disclosure.\") You mus t also agree to mai ntain the records in stric t confidence, subject toprohibitions on re-disclosure. 42 C. F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2. 64, 2.65, 2.66. The t hird type of permission is an audit and evaluation by a feder al, state, or local agency responsible for over sight of Medicare or Medicaid. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.53. In many ways, that authority is the most powerful and the most problematic. It is powerful because it allows virtually immediate access to the highly confidential records. It is p roblematic because it might require you to create a firewall between the information available to the investigating age ncy and the prosecutor. A firewall might be necessary due to the subtleties in the audit and evaluation regulation, which provide s as follows: (c) Medicare or Medicaid audit and evaluation. (1) For purposes of Medicare or Medicaid audit or evaluation unde r this section, audit or evaluation includes a civil or administrative investigation of the program by any Feder al, State, or local agency responsible for oversight of the Medicare or Medicaid program and includes administrative enforcement, against the program by the agency, of any remedy authorized b y law to be i mposed as a result of the findings of the investigation. (d) Limitations on disclosure and us e. Exce pt as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, patient identifying information disclosed under this section may be d isclosed only back to the progr am from which it was obta ined and used on ly to carry out an au dit or evaluation purpose or to investigate or prosecute criminal or other activities, as authorized b y a court order entered under \u00a7 2.66 of these r egulations. Id. \u00a7 2.53(c) & (d). Before utilizing the audit and evaluation authority, o ne easily o verlooked requirement is that the person conduc ting the audit and evaluation must agree in writing to maintain24 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009patient confidentiality, destroy all patient identifying information upo n completion of the audit or evaluation, and otherwise comply w ith the regulatory limitations on disclosure. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.53 (a) & (b)(1). Obviou sly, the best course would be to p rovide that written assu rance before embarking on an audit an d evaluation so there is no doubt about the government's purpose and authority. The audit and evaluation regul ation raises several important considerations. At the outset, it is limited to investigations that are civil or administrative. Notably, criminal investigations are not included. Moreover, th e regulatory authority \"in cludes administrative enforcement, against the program by the agency, of any remedy authorized by law to be imposed as a result of the findings of the investigation.\" 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.53 (c)(1). It is unclear, how ever, whether that also includes a United S tates Attorney's office (USAO) that uses civil enfor cement based on information obta ined fr om an adm inistrative investigation . No court has ruled on the matter. Thus, even assuming the Depar tment of Justice (Depar tment) is an orga nization responsible for over sight of Medicare and Medicaid that has authority for a civil audit and evaluation investi gation, it is uncertain whether that also allow s for c ivil enforcement absent a co urt order. Given t hose uncertainties, it is recom mended that you allow the administrative ag ency (most likely the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Services (HHS)) to perform any audit and evaluation wi thout the disclosure of patient identifying information to the Depar tment or USAO. Then, if the agency uncover s information that should be referred for criminal or civil enfor cement, the agency coul d obta in (out of an abundance of caution) authorization by means of patient consent (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.31) or a court order (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.64, 2.65, 2.66). Even if you obtain access to patient identifying information by meeting one or more of the requirements for compulsion and pe rmission, there is one category of records that is su bject to yet anot her level of prot ection: so-called confidential communications made by a p atient toa progr am staff member in the course of diagnosis, treatment, or referral. 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 63. In order to win access t o tho se record s, you must demonstrate that: Disclosur e is necessary to prot ect against an existing threat to life or serious bodily injury; Disclosure is necessary in connection with investigation or prosecution of an extremely serious crime, such as homicide, rape, kidnaping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon , or child abuse and negl ect; or Disclosur e is in conn ection with litigation or an administrative proceeding in whi ch the patient offers testimony pertaining to the content of the con fidential com munications. 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 63. The list of extremely serious crimes is illustrative, not exclusive, and has been refin ed by the courts. United States v. Hughes, 95 F.Supp. 2d 49, 58-59 (D. Mass. 2000) (on the narrow facts of the case, \u00a7 2. 63 extremely serious crim e requirem ent did not include possession of a firearm by a d rug user); In Re Augus t 1993 Regul ar Grand J (Hospital Subpoe na), 854 F.Supp. 1380, 1385 ( S.D. Ind. 1994) (government declined to assert dou btful argument that fraudulent billing is an extremely serious crime under \u00a7 2.63). IV. What are the strategic considerati ons? Before you embark on a drug case or health care fraud investigation that involves confi dential substance abuse records, you should stop and think about several stra tegic considerations. First, you should consi der whether your investigation will be com promised by a record request that triggers notice to the affected patients. If your investigation is civil, the regulations req uire immediate notice to affected patients. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64. If your investigation is crim inal, h owever, the regulations allow for an ex parte order to avoid compromising the investigation. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66 (b). In a criminal case, the Fir st Circuit has uphe ld a district court's decision to allow for 180 days delayed notification to pat ients, even though the confidentiality regul ations provide for noti RY 2009 UNITED STATE ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 25\"upon of any court order authorizin g disclos ure. Shinderman, 515 F.3d at 11-13. Second, extreme care is re quired if patients are likely to be p rosecuted. The entire purpose of the regulations is to protect patient confidentiality so as not to det er substance abu se patients from seeking treatment. Accordingly, if y ou need court- ordered access to records in order to prosecute patients, the regulations require the following: The c ase mus t involve an extremely serious crime; The records must be reasonably likely to provide information of \"substantial value\"; The other ways of obta ining the information woul d no t be effective; and The potential injury to the patient and patient- physician relationship is outweighed by the public interest in disclos ure. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65(d). Since the \u00a7 2 .65 defi nition of an ex tremely serious crime is the same as that for \u00a7 2.63, referen ced above, it pays to check th e case law under both sections. Compare United States v. Corona, 849 F.2d 562 (11th Cir. 1988) (under \u00a7 2.65, purchase of f irearms by a su bstance ab use addict w as \"extrem ely serio us\") with United States v. Hughes, 95 F. Supp. 2d 49, 58-59 (D. Mass. 2000) (unde r \u00a7 2. 63, false statement by a drug user in possession of a firearm and while purchasing a firearm was not \"extremely serious\"). Third, befor e you attempt an u ndercover investigation in a substance abuse treatment facility, you must obtain a court order. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.67 . For court authorization of an u ndercover operation, you need to demonstrate that: There is re ason to believe an employee is engaged in criminal activity; Other ways of obtaining the evidence would not be effective; and The publ ic interest in disclosure outweighs risk of harm to the patient and/or the patient- physician relation ship. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.67(c). You will als o be required to provide notice of the unde rcover operation to the clinic's program director unless your application asserts a belief that the program director is involved in the criminal activities to be investigated or that the program director will disclose the existence of the unde rcover operation. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.67(b). Finally, if a court authorizes you to seize a large n umber of confidential substance ab use records, you should consider the interplay with other ongoing i nvestigations in your office. For example, after seizing the records, you may be surprised to learn that several patients are either witnesses or defe ndants in other cases prosecuted by your office. In that situ ation, your obligation to maintain the con fidentiality of the substance ab use records might con flict with your Brady and Giglio disclosur e obl igations in those other cases. At that point, the only solution is patien t con sent or a court order. In such ci rcum stances , your office should also consider the use of a tain t team to monitor any overlap between the patient records you seized and the witnesses and defendants in other cases prosecuted by your office who are subject to Brady and Giglio disclos ure requirements. V. Case study The f ollowing example is based on a Maine case in which the USAO successfully pros ecuted the following parallel proceeding: Criminal charges against a doctor for forging controlled substance prescriptions, falsifying records, and engaging in health care fraud; and Civil claims against the doctor's met hadone clinic for improperly allo wing certain patients to \"take home\" methadon e (which occasionally resulted in diversion and over dose deat h), failing to maintain proper DEA records of met hadone suppl y and distribution, and Medicaid billing frau d. Each step illustrates the applicable rules from 42 C.F.R. Part II.26 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009A. Step 1: The investigation The investigation began in response to an unusual sp ike in overdose deaths in southern Maine. Typically, th e cause of death was a multi- drug overdose but a common thread wa s the presence of methadone, the source of which, in some instances , coul d be t raced to a local methadone clinic. In response to the publ ic health crisis, the HHS, Office of In spector G eneral (OIG), commenced an administrative investigation. Compliance w ith 42 C.F.R. Part II was required because the clinic's confidential records unque stionably involved drug abuse treatment. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2. 11. To g ain immediate access to the records, OIG com menced an aud it and evaluation and provi ded con temporaneou s written ass urances that it woul d mai ntain patient confidentiality and comply with the limitations on redisclosure. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.53 (a) & (b). To avoi d any risk under the subtle audit and evalu ation regulations, patient-identifying information was not provided to the USAO at this stage in the investigation. B. Step 2: The di scover y of crim inal violations As the administrative investigation proceeded, OIG received information from a patient that a doctor at the methadon e clinic had issued prescriptions for controlled substances by using another doctor's prescription pad and DEA registration. OIG's review of clinic records confi rmed the allegation. Accordingly, OIG had reason to believe the doctor had committed a crime in violation of 21 U .S.C. \u00a7 843. The USAO requested a court order that would authorize OIG to share with the criminal prosecutors the confidential fruits of the audit and evaluation. The request was made pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66, which al lowed for an ex p arte order so as not to compromise the ongoing investigation. The district court granted the request and authorized delayed no tification to the affected patients. Notably, ac cess was not requested for the civil side of the USAO. One reason wa s that theregulations authorizin g disclos ure fo r a noncriminal purpose do n ot include a provi sion for an ex parte order. 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 2. 64. Accord ingly, if the USAO had requested access for civil enfor cement, the court would have required ad vanced noti ce to the clinic, which woul d have compromised the ongoing investigation. Moreover , at this point in the case, access for civil enforcement was not necessary. Indeed, given the general nature of civil health care cases, it was entirely possi ble that affirmative civil enfor cement coul d have been accomplished using confidential patient-identification numbers, without access to patient-identifying information. If access had been n ecessary, the Civil Division could have requested its o wn court order or it could have asserted its authority to access the confidential records pursuant to the audit and evalu ation regulations. C. Step 3: The search war rant Upon review and further investigation, OIG and the criminal division of the USAO decided to apply for a search wa rrant to obtain the methadon e clinic's patient records and a mirror image of the clinic's computer. In suppo rt of the search wa rrant application, the USAO filed a motion that requested permission to seize confidential substance ab use m edical record s. Since criminal pros ecution was the purpose, an ex parte motion was filed pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66. Again, access was not requested for the civil side of the USAO. The district court granted the application for a search wa rrant and the supporting motion for access to the confidential records. After execution of the search wa rrant, the USAO p rovided notice, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66 (b), to all patien ts whose records were seized. D. Step 4: Ac cess for the c ivil li tigation The e xecution of the search wa rrant and the ongoing investigation revealed that the met hadone clinic was subject to civ il prosecution for:JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 27Improperly dispensing take-home met hadone to pat ients who dive rted the drugs, which sometimes resulted in death; Failing to m aintain proper D EA record keeping for met hadone dispensing and suppl ies; Overbilling Medicaid for unne cessary and substandard serv ices. At that point, it b ecame necessary fo r the civil side of the USAO to access the confidential patient-identifyin g information, at a m inimum, in order to provi de discover y in the ongoi ng para llel civil case against the methadone clinic. M oreover, after th e execution of th e search warrant, there was no fe ar of com promising an on going criminal investigation. Accordingly, as the parallel civ il case proceeded, the Civil Division of the USAO filed a mot ion, whi ch the court granted, requesting a Protective Order that allowed access to the confidential records by all parties in the ongoing civil case, subject to stric t confidentiality requirements and in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.64. E. St ep 5: Trial and c ivil settlement For the criminal trial against the doctor, the USAO obtained wr itten consent, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2. 31, for mos t of the patients who testified. The 1-week jury trial resulted in a 58- count conviction and a sentence of 6 months in prison and 6 months of home confinement. United States v. Shinderman, 474 F. Supp. 2d 180 (D. Me. 2007). A civil trial was not necessary because the methadone clinic settled the claims (by payment of $1 mi llion) soon after the government won a novel summary judgment motion that established liability for dozens of Title 21 i llegal drug distribution penalties based on the clinic's violation of Title 42 t ake-home met hadone regulations. United States v. CAP Quality Care, Inc., 486 F. Supp.2d 47 (D. Me. 2007).VI. Concl usion As is often the case in the feder al pros ecution of drug and he alth care cases, access to the unde rlying medi cal records can mak e the difference bet ween succes s and failure. Increasingly, access to that information wi ll be govern ed by the unique substance ab use confidentiality rules of 42 C.F.R. Part II. By following the su btle rules t hat protect those double secret records, the gove rnment can increase the likelihood of success, protect patient confi dentiality, and avoi d the types of chal lenges that might otherwise derail the prosecution.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091Assista nt U.S. Attorney Evan J.

Smith DeW aal Senior Counsel Criminal Divisi on Fraud Section This article serves as a reminder of the general rule that pers onal medical information disclosed to the Department of Justice (Department) in the course of h ealth oversight investi gations, litigation, or proceed ings can not be u sed again st an individual patient in an unrelated, non-health care ove rsight investigation, civil or criminal litigation, or adm inistrative proc eeding (derivative use). However, if a derivative use is necessary notwithstanding the general rule, one of two procedu res must be f ollowed to obta in perm ission for the desired no n-health oversight use. The choice of procedure to follow is dictated by the manner in whi ch the Department obtained the personal medi cal information: By health care fraud administrative subpo ena issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3486 (2003) (\u00a7 3486 subpoena) or means, such as: A voluntary disclosur e; A grand jury subpoena; An Inspect or Gener al subpoena; A civil subpoena; or During the execution of a search warrant. As a further prec autionary note and as discussed below, be aw are that the types of cases to which the general prohi bition against deri vative use applies may include a broader universe of matters than is apparent at first blush. The cases may reach certain types of Title 21 cases, forexam ple, involving the fraudulent dispensat ion or diversi on of con trolled pharmaceu ticals. The Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104- 191, 110 Stat. 1936 (HIPAA), enact ed robu st new health care antifraud statutes. These statutes included new administrative subpoena authority, which w as const rained by a gener al prohi bition on the gove rnment's derivative use of individual health information produced in response to the new \u00a7 3486 subpoenas, for any purpose unrelated to th e payment for or rec eipt of h ealth care or a fraudulent claim related to heal th care. Section 3486(e) req uires th at an application for a derivative use be made to an appropriate court, which is required to make a fi nding of go od cause before i t can authorize a d erivative use ot herwise prohibited. The forgoing restrictions apply only to prot ect the discrete universe of personal medi cal records produced to the government in compliance with a \u00a7 3486 subpoena. Presidential Executive O rder 13,181 was issued on December 20, 2000 (Exec. Order No. 13,181, 65 Fe d. Reg. 81,321 ( Dec. 26, 2000)). Executive Order 13,181 was issued to protect the bal ance of pers onal heal th information obtained by the government during a health oversight mat ter by mea ns other than a \u00a7 3486 subpoena, including gran d jury subpoenas, voluntary disclosur e, civil subpoenas ( in qui tam matters), Inspect or Gener al subpoenas, or pursuant to a search warrant. Executive Order 13,181 generally prohibits the use of this broader universe of non section 3486 subpoena health oversight personal health information against an individual, for a non-health care oversight derivative use. Analogous to the judicial p rocedure provided in \u00a7 3486(e), 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 29which permission for an ot herwise prohi bited derivative use can be sought from the Deputy Attorney Gener al (DAG) (or the Gener al Counsel of the Depar tment of Defense, if the prot ected health information involves membe rs of the Armed Services).

Introduct ion Health care fraud against the Medicare and Medicaid programs causes billions of dollars in losses each year. Criminal and civil enforcement results in significant recove ries through criminal restitution, forfeitures, and civil settlements and judgments. In many cases, however, the perpetrators move the money as quickly as it is deposited. This article focuses on the fraud injunction statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 (2002), which provides for the freezing of assets before it is too late. One of the mos t effective uses of the fraud injunction statute has been to freeze bank accounts in cases involving sham health care companies. T hese companies b ill Medicare millions of doll ars in just a few months for services or d rugs that are not medically necessary or not provided at all. Typical cases have involved billings for durable medical equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs, mattresses, brac es, oxy gen concen trators, and diabetic supplies. Another typical schem e involves billing millions for Human Immunodeficiency Virus infusion treatments. More recently, \u00a7 1345 has a lso been used to freeze bank accounts in cases involving fraud against health mai ntenance organizations (HMOs) fu nded by Medicare . A case filed under \u00a7 1345 is a unique type of civil proceeding. It begins with a civil complaint but requires evidence of a crime listed in \u00a7 1345. While this article focuses on health care fraud, the fraud injunction statute extends to other frauds such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. If a criminal indictment is filed, discovery in the \u00a7 1345 case chan ges from the civil rules of procedure to th e criminal ru les. In some cases the gove rnment may seek damages unde r the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729-3731 (the FC A), as well as injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345. In such cases, co urts w ill gen erally grant a m otion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary in junction based on an adequate showing of a crim e list ed in \u00a7 1345. However, a violation of the FC A does not provi de a basi s for injunctive relief unde r 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1345. United States v. Sriram, 147 F. Supp. 2d 914, 946 (N.D. Ill. 2001). There also is no provi sion under \u00a7 1345 to freeze the treble dam ages provi ded for under th e FCA. Id. at 947. Still, th e Fourth Circuit has held that a court's general equitable power and Feder al Rule of Civil Procedu re 64 authorize injunctive relief to serve the publ ic interest and maintain the status quo whe re both damages and equitable relief are so ught. See United States ex rel. Rahman v. Oncology Assocs., 198 F. 3d 489, 496-501 (4th Cir. 1999). This article provides an overview of \u00a7 1345 proceedings. First, the article identifies some practical issues with respect to para llel proceedings. Next, the article discusses the requirements for filing a \u00a7 1345 c ase and obtaining a TRO and a preliminary injunction. The article then addresses motions, discovery, trials, and judgments. The article also outlines the steps for o btaining relief in cases where defendants disappear. The article concludes that the continued use of the fraud injunction statute to freeze assets is critical to the fight against health care fraud. II. Parallel procee dings Parallel proce edings refer to other legal procee dings that involve the same facts. For example, a criminal investigation may be underway when a ci vil Assistant United S tates Attorney (AUSA) is asked t o seek a TRO under34 UNITED S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN AUSAs need to coor dinate with each ot her, and they also need to be sure the coordination is proper and not subject to claims of abuse. The first practical issue is ri sk of fli ght. If a parallel criminal investigation is not sufficiently advanced for an arrest to be made simultaneously with the freezing of assets, the flight risk of the defendant should be considered before filing the \u00a7 1345 case. A TRO may be requested ex parte but the court will order that noti ce be given quickly after the assets are frozen. The civil and criminal AUSAs sho uld also coordinate with asset forfeiture AUSAs. In some cases, assets can b e seized or restrained through provisions in forfeiture statutes instead of using the fraud injunction statute. However, in such cases, the filing of a civil forfeiture case or an indictment with a criminal forfeiture allegation must soo n follow in accordance with statu tory time frames. Another consideration is th e appropriate sharing of evidence. Some of the evidence gathered in a criminal investigation may be considered grand jury m aterial. In appropriate cases, an or der may be ob tained under Feder al Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) for certain evidence to b e used for th e \u00a7 1345 proceeding. Each type of proceeding must be conducted in good faith and must be u sed for its proper purpose. The processes of one type of proceeding may not be improperly used for purposes of the parallel proceeding. In some cases, defendants have claim ed that th e civil proceedings were inappropriately used to gather evidence for the criminal investigation. In such cases, courts scrutinize the conduc t of the government. See United States v. Stringer, 535 F.3d 929 (9th Cir. 2008) (rev ersin g dismissal of in dictm ent where defendants were advised of their Fifth Amendm ent rights and the Securities and Excha nge Commission (SEC) made no misrepresentations); United States v. Pos ada Carriles, 541 F. 3d 344, 356- 61 (5th Cir. 2008) (reversin g dismissal of in dictm ent where defendant had applied for naturalization and was advised of h is Fifth Amendment rights);United States v. Scrushy, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1138-40 (N.D. Ala. 2005) (suppressing statements made i n prior SEC deposition because of prosecutor's input regarding location and content of deposition). In some cases, the parties in a civil proceeding will seek a stay p ending the completion of a parallel crim inal proceeding. See, e.g., Ashworth v. Albers Med., Inc., 229 F.R.D. 527, 532 (S.D. W. Va. 2005) (gra nting pre-indictm ent stay); Baranski v. Fifteen Unk 195 F. Supp. 2d 862, 870-71 (W.D. Ky. 2002) (sam e). However, stays are n ot alw ays gra nted. See, e.g., Microfin., Inc. v. Premier Holidays Int'l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 79 (1st Cir. 2004); Horn v. District of Columbia, 210 F.R.D. 13, 16 (D.D.C. 2002). III. TRO appl iminary injunction he aring A.

Elements that must be established and relief tha t is available Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 (2002) states what must be es tablished to obta in relief and the relief available. \u00a7 1345. Injunctions against fraud (a)(1) If a person is - (A) violating or abou t to violate this chap ter or section 287, 371 (insofar as such vi olation involves a conspiracy to defraud the United States or any agency thereof), or 1001 of this title; (B) committing or about to commit a banking law violation (as defi ned in section 3322(d) of this title); or (C) com mitting or abou t to com mit a Feder al health care offense; the Attorney General may commence a civil action in any feder al court to enjoi n such violation. (2) If a person i s alienating or disposing of property, or intends to alienate or dispose of property, obta ined as a result of a banki ng law violation (as defined in section 3322(d) of this title) or a Feder al heal th care offense or property whi ch is traceable to such violation, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in any Federal court- (A) to enjoi n such al ienation or disposition of property; or (B) for a restraining order to - (I) prohi bit any pers on from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposi ng of any such property or property of equivalent value; and (ii) a ppoint a te mporary re ceiver to administer su ch restrain ing order. (3) A perm anen t or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted wi thout bond. (b) The Court shall proce ed as soon as practicable to the hear ing and determinationof such an action, and may at an y time before final determination, enter such a restraining order or prohibition, or take such other action, as is warranted to prevent a continuing and substantial injury to the United States or to any person or cl ass of person s for w hose protection the action is brought. A proceeding under this section is gover ned by the Fed eral Rules of Civil Procedu re, except that, if an indictment has been returned against the respondent, discovery is governed by the Feder al Rules of Criminal Procedu re. In summary, if the United S tates establishes an ongoing violation of a crime liste d in \u00a7 1345(a)(1), or that such a violation is about to be committed, the statute authorizes the court to issue an injunction to stop ongoing or fu ture violations. In either case, if the United S tates establishes that fraud proce eds have been dissipated or are likely to be dissipated, \u00a7 1345(a)(2 ) authorizes th e court to en ter a restraining order to stop the dissipation and prohibit the transfer or disposition of \"any such property or proper ty of equivalent value.\" Section 1345 further provides that th e court may appoint a receiver or grant other equitable relief. The court may \"ta ke such other action, as is warranted to preve nt a cont inuing and substantial injury to the United S tates or to any pers on or class of persons for whose protection the action is brought.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345(b). A fraud injunction sought by the United S tates is different than the typical mot ions for TROs and preliminary injunctions in civil cases between private par ties. The traditional test for the issuance of a tem porary re straining order does not apply where the gove rnment is seeking an i njunction pursuant to a federal statute that was enacted to protect the public interest and that authorizes injunctive relief. United States v. Sriram, 147 F. Supp. 2d 914, 935-37 (N.D. Ill. 2001); United States v. Medina, 718 F. Supp. 928, 930 (S.D. Fla. 1 989). Courts have held that the gove rnment is not required to make a traditional showing of irreparable harm whe n seeking a \u00a7 1345 injunction . See United States v. Hoffman, 560 STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009Supp. 2d 772, 776 (D. Minn. 2008) (threat of substantial injury m ay substitu te for irre parable harm); United States v. Williams, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1368, 1377 (M.D. Fla. 2 007) (irreparable harm may be presumed); United States v. Livdahl , 356 F. Supp. 2d 1289, 1290- 91 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (no irreparable harm showing required). The government also is not required to show the inadequacy of o ther rem edies at law . See Livdahl , 356 Supp. 2d at Fang , 937 F. Supp. 1186, 1199 (D. Md. 1996). Furthermore, courts generally presume that the balance of hardships tips in favor of the government. See Williams, 476 F. Supp. 2d at 2d a t 935- 37. Ther e is a split in the circuits over whe ther the government must tra ce proceeds of the fraud to the specific bank accounts or properties that the government seeks to restrain. The Eleventh Circuit has held that, as explicitly stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345, the district court may fre eze assets of \"eq uivalen t value \" to the frau d proceed s, without regard to w hether th e specific assets are trace able to th e frau d. United States v. D BB, Inc., 180 F.3d 1277, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 1999). However, in a case whe re the maj ority of the defendant's income was not from Medicare, the Sixth Circuit stated that the gove rnment was required to link the fraud to the assets it was seeking to restrain . See United States v. Brown, 988 F.2d 658, 664 (6th Cir. 1993). Still, some court s have ruled that once t he gove rnment has established a criminal violation, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the assets at issue are not the proceeds of the frau d. See Fang , 937 F. Supp. at 1198-99; United States v. F. Supp. 1165, 1183 (E.D.N.Y. 1991); see also U .S. v. Liner, 97 Fe d. Appx. 74, 75 (8th Cir. 2004) (scope of injunction affirmed where defendant refused to offer evidence as to the source of th e fro zen asse ts). C. Burden of proof There are also differences among the courts in the various federal judicial circuits w ith respect to the level of proof required to obtain the TRO and preliminary in junction under \u00a7 1345. Some courtshave used a probable ca use stan Livdahl , 356 F. 755 F. Supp. at 1177. Other court s have used a prepon derance of the evidence stan dard. See Brown, 988 F.2d at 663- 64; Hoffman, 560 F. Supp. 2d a 777; 476 F. Supp. t 1374 ; Sriram, 147 F. Supp. 2d at 9 38. Some courts appear to com bine standards of proof. See Fang , 937 F. Supp. at 1198 (reasonable probability); 1994) (prepon evidence t hat probab le cause e xists). Other courts decline to decide which is th e appropriate level of proof because t he gove rnment's evidence satisfies the higher civil standard of preponderance of th e evidence. See United States v. Legro, 2008 W L 2605104, *3 (5th Cir. July 2, 2008). D. Evidentiary considerations Hearsay is p ermissible in the affidavit to suppo rt the mot ion for the TRO and at the prelim inary i njunction hearing. Levi Strauss & Co. v. Sunrise Intern. Trading, Inc., 51 F. 3d 982, 985 ( 11th Cir. 1995) . Courts generally caution, however, that while hearsay is admissible, less weight may be given to hearsay than to testimony or other exhibits that mee t the requirements of the Feder al Rules of Evidence. In cases where the preliminary in junction is contested, the United States generally calls the defendants to the stand. The defendant must decide whether to invoke the Fifth Amendment to fully guard against possible use of the testimony in a cr iminal case t hat may follow. Becau se \u00a7 1345 is a civil proce eding, an advers e inference may be drawn from the invocation of the Fifth Amendment. Baxt er v. Palmigiano, 425 U .S. 308, 318-19 (1976). IV. Defense m otions to r elease assets In addition to co ntesting the prelim inary injunction or its scope, defe ndants may move f or the release of assets for specific purposes such as attorney's fees or living exp enses . Court rulings on such m otions vary. Factors that court s have considered include: JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 37The strengt h of the gove rnment's evidence of fraud and the extent of the losses caused by the fraud; Whether there is evidence that the defendant had some legitimate source of income; Whether court s in that circuit require evidence linking each asset to the fraud o r allow the \u00a7 1345 i njunction to include \"equivalent assets;\" The balance of h ardships; Whether the requests for attorney's fees or living expenses are reasonable and substantiated; and Whether the attorney's fees are for a civil case or a criminal case. In cases where it is shown that th e funds are procee ds of a crime, it is well settled that such funds cannot be used for a ttorney's fee s. See Caplin v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 626 (1989); United States v. Monsanto, 491 U .S. 600, 614 (1989). As explained by the Supreme Court: A robbery su spect, for example, has no Sixth Amendment right to use f unds he has stolen from a bank to retain an attorney to defend him if he is apprehended. The money, [al]though in his possession, is n ot rightfully his. . . . No lawyer, in any case, the right stolen property . . . . Caplin, 491 U.S. at 6 26 (quotation omitted). See also S.E.C. v. Quinn, 997 F.2d 287, 289 (7th Cir. 1993) (sw indler ca nnot use victim s' asse ts to hire counsel to help him retain the gleanings of crim e). Courts have denied requests for attorney's fees, recogni zing the har m that would be caused to th e victims if funds were relea sed. See S.E.C. v. Current Fin. Serv. 726, 733 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); see also U nited States Grasso, 500 F. Supp. 2d 511, 514 ( E.D. Pa. 2007) (addressing nder \u00a7 1345 only afte r restitu tion had been paid to victims). Courts will look at the facts of each cas e, though, and in appropriate cases may release somefunds for fe es or livin g expenses. See, e.g., United States v. Liner, 97 Fed. Appx. 74, 75 (8th Cir. 2004) (affirming scope of injunction no ting district court had allowed some funds for living expenses); United States v. Payment Processing Center, LLC , 439 F. Supp. 2d 435, 441 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (holding that some funds frozen u nder \u00a7 1345 may be released for attorney's fees if defendants subm it financial disclosures justifying the use of restrained assets); S.E.C. v. Duclaud Gonzalez de Castilla , 170 F. Supp. 2d 427, 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (releasing some funds for attorney's fees whe re \"inference upo n whi ch the freeze was granted may not be supported\"). V. Discover y If the \u00a7 1345 case is not stayed, discovery w ill proceed unde r the civil rules unless an indictment is filed. After that, discovery in the \u00a7 1345 proceeding will be governed by the criminal ru les. In civil discover y, defe ndants sometimes attempt to make a blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment; how ever, a civil litigant is required to claim the privilege with respect to each specific interrog atory or d eposition question. See Angl ada v. Sprague , 822 F.2d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir. 1987). This is required so that the court can properly evaluate th e claim of p rivilege. See id. The United S tates also may ask the court to make a permissible adverse inference if th e privilege is invoked with resp ect to specific questions. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1976); Sriram, F. Supp. at 732-33. Sometimes a defendant may have waived t he Fif th Amendment as to a subject matter. See, e.g., Nutramax Lab. v. Twin Lab. , 32 F. Supp. 2d 331, 336-37 (D. Md. 1999) (civil litigant who voluntarily tes tified by aff idavit waived Fifth Amendment privilege); United States v. Gwinn, 2003 WL 23357667 *6 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 15, 2003) (\"Where a w itness provides statem ents as to h is finances in papers submitted to the court, he i s deemed to have waived his Fifth Amendm ent privilege on the same subject matter.\") In some \u00a7 1345 proceedings, the defendants are corporations, which do not have Fifth38 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009Amendment rights. Brasw ell v. United Sates, 487 U.S. 99, 108- 09 (1988) . Moreover, corporations cannot use the Fifth Amendm ent right of the owners to avoid discovery. Id. at 115-18. Braswell was the sole shareholder of his corporation. The Supreme Court held that a corporate custodian must produ ce corporate records even i f \"his act of production will be p ersonal ly incriminating.\" Id. at 117. \"Any claim of Fifth Amendment privilege asserted by the agent would be t antamount to a claim of privilege by the corporation\u2014which of cours e poss esses no such privilege.\" Id. at 110. Thus, for discovery purposes, corporate defendants must desi gnate an individual to app ear at depositions and to resp ond to d iscovery. Id. at 116-18; Nutramax, 32 F. Supp. 2d a t 337- 38 (corporation must designate a person with knowledge for Rule30(b)(6) deposition and to answ er interrogatories). Corporate def endants may not avoid discovery by designating someone who will invoke the Fifth Amendment. If necessary, corporations must desi gnate a pers on who will not invoke t he Fif th Amendment as to the areas for which the ow ner invokes i t. Corporations must also provide the designated person wi th the information or records necessary to adequately respond for th e corporation . See Braswell, 487 U.S. at 116-18; Nutramax, 32 F. Supp. 2d a t 337- 38. VI. Sum mary judgment Sum mary judgment is granted whe re the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of mat erial fact and the moving part y is entitled to jud gment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U .S. 317, 322 ( 1986) . A summary judgment motion should be acco mpanied by declar ations, depositions, and exhibits that establish the elements of \u00a7 1345. In Medicare fraud cases this would include: Evidence of the claims submitted to Medicare, with redactions to protect privacy; Evidence t hat the claims were false or fraudulent; Evidence of payment; andEvidence of the dissipation of the fraud proceed s. In cases involving sham companies, the evidence of fraud may be u ndisputed. There may be bank records that show there were no purchases of m edical su pplies or d rugs. There may also be evidence t hat there was no re al medical office or m edical files. In som e cases, doctors may provi de decl arations or deposition testimony indicating that they did n ot treat or prescribe for the patients, even though the defendants subm itted claims to Medicare alleging those doct ors had done so. In cases where the def endants have invoked the Fif th Amendment, there may be n o evi dence to rebut a well-suppo rted summary judgment motion. There also may be n o dis pute in cases where the def endant has pl ed gu ilty to related crim inal ch arges. See United States v. Sriram, 2008 W L 516306 * 5 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 26, 2008) (granting partial summary judgment on FCA coun ts). Thus, a summary judgment motion may well resolve the case without a tr ial. VII. Trial Most \u00a7 1345 proceedings do not proceed to trial. If there is a trial, it will be a bench trial, and the parties may agree to rely on some of the evidence that was presented at the prelim inary injunction hearing. The burden of proof will be the civil burden of proof, a preponderance of the evidence. VIII. F inal judgments Under \u00a7 1345, the United States may seek to enjoin the defendants from committing a specific criminal viol ation. The United States m ay also seek other injunctive relief for the benefit of the victims of the fraud. For example, the United States may seek the disgorgement of the fraud proceeds. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. W ilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F. States v. Durham , 86 F.3d 70, 71 n.2 (5th Cir. 1996); United States ex rel. Zissler v. Univ. of Minn., 992 F. Supp. 1097, 1108- 14 (D. Minn. 1998) . In aJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 39Medicare fraud case, the bank accounts woul d be released to the United States for return to the Medicare Trust Fund. IX. Fugitives Sometimes the per petrators of the fraud flee. If they disappear after being served wi th the \u00a7 1345 c omplaint and TR O and fail to answer the complaint, the courts w ill gran t a m otion for a default judgment. However, sometimes the perpetrato rs flee before th ey can be served. There are certain steps that must be taken to obtain relief in cases where the def endant cannot be served. Defendants may be deemed served if the United S tates publishes a notice in accordance with the applicable state statute. This also provides noti ce of the TRO as required by Feder al Rule of Civil Procedu re 65(a)(1). The proc ess of servi ce by publication takes ab out 2 months. The f irst step is to file a mot ion to extend the TRO to allow sufficient time to serve by publ ication. The motion should be suppo rted by an af fidavit or testimony indicating the efforts that have been m ade t o locate individual defe ndants or the representatives of c orporate d efendants. There is authority for extending TROs beyond the two 10-day periods referenced in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2). See Uni ted States v. DBB, Inc., 180 F. 3d 1277, 1280 n.3 (11th Cir. 2d Cir. No. 05-21461- CV-MGC, D.E. 53 ( S.D. Fla. Oct. 20, 2005).The next step is to file a motion to permit service by publ ication. This mot ion mus t be suppo rted by an adequate affidavit detailing sufficient diligent steps to locat e the defen dants. The a ffidavit may include evidence that the defendants are evading service or have fled. The motion should also be accompanied by the proposed \"Notice of Action\" that will be published. After completion of the publication, if the def endants fail to file an answ er by the dat e set in the notice, the court will gran t a m otion for a default judgment. X. Concl usion In fast mov ing health care fraud schemes, the individuals controlling the fraud qui ckly drain the bank accoun ts after receiving pay ment and move on to the nex t sham com pany. When law enforcement is alerted in time, many \u00a7 1345 TROs resu lt in freez ing millions of Medicare dollars. The continued use of \u00a7 1345 to freeze assets is criti cal to recovering health care dollars that would otherw ise be lost to cri minals.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091Ana Maria Martinez has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney since 1990 a nd is currently in the Econom ic Crimes Section, focusi ng on cr iminal health care f raud cases. During previous years, Ms. M artin ez has worked on civil h ealth care fraud cases as well as a variety of criminal fraud cases. a40 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009Health Care Fraud Sentenci ng: Achieving Loss Calculations under the United S tates Sentenci ng Guidelines Kirk Ogrosky Deputy Chief Fraud Section Criminal Divisi on John S. Darde n Assistant C hief Fraud Section Criminal Divisi on I. Introduct ion After ag gressively prosecuting health care fraud for over 20 years, Depar tment of Justice (Departm ent) statistics estab lish that health care fraud, as evidenced by the number of investigations and cases, cont inues to increase. This increase strongly sugges ts that fraud cannot be eradicated and the country's limited health care dollars cann ot be r estored m erely through investigation, prosecution, imprisonment, and restitution orders. If it could, the number of those caught committing health care fraud woul d be decreasing. Ther efore, history has taught the valu able lesson that federal prosecu tors m ust endeavor to det er fraud in our heal th care system before i t occu rs. Social scientists teach that deterrence can be increased by focusing on the three primary f actors that impact a person 's decision process. Those three factors are: The per son's assessment of the likelihood of detection; The per son's understanding of the severity of puni shment if detected; and The tem poral relati onship between the reward of the conduct and the risk of punishment. Thus, although the government cannot prosecute its way out of fraud, feder al pros ecutors can t ake reasoned and calculated steps to ensure that the way cases are prosecuted helps to deter crime before i t occu rs. During the past 2 years, the Depar tment has attempted to focus resources on health care fraud to increase the ability to detect fraud through the analysis of real time claims data and to bri ng cases to ind ictment within days. A portion of these efforts are discussed below in addressing the operation of the Medicare Fraud St rike Force (the Strike Force). This article addresses a key element of this effort: u niformly ac hieving appropriate sentences i n health care f raud cases. According to statements from cooperating health care fraud defendants, many of the people caugh t com mitting heal th care fraud believe that their criminal exposur e is insignificant com pared to the pot ential monetary reward. The average term of incarceration between 1 995 and 2006 for those defendants who have served time for health care fraud is approximately 30 months. For some, a single day in prison i s enou gh deterrence. However, criminals stealing large sums from the health care system are comparing the pot ential health care fraud sentences against other criminal endeavor s. Burglary, robbery, and narc otics crimes all pose risks of longer puni shment and less mone tary rewards than health care fraud. Consequently, cr iminals are unwittingly encouraged to turn to health care fraud. As discussed below, the community needs to understand that health care fraud is not aJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 41victimless crime that will be punished lightly. Health care fraud should be p unished commensurate with other equally damaging crimes. This article will discuss how to ensure that defendants rece ive appropriate an d uniform sentences i n health care f raud cases. II. Increased criminal enforcement efforts In March 2007, the Fraud Se ction of the Criminal Division worked w ith the United S tates Attorney's Office (USAO) for th e Southern District of Florida to establish pha se one of the Strike Force . The Str ike Force was concei ved after a detailed review of Medicare claims data from around the nation. This claims data analysis established that Miami-Dade C ounty, Florida had the mos t severe concentration of health care fraud in the country. In the simplest terms, the concept behind the Str ike Force was to bri ng traditional law enforcement techniques to health care fraud criminal activity. The pre mise of the Str ike Force is that traditional whi te collar law enforcement techniques are too slow for effective deterrence in areas that have concentrations of health care fraud centered around nonexistent providers. Delay in prosecution costs the government more as targets continue to commit fraud dur ing lengthy investigation s. Strike Force results have been d ramatic. Since the inception of the Strike Force operations in 2007 f ederal prosecutors have indicted 187 defendants in 104 cases in both M iami and Los Angeles, the phase t wo site. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for m ore t han one-half billion dollars. The impact of the Str ike Force has been fe lt not only in the number of prosecutions and convictions. In Miami-Dade County alone, billing by durable medical equipment (DME) com panies dropped by over $1.7 billion dur ing the phase one operation in 2007. Thus , not only were fraudul ent billings to Medicare reduced b y the amounts that the Strike Force defendants woul d have billed but the deterrent impact was substantial. These results illustrate the success of focusi ng on t he three key factors of effective det errence.One of the key components of that deterrent effect was a significant increase in the lengt h of incarceration for convicted defendants. During phase one of the Str ike Force , the average sentence of incarceration was 43 months, which is approximately 1 year longer than the average Medicare frau d sentence nation wide. Further, community awareness of substantially longer sentences achieved in pha se one cases, including several in excess of 10 y ears, adds to the perception of punitive risk. As with most white collar cases, the key driver of a Medicare fraud sentence unde r the United S tates Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter Guidelines) is the am ount of \"intended loss\" under \u00a7 2B1.1. Feder al pros ecutors have not always ta ken consistent positions on how to calculate in tended loss in Medicare frau d cases. A review of sentencing decisions in Medicare fraud cases revea ls that pros ecutors gener ally have used one of three methodologies: The amount billed to Medicare; The amount allo wed under applicable Medicare fee schedules; or The amount actu ally paid by Medicare . These various positions often ap pear to be b ased on negotiated arrangements rather than the defendant's intent. Although the facts m ay va ry from case to case, the way to s eek an appropriate sentence is to base the loss calculation on wha t the individual defe ndant intended. The best evidence of the defendant's intent in mos t cases is wha t he knowingly and willfully inserted in the fal se claims submitted to Medicare. III. Defendant 's individual ized intent drives the appropri ate loss calculation As discussed in mor e detail below, the purpose of sentencing is to hold a defendant accountable for his crime. In fraud cases, that includes what the defendant intended to accomplish with his fraudulent sch eme. A defendant's actions are the best evidence of his intent. In a health care fraud case, the act of filing a claim requires that a person knowingly and42 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009willfully place an am ount into the electronic or paper claim form. In mos t cases, this act is the best evidence of the amount the person intends to take fro m the Medicare program. A. \"Int ended loss\" includes loss that is impossible or unlik ely Under \u00a7 2 B1.1, the appropriate am ount of loss \"is the greater of a ctual loss o r intended loss.\" UNITED STATES SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES MANUAL \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(A) (2006) (emphasis Guidelines defi ne \"intended loss\" as \"the pecuniary harm that was intended to the offense . . . and . . . includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur (e.g., as in a government sting operation, or an insurance fraud in whi ch the claim exceeded the insured val ue.).\" Id. at cm t. n.3(A)(ii) (emphasis added). As the Eleventh Circuit has stated: It is not required that an intended loss be realistic ally possible. Nothing in [the notes to what is now labeled as Section 2B 1.1] requires that the def endant be capab le of inflicting the loss he i ntends. We do n ot agree . . . that an intended loss cannot exceed the loss that a defendant in fact coul d have occasioned if his fraud had been successful. Thes e decisions are inconsistent with the concep t that the calculation can be b ased on the intended loss. United States v. Wai-Keung, 115 F. 3d 874, 877 (11th Cir. 1997) (cit ation s omitted); see a lso United States v. Serrano, 234 Fe d. Appx. 685, 687 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"W e hold that th e district court properly in terpreted \u00a7 2B1.1 and that the court did not clearly err when it approximated the intended loss as the amounts Appellant submitted to Medicare and Medi-Cal for reim bursem ent.\"); United States v. McLemore, 200 Fe d. Appx. 342, 344 ( 5th Cir. Miss. 2006) (unpubl ished) (allowing no setoff for the value of any Medicare or Medicaid services actually rendered or products provided and ho lding that the determination of the amount of loss for calculations under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) requires the use of the greater of actual loss o r intended loss).In a Medicare fraud case, \"actual loss\" will rarely if ever ex ceed \"intended loss.\" Actual loss is rep resented by the amount paid out by Medicare for the false claims. It is n ot uncommon in Medicare fraud cases for there to be numer ous claims for whi ch no mone y was paid out by Medicare, part icularly in schem es that involve \"blast billing\" or instances where Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services catch on to a scheme and deny or at least delay payment while they investigate. Thus , the question at sentencing will be what figure\u2014the amount billed to Medicare or the amount allowed under the fee schedules\u2014shou ld be u sed to det ermine \"intended loss.\" B. Intended loss is properly based on t he amount subm itted minus a co-payment deduction The mere fact that the Medicare fee schedules exist does not require that intended loss unde r the Guidelines be b ased on the amounts allowed under those schedules. The Guidelines specifically state that intended loss includes loss that would have b een impossible or u nlikely to occur. Thus, intended loss under the Guidelines is typically calculated by using the amount billed to M edicare minus the 20 percent co-p ayment deduction where it is established that a defendant unde rstood the co-payment collection requirement, even though such amount may include loss in excess of the amount allowed under fee sch edules. In 2003 the Fou rth Circuit directly addressed the issue of using the billed am ount as evidence of intended loss. United States v. Miller, 316 F. 3d 495 ( 4th Cir. 2003) . In Miller, a doctor was convi cted of mail fraud based on his submission of false and fraudul ent claims to Medicaid, Medicare, and the West Virginia Workers' Compensation program. Id. at 496. At sentencing, the district court calculated intended loss as the difference between what M iller b illed to M edicare (rather than wha t he actually received) and the amount to which he was legitimately entitled based upon the rendered serv ices. Id. at 497.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 43Miller appealed his sentence, arguing among other things, that \"the court erred in using the amount he billed to Medicare and M edicaid, rather than the payments those programs allow, in estimating the am ount of loss h e intended becau se he could not have any rea sonable expectation to be pai d . . . beyond what the progr am allows.\" Id. at 501 (internal quotation marks omitted). Miller argued, therefore, that intended loss should be limited to the allowed amount set forth in the program s' reimbursement fee sch edules. The Fou rth Circuit emphatically rejected that argument, holding that \"th e Guidelines permit court s to use i ntended loss in calculating a defendant's sentence, even if this exceeds the amount of loss actually possible, or likely to occur , as a result of the def endant's cond uct.\" Id. at 502. The Fourth Circuit's holding was based in part on the common sense asse ssment that \"[a ]s anyone who has received a bill well knows, the presumptive purpose of a bill is to notify the recipient of the amount to be p aid.\" Id. at 5 04. Other cou rts of appeals have ap proved the use of the billed am ount as intended loss with much less d iscussion than the Fourth Circuit. See, e.g., United States v. Mikos, 539 F.3d 706, 714 (7th Cir. 2008) the Medicare program for $1.8 m illion; that's the intended loss whether Medicare paid or not. . . .\" ); United States v. Cruz-Natal, 150 Fed. Appx. 961, 964 (11th Cir. 2005) (approving use of billed amount to calculate intended loss i n Medicare f raud case \"[ b]ecau se the intended loss is easily calculated an d greater than the actual loss\"); Serrano, 234 Fed. Appx. at 687. In the Miller case, the court concluded that the billed am ount served as prima facie evidence of the defendant's intended loss, unless the defendant offered contradictory ev idence regarding his subjective intent. 316 F.3d at 504. Therefore, prosecutors may use the amount billed as the starting point for assessing a criminal defendant's intent.C. The risks of usin g the allow ed am ount to measure intended loss In United States v. Singh, 390 F. 3d 168, 193- 94 (2d Cir. 2004), the Secon d Circuit found that the defendant's testimony regarding Medicare's reimbursement rules, including the fact that Medicare paid claims based on a fee schedule and not necessarily o n the amount billed on the claim form, const ituted suff icient evidence t o rebut an inference of intended loss. Thus , the Second Circuit held that the defen dant's intended loss should be based on the \"allowed amount\" or the amount as calculated under the applicable Medicare fee schedules where evidence established that the def endant intended to inflict such a loss. Although use of the allowed amount may be appropriate in certain instances, particularly in cases an d schemes that exist within an otherw ise legitimate enterprise, use of the allowed amount to measu re loss i n fraudulent enterprises r isks a sentencing determination that underrepresents criminal conduct. For instance, if a defendant only intended to take an amount allowed by the computer system and the Medicare progr am payment formulary, why woul d no t the defendant submit claims for that amount? If he h ad knowledge of the allowed amount could no t he have easily claim ed that am ount? Medicare requires that the defendant collect the 20 pe rcent co-payment from patients based on the amount billed to Medicare\u2014did the defendant collect any co-payments? If so, what is the evidence of such collection and wa s it based on the allowed amount or the billed amount? Further, did the defendant believe that the Medicare progr am never mistakenl y pays above the fee schedule? H ad M edicare pai d the claimed amount, would the def endant have kept the money or returned the funds to Medicare saying they did not \"intend\" to take that much? Thes e questions are particu larly difficult to an swer. A fter all , if a defendant really believed t hat Medicare was infallible, then he would never have s ubmitted fraudulent claims because Medicare would not have paid. 44 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009By submitting fraudulent claims to Medicare, the def endant shows he knew that the progr am had syste mic payment weaknesses that made it vulnerable to fraud. Under these circumstances, is it reasonable to bel ieve that the def endant did n ot intend to kee p everything that he m ight receive as payment from Medicare, including pay ments over and above the allowed amounts? Eve n if the defendant did no t necessarily expect to receive the full amount of h is bills from Medicare, he most certainly would have kept the money had it been paid. See U nited States v. Geevers , 226 F. 3d 186, 193 (3d Cir. 2000) (the \"[defendant] may not have expected to get it all, b ut he could be presumed to have wanted to\"). All this is not to say that, even with respect to fraudulent enterprises, the billed amount should be uncond itionally applied. It is easy to think of instances in which an amount other than that billed to Medicare could const itute the intended loss. The following hy pothetical situations are scenar ios where the claimed or billed am ount may not proper ly const itute the def endant's intended loss. A defe ndant submits claims information to a third-party billing com pany for prepar ation and transmission of the claims. In the cou rse of subm itting the bills to Medicare, the third- party co mpany tran sposes numbers and bills Medicare for an am ount higher than that reflected on the defendant's subm ission to the billing company. A defendant handwr ites Claims Forms 1500 for $500, and the Medicare proc essor misread s the claim s as $ 5000. A defendant has an arrangement with a third- party billing company whe reby the billing company gets a percentage of the amount paid by Medicare. The defendant instructs his third-party billing company to b ill Medicare $500 per claim for each piece of DME, but to get more money the company actually bills Medicare $700 per claim. In each of these examples, and there are certainly numerous others, evidence coul d be p resented that the defendant did no t intend a loss in the amountclaimed or s ubmitted to Medicare. In each of these examples, however, the focus of the inquiry is properly on the defendant's conduct an d intent. Conversely, the generalized use of the allowed amount as the intended loss based on the mere existence of a fee schedule poses a risk that a sentencing court may not properly focus on the specific intent of the defendant. This ris k is multiplied whe n defense counsel seeks to focus attention on t he victim's programmatic rules rather than the defendant's criminal intent. Case analysis revea ls that defe nse coun sel frequently focus on abstract, ex pert op inions about Medicare regu lations and internal operating proced ures. These have l imited re levance t o what an individual defendant intended, unless evidence is focused on the def endant's knowledge of such inner workings. Thus, unlike the billed amount, which at a minimum reflects a knowing and willful act of a defendant, the allowed amount does not, on its fac e, sh ow a crim inal's intent. In addition, Medicare dat a from financial intermediaries often has an al lowed am ount of zero for unpaid claims. In this instance, is it accurate for the court, in using a sum allowed amount for all fraudulent claims, to concl ude that the defendant intended to steal nothing from the Medicare p rogram when he submitted these claims, even though they went unpaid? Of course not. So again, the question becomes, for claims in which there is no allowed amount, wha t did the defendant intend? The best evidence of that intent is the amount the defendant billed to th e Medicare program. D. Loss in Medicar e fraud cases is not cappe d at \"actual loss\" Finally, some misguided defense c ounsel have argued that intended loss in Medicare fraud cases is capp ed by the Guidelines based on an application note following \u00a7 2 B1.1 which st ates as follows: Government Benefits.\u2014 In a case involving govern ment benefits (e.g., gran ts, loans, entitlement program payments), loss shall be considered to be not less than the value of the benef its obtained by unintended re cipients orJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 45diverted to un intended uses, as the case may be. For example, if the defendant was the intended re cipient of food stamps having a value of $100 but fraudulently received food stamps having a value of $150, loss is $50. UNITED STATES SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(F)(ii) (2006). As a preliminary m atter, this section relating to receipt of \"government benefits\" does not apply to Medicare f raud cases. However, some defen se coun sel assert that the not e's langu age precludes use of \"i ntended loss\" i n a M edicare f raud case and otherwise imposes a cap on loss. This argument is not suppo rted by the language of the application note or b y the case law . First, the language of the application note does not impose a cap on loss. Rather, the note states that in certain cases loss \"shall be consi dered to be not less than. . . .\" UNITED STATES SENT ENC ING GUIDELI NES \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(F)(iii) (2006) (emphasis added). Thus, to the extent that the application note applies to at all, it sets a floor on the amount of loss, not a ceiling. Further, Courts have rejected the argument that this note imposes a cap on loss. In Miller, the Fourth Circuit held that the amount billed to Medicare constitu tes prima facie evidence of intended loss in a Medicare fraud case. In rejecting the argument regarding the application note , which at the time was cont ained in a different section of the Guidelines, the Fourth Circuit wrote as f ollows: [N]ote 8(d) simply does not speak to the issue of whether court s can u se intended ra ther than actual loss, but instead deals with an issue altogether different from the one to whi ch [the defendant] would have it apply. Specifically, note 8(d) directs courts to include the diversion of gover nment progr am benefits as losses, even if the government funds ultimately go t o eligible recipients. In other words, in cases involving government program benefits, loss is the value of the benefits diverted, as opposed to mer ely the value of benefits that ultimately end up i n the hands of ineligible recipients, or are used f or an unauthorized purpose (em phasis om itted).. . . Thus, these cases make clear that note 8(d) is not meant to dis tinguish act ual loss of gover nment progr am benefits from intended loss of government program benefits, as [the defendant] would have us read it. R ather, note 8(d) clarifies that \"loss\" includes the amount of gover nment progr am benefits diverted fr om intended recipien ts or uses, even if those funds are ultimately distributed to eligible recipients, or used for an ot herwise authorized purpose. Miller, 316 F. 3d at 500- 01. The Guidelines thus do not cap i ntended loss in Medicare fraud cases at the amount actually paid. IV. Concl usion In conclusion, in order to better deter health care fraud o n the front end, law enforcement must: Do a better job of detecting health care fraud in the first instance; Seek consistent and appropriate punishment; and Move c ases from identification to pros ecution with greater sp eed. In seeking app ropriate sentences , the key question is wha t loss was intended by the individual defen dant. In many cases, the best evidence of a defendant's intent is what he p ut on the claim s actually submitted to th e Medicare program. As discussed above, where there is evidence t hat a defendant has know ledge of a fee schedule or capped paid rate, then that evidence shou ld be consi dered al ong with the claimed amount to determine wha t the defendant intended. This article has attempted to explain that there is not a uniform ly corr ect method for set ting the loss numbers. Rather, an individualized inquiry in to the intent of the defendant should be used to determine the intended loss amount. The amount actually submitted to Medicare by the defendant is the appropriate place for this inqui ry to begin.\u009846 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' 2009ABOUT THE AUTHOR s \u0091Kirk Og rosky is Deputy Chief within the Fraud Section, Criminal Division and supervises Me dicar e Fraud Strike F orce Operations.

With ever-risin g health care costs, both feder al and state gove rnments are eager to stave off what many perc eive as a Medicare progr am hemorrha ging from the act ivities of f raudsters. Beginning in the 1990s, as p art of a comprehensive effort to reform health care, the Clinton Administration essentially decl ared w ar on health care fraud and abuse in America and actively rec ruited law enforcement to assist in its efforts. See MALCOLM SPARROW , LICENSE TO STEAL: HOW FRAUD BLEEDS AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM , 56 (Westview Press 2000). Additionally, in 1996 and 1997 Congress enact ed two pie ces of fraud and abuse legislation that granted a wide range of additional powers to regulators. See id. at 57. This legislation included the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 a nd the Balanced Budget Act of 1 997 (BBA). Id. Until the passage of HIPAA, Medicare contractors (fiscal intermediaries (FIs) and carriers) perf ormed cl aims proces sing and related functions for CMS but were not obligated to perform at a speci fic level of effort to com bat potential fraud, waste, and abuse. This made CMS particularly vulnerable to these activities. With the passage of HIPAA, how ever, CMS was authorized to contract with new entities, separate and apar t from the FIs and carriers, whose raison d'etre woul d be identifying fraud, waste, and abuse. President Clinton referred to these new contractors as \"Medicare fraud hunters\" in White House press relea ses. See id. at 57-58 n. 2. Using this new legislative authority, CM S (then known as the Health Care Financi ng Administration (HCFA)) entered into cont racts with entities term ed Program Safeguard Contracto rs (P SCs), which operated as fraud fighters. PSCs use data analysis a nd other activities, oftentimes in coordination wi th law enforcement, to fight fraud, waste, and abuse. There are currently 10 PSCs that cond uct antifraud, waste, and abuse activities under M edicare Parts A and B. See Tabl e 1 at p. 48. See Brenda Thew, PSC s to ZPI Cs (Aug. 4, 2008) (unpubl ished Po werPoint presentation)(copy on file with author). See Tables 2 an d 3 on pages 48 a nd 49 r espectively, for PSC Part A and Part B jurisdictions. In the current contracting environment, PSCs manage 15 Benef it Integrity (BI) task orders that address fraud, waste, and abuse issues associated with: Medicare Part A (hospital in surance; i.e., inpatient care in ho spitals, inpatient stays in a skilled nursing faci lity, hospice care ser vices, home health services, and inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institu tion); See CTR. FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAI D SERV. MEDICARE & YOU 10 (2008) (CMS Publication No.10050-56 (Sept. 2007)); Medicare Part B (medical in surance; i.e., medically-necessary services, like doctors ' services, outpat ient care, and other medical services that Part A does not cove r, as well as some preventive services); See CTR.

Id. Last but not least, some PSC s also mana ge the Medicare- Medicaid D ata Match Program (also known as M edi-Medi). Id. As its name implies, Medi-Medi is a data mat ch program whe reby Medicare and Medicaid data is m atched to identify improper bil ling and utilization patterns. See Lourdes Grindal Miller, W hat is M edi-Medi? (unpublished presentation) (copy on file with author). Medi-Medi began as a pilot project in Californ ia in 2001. Id. By September 2005, nine additional states had joined: Florida Illinois New Jersey New York North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvani a Texa s and Washington. Id.; see a lso, Lourdes Grindal Miller, Frequently Asked Questions abou t the Medi-Medi Program (unpubl ished presentation) (copy on file with the author). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 formalized Medi-Medi and allocated ongoing funding for it s expansion. Id. Medi-Medi is currently being expanded to a national program. Id. On December 8, 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108- 173, 117 Stat. 2066 (2003) (codi fied in scattered sections of 26 U.S.C. and 42 U.S.C.) (also known as the MMA), which implemented landmark reforms to the existing Medicare Program, including the organization and structure of the Medicare contractors. Spe cifically, \u00a7 911 o f the MMA established Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) in place of fiscal interm ediaries an d carriers. See David Fo rman, CMS Legislative Summary of H.R. 1 Medicare Prescription D rug and M odernization Act of 2003 107 (copy on file with author). MACs collectively perform Medicare Part A and Part B work in lieu of having separate Part A and B contractors. CMS is in the proc ess of cond ucting a full and open compe tition to transition all fee-for-service (FFS) contracts to MACs, with the goal of completing the tran sitions no later t han the year 2 011. See Thew a t 9. The f irst Medicare contractors to unde rgo the MAC t ransformation were those processing DME claims. Consequently, there are now four DME MACs, each ap portioned its own jurisdiction nationally. Each D ME MAC is responsible for processing DME claims for the states that lie within their resp ective jurisdictions. See Table 5 at p. 51. See Thew a t 11. Thus , for example, the Region C DME MAC jurisdiction is re sponsible for proce ssing claims in the southern port ion of the country, reaching nort h to West Virginia, south to Florida, and we st to New M exico and Colorado.JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 51 In the interests of better cooper ation and greater efficiency, CMS subsequently decided to align the DME PSC jurisdictions with the DME MAC jurisdictions so that they would be consonant with one another. CMS ne xt determined to follow the same course with respect to the Part A and B MAC jurisdictions by alig ning the PSCs with them. Under this strategy, MACs woul d continue to process Part A and B claims, and the PSCs would continue to p erform benefit integrity work with resp ect to Part A and B providers. There are 15 different Part A and B MAC jurisdictions throughout the country. See Table 6 at p. 52. See Thew at 1 5. Tabl e 552 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009 Building on t his structure, CMS deci ded that benefit in tegrity ac tivities should be aligned with the Part A and B MAC jurisdictions. Recognizing the variation in claim s volume, beneficiary populations, and potential fraud risk, CMS reconfigured the PSC task orders with MAC jurisdictions and created seve n new zones for benef it integrity activities as illustrated in Table 5 supra. CMS is currently engaged i n full and open competitions to award contracts to new entities in each zone. The new entities are called Zo ne Program Integrity Contractors (ZPICs) and effectively rep lace the PSCs. Interview with Brenda Thew, Director, Division of Benefit Integrity Managem ent Operations, Centers for Medicare & M edicaid Se rvices, in Baltimore, Md. (Sept. 23, 2008) . As each ZPI C is awarded, the ZPIC will as sume the responsibilities that, until this time, have been conduc ted by the PSC in the respective states in the zone. Id.CMS' realignment of contractors into the seven zones reflects a recognition of the current Medicare fraud environment. Medicare fraud is more acute in certain areas of the country th an in others, and therefore requires more direct attention, involvement, and resources for Medicare fraud fighters than ot hers. For exam ple, Zone 7 is devoted to th e State o f Florid a, where Medicare fraud is particularly rampant. In cont rast, Zon e 2 w ill cove r a vast territory of largely western and southwestern states because Medicare fraud is fa r less prevalent there than in places like Florid a. Zones such as F lorid a are classified as \"hot zones. \" Other hot zones i nclude: California Illinois New York Texas Tabl e 6JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 53See Brenda Thew, PSCs to ZP ICs at 17. CMS has field or regional offices in all of the hot zone states, id., and ZPICs are encouraged (or in some cases, required) to mai ntain a phy sical presence in hot zones. Many times, law enfor cement also has offices w ithin close p roximity of C MS offices. The coalescence of three fraud fighters, CM S, ZPICs, an d law enforcement, should make for a powerful coa lition in the battle against M edicare fraud in the near future. CMS is in the process of awarding ZPIC contracts at the time of this writing. CMS ha s the ability to aw ard each Z PIC a separate task order for virtually every as pect of Medicare under its contractual canopy: Medicare Parts A, B, DM E, and Home Health; Medi-Medi, Medicare Part D (after 2009); Managed Care;Cost Report Audit; and Special ty task ord ers for Field Office project s. See id. at 18. Eac h ZPI C task order will be over seen by a CMS Gover nment Task Leader (GTL), following the current model under which GTLs monitor the PSCs. CMS' transition to the ZPI Cs is expected to be a boon for law enforcem ent on several fronts. First, law enforcement will be able to contact one ZPIC for all of its data needs. It will provi de \"one- stop shopping\" that will elim inate the need to visit several PSCs for data. \"One-stop shopping\" will save time and improve e fficiency for law enforcement efforts. See Table 7 below; see Brenda Thew, PSCs to ZP ICs (unpublished PowerPoint pres entation) (July 25, 2008) (copy on file with author) for an illustrati on of th e future ZPIC contracting environment. Tabl e 754 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009Second , by virtue of the new ZPIC structure, where all Medicare data will be under the same roof, law enforcement will be able to obtain data across all parts of Medicare to better determine whet her a provider or suppl ier is defrauding one or several part s of the Progr am. Consolidation of data, therefore, will provide law enforcement with a larger and more comprehen sive pi cture of potential Medicare fraud a provider or supplier may be perpetrating. This con solidation will also provide more and better quality opp ortunities for investigating, prosecuting, and convicting fraudsters. Third, CMS is in the process of establishing law enfor cement liaisons f rom the law enforcement community who will assist in the coor dination with ZPICs. This will enhance support to law enfor cement pers onnel as they mount successful investigations and eventual prosecutions. Law enforcement liaison s, who are familiar with the special needs in each area of the country, w ill be able to coordinate closely w ith ZPICs to increase overall efficiency. Similarly, CMS also expects to ben efit from the new ZPIC envi ronment. CMS expects to see an econom ic ben efit through the consolidation of contractors and the streamlining of resources to those areas that need it most. Similarly, CMS expects state par tners to save money by virtue of fewer req uired reso urces. See Brenda Thew, PSCs to ZPICs at 19. In sum, the new ZPICenvironment will achieve the best value for CMS by leveraging economies of scale and concentrating effo rts in high frau d areas. Id. CMS also expects increased efficiency for the ability to look at p roviders a cross all b enefit categories. Id. Moreover , CMS expects better coor dination among contracto rs an d their p artners. In closing, CMS' transition from PSCs to ZPICs will help law enforcement be more effective and efficien t in combating Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS and its ZPIC contractors expect to provide law enforcement with the critical suppo rt needed for battling fraud, waste, and abuse in the new mi llennium.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091Brian Petry, a licensed attorney, cu rrently serves as a CMS Health Insurance Specialist in the CMS Program Integrity Group, is the National CMS Law Enforcement Liaison, and is A ssociate GTL to tw o PSC Task O rders.aJANUA UNITED STATE Billed Ph ysical The rapy Services and Enforcement Actions Tar geting Fraudulent Physical Th erap y Practices David M.

See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26(b)(2). Physicians argue that it allow s for g reater co ntrol ov er patien t care because the doctor is directly involved in the physical therapy. Opponents have argued that the practice allows unskilled or uneducated individuals to ren der services on the physicians' behalf. While the provi der com munity cont inues to debate the merits of the \"incident to\" ru le, most will agree that the practice is susceptible to fraud and abuse. Physical therapy is one such practice area that has a demonstrated history of \"incident to\" abuse. This article will address the concerns relating to phy sician-billed phy sical therapy and hi ghlight areas that are susceptible to fraud and abuse. Further, the article will address a current joint agency enfor cement initiative focusi ng on physical therapy billing fraud in Mississippi.Lastly, it will discuss the positive impact recent enfor cement actions and regul atory chan ges have had on physician \"incident to\" billing. II. The troub led past In 1994 the Office of Inspect or Gener al for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) conducted its first inquiry into the nature and extent of phy sical therapy provided to Medicare beneficiaries in a physician 's office. See Office of Inspect or General, \"Physical Therap y in Physicians' Offices\" (OEI-02-90-00590) issued March 1994, available at http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oei/ reports/oei-02-90-00590.pdf. The initial study, conduc ted by OIG's Office of Eva luations and Inspect ions (OEI), revea led that near ly four out of five cases involving physical therapy provided in a phy sician's office did no t qualify as true physical therapy services. The study found that the services: 1) were not restorative; 2) lacke d complexity; 3) were not accompanied by a comprehensive plan of care; or 4) failed to include long-term goals. These shortcomings resulted in Medicare p aying $47 million in improper cl aims. Over the next several years, phy sical therapy reimbursement was studied and scrutinized by OIG. This work identified over $1 billion in improper M edicare payments. See generally Office of I nspector General studies: \"Physical and Occupational Therapy in Nursing Homes: Medical Necessity and Quality of Care\" (OEI-09-97-00121) issued August 1999, available at http://www.apta.org56 C ost of Improper Billings to Medicare\" ( OEI-09-97-00122) apy for Medicare Nursing Home Patients: Medical Necessity, Cost, and Docum entation Under the $1,500 C aps\" (OEI-09-99-00560) issued August available at http://www. oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-09-99-00563.pdf; and \"Physical, Occupational, and Spe ech Ther apy for Medicare Nursing Home Patients: Medical Necessity and Quality of Care Based on the Treatment Diagnosis\" (OEI-09-99- 00563) issued August 2001, available at http: //www.oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-09-99-005 63.pdf. Providers continued to demonstrate significant noncompliance an d quality of car e problems, including overutilization, using unskilled staff, and billing for m edically unnecessary serv ices. OIG initiated another study examining Medicare Part B payments for phy sical therapy services rendered or b illed by physician s. See Office of Inspector General, \"Physical Ther apy Billed by Physicians\" ( OEI-09-02-00200) issued May 2006, available at http://www.oig.hhs. gov/oei/reports/oei-09-02-00200. pdf. The objective was clear: identify aberrant billing patterns and mak e recommendations to protect the Medicare program. Id. OIG unde rtook the task by exam ining ph ysician billing pat terns for physical therapy services rendered over the first 6 mont hs of 2002. The results raised concerns about systemic abuse of the \"incident to\" rule relating to physician -billed physical therapy. See id. From January t hrough June 2002, Medicare paid all provi ders approximately $528 million for physical therap y services bil led to Part B carr iers.Id. Nearly 30 percent of th ese payments were made to p hysician s. Id. Based on a simple random sample, OIG determined that over 91 perc ent of the phy sician-billed phy sical therapy paid for by Medicare failed to meet progr am requirements for reim bursem ent. Id. The services failed to meet program requirements because they were not medically reasonable or necessary, n ot properly documented, or were unsupported by a c omplete plan of care. As a result, M edicare improperly paid in excess of $136 million. Id. The 6-month review soon turned into a 2-year com prehen sive study addressing phy sician-billed phy sical therapy services. Physician re imbursement by Medicare for physical therapy services in 2002 t otaled $353 million. Id. This included a total of 15 phy sicians who bil led in exces s of $1 million for physical therapy serv ices. Id. By the end o f 2004, physician reimbursement for phy sical therapy services jumped 44 pe rcent, totaling $509 mi llion. Id. The num ber of phy sicians billing mor e than $1 million annua lly jumped to 38, an increase of 250 percent. Id. More disconcerting was the fact that four perc ent of physicians w ho bil led for physical therapy services accoun ted for more than half of the $509 million paid to p hysician s. Id. This compelling dat a prom pted the begi nning of an enforcement initiative focusing on phy sician- billed physical therapy serv ices. III. Rules and r egulations governing reimbursement Physical therapy is the treatment of functional limitations to prevent or slow impairments and disabilities b rought about by injury or ill ness. See Office of Inspector General, \"Physical Ther apy Billed by Physicians\" ( OEI-09-02-00200) issued May 2006, available at http://www.oig.hhs.gov/ oei/reports/oei-09-02-00200. Phy sical therapy often includes phy sical mani pulation of the body and can, in certain circum stances , be acc ompanied by mac hine-assisted acts performed unde r the supervision of a qualified individual. The Medicare Part B program covers outpatien t physical therapy serv ices. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410. 26. Generally, phy therapyJANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 57services are per formed by qualified physical therapists or physical therapy assistants in independent or stan d-alone practices. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410. 60(a). A phy sical therapist mus t be licensed by the state in which he or she is practicing and have gr aduated fr om an acc redited physical therapy program. See 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 484. 4. Likewise, phy sical therapy assistants mus t be license d, if applicable, and a graduate of an accredited 2-year program or have achieved a satisfactory grade on an app roved p roficiency examination . Id. Medicare regulations also allow physicians to bill for phy sical therapy services that satisfy the \"incident to\" rule. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26(b). Medicare Part B pays for services incident to the service o f a p hysician if: The services are rendered to non institutional patients in a noninstitutional setting (not in a hospital). The services are an integral, though incidental, part of the service of a physician in the course of diagnosis or treatment of an injury or illness. The s ervices are commonly furnished wi thout charge or included in the bill of the phy sician. The services must be of a ty pe that are commonly furnished in the office or clinic of a phy sician. The services are furnished under the direct supervision of the phy sician (the supervising physician, however, need not be the same physician upo n whos e professional service the incident to serv ice is b ased). The s ervice mus t be furnished by the physician, practitioner with an incident to benefit, or auxiliary person. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26(b)(1)-(6). Plainly stated, the \"incident to\" rule allows for feder al progr am reimbursement for services performed by phy sicians, or individuals unde r the physician's direct supervision and employ, at the full physician re imbursement rate. Early exam ples of \"in cident to\" services included blood pressure measurements, x-rays, vaccination administration,and wound care. Over time, as phy sicians brought more complex and specialized services into the office setting, the number of \"incident to\" services increased to in clude physical therapy. A non physician provider or auxiliary pers on is anyone who is acting un der the direct supervision of a physician, regardless of whether the individual is an em ployee, leased em ployee, or independent contractor of the phy sician or of the same entity that employs or contracts with the physician . See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26(a). A uxiliary person nel are often nurses, nurse practitioners, technician s, physician assistan ts, chiropractors, massage therapists, or physical therapy aides. Prior to 2 005, Medicare did no t require auxiliary personnel to possess any specialized education, training, or license. The regulatory ch anges are discussed in length in section VII. While the \"incident to\" rule allows for physician reimbursement for services rendered by auxiliary personnel, it does not absolve the physician from involvement in the service. The regul ations require the physician to provi de direct supervision over the administration of the service. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26(a)(2). In the office setting, direct supervision mea ns \"the phy sician mus t be present in the office suite and immediately available to furnish as sistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure.\" 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.32(b)(3)(ii). The physician need n ot be in the room while the service is ren dered. Id. If the \"incident to\" service is performed in a beneficiary's home, Medicare will co ver it o nly if there is direct personal supervision. Simply put, the phy sician mus t be in the home with the auxiliary pers onnel if the services are billed \"incident to\" the physician 's professional serv ices. Medicare has outlined three basic cover age requirements gover ning reimbursement for physical therapy services, regardless of the provider type or service location. First, the patient must be unde r the care of a phy sician. Second, the services must be furnished under a plan of c are outlining the type, amount, frequency, and duration of th e therapy. See 42 C.F.R.58 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009\u00a7 410.61(c). The plan of care must include, at minimum, the pat ient's significant medical history, diagnosis, physician order, therap y goals, contraindication, and the patient's unde rstanding of the need for treatm ent and intended goals. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.24(c); see also Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Publ Chapter 15, \u00a7 220.2, available at http://www.cms.hhs. gov/Manuals/downloads/bp102c 15.pdf. Third, the plan of care mus t be certified or recertified by the physician periodically . See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.24(c). The physician recertific ation requirement is intended to ensure that the patient is re sponding to the trea tment and allow s the physician to m odify or discontinue the treatment if necessary. Medicare will pay for physical therapy services rendered \"i ncident to\" a physician's professional service when the standard coverage requirements are satisfied and the physician complies with all factors se t forth in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26. IV. The M Initiative OIG exam ined physician-billed therapy services and identified seve ral progr am vulnerabilities susceptible to fraud and abuse. In the wake of OIG studies, Medicare carriers and program safeguard contractors began examining physician billing pat terns relating to ph ysical therapy services. The results w ere consistent with OIG findings in that the data identified possible physician abuse of th e \"incident to\" rule. Cahaba Safeguard Administrators (CSA), the program safe guard contracto r for th e Medicare Part B progr am in Mississippi, identified a s eries of probl ematic billing trends that indicated exces sive ove rutilization of physician-billed physical therapy services. The data analysis focused on physicians w ho bil led speci fic time- based physical therapy reimbursement codes. For exam ple, CSA identified on e physician w ho bil led the Medicare progr am 18.5 hou rs of physical therapy for one beneficiary in 1 day. In fact, CSA identified numerous exam ples of beneficiaries who received b etween 8 and 12 hou rs of physical therapy on a daily basis. The da ta also identified several phy sicians who bil led in exces s of 150 hou rs of physical therapy services within a 24 ho ur time period. While the volume of services was staggering, the more disturbing fact was that the claims often identified the service location as the beneficiary's home. To pu t this into pers pective, for a physician to lawfully bill 150 hou rs of in-home physical therapy services in 1 day, th e physician would have to personally treat more than six beneficiaries an hour, all located in the same home, for 24 consecutive hours. If the in-home services were provi ded by auxiliary pers onnel unde r the direct supervision of a phy sician, the physician w ould be r equired to supervise 6 individuals, rendering treatment to 6 b enef iciaries an hour, all located in the sam e home, 24 times a day. The data analysis raised serious doubts about the physician's ability to provi de the amount of therapy that was submitted to th e Medicare programs for re imbursem ent. CSA referred the findings to the OIG Office of Investigations (OI). OI initiated investigations into several Mississippi phy sical therapy companies based on billing patterns evidencing the hal lmarks of over utilization and/or the lack of physician sup ervision. The investigations resulted in 13 cases targeting physical therapy clin ics, their respective ow ners and principals, and several affiliated physicians and employees suspect ed of fraudulently billing federal and state h ealth care programs. The financial loss to the government was estimated to exceed $60 mi llion for the fraudulently rendered physical therap y services. This was the beginning of the Mississippi Physical Therapy Initiative. As the investigations procee ded, the manner and scheme in which the clinics operated became evident. Several individuals would collectively open a cl inic to provi de in-home therapy services to Medicare and M edicaid beneficiaries. The owner s often had little or no medi cal background and included an investment banker, several housewives, a nurse practitioner, a durable medical eq uipment (DME) supplier, a receptionist, and a drug counselor. JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 59The clinic owners would subsequently recruit physicians to serve as medi cal directors. The medical directorship agreements often re quired little or no w ork on t he par t of the physician yet paid either an ann ual salary or per assessment fee. In some instances , the medical director received both types of compensation. The clinic would subsequently require the physician to reassign his or her rights to the clinic in order to receive payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. After reassignment, the clinics could bill fe deral and state health care programs directly using the doct or's provider number and collect payment on the doctor's behalf. The clinics would then hire individuals with little to no m edical backgr ound to serve as physical therapy \"te chnicians.\" These individuals included a gas station attendant, a shoe salesman, retail cashiers, a convi cted fe lon, a high school dropout, mas sage therapists, kinesiotherapists, and an exercise p hysiolo gist. The \"technician s\" were tasked wi th the responsibility of rendering unsupervised in-home physical therapy services to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. No individual em ployed by the clinics was lawfully authorized b y the Sta te of Mississippi to render physical therap y services. The physical therapy services were later billed unde r the phy sician's provider number as if the physician personal ly rendered the services or directly supervised a \"technician\" rendering the services. As a result, the physical therapy clinics submitted claims that were false and fraudulent in one or more of the following ways. First, the claims falsely purported that the physical therapy services were rendered by a physician or u nder th e direct su pervision of a physician . Second, the services were not medically reasonable or n ecessary. Third, the services were not rendered or did not accura tely reflect the amount of services provided. Fourth, the services were not initiated or re- initiated by a physician's direct and pers onal medical ev aluation every 3 0 days. Fifth, the claims falsely purported that the treatments were ordered by a physician as an integral part of his or her cont inuing active participation and managem ent in the course of treatm ent. In April 2007 the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi (USAO) reached ou t to the OIG Office of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) for assistance in prosecuting several of the phy sical therapy fraud cases. OCIG assistance was requested because the USAO did not have the resources to prosecute all of its health care fraud cases because of the unprecedented am ount of Feder al Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fraud occurring in the wake of Hurricane Katrin a. The goal of the initiative was to form a collaborative partnership between OIG and the USAO to quickly and efficiently indict and prosecute the offenders. The initiative prove d successful with OIG providing manpo wer and substantive knowledge to the formidable skill and experience of the USAO. Within 6 mont hs, the USAO and O IG brought 7 cases before the grand jury and o btained 7 i ndictments against 18 individuals. V. United States v. Canton Rehab. Serv., Inc., 3:07-CR-00096 ( S.D. Miss. Aug. 22, 2007) In January 2001 Fr ank Kay Wiley and Michael Anthony Yant, open ed an d established Canton Rehabilitation Services, Inc. (CRS) in Canton, Mississippi. Wiley and Yant opened CRS for the purpose of subm itting false and fraudul ent claims to the Medicare and Medicaid progr ams for physical therapy services. Wiley imported the scheme to defr aud from Texas wh ere he w as previously an owner and operator o f a rehab ilitation facility. The clinic in Texas was shut down after a federal investigation revealed it had fraudul ently billed for phy sical therapy services. Wiley and Yant incorporated the clinic through straw pers ons, but cont rolled the day -to- day opera tions. The business model of CRS was distinctive in that it was the only clinic in the60 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009investigation that rendered ser vices in a traditional brick and mor tar facility. Rather than provide in- home physical therapy services, CRS would transp ort beneficiaries to and from their hom es for treatment via a company van. This presented a unique investigative challenge because the gover nment need ed to establish that no p hysician was pres ent in the clinic during the rendering of the physical therapy serv ices. CRS's ability to bill fe deral and state programs was contingent on securing a physician's provider number. Yant, using his relationship with area physicians made through his DME company, recruited two doct ors to serve as medical directors. Wiley recruited the third medical director. The medical directorship agreements required the physicians t o work bet ween 6 to 8 hours a week and pa id them $125 pe r patient assessment. The agreements required the physicians to consult with company adm inistrators, supervise activities with other physicians and profes sionals, submit reports, admit an d discharge patients, and supervise all medical care rendered by a specialist. In actuality, the phy sicians performed little or no wor k. The medical directorship agreements were a sham used to ob tain the physicians' provide r numbers. The physicians' only job was to sign progress notes on a weekly or biweekly basis. The physicians' per assessment fee was based on the num ber of patient charts reviewed by the physicians. The physicians' signature gave the appearance t hat they supervised the administration of the physical therapy when they had not. Once the physician s' provider numbers w ere acqu ired, CRS sought to recruit hou rly employees to serve as \"techn icians\" wh o were responsible for rendering the phy sical therapy services to the beneficiaries. N one of the employees were licensed as a phy sical therapist or phy sical therapy assistant. The employees were not trained or educated in the art or discipline of physical therapy by an authorized or accredited entity and none were authorized to render phy sical therapy services unde r the governing regulations promulgated by the State o f Mississi ppi. The business model was implemented to abuse the \"incident to\" rule. All claims for services rendered by CRS employees were submitted under one of the three medical directors' provi der numbers. Each cl aim submitted by CRS falsely purported that the phy sical therapy services were rendered by a phy sician or unde r the direct supervision of a physician. At no time did any CRS phy sician render phy sical therapy services to a beneficiary. Moreover , no p hysician supervised a CRS employee providing ph ysical therapy services to a beneficiary. The investigation revea led that two of the three medical directors were not present at th e facility when the services were provi ded. One physician admitted that he never set foot in the facility. Another physician w as rarely pres ent and did n ot supervise any individual during the provi sion of the physical therapy serv ices. CRS submitted claims to Medicare i n excess of $3.7 mi llion and received payments totaling over $1.6 million. In the same time period, CRS submitted claims to Medicaid for payment in excess of $456,362.00 and received payments totaling $78, 402. 00. Wiley and Y ant owned and operated a s econd clinic, Mississippi Central Rehabilitation (MCR), using the same manne r and scheme as CRS. MCR submitted cl aims to feder al and state health care programs totaling $7,014,319.85 and received i n exces s of $2,851, 664. MCR was not charged, but the financial loss attributable to the clinic was applied at sentencing un der the relevant cond uct provi sion of the United States S entencing Guidelines. On August 22, 2007, Wiley an d Yant were charged in a 36-count indictment alleging conspiracy, health care f raud, false cl aims, false statements, wire fraud, mone y launde ring, and forfeiture. Wiley proffered and agreed to cooper ate in the pros ecution of Yant. Wiley entered a guil ty plea to one coun t of making a false statement involving a health care matter in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1035 (1996). Wiley was sentenced to 37 mont hs in prison. In April 2008 Yant also entered a guil ty plea to one coun t of making a false statement in a health care matter and was later sen tenced to 4 8 months in prison . JANUA RY 2009 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN ent: OIG wi th the recent enfor \"i \"Prevalence and Creden tials of Nonphysicians w ho Performed Medicare rvices\" (OEI-09-06- 00430). The investigations and anal ysis have allowed for the identification of part icular areas susceptible to fraud and abuse and laid the framework to identify this type of program fraud. The pr imary challenge in developing an \"incident to\" case is identifying the individual who personally rendered the service. Reimbursement claim forms do not require a physician to use a modifier to id entify whether th e services were rendered by the phy sician personally or by auxiliary personnel \"incident to\" the physician's professional serv ices. Another problem related to the development of \"incident to\" abuse cases relates to the volume of services billed by an individual phy sician. Medicare does not cap the amount of services that may be billed under a particular physician's provider number. A physician is permitted to bill for an unl imited amount of services as long as the supervision requirements are met . Moreover, the regulations do not limit the number of auxiliary personnel that a p hysician can simultaneously supervise. T herefore, th e ability to id entify problematic or fraudul ent billers cannot be accomplished by data analysis alone and requires additional scrutiny of the physician's business practices. Prosecutors and investigators mus t take a 2- pronged ap proached in devel oping cases involving potential \"in cident to\" abuse. First, determine whether the physician personally rendered the \"incident to\" service. If the physician person ally rendered the ser vice t he inquiry ends. If not, the second step requires one to determine whether the physician satisfied the appropriate supervision requirem ent over th e auxiliary personnel ren dering the service. For example, the data analysis from the Mississippi Physical Therapy Initiative demonstrated that the physicians were billing inexcess of 24 ho urs a day. As discussed supra, there were many occasions where the physician's provider number was used to bill in excess of 150 hours of physical therapy in 1 day. In this situation, the amount of tim e billed necessarily implied the physician w as billing for services rendered by auxiliary personnel because of the impossibility that on e provider can provide more than 24 ho urs of service in 1 da y. The lawful billing of 150 hou rs of physical therapy services would require a physician to supervise at a minimum 6 au xiliary pers onnel for 24 consec utive hours. The dat a gave credibility to the not ion that the phy sician wa s not adequately supervising the auxiliary pers onnel because of the high volume of services. The subsequent investigation confi rmed that the physicians w ere par t of an \"i ncident to\" scam. The answers to this relatively sim ple inqui ry will assist prosecutors in efficiently and effectively devel oping successful \"incident to\" abuse cases. VII. A new beginning Recent enforcement initiatives coupled with speci fic regul atory chan ges appear to have had an impact on reducing phy sician abuse of the \"incident to\" rule involving phy sical therapy servi ces. Medicare P art B billing data for the past 3 years show a sharp decl ine in physician \"incident to\" billing. In 2007 Medicare Part B paid approximately $1.56 billion for physical therapy services. Memorandum from the Regional Inspector General for Evalu ations and Inspections, Region IX to the Depar tment of Justice (October 1, 2008) (on file with author). Physicians r eceived $291 million or 19 perc ent of the total amount of allowable physical therapy services, a decrease of approximately 43 pe rcent from the 2004 physician -billed figure. Id. Over the same time period, the number of physicians that billed in exces s of $1 million for physical therapy services decreased from 38 t o 6, reflecting an 84 pe rcent reduction . Id. Additionally, the number of physicians that billed in excess of $100, 000 annually decreased from 992 to 2 79. Id. The decrease is lik ely, in part, attributable to increased enforcement of \"incident to\" abuse. The62 UNITED STATE S ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUA RY 2009decrease may also be attributable to a 2005 regul ation chan ge addressing the qualifications of auxiliary personnel. During the Mississippi Physical Therapy Initiative, it was evident that many of the auxiliary pers onnel posse ssed little or no skill, education, or training in the field of physical therapy. Prior to 20 05 Medicare expected the person providing the phy sical therapy to be highly knowledgeable, skilled, and trained in the field of phy sical therapy, but there was no expressed regulatory requirement. The regulations simply req uired the auxiliary personnel to: Be unde r the direct supervision of a phy sician; and Be an employee of the physician, practice group, or legal entity that employed the supervising physician . See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.26. In 2005 t he Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented a r egul ation mandating that auxiliary personnel possess the same education and skill level as a license d physical therapist. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.29(c)(2 ). The regul ation chan ge eliminated physician \"incident to\" billing for services rendered by uneducated an d unskilled em ployees. The new regul ation states, \"Medicare Part B pays for outpatients physical therapy services . . . if they are furnished . . . by, or in cident to the service o f, a physician, physician assi stant, clinical nurse special ist, or nurse practitioner w hen those professionals may perform phy sical therapy services under State law.\" 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.60(a)(3)(iii). The rule further provi des that when the therapy is provided \"incident to\" the services rendered by a physician, physician assistant, clinical nurse special ist, or nurse practitioner, the \"service and the person w ho furnishes the service must meet the standar ds and condi tions that appl y to phy sical therapy and physical therapists, except that a lic ense to practice physical therapy in the Sta te is not required.\" Id. (emphasis added). In all other circumstances, Medicare manda tes that the licensed phy sical therapist, or phy sical therapy assistan t actin g under th e direct su pervision of aphysical therapist, must be t he prof essional providing the service. VIII. Concl usion To da te the Mississippi Phy sical Ther apy Initiative has produced seven indictments, eight guilty pleas, and approximately $6 million in court -ordered re stitution. The sentences have ranged from 4 years in carceration to 5 years probation. The convictions also resulted in program exclusions being imposed by the OIG which prohibit the convicted individual from particip ating in federal health care programs for a period of y ears. Encouraged by the earl y success, OIG and the USAO continue to aggressively pursue t he culpable individuals and recove r federal program funds. OIG is continuing to review phy sical therapy bills subm itted by phy sical therapists and physicians un der Medicare's \"incident to\" provision. OIG hop es to create additional enforcement initiatives consistent with its o verall mission to protect the fed eral health program s. OIG data analysts are currently identifying problematic billing patterns by applying soph isticated an alytical methods to 10 0 perc ent of the Medicare claims data for targeted years. While \"incident to\" abuse in the pra ctice of physical therapy has cost the federal health care programs millions of dollars in improperly paid claims, OIG believes that the continuation of aggr essive enforcement initiatives similar to the Mississippi project will deter the spread and depth of \"incident to\" fraud.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHOR \u0091David M .
